Individual differences in anticipatory mu rhythm modulation are associated with executive function and processing speed	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Attention; Regulation; Executive function; Tactile; Alpha; Mu rhythm	NIH TOOLBOX COGNITION; ALPHA-BAND; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG ALPHA; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; TACTILE PERCEPTION; PRESTIMULUS ALPHA; SPATIAL ATTENTION; REACTION-TIME; OSCILLATIONS	There is increasing interest in the role of brain oscillations in the regulation and control of behavior. The current study examined the relations between specific cognitive abilities and changes in brain oscillatory activity during anticipation of, and in response to, tactile stimulation of the hand. The oscillation of interest was the sensorimotor mu rhythm (8-14 Hz) at central electrode sites. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during a task in which a visuospatial cue directed adults (N = 40) that a tactile stimulus would be delivered to their left or right hand. Lateralized changes in mu power following tactile stimulation were associated with reaction time to the tactile stimulus. The extent of a contralateral anticipatory reduction in mu power during the 500 ms before the tactile stimulus was associated with performance on a separate processing speed task. Changes in ipsilateral mu power during anticipation of the tactile stimulus were associated with performance on a flanker task and were marginally correlated with performance on a card sort task. Regression analyses further indicated the specificity of these relations to anticipatory changes in mu power. In summary, mu rhythm modulation during anticipation of tactile stimulation to a specific bodily location was related to a broad measure of processing speed and to variability in the broader ability to regulate behavior in a goal-directed manner. Implications are discussed in terms of the foundational role of anticipatory attention in cognitive processes and the utility of selective attention to the body as an index of attentional control more broadly.

Vortioxetine (VOR) is a multimodal antidepressant drug with pro-cognitive actions in animal models and MDD patients. The VOR-mediated blockade of 5-HT3-R in a sub-population of GABA interneurons enhances pyramidal neuron activity in rat medial prefrontal cortex, an effect possibly underlying its pro-cognitive action. Brain oscillations are involved in regulation of cognitive function. We therefore examined VOR effects on oscillatory activity in four brain areas of freely-moving rats (prelimbic cortex, PrL; nucleus accumbens, NAc; dorsal hippocampus, dHPC; paraventricular thalamic nucleus, PVA), in standard and in serotonin-depleted rats showing recognition memory deficits. 4-chloro-DL-phenylalanine (pCPA) markedly reduced low frequency oscillations (LFO, mainly 1 Hz oscillations) and enhanced theta oscillations in PrL and NAc. It also reduced gamma and high frequency oscillations (HFO) in PVA. Subchronic VOR and escitalopram (ESC) treatments had little effect on oscillatory activity in standard rats. However, VOR -but not ESC-prevented recognition memory deficits in 5-HT-depleted rats, and normalized LFO and theta powers in PrL and NAc. In parallel, VOR -but not ESC- prevented the deficit in PrL-dHPC gamma coherence, but not the decrease in gamma and HFO powers in PVA. Overall, this supports a prominent role of serotonergic neurotransmission on brain oscillatory activity, particularly in cortico-striatal pathways linked to short-term recognition memory. Further, VOR prevented pCPA-induced cognitive deficits by normalizing oscillatory activity at lower frequencies in the PrL-NAc pathway, also normalizing the PrL-dHPC coherence at gamma frequencies.

If epilepsy surgery is considered, stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) may reveal which of the lesions is seizure-generating, but frequently, some uncertainty remains. We aimed to investigate whether interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), which are a promising biomarker of epileptogenicity, are associated with the primary focus. Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 16 patients with dual pathology. They were grouped according to their seizure-generating lesion, as suggested by ictal SEEG. An automated detector was applied to identify interictal epileptic spikes, ripples (80-250 Hz), ripples co-occurring with spikes (IES-ripples) and fast ripples (250-500 Hz). We computed a ratio R to obtain an indicator of whether rates were higher in the hippocampal lesion (R close to 1), higher in the neocortical lesion (R close to -1), or more or less similar (R close to 0). Results:Spike and HFO rates were higher in the hippocampal than in the neocortical lesion (p< 0.001), particularly in seizure onset zone channels. Seizures originated exclusively in the hippocampus in 5 patients (group 1), in both lesions in 7 patients (group 2), and exclusively in the neocortex in 4 patients (group 3). We found a significant correlation between the patients' primary focus and the ratio R-fast ripples, i.e., the proportion of interictal fast ripples detected in this lesion (p< 0.05). No such correlation was observed for interictal epileptic spikes (p= 0.69), ripples (p= 0.60), and IES-ripples (p= 0.54). In retrospect, interictal fast ripples would have correctly "predicted" the primary focus in 69% of our patients (p< 0.01). Conclusions:We report a correlation between interictal fast ripple rate and the primary focus, which was not found for epileptic spikes. Fast ripple analysis could provide helpful information for generating a hypothesis on seizure-generating networks, especially in cases with few or no recorded seizures.

When mixed and single-task blocks are presented, two types of costs usually occur: theswitch cost, measured by contrasting performance on switch and repeat trials during the mixed-task blocks, and themixing cost, calculated as the performance difference between theall-repeat trials from the single-task blocks and the repeat trials from the mixed-task blocks. Both costs can be mitigated by informational cues that signal the upcoming task switch beforehand. Recent electroencephalographic studies have started unveiling the brain oscillatory activity underlying the switch cost during the preparatory cue-target interval, thus, targeting proactive control processes. Less attention has instead been paid to the mixing cost and, importantly, to the oscillatory dynamics involved in switch and mixing costs during reactive control. To fill this gap, here, we analyzed the time-frequency data obtained during a task-switching paradigm wherein the simultaneous presentation of task cues and targets increased the need for reactive control. Results showed that while alpha and beta bands were modulated by switch and mixing costs in a similar gradual fashion, with greater suppression going from switch to repeat andall-repeat trials, theta power was sensitive to the switch cost with increased power for switch than repeat trials. Together, our findings join previous studies underlining the importance of theta, alpha and beta oscillations in task-switching and extend them by depicting the oscillations involved in switch and mixing costs during reactive control processes.

However, there is growing evidence that the stream of sensory inputs is not elaborated in an analog way but is instead organized in discrete or quasi-discrete temporal processing windows. These discrete windows are suggested to depend on rhythmic neural activity in the alpha (and theta) frequency bands, which in turn reflect changes in neural activity within, and coupling between, cortical areas. In the present study, we investigated a possible causal link between oscillatory brain activity in the alpha range (8-12 Hz) and the temporal resolution of visual perception, which determines whether sequential stimuli are perceived as distinct entities or combined into a single representation. To this aim, we employed a two-flash fusion task while participants received focal transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in extra-striate visual regions including V5/MT of the right hemisphere. Our findings show that 10-Hz tACS, as opposed to a placebo (sham tACS), reduces the temporal resolution of perception, inducing participants to integrate the two stimuli into a unique percept more often. This pattern was observed only in the contralateral visual hemifield, providing further support for a specific effect of alpha tACS. The present findings corroborate the idea of a causal link between temporal windows of integration/segregation and oscillatory alpha activity in V5/MT and extra-striate visual regions. They also stimulate future research on possible ways to shape the temporal resolution of human vision in an individualized manner.

However, the significant interindividual differences among patients limit its application in clinical practice. Here, we applied and evaluated an individualized, frequency-based approach of HFO analysis in stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) data for localizing the epileptogenic zones (EZs). Methods Clinical and SEEG data of 19 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy were retrospectively analyzed. The individualized spectral power of all signals recorded by electrode array, i.e., the relative strength of HFO, was computed with a wavelet method for each patient. Subsequently, the clinical value of the relative strength of HFO for identifying the EZ was evaluated. Results Focal increase in the relative strength of HFO in SEEG recordings were identified in all 19 patients. HFOs identified inside the clinically identified seizure onset zone had more spectral power than those identified outside (p< 0.001), and HFOs in 250-500 Hz band (fast ripples) seemed to be more specific identifying the EZ than in those in 80-250 Hz band (ripples) (p< 0.01). The resection of brain regions generating HFOs resulted in a favorable seizure outcome in 17 patients (17/19; 89.5%), while in the cases of other patients with poor outcomes, the brain regions generating HFOs were not removed completely. Conclusion The relative strength of HFO, especially fast ripples, is a promising effective biomarker for identifying the EZ and can lead to a favorable seizure outcome if used to guide epilepsy surgery.

PV IN decreased activity is suggested to be the culprit for many of the EEG deficits measured in patients, which correlate with deficits in working memory (WM), cognitive flexibility and attention. In the last few decades, CIAS has been recognized as a heavy burden on the quality of life of patients with schizophrenia, but little progress has been made in finding new treatment options. An important limiting factor in this process is the lack of adequate preclinical models and an incomplete understanding of the circuits engaged in cognition. In this study, we back-translated an auditory stimulation protocol regularly used in human EEG studies into mice and combined it with optogenetics to investigate the role of prefrontal cortex PV INs in excitatory/inhibitory balance and cortical processing. We also assessed spatial WM and reversal learning (RL) during inhibition of prefrontal cortex PV INs. We found significant impairments in trial-to-trial reliability, increased basal network activity and increased oscillation power at 20-60 Hz, and a decreased signal-to- noise ratio, but no significant impairments in behavior. These changes reflect some but not all neurophysiological deficits seen in patients with schizophrenia, suggesting that other neuronal populations and possibly brain regions are involved as well. Our work supports and expands previous findings and highlights the versatility of an approach that combines innovative technologies with back-translated tools used in humans.

Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) is a popular breathing process and is established for its significant effects on the various aspects of physiology and psychology. Aims: This study aimed to observe neuronal oscillations in multifrequency bands and interhemispheric synchronization following SKY. Settings and Design: This study employed before- and after-study design. Subjects and Methods: Forty healthy volunteers (average age 25.45 +/- 5.75, 23 males and 17 females) participated in the study. Nineteen-channel EEG was recorded and analyzed for 5 min each: before and after SKY. Spectral power for delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency band was calculated using Multi-taper Fast Fourier Transform (Chronux toolbox). The Asymmetry Index was calculated by subtracting the natural log of powers of left (L) hemisphere from the right (R) to show interhemispheric synchronization. Statistical Analysis: Paired t-test was used for statistical analysis. Results: Spectral power increased significantly in all frequency bands bilaterally in frontal, central, parietal, temporal, and occipital regions of the brain after long SKY. Electrical activity shifted from lower to higher frequency range with a significant rise in the gamma and beta powers following SKY. Asymmetry Index values tended toward 0 following SKY. Conclusions: A single session of SKY generates global brain rhythm dominantly with high-frequency cerebral activation and initiates appropriate interhemispheric synchronization in brain rhythms as state effects. This suggests that SKY leads to better attention, memory, and emotional and autonomic control along with enhanced cognitive functions, which finally improves physical and mental well-being.

In the Task session, participants had to reach a visual target adapting cursor's movements to compensate an angular deviation introduced experimentally, while in the Control session no deviation was applied. The task was repeated at 13:00 hours, 17:00 hours and 23:00 hours before sleep, and at 08:00 hours after sleep. The deviation angle was set at 15 degrees (13:00 hours and 17:00 hours) and increased to 45 degrees (reinforcement) at 23:00 hours and 08:00 hours. Both for Task and Control nights, high-density electroencephalogram sleep recordings were carried out (23:30-19:30 hours). The Task night as compared with the Control night showed increases of: (a) slow-wave activity (absolute power) over the whole scalp; (b) slow-wave activity (relative power) in left centro-parietal areas; (c) sleep slow oscillations rate in sensorimotor and premotor areas; (d) amplitude of pre-down and up states in premotor regions, left sensorimotor and right parietal regions; (e) sigma crowning the up state in right parietal regions. After Task night, we found an improvement of task performance showing correlations with sleep slow oscillations rate in right premotor, sensorimotor and parietal regions. These findings suggest a key role of sleep slow oscillations in procedural memories consolidation. The diverse components of sleep slow oscillations selectively reflect the network activations related to the reinforced learning of a procedural visuomotor task. Indeed, areas specifically involved in the task stand out as those with a significant association between sleep slow oscillations rate and overnight improvement in task performance.

The aim of this study was to examine whether attentional processes contribute to altered pain inhibition processes in patients with IBS. Nine female patients with IBS and nine age-/sex-matched controls were included in a pain inhibition paradigm using counter-stimulation and distraction with electroencephalography. Patients with IBS showed no inhibition of pain-related brain activity by heterotopic noxious counter-stimulation (HNCS) or selective attention. In the control group, HNCS and selective attention decreased the N100, P260 and high-gamma oscillation power. In addition, pain-related high-gamma power in sensorimotor, anterior cingulate and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was decreased by HNCS and selective attention in the control group, but not in patients with IBS. These results indicate that the central pain inhibition deficit in IBS reflects interactions between several brain processes related to pain and attention.

Still, whether these GBOs reflect stimulus encoding in the primary somatosensory cortex (Si) or nocifensive behavior in the primary motor cortex (Ml) is debated. Here we recorded neural activity simultaneously from the brain surface as well as at different depths of the bilateral Sl/MI in freely-moving male rats receiving nociceptive stimulation. GBOs measured from superficial layers of Si contralateral to the stimulated paw not only had the largest magnitude, but also showed the strongest temporal and phase coupling with epidural GBOs. Also, spiking of superficial SI interneurons had the strongest phase coherence with epidural GBOs. These results provide the first direct demonstration that scalp GBOs, one of the most promising pain biomarkers, reflect neural activity strongly coupled with the fast spiking of interneurons in the superficial layers of the Si contralateral to the stimulated side.

Modulations of oscillations in the alpha to beta range in task-relevant sensory regions have been suggested to play an important role for both mechanisms. We adapted a Sternberg task variant to the auditory modality, with a strong or a weak distracting sound presented at a predictable time during the retention period. Using a time-generalized decoding approach, relatively decreased strength of memorized information was found prior to strong distractors, paralleled by decreased pre-distractor alpha/beta power in the left superior temporal gyrus (ISTG). Over the entire group, reduced beta power in ISTG was associated with relatively increased strength of memorized information. The extent of alpha power modulations within participants was negatively correlated with strength of memorized information. Overall, our results are compatible with a prioritization account, but point to nuanced differences between alpha and beta oscillations.

Beta and gamma oscillations index cognitive interference effects across a distributed motor network	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Multi-source interference task; Neural oscillations; Magnetoencephalography; Superadditivity	OLDER-ADULTS; CORTEX; DYNAMICS; MEG; DESYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENTS; FREQUENCY; TASK; FMRI; EEG	The planning and execution of an efficient motor plan is essential to everyday cognitive function, and relies on oscillatory neural responses in both the beta (14-30 Hz) and gamma (>30 Hz) bands. Such motor control requires not only the integration of salient information from the environment, but also the inhibition of irrelevant or distracting inputs that often manifest as forms of cognitive interference. While the effects of cognitive interference on motor neural dynamics has been an area of increasing interest recently, it remains unclear whether different subtypes of interference differentially impact these dynamics. We address this issue using magnetoencephalography and a novel adaptation of the Multi-Source Interference Task, wherein two common subtypes of cognitive interference are each presented in isolation, as well as simultaneously. We find evidence for the subtype-invariant indexing of cognitive interference across a widely distributed set of motor regions oscillating in the beta range, including the bilateral primary motor and posterior parietal cortices. Further, we find that superadditive effects of cognitive interference subtypes on behavior are paralleled by gamma oscillations in the contralateral premotor cortex, and determine that these gamma oscillations also predict the superadditive effects on behavior.

A method based on the combination of shortest path tree (CSPT) for constructing a functional brain network (denoted as CSP-FBN) is proposed, which is applied to fatigue driving state recognition and neural mechanism analysis of fatigue driving. Through the comparison experiment of the classification accuracy in the same frequency band (beta band), the results show that the functional brain network constructed by the combined shortest path tree in fatigue state recognition is better than the functional brain network constructed by other methods, the accuracy of 10-fold cross validation reaches 99.17%. At the same time, we also find that Fz, F4, Fc3, Fcz, Fc4, C3, Cz4, Cp3, Cpz, Cp4, P3, Pz and P4 are important electrodes for fatigue driving state recognition, which reflects that the right central region and the central parietal region of the brain have a close relationship with the occurrence of fatigue driving.

Beyond the eye: Cortical differences in primary visual processing in children with cerebral palsy	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; MEG; Vision; Visual perception; Contrast; Spatial gratings	TOP-DOWN INFLUENCES; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTUAL IMPAIRMENT; MOTOR; DAMAGE; MEG; DISORDERS; PRETERM; LINK; EEG	Despite the growing clinical recognition of visual impairments among people with cerebral palsy (CP), very few studies have evaluated the neurophysiology of the visual circuitry. To this end, the primary aim of this investigation was to use magnetoencephalography and beamforming methods to image the relative change in the alpha-beta and gamma occipital cortical oscillations induced by a spatial grating stimulus (e.g., visual contrast) that was viewed by a cohort of children with CP and typically-developing (TD) children. Our results showed that the high-contrast, visual gratings stimuli induced a decrease in alpha-beta (10 - 20 Hz) activity, and an increase in both low (40 - 56 Hz) and high (60 - 72 Hz) gamma oscillations in the occipital cortices. Compared with the TD children, the strength of the frequency specific cortical oscillations were significantly weaker in the children with CP, suggesting that they had deficient processing of the contrast stimulus. Although CP is largely perceived as a musculoskeletal centric disorder, our results fuel the growing impression that there may also be prominent visual processing deficiencies. These visual processing deficits likely impact the ability to perceive visual changes in the environment.

A smartphone based platform for portable non-invasive light and sound neuromodulation	42ND ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY: ENABLING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR GLOBAL HEALTHCARE EMBC'20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 20-24, 2020	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			STIMULATION; LOOP; BRAIN	This paper presents a smartphone based system for presenting light and sound stimulation to a user for neuromodulation experiments. A smartphone platform was used to increase ease of use and enable out-of-the-clinic experiments. The created Android app provides both visual and auditory entrainment stimuli, along with a real-time extraction of ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) phase using a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) for enabling closed loop simulations. Both visual and auditory stimulation is provided accurately in the 1-20 Hz range using the smartphone class hardware. Test results for both gave R squared fit values of 1 between a fitted line and the measured stimulation frequencies. Data from 13 subjects showed the PLL could track EEG phase in the slow oscillation band with an error of 14.83 +/- 38.47 degrees, with an average of 0.04 +/- 0.20 ms processing overhead per sample.

Thus, users were easily able to select one of them by shifting their eye focus. However, in that work, EEG signals were collected through electrodes placed on occipital and parietal regions (hair-covered areas), which demanded a long preparation time. Also, that work used low-frequency stimuli, which can produce visual fatigue and increase the risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures. In order to improve the practicality and visual comfort, this work proposes a BCI based on Depth-of-Field using the high-frequency SSVEP response measured from below-the-hairline areas (behind-the-ears). Methods: Two high-frequency stimuli (31 Hz and 32 Hz) were used in a Depth-of-Field setup to study the SSVEP response from behind-the-ears (TP9 and TP10). Multivariate Spectral F-test (MSFT) method was used to verify the elicited response. Afterwards, a BCI was proposed to command a mobile robot in a virtual reality environment. The commands were recognized through Temporally Local Multivariate Synchronization Index (TMSI) method. Results: The data analysis reveal that the focused stimuli elicit distinguishable SSVEP response when measured from hairless areas, in spite of the fact that the non-focused stimulus is also present in the field of view. Also, our BCI shows a satisfactory result, reaching average accuracy of 91.6% and Information Transfer Rate (ITR) of 5.3 bits/min. Conclusion: These findings contribute to the development of more safe and practical BCI. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Goal: We set to record and analyze for the first time concurrent electroencephalographic (EEG), electrocardiographic (ECG), and unrestrained whole-body plethysmographic (Pleth) signals from control (WT - wild type) and SUDEP-prone mice (KO- knockout Kcna1 animal model). Methods: Employing multivariate autoregressive models (MVAR) we measured all tri-organ effective directional interactions by the generalized partial directed coherence (GPDC) in the frequency domain over time (hours). Results: When compared to the control (WT) animals, the SUDEP-prone (KO) animals exhibited (p < 0.001) reduced afferent and efferent interactions between the heart and the brain over the full frequency spectrum (0-200Hz), enhanced efferent interactions from the brain to the lungs and from the heart to the lungs at high (>90 Hz) frequencies (especially during periods with seizure activity), and decreased feedback from the lungs to the brain at low (<40 Hz) frequencies. Conclusions: These results show that impairment in the afferent and efferent pathways in the holistic neuro-cardio-respiratory network could lead to SUDEP, and effective connectivity measures and their dynamics could serve as novel biomarkers of susceptibility to SUDEP and seizures respectively.

Here we provide evidence that beta band oscillatory activity in a resting state condition might play a crucial role in such detrimental effects. EEG activity at rest was measured from thirty young participants (mean age = 24.03) in two different body posture conditions. In one condition participants were required to keep their hands freely resting on the table. In the other condition, participants' hands were tied behind their back. Increased beta power was observed in the left inferior frontal gyrus during the tied hands condition compared to the free hands condition. A control experiment ruled out alternative explanations for observed change in beta power, including muscle tension. Our findings provide new insights on how body postural manipulations impact on perceptual tasks and brain activity.

To better understand the differential dysfunction of the visual network in DLB, we compared auditory and visual event-related potentials and oscillations in patients with DLB. Methods: Event-related potentials elicited by visual and auditory oddball tasks were recorded in 23 patients with DLB and 22 healthy controls and analyzed in time and time-frequency domain. Results: DLB patients had decreased theta band activity related to both early sensory and later cognitive processing in the visual, but not in the auditory task. Patients had lower delta and higher alpha and beta bands power related to later cognitive processing in both auditory and visual tasks. Conclusions: In DLB visual event-related oscillations are characterized by a decrease in theta and lack of inhibition in alpha bands. Significance: Decreased theta and a lack of inhibition in alpha band power might be an oscillatory underpinning of some classical DLB symptoms such as fluctuations in attention and high-level visual disturbances (C) 2020 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Stronger resting-state neural oscillations associated with wiser advising from the 2nd-but not the 3rd-person perspective	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SPECTRAL EEG PARAMETERS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SELF; WISDOM; CORTEX; INTELLIGENCE; METAANALYSIS; THICKNESS; NETWORKS; ALPHA	This is the first electroencephalogram study exploring the personal perspective effect on wise advising. Participants advised hypothetical protagonists in life dilemmas from both the 2nd- and 3rd-person perspective. Their advice for each dilemma was rated by two independent raters on wisdom criteria, i.e., metacognitive humility, metacognitive flexibility, and perspective taking. The results revealed that participants felt a significantly shorter psychological distance from protagonists when advising from the 2nd- (vs. the 3rd-) person perspective, p<0.001. However, there was no significant effect of perspective condition on the wisdom score. Nevertheless, stronger resting-state absolute EEG powers in the frontal lobe were associated with wiser advising from the 2nd-, but not the 3rd-person perspective. Moreover, Z tests revealed that the correlations between the resting-state absolute EEG powers and wisdom scores were significantly stronger during advising from the 2nd- than the 3rd-person perspective. These results suggest that advising from the 2nd-person perspective was more self-related, and mental activities during rest contributed to advising from the 2nd- but not the 3rd-person perspective.

J	Wilkins, KB; Yao, J				Wilkins, Kevin B.; Yao, Jun			Coordination of multiple joints increases bilateral connectivity with ipsilateral sensorimotor cortices	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Dynamic causal modeling (DCM); Connectivity; Motor planning; Complexity	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; EXTERNALLY TRIGGERED MOVEMENTS; MOTOR CORTEX ACTIVITY; INTERHEMISPHERIC INTERACTIONS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; FINGER MOVEMENTS; ACTIVATION; MONKEY; PREMOTOR; FMRI	Although most activities of daily life require simultaneous coordination of both proximal and distal joints, motor preparation during such movements has not been well studied. Previous results for motor preparation have focused on hand/finger movements. For simple hand/finger movements, results have found that such movements typically evoke activity primarily in the contralateral motor cortices. However, increasing the complexity of the finger movements, such as during a distal sequential finger-pressing task, leads to additional recruitment of ipsilateral resources. It has been suggested that this involvement of the ipsilateral hemisphere is critical for temporal coordination of distal joints. The goal of the current study was to examine whether increasing simultaneous coordination of multiple joints (both proximal and distal) leads to a similar increase in coupling with ipsilateral sensorimotor cortices during motor preparation compared to a simple distal movement such as hand opening. To test this possibility, 12 healthy individuals participated in a high-density EEG experiment in which they performed either hand opening or simultaneous hand opening while lifting at the shoulder on a robotic device. We quantified within- and cross-frequency cortical coupling across the sensorimotor cortex for the two tasks using dynamic causal modeling. Both hand opening and simultaneous hand opening while lifting at the shoulder elicited coupling from secondary motor areas to primary motor cortex within the contralateral hemisphere exclusively in the beta band, as well as from ipsilateral primary motor cortex. However, increasing the task complexity by combining hand opening while lifting at the shoulder also led to an increase in cross-frequency coupling within the ipsilateral hemisphere including theta, beta, and gamma frequencies, as well as a change in the coupling frequency of the interhemispheric coupling between the primary motor and premotor cortices. These findings demonstrate that increasing the demand of joint coordination between proximal and distal joints leads to increases in communication with the ipsilateral hemisphere as previously observed in distal sequential finger tasks.

Electrophysiological studies suggested that the effect of tACS applied at an alpha frequency (8-12 Hz) was state-dependent. The effects of tACS, that is, an increase in parieto-occipital electroencephalography (EEG) alpha power and magnetoencephalography (MEG) phase coherence, was only observed when the eyes were open (low alpha power) and not when the eyes were closed (high alpha power). This state-dependency of the effects of alpha tACS might extend to the aging brain characterized by general slowing and decrease in spectral power of the alpha rhythm. We additionally hypothesized that tACS will influence the motor cortex, which is involved in motor skill learning and consolidation. A group of young and old healthy adults performed a serial reaction time task (SRTT) with their right hand before and after the tACS stimulation. Each participant underwent three sessions of stimulation: sham, stimulation applied at the individual participant's alpha peak frequency or individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF; alpha-tACS) and stimulation with iAPF plus 2 Hz (alpha 2-tACS) to the left motor cortex for 10 min (1.5 mA). We measured the effect of stimulation on general motor skill (GMS) and sequence-specific skill (SS) consolidation. We found that alpha-tACS and alpha 2-tACS improved GMS and SS consolidation in the old group. In contrast, alpha-tACS minimally improved GMS consolidation but impaired SS consolidation in the young group. On the other hand, alpha 2-tACS was detrimental to the consolidation of both skills in the young group. Our results suggest that individuals with aberrant alpha rhythm such as the elderly could benefit more from tACS stimulation, whereas for young healthy individuals with intact alpha rhythm the stimulation could be detrimental.

Infant EEG theta modulation predicts childhood intelligence	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							VISUAL RECOGNITION MEMORY; FRONTAL THETA; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; DEFERRED IMITATION; YOUNG-CHILDREN; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ATTENTION; AUTISM; POWER; STABILITY	Intellectual functioning is a critical determinant of economic and personal productivity. Identifying early neural predictors of cognitive function in infancy will allow us to map the neurodevelopmental pathways that underpin individual differences in intellect. Here, in three different cohorts we investigate the association between a putative neurophysiological indicator of information encoding (change in frontal theta during a novel video) in infancy and later general cognitive outcome. In a discovery cohort of 12-month-old typically developing infants, we recorded EEG during presentation of dynamic movies of people and objects. Frontal theta power (3-6 Hz) significantly increased during the course of viewing each video. Critically, increase in frontal theta during viewing of a video was associated with a differential response to repetition of that specific video, confirming relation to learning. Further, individual differences in the magnitude of change in frontal theta power were related to concurrent nonverbal cognitive level. We then sought to extend this association in two independent samples enriched for variation in cognitive outcome due to the inclusion of infants at familial risk for autism. We observed similar patterns of theta EEG change at 12 months, and found a predictive relation to verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills measured at 2, 3 and 7 years of age. For the subset of high-risk infants later diagnosed with autism, infant theta EEG explained over 80% of the variance in nonverbal skills at age 3 years. We suggest that EEG theta change in infancy is an excellent candidate predictive biomarker that could yield substantial insight into the mechanisms that underlie individual differences in childhood intelligence, particularly in high risk populations.

Ironically, current methods for detecting these shifts of attention typically generate task interruptions and further disrupt performance. In the current study, we developed a method to (1) track shifts of attention away from the reading task by examining the similarity between 5 min of eyes-closed-restingstate EEG and 5 min reading EEG; and (2) investigate, during reading, how the ratio between attention shifts and focused reading relates to readers' comprehension. We performed a Spectral Similarity Analysis (SSA) that examined the spectral similarity between EEG recorded during reading and at rest on a moment-by-moment basis. We then recursively applied the algorithm to the resting-state data itself to obtain an individual baseline of the stability of brain activation recorded during rest. We defined any moment in which SSA during reading was greater than the mean correlation between resting-state EEG and itself as an "attentional shift." The results showed that the proportion of such attentional shifts recorded over the left visual region (O1) significantly predicted reading comprehension, with higher ratios (indicative of more frequent attentional shifts) relating to worse comprehension scores on the reading test. As a proof of its validity, the same measure collected during the reading comprehension test also predicted participants' Simon effect (incongruent - congruent response times) which is a common index of selective attention. This novel method allows researchers to detect attention shifts moments during reading without interrupting natural reading process.

Behavioral inhibition and EEG delta-beta correlation in early childhood: Comparing a between-subjects and within-subjects approach	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Behavioral inhibition; Delta-beta correlation; EEG; Temperament; Child	SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; CORTISOL-LEVELS; ASYMMETRY; CHILDREN; RISK; ASSOCIATIONS; MOTIVATION; EMOTION; PARENTS	Heightened delta-beta correlation has been conceptualized as reflecting exaggerated neural regulation and has been implicated in anxiety. Behavioral inhibition (BI) is a temperament characterized by wariness to novelty and is a robust predictor of anxiety, but delta-beta correlation has not been investigated in relation to childhood BI. We examined the relation between BI and between-subjects (i.e., across participants) and within-subjects (i.e., across data epochs) measures of baseline EEG delta-beta correlation in 118 children. Using a between-subjects measure, children scoring high on BI had higher delta-beta correlation relative to low BI children at frontal and central, and marginally higher in parietal, brain regions. Using a within-subjects measure, continuous BI scores were positively correlated with central and parietal delta-beta correlation. Delta-beta correlation may be a neural correlate of BI in childhood that displays differences in region specificity, correlation strength, and variability of correlation values when comparing between- and within-subjects measures.

SEEG has previously been utilized to study the theta band (3-8 Hz) in conflict processing and spatial navigation, but most studies of hippocampal activity during movement have used noninvasive measures such as fMRI. We analyzed modulation in the beta band (13-30 Hz), which is known to play a prominent role throughout the motor system including the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. We conducted the classic 'center-out' direct-reach experiment with nine patients undergoing surgical treatment for medically refractory epilepsy.Main results.In seven of the nine patients, power spectral analysis showed a statistically significant decrease in power within the beta band (13-30 Hz) during the response phase, compared to the fixation phase, of the center-out direct-reach task using the Wilcoxon signed-rank hypothesis test (p < 0.05).Significance.This finding is consistent with previous literature suggesting that the hippocampus may be involved in the execution of movement, and it is the first time that changes in beta-band power have been demonstrated in the hippocampus using human electrophysiology. Our findings suggest that beta-band modulation in the human hippocampus may play a role in the execution of voluntary movement.

However, the pathophysiology of tremor generation in ET remains unclear. Here, we used autoptic cerebral tissue from patients with ET, clinical data, and mouse models to report that synaptic pruning deficits of climbing fiber (CF)-to-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses, which are related to glutamate receptor delta 2 (GluR delta 2) protein insufficiency, cause excessive cerebellar oscillations and might be responsible for tremor. The CF-PC synaptic pruning deficits were correlated with the reduction in GluR delta 2 expression in the postmortem ET cerebellum. Mice with GluitS2 insufficiency and CF-PC synaptic pruning deficits develop ET-like tremor that can be suppressed with viral rescue of GluR delta 2 protein. Step-by-step optogenetic or pharmacological inhibition of neuronal firing, axonal activity, or synaptic vesicle release confirmed that the activity of the excessive CF-to-PC synapses is required for tremor generation. In vivo electrophysiology in mice showed that excessive cerebellar oscillatory activity is CF dependent and necessary for tremor and optogenetic-driven PC synchronization was sufficient to generate tremor in wild-type animals. Human validation by cerebellar electroencephalography confirmed that excessive cerebellar oscillations also exist in patients with ET. Our findings identify a pathophysiologic contribution to tremor at molecular (GluR delta 2), structural (CF-to-PC synapses), physiological (cerebellar oscillations), and behavioral levels (kinetic tremor) that might have clinical applications for treating ET.

Theta oscillations are observable in both humans and rodents during spatial navigations. However, the hippocampus (Hip) is well known as the generator of current rhythm, and other brain areas, such as prefrontal cortex (PFC), can be affected by theta rhythm, too. The PFC is a core structure for the execution of diverse higher cortical functions defined as cognition. This region is connected to the hippocampus through the hippocampal/prefrontal pathway; hereby, theta oscillations convey hippocampal inputs to the PFC and simultaneously synchronize the activity of these two regions during memory, learning and other cognitive tasks. Importantly, thalamic nucleus reunions (nRE) and basolateral amygdala are salient relay structures modulating the synchronization, firing rate, and phase-locking of the hippocampal/prefrontal oscillations. Herein, we summarized experimental studies, chiefly animal researches in which the theta rhythm of the Hip-PFC axis was investigated using either electrophysiological assessments in rodent or integrated diffusion-weighted imaging and electroencephalography in human cases under memory-based tasks. Moreover, we briefly reviewed alterations of theta rhythm in some CNS diseases with the main feature of cognitive disturbance. Interestingly, animal studies implied the interruption of theta synchronization in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. To disclose the precise role of theta rhythm fluctuations through the Hip-PFC axis in cognitive performances, further studies are needed.

The high-frequency oscillation (HFOs) mode in MEG signal can now be used to detect lesions. Due to the time-consuming and error-prone operation of HFOs detection, an automatic HFOs detector with high accuracy is very necessary in modern medicine. Therefore, an optimized capsule neural network was used, and a MEG (magnetoencephalograph) HFOs detector based on MEGNet was proposed to facilitate the clinical detection of HFOs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a neural network has been used to detect HFOs in MEG. After optimized configuration, the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the proposed detector reached 94%, 95%, 94%, and 94%, which were better than other classical machine learning models. In addition, we used the k-fold cross-validation scheme to test the performance consistency of the model. The distribution of various performance indicators shows that our model is robust.

The pathophysiology of IS remains incompletely understood, despite the heterogeneity of IS etiologies, more than 200 of which are known. In particular, the neurobiological basis of why multiple etiologies converge to a relatively similar clinical presentation has defied explanation. Treatment options for this form of epilepsy, which has been described as "catastrophic" because of the poor cognitive, developmental, and epileptic prognosis, are limited and not fully effective. Until the pathophysiology of IS is better clarified, novel treatments will not be forthcoming, and preclinical (animal) models are essential for advancing this knowledge. Here, we review preclinical IS models, update information regarding already existing models, describe some novel models, and discuss exciting new data that promises to advance understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying the specific EEG changes seen in IS-interictal hypsarrhythmia and ictal electrodecrement.

Using prefrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to enhance proactive cognitive control in schizophrenia	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							CONTEXT-PROCESSING DEFICITS; WORKING-MEMORY; GOAL MAINTENANCE; CORTEX; POWER; OSCILLATIONS; SPECIFICITY; DYSFUNCTION; INTENSITY; THETA	The goal of this study was to use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to examine the role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in neural oscillatory activity associated with proactive cognitive control in schizophrenia. To do so, we tested the impact of PFC-targeted tDCS on behavioral and electrophysiological markers of proactive cognitive control engagement in individuals with schizophrenia. Using a within-participants, double-blinded, sham-controlled crossover design, we recorded EEG while participants with schizophrenia completed a proactive cognitive control task (the Dot Pattern Expectancy (DPX) Task), after receiving 20 min of active prefrontal stimulation at 2 mA or sham stimulation. We hypothesized that active stimulation would enhance proactive cognitive control, leading to changes in behavioral performance on the DPX task and in activity in the gamma frequency band during key periods of the task designed to tax proactive cognitive control. The results showed significant changes in the pattern of error rates and increases in EEG gamma power as a function of tDCS condition (active or sham), that were indicative of enhanced proactive cognitive control. These findings, considered alongside our previous work in healthy adults, provides novel support for the role gamma oscillations in proactive cognitive control and they suggest that frontal tDCS may be a promising approach to enhance proactive cognitive control in schizophrenia.

Proactive cognitive control is a process that anticipates the requirement of cognitive control and crucially depends on the maturity of the PFC. Since this process is important to ADHD symptomatology, we here test the hypothesis that children with ADHD have proactive cognitive control impairments and that these impairments are reflected in the PFC oscillatory activity. We recorded EEG signals from 29 male children with ADHD and 25 typically developing (TD) male children while they performed a Go-Nogo task, where the likelihood of a Nogo stimulus increased while a sequence of consecutive Go stimuli elapsed. TD children showed proactive cognitive control by increasing their reaction time (RT) concerning the number of preceding Go stimuli, whereas children with ADHD did not. This adaptation was related to modulations in both P3a potential and lateral prefrontal theta oscillation for TD children. Children with ADHD as a group did not demonstrate either P3a or theta modulation. But, individual variation in theta activity was correlated with the ADHD symptomatology. The results depict a neurobiological mechanism of proactive cognitive control impairments in children with ADHD.

Their modulation with transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been shown to alter motor behavior and cortical excitability. The aim of the present study was to determine whether tACS applied bilaterally over sensorimotor cortex at 10 Hz and 20 Hz modulates interhemispheric interactions and corticospinal excitability. Thirty healthy volunteers participated in a randomized, cross-over, sham-controlled, double-blind protocol. Sham and active tACS (10 Hz, 20 Hz, 1 mA) were applied for 20 min over bilateral sensorimotor areas. The physiological effects of tACS on corticospinal excitability and interhemispheric inhibition were assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation. Physiological mirror movements were assessed to measure the overflow of motor activity to the contralateral M1 during voluntary muscle contraction. Bilateral 10 Hz tACS reduced corticospinal excitability. There was no significant effect of tACS on physiological mirror movements and interhemispheric inhibition. Ten Hz tACS was associated with response patterns consistent with corticospinal inhibition in 57% of participants. The present results indicate that application of tACS at the alpha frequency can induce aftereffects in sensorimotor cortex of healthy individuals.

To achieve such flexible and purposeful control of the human body, brain systems exhibit extensive modulation during the transition from resting state to motor execution and to maintain proper joint impedance. However, the neural structures contributing to such sensorimotor control under unconstrained and naturalistic conditions are not fully characterized. To elucidate which brain regions are implicated in generating and coordinating voluntary movements, we employed a physiologically inspired, two-stage method to decode relaxation and three patterns of contraction in unilateral finger muscles (i.e., extension, flexion, and co-contraction) from high-density scalp electroencephalograms (EEG). The decoder consisted of two parts employed in series. The first discriminated between relaxation and contraction. If the EEG data were discriminated as contraction, the second stage then discriminated among the three contraction patterns. Despite the difficulty in dissociating detailed contraction patterns of muscles within a limb from scalp EEG signals, the decoder performance was higher than chance-level by 2-fold in the four-class classification. Moreover, weighted features in the trained decoders revealed EEG features differentially contributing to decoding performance. During the first stage, consistent with previous reports, weighted features were localized around sensorimotor cortex (SM1) contralateral to the activated fingers, while those during the second stage were localized around ipsilateral SM1. The loci of these weighted features suggested that the coordination of unilateral finger muscles induced different signaling patterns in ipsilateral SM1 contributing to motor control. Weighted EEG features enabled a deeper understanding of human sensorimotor processing as well as of a more naturalistic control of brain-computer interfaces.

Anticipated synchronization in human EEG data: Unidirectional causality with negative phase lag	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							VISUAL-CORTEX; VOLUME CONDUCTION; GRANGER CAUSALITY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; COMMUNICATION; OSCILLATIONS; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION; DIVERSITY	Understanding the functional connectivity of the brain has become a major goal of neuroscience. In many situations the relative phase difference, together with coherence patterns, has been employed to infer the direction of the information flow. However, it has been recently shown in local field potential data from monkeys the existence of a synchronized regime in which unidirectionally coupled areas can present both positive and negative phase differences. During the counterintuitive regime, called anticipated synchronization (AS), the phase difference does not reflect the causality. Here we investigate coherence and causality at the alpha frequency band (f similar to 10 Hz) between pairs of electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes in humans during a GO/NO-GO task. We show that human EEG signals can exhibit anticipated synchronization, which is characterized by a unidirectional influence from an electrode A to an electrode B, but the electrode B leads the electrode A in time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first verification of AS in EEG signals and in the human brain. The usual delayed synchronization (DS) regime is also present between many pairs. DS is characterized by a unidirectional influence from an electrode A to an electrode B and a positive phase difference between A and B which indicates that the electrode A leads the electrode B in time. Moreover we show that EEG signals exhibit diversity in the phase relations: the pairs of electrodes can present in-phase, antiphase, or out-of-phase synchronization with a similar distribution of positive and negative phase differences.

These idiosyncratic biases and their neural underpinnings are often overlooked in studies on the physiology underlying perception. A potential candidate mechanism reflecting such idiosyncratic biases could be spontaneous alpha band activity, a prominent brain rhythm known to influence perceptual reports in general. Using a temporal order judgment task, we here tested the hypothesis that alpha power reflects the overcoming of an idiosyncratic bias. Importantly, to understand the interplay between idiosyncratic biases and contextual (temporary) biases induced by experimental manipulations, we quantified this relation before and after temporal recalibration. Using EEG recordings in human participants (male and female), we find that prestimulus frontal alpha power correlates with the tendency to respond relative to an own idiosyncratic bias, with stronger alpha leading to responses matching the bias. In contrast, alpha power does not predict response correctness. These results also hold after temporal recalibration and are specific to the alpha band, suggesting that alpha band activity reflects, directly or indirectly, processes that help to overcome an individual's momentary bias in perception. We propose that combined with established roles of parietal alpha in the encoding of sensory information frontal alpha reflects complementary mechanisms influencing perceptual decisions.

Twenty-four healthy younger adults had to perform choice reaction tasks differed in the number of S-R mappings and motor response requirements. Performance was lower in the high load than in the low load condition. Performance decline at higher WM loads was accompanied by an increase of EEG power in delta, theta, and beta frequency bands and by a reduction in alpha band. The effect on alpha was generalized across all the electrodes. Correlations between EEG and performance were observed in the high load condition but not in the low load condition. Theta activity negatively correlated with reaction time, whereas positive correlations between beta activity and reaction time were found. The two frequency bands negatively correlated with each other at all electrodes. The results suggest that changes in alpha and theta power may be considered as the most sensitive indicators of cognitive load. The alpha reduction may be related to activation of widespread cortical areas which were recruited for performance of complex WM tasks. The beta increase, especially in the beta-2 range, may partly be associated with activation of motor cortex due to difficulties in preparation and execution of motor responses. Theta increases may be considered as an index of facilitation of information processing in WM and improvements in higher-order executive control, which in turn facilitates motor processes.

EEG recordings can provide predictive biomarkers of the epileptogenic zone. Wide-band EEG makes it possible to record from infraslow (including DC shifts) to high frequency (HFO, over 300 Hz) oscillations for diagnostic purposes in patients with epilepsy. Although the presence of HFOs have been proposed to sign the epileptogenic zone, DC-like recordings demonstrate that DC shifts precede HFOs at seizure onset. This led to the proposal that "ictal active DC shifts" are causally related to seizure onset as opposed to "ictal passive DC shifts". Thus, active DC shifts may constitute predictive biomarkers of the epileptogenic zone in epilepsy. Since DC shift is commonly associated to a rise in extracellular potassium, potassium homeostasis regulated by Kir4.1 channels in astrocytes may play an key role at seizure onset. In addition, we hypothesize that, during the interictal period, the co-occurrence of slow events and interictal HF0s, so-called "Red slow", may also delineate an epileptogenic zone, even if a seizure would not be actually recorded.

Multitaper-based method for automatic k-complex detection in human sleep EEG	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; K-complex; Multitaper spectrogram; Sleep study; Spectral analysis	WAVE; METABOLISM; SPINDLES	In this paper, we propose a novel method for automatic k-complex (KC) detection in human sleep EEG, named MT-KCD. KCs are slow oscillations in the EEG signal characterized by a well-delineated, negative, sharp waves immediately followed by a positive component standing out from the background, with high-amplitude and total duration >= 0.5 s. Among the important aspects of the KC are its homeostatic and reactive functions in the brain, functioning as a sleep protection mechanism, and its practical use as a marker of N2 sleep stage during sleep studies. Given the importance of the KC, and the effort required from human experts to analyze EEG recordings visually, some recent research works have proposed automatic methods for KC detection. In comparison with existing methods, a key feature and novelty of MT-KCD is the use of multitaper spectral analysis to pre-process the EEG signal and automatically extract candidate KCs from it (characterized as 0-4 Hz power concentrations standing out from the background). After extraction, candidates are accepted/rejected depending on time domain characteristics (peak-to-peak amplitude >= 75 mu V, duration <= 2 s). The method overall time complexity is O(N logN). Regarding effectiveness, we have evaluated MT-KCD by using a public KC database (DREAMS) consisting of ten polysomnographic recordings of healthy patients (6 female and 4 male subjects with age range 20-47 years) partially annotated by two experts. Results have shown that MT-KCD improves detection metrics, especially F1 and F2 scores (harmonic averages of recall and precision), when compared to existing methods. Besides, improving F1 and F2 scores, MT-KCD also contributes to the automatic analysis of sleep EEG multitaper spectrograms, a technique recently proposed by researchers in the area of sleep studies as a complement to the traditional hypnogram (sleep stages diagram).

JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY & NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							RATING-SCALE; OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; TASK; SYNCHRONIZATION; CONNECTIVITY; DYSFUNCTION; COGNITION; FAILURE; MANIA	Background The synchronized activity of distributed neural assemblies - reflected in the electroencephalogram (EEG) - underpins mental function. In schizophrenia, modulation deficits of EEG spectral content during a P300 task have been replicated. The effects of treatment, chronicity and specificity in these deficits and their possible relationship with anatomic connectivity remain to be explored. Methods We assessed spectral entropy modulation of the EEG during a P300 task in 79 patients with schizophrenia (of those, 31 were in their first episode), 29 patients with bipolar disorder and 48 healthy controls. Spectral entropy values summarize EEG characteristics by quantifying the irregularity of spectral content. In a subsample, we calculated the network architecture of structural connectivity using diffusion tensor imaging and graph-theory parameters. Results We found significant spectral entropy modulation deficits with task performance in patients with chronic or first-episode schizophrenia and in patients with bipolar disorder, without significant pre-stimulus spectral entropy differences. The deficits were unrelated to treatment doses, and spectral entropy modulation did not differ between patients taking or not taking antipsychotics, lithium, benzodiazepines or antidepressants. Structural connectivity values were unrelated to spectral entropy modulation. In patients with schizophrenia, spectral entropy modulation was inversely related to negative symptoms and directly related to verbal memory. Limitations All patients were taking medication. Patients with bipolar disorder were euthymic and chronic. The cross-sectional nature of this study prevented a more thorough analysis of state versus trait criteria for spectral entropy changes. Conclusion Spectral entropy modulation with task performance is decreased in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This deficit was not an effect of psychopharmacological treatment or structural connectivity and might reflect a deficit in the synchronization of the neural assemblies that underlie cognitive activity.

Distinguishing vigilance decrement and low task demands from mind-wandering: A machine learning analysis of EEG	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillation; independent component analysis; mind-wandering; support vector machine; task demands; vigilance	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; SPONTANEOUS THOUGHT; BRAIN; NETWORK; CORTEX; CLASSIFICATION; CONNECTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; RELEVANT; HUMANS	Mind-wandering is a ubiquitous mental phenomenon that is defined as self-generated thought irrelevant to the ongoing task. Mind-wandering tends to occur when people are in a low-vigilance state or when they are performing a very easy task. In the current study, we investigated whether mind-wandering is completely dependent on vigilance and current task demands, or whether it is an independent phenomenon. To this end, we trained support vector machine (SVM) classifiers on EEG data in conditions of low and high vigilance, as well as under conditions of low and high task demands, and subsequently tested those classifiers on participants' self-reported mind-wandering. Participants' momentary mental state was measured by means of intermittent thought probes in which they reported on their current mental state. The results showed that neither the vigilance classifier nor the task demands classifier could predict mind-wandering above-chance level, while a classifier trained on self-reports of mind-wandering was able to do so. This suggests that mind-wandering is a mental state different from low vigilance or performing tasks with low demands-both which could be discriminated from the EEG above chance. Furthermore, we used dipole fitting to source-localize the neural correlates of the most import features in each of the three classifiers, indeed finding a few distinct neural structures between the three phenomena. Our study demonstrates the value of machine-learning classifiers in unveiling patterns in neural data and uncovering the associated neural structures by combining it with an EEG source analysis technique.

Decrements in attention have been associated with altered noradrenergic activity in animals. However, research linking noradrenergic functioning to attention in aging humans is scarce, likely reflecting long-standing methodological challenges in noninvasive assessments. We studied whether age-related differences in the noradrenergic system predict differences in attention. We measured pupil dilation, a noninvasive marker of arousalrelated norepinephrine (NE) release, while concurrently recording the EEG of male younger (N= 39; 25.2 +/- 3.2 years) and older adults (N=38; 70.6 +/- 2.7 years). Arousal was modulated on a trial-by-trial basis using fear-conditioned (CS+) stimuli. During conditioning, pupil and EEG markers related to heightened arousal were identified. Afterward, in a dichotic listening task, participants were cued to direct attention to either the left or right ear while highly similar syllable pairs were presented simultaneously to both ears. During the dichotic listening task, presentation of fear-conditioned stimuli reinstated the acquired arousal response, as reflected in pupil and EEG alpha-beta band responses. Critically, pupil dilation to CS+ was correlated with stronger EEG alpha-beta desynchronization, suggesting a common dependence on NE release. On a behavioral level, stronger arousal reactions were associated with better attention. In particular, structural equation modeling revealed that the responsiveness of the NE system is associated with attention on a latent construct level, measured by several indicator tasks. Overall, our results suggest that the responsiveness of the NE system supports attention across the lifespan.

Some neuronal disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), severely impair the communication capacity of patients. Several invasive and non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), most notably using electroencephalography (EEG), have been developed to provide a means of communication to paralysed patients. However, except for a few reports, all available BCI literature for the paralysed (mostly ALS patients) describes patients with intact eye movement control, i.e. patients in a locked-in state (LIS) but not a completely locked-in state (CLIS). In this article we will discuss: (1) the fundamental neuropsychological learning factors and neurophysiological factors determining BCI performance in clinical applications; (2) the difference between LIS and CLIS; (3) recent development in BCIs for communication with patients in the completely locked-in state; (4) the effect of BCI-based communication on emotional well-being and quality of life; and (5) the outlook and the methodology needed to provide a means of communication for patients who have none. Thus, we present an overview of available studies and recent results and try to anticipate future developments which may open new doors for BCI communication with the completely paralysed.

Temporal Dynamics of Memory-guided Cognitive Control and Generalization of Control via Overlapping Associative Memories	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						associative memory; cognitive control; EEG; generalization	ITEM-SPECIFIC CONTROL; AUTOMATIC PROCESSES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EPISODIC MEMORY; CONFLICT; HIPPOCAMPAL; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; ERP; REINSTATEMENT	Goal-directed behavior can benefit from proactive adjustments of cognitive control that occur in anticipation of forthcoming cognitive control demands (CCD). Predictions of forthcoming CCD are thought to depend on learning and memory in two ways: First, through direct experience, associative encoding may link previously experienced CCD to its triggering item, such that subsequent encounters with the item serve to cue retrieval of (i.e., predict) the associated CCD. Second, in the absence of direct experience, pattern completion and mnemonic integration mechanisms may allow CCD to be generalized from its associated item to other items related in memory. While extant behavioral evidence documents both types of CCD prediction, the neurocognitive mechanisms giving rise to these predictions remain largely unexplored. Here, we tested two hypotheses: (1) memory-guided predictions about CCD precede control adjustments due to the actual CCD required; and (2) generalization of CCD can be accomplished through integration mechanisms that link partially overlapping CCD-item and item-item associations in memory. Supporting these hypotheses, the temporal dynamics of theta and alpha power in human electroencephalography data (n = 43, 26 females) revealed that an associative CCD effect emerges earlier than interaction effects involving actual CCD. Furthermore, generalization of CCD from one item (X) to another item (Y) was predicted by a decrease in alpha power following the presentation of the X-Y pair. These findings advance understanding of the mechanisms underlying memory-guided adjustments of cognitive control.

J	Yang, DL; Nguyen, TH; Chung, WY				Yang, Dalin; Nguyen, Trung-Hau; Chung, Wan-Young			A Synchronized Hybrid Brain-Computer Interface System for Simultaneous Detection and Classification of Fusion EEG Signals	COMPLEXITY			English	Article							MOTOR IMAGERY; SPEED	Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology represents a fast-growing field of research and applications for disabled and healthy people, which is a direct communication pathway to translate the neural information into an active command. Owing to the complicated headset structure, low accuracies, extended training periods, and nonstationary noises, BCI still has many challenges that should be dealt with for further facilitation of BCI technology use in daily life. In this study, a simplified synchronized hybrid BCI system is proposed for multiple command control by the electroencephalograph (EEG) signals in the motor cortex. This system can detect the single motor imagery (MI) task, single steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) task, and hybrid MI + SSVEP tasks simultaneously (total ten mental tasks) via 2 EEG channels with high accuracy. The fast independent component analysis algorithm is employed to hybrid signals for obtaining clear EEG signals resulting from denoising. Feature extraction is performed by the wavelet transform, which is extracted by the features in the frequency and time domains. Furthermore, a four-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) is used as a classifier to distinguish different mental tasks. Finally, the hybrid MI + SSVEP system with a simple structure achieves a high accuracy of 95.56%. Additionally, the single MI-based and the SSVEP-based BCI system obtain the classification accuracy of 90.16% and 93.21%, respectively. Experimental results indicate that the synchronized hybrid BCI system could achieve multiple command control with a simple structure. In comparison with the single MI-based and the SSVEP-based BCI system, the hybrid MI + SSVEP BCI system shows a stable performance and higher efficiency. The proposed investigation provides a new method for the multiple command control by a hybrid BCI system. Also, the proposed BCI system offers the possibility of friendly utilization for disabled people because of its reliability, ease of use, and simplified headset structure.

Measuring the Domain Specificity of Workload Using EEG: Auditory and Visual Domains in Rotary-Wing Simulated Flight	HUMAN FACTORS			English	Article						neuroergonomics; physiological measurement; mental workload; multiple resource model; pilot behavior	MENTAL WORKLOAD; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; HEART-RATE; PERFORMANCE; TASK; MEMORY; INDEXES; ALPHA; THETA; ENTRAINMENT	Objective The overarching objective was to evaluate whether workload sensory-domain specificity could be identified through electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during simulated rotary-wing operations. Background Rotary-wing aviators experience workload from different sensory domains, although predominantly through auditory and visual domains. Development of real-time monitoring tools using psychophysiological indices, such as EEG recordings, could enable identification of aviator overload in real time. Method Two studies were completed, both of which recorded EEG, task performance, and self-report data. In Study 1, 16 individuals completed a basic auditory and a basic visual laboratory task where workload was manipulated. In Study 2, 23 Army aviators completed simulated aviation flights where workload was manipulated within auditory and visual sensory domains. Results Results from Study 1 found differences in frontal alpha activity during the auditory task, and that alpha and beta activities were associated with perceived workload. Frontal theta activity was found to differ during the visual task while frontal alpha was associated with perceived workload. Study 2 found support for frontal beta activity and the ratio of beta to alpha + theta to differentiate level of workload within the auditory domain. Conclusion There is likely a role of frontal alpha and beta activities in response to workload manipulations within the auditory domain; however, this role becomes more equivocal when examined in a multifaceted flight scenario. Application Results from this study provide a basis for understanding changes in EEG activity when workload is manipulated in sensory domains that can be used in furthering the development of real-time monitoring tools.

These recurrent symptoms are thought to maintain the severity and substantial impairment in social and cognitive thoughts. SAD is associated with a disruption in neuronal networks implicated in emotional regulation, perceptual stimulus functions, and emotion processing, suggesting a network system to delineate the electrocortical endophenotypes of SAD. This paper seeks to provide a comprehensive review of the most frequently studied electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral coupling, event-related potential (ERP), visual-event potential (VEP), and other connectivity estimators in social anxiety during rest, anticipation, stimulus processing, and recovery states. A search on Web of Science provided 97 studies that document electrocortical biomarkers and relevant constructs pertaining to individuals with SAD. This study aims to identify SAD neuronal biomarkers and provide insight into the differences in these biomarkers based on EEG, ERPs, VEP, and brain connectivity networks in SAD patients and healthy controls (HC). Furthermore, we proposed recommendations to improve methods of delineating the electrocortical endophenotypes of SAD, e.g., a fusion of EEG with other modalities such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalograms (MEG), to realize better effectiveness than EEG alone, in order to ultimately evolve the treatment selection process, and to review the possibility of using electrocortical measures in the early diagnosis and endophenotype examination of SAD.

However, few studies have investigated the acute effects of ketamine on the BOLD pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) response and EEG spectra. In a randomised, double-blind, active placebo-controlled crossover trial, resting-state simultaneous EEG/fMRI was collected during infusion of ketamine or active placebo (remifentanil) in 30 participants with MDD. Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale scores showed a significant antidepressant effect of ketamine compared to placebo (69% response rate). phMRI analyses showed BOLD signal increases in the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices and sensitivity of the decrease in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) BOLD signal to noise correction. EEG spectral analysis showed increased theta, high beta, low and high gamma power, and decreased delta, alpha, and low beta power with differing time-courses. Low beta and high gamma power time courses explained significant variance in the BOLD signal. Interestingly, the variance explained by high gamma power was significantly associated with non-response to ketamine, but significant associations were not found for other neurophysiological markers when noise correction was implemented. The results suggest that the decrease in sgACC BOLD signal is potentially noise and unrelated to ketamine's antidepressant effect, highlighting the importance of noise correction and multiple temporal regressors for phMRI analyses. The lack of effects significantly associated with antidepressant response suggests the phMRI methodology employed was unable to detect such effects, the effect sizes are relatively small, or that other processes, e.g. neural plasticity, underlie ketamine's antidepressant effect.

This paper presents one of the first to investigate neural activities related to contingent learning of infants by analyzing their motor response that could elicit an audio-visual feedback. Three different kinds of motor response of infants were investigated, including unilateral kicks, synchronized kicks, and alternate kicks. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals of infants were recorded before the motor experiments. Higher theta band power and lower upper beta power at the right temporal lobe of infants predicted a higher ratio of total unilateral kicks and a lower ratio of synchronized kicks at the later acquisition stage of the experiment. As contingent learning could be reflected by specific motor response in relation to the audio-visual stimuli, the results suggested that right temporal oscillations could predict different levels of contingent learning of infants.

Interhemispheric symmetry of mu-rhythm phase-dependency of corticospinal excitability	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; HEMISPHERIC-ASYMMETRY; TMS; HANDEDNESS; VARIABILITY; INHIBITION; HYPOTHESIS; PHYSIOLOGY	Oscillatory activity in the mu -frequency band (8-13Hz) determines excitability in sensorimotor cortex. In humans, the primary motor cortex (M1) in the two hemispheres shows significant anatomical, connectional, and electrophysiological differences associated with motor dominance. It is currently unclear whether the mu -oscillation phase effects on corticospinal excitability demonstrated previously for the motor-dominant M1 are also different between motor-dominant and motor-non-dominant M1 or, alternatively, are similar to reflect a ubiquitous physiological trait of the motor system at rest. Here, we applied single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to the hand representations of the motor-dominant and the motor-non-dominant M1 of 51 healthy right-handed volunteers when electroencephalography indicated a certain mu -oscillation phase (positive peak, negative peak, or random). We determined resting motor threshold (RMT) as a marker of corticospinal excitability in the three mu -phase conditions. RMT differed significantly depending on the pre-stimulus phase of the mu -oscillation in both M1, with highest RMT in the positive-peak condition, and lowest RMT in the negative-peak condition. mu -phase-dependency of RMT correlated directly between the two M1, and interhemispheric differences in mu -phase-dependency were absent. In conclusion, mu -phase-dependency of corticospinal excitability appears to be a ubiquitous physiological trait of the motor system at rest, without hemispheric dominance.

Each 0.004 mm(2) channel is an amperometric readout circuit composed of an opamp-less delta-sigma-modulated analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that consumes only 50 nW of power from a 0.6 V supply. The latter is analytically proven to be approximately equivalent to the former under conditions that are typical for the biochemical microsensors. The circuit also includes a low-power multiplierless frequency response analysis (FRA) unit that performs bioimpedance extraction. The channel achieves 1 pA current sensitivity and attains 50.3 dB signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR). The impedance analyzer achieves a dynamic range of 1 pA to 20 nA and a 5 kHz frequency scan range. The 2 mm x 1 mm die has been validated in vivo in real-time multisite potassium sensing in the rodent brain using gold microelectordes implemented on a polyimide substrate.

J	Rawls, E; Miskovic, V; Lamm, C				Rawls, Eric; Miskovic, Vladimir; Lamm, Connie			Delta phase reset predicts conflict-related changes in P3 amplitude and behavior	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Delta; Phase; Phase reset; P3; Network reset; Conflict adaptation	ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; MASS UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; BRAIN POTENTIALS/FIELDS; ALPHA-PHASE; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; DECISION-MAKING; OSCILLATIONS; ADAPTATION	When multiple competing responses are activated, we respond more slowly than if only one response is activated (response conflict). Conflict-induced slowing is reduced for consecutive high-conflict stimuli, an effect known as conflict adaptation. Verguts and Notebaert's (2009) adaptation by binding theory suggests this is due to Hebbian learning of cognitive control, potentiated by the response of the locus coeruleus norepinephrine (NE) system. Phasic activity of the NE system can potentially be measured non-invasively in humans by recording the P3 component of the event-related potential (ERP), and the P3 is sensitive to conflict adaptation. Bouret and Sara's (2005) network reset theory suggests that phasic NE might functionally reset ongoing large-scale network activity, generating synchronous neural population activity like the P3. To examine the possibility that network reset contributes to conflict effects in the P3, we recorded high-density EEG data while subjects performed a flanker task. As expected, conflict and conflict adaptation modulated P3 amplitudes. Brain-behavior correlation analyses indicated that activity during the rise of the P3 was related to RT and predicted RT differences due to conflict. More importantly, phase of delta oscillations not only predicted reaction time differences between low-conflict and high-conflict conditions, but delta phase reset also predicted the amplitude of the P3. Delta oscillations exhibited dominant peaks both pre and post-stimulus, and delta at stimulus onset predicted the post-stimulus ERP, in particular the N2 and P3. This result bridges human EEG with basic mechanisms suggested by computational neural models and invasive patient recordings, namely that salient cognitive events might reset ongoing oscillations leading to the generation of the phase-locked evoked potential. We conclude that partial phase reset is a cortical mechanism involved in monitoring the environment for unexpected events, and this response contributes to conflict effects in the ERP. These results are in line with theories that phasic NE release might reset ongoing cortical activity, leading to the generation of ERP components like the P3.

It is also considered the major factor causing the out-of-the-loop phenomenon (OOTL) occurrence. OOTL is strongly related to a high level of automation in operative contexts such as the Air Traffic Management (ATM), and it could lead to a negative impact on the Air Traffic Controllers' (ATCOs) engagement. As a consequence, being able to monitor the ATCOs' vigilance would be very important to prevent risky situations. In this context, the present study aimed to characterise and assess the vigilance level by using electroencephalographic (EEG) measures. The first study, involving 13 participants in laboratory settings allowed to find out the neurophysiological features mostly related to vigilance decrements. Those results were also confirmed under realistic ATM settings recruiting 10 professional ATCOs. The results demonstrated that (i) there was a significant performance decrement related to vigilance reduction; (ii) there were no substantial differences between the identified neurophysiological features in controlled and ecological settings, and the EEG-channel configuration defined in laboratory was able to discriminate and classify vigilance changes in ATCOs' vigilance with high accuracy (up to 84%); (iii) the derived two EEG-channel configuration was able to assess vigilance variations reporting only slight accuracy reduction.

Our approach is to use copula models of functionals of the Fourier coefficients which is a generalization of coherence. Here, we use standard parametric copula models with a single parameter from both elliptical and Archimedean families. Our approach is to analyze changes in activity in local field potentials in the rat cortex prior to and immediately following the onset of stroke. We present the necessary theoretical background, the multivariate models and an illustration of our methodology on these local field potential data. Simulations with nonlinear dependent data reveal that there is information that is missed by not taking into account dependence on specific frequencies. Moreover, these simulations demonstrate how our proposed method captures more complex nonlinear dependence between time series. Finally, we illustrate our copula-based approach in the analysis of local field potentials of rats.

The multi-subject analysis is to make inferences on the group/population level about the properties of MI brain activity. However, intrinsic neurophysiological variability of neural dynamics poses a challenge for devising efficient MI systems. Here, we develop a time-frequency model for estimating the spatial relevance of common neural activity across subjects employing an introduced statistical thresholding rule. In deriving multi-subject spatial maps, we present a comparative analysis of three feature extraction methods: Common Spatial Patterns, Functional Connectivity, and Event-Related De/Synchronization. In terms of interpretability, we evaluate the effectiveness in gathering MI data from collective populations by introducing two assumptions: (i) Non-linear assessment of the similarity between multi-subject data originating the subject-level dynamics; (ii) Assessment of time-varying brain network responses according to the ranking of individual accuracy performed in distinguishing distinct motor imagery tasks (left-hand vs. right-hand). The obtained validation results indicate that the estimated collective dynamics differently reflect the flow of sensorimotor cortex activation, providing new insights into the evolution of MI responses.

The identification of the SOZ is usually based on visual inspection by highly qualified neurophysiologists. However, quantitative IEEG analyses have recently been developed by exploiting signal and image characteristics in order to improve and expedite the SOZ detection.

The phosphodiesterase-4 and glycine transporter-1 inhibitors enhance in vivo hippocampal theta network connectivity and synaptic plasticity, whereas D-serine does not	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; RECEPTOR-MEDIATED RESPONSES; NEUROMODULATOR D-SERINE; NMDA RECEPTOR; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; SPATIAL MEMORY; PREPULSE INHIBITION; SELECTIVE INHIBITOR; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS	Dysfunctional N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) have been associated with deficits in synaptic plasticity and cognition found in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia. Therapeutic approaches that indirectly enhance NMDAR function through increases in glycine and/or D-serine levels as well as inhibition of phosphodiesterases that reduces degradation of cAMP, are expected to enhance synaptic strength, connectivity and to potentially impact cognition processes. The present in vivo study investigated effects of subcutaneous administration of D-serine, the glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) inhibitor SSR504734 and the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram, on network oscillations, connectivity and long-term potentiation (LTP) at the hippocampi circuits in Sprague-Dawley rats. In conscious animals, multichannel EEG recordings assessed network oscillations and connectivity at frontal and hippocampal CA1-CA3 circuits. Under urethane anaesthesia, field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were measured in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus after high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the Schaffer collateral-CA1 (SC) pathway. SSR504734 and rolipram significantly increased slow theta oscillations (4-6.5Hz) at the CA1-CA3, slow gamma oscillations (30-50Hz) in the frontal areas and enhanced coherence in the CA1-CA3 network, which were dissociated from motor behaviour. SSR504734 enhanced short-term potentiation (STP) and fEPSP responses were extended into LTP response, whereas the potentiation of EPSP slope was short-lived to STP with rolipram. Unlike glycine, increased levels of D-serine had no effect on network oscillations and limits the LTP induction and expression. The present data support a facilitating role of glycine and cAMP on network oscillations and synaptic efficacy at the CA3-CA1 circuit in rats, whereas raising endogenous D-serine levels had no such beneficial effects.

We introduce an unsupervised HFO detector that uses computer-vision algorithms to detect HFO landmarks on two-dimensional (2D) time-frequency maps. To validate the detector, we introduce an analytical model of the HFO based on a sinewave having a Gaussian envelope, for which analytical equations in time-frequency space can be derived, allowing us to establish a direct correspondence between common HFO detection criteria in the time domain with the ones in the frequency domain, used by the computer-vision detection algorithm. The detector identifies potential HFO events on the time-frequency representation, which are classified as true HFOs if criteria regarding the HFO's frequency, amplitude, and duration are met. The detector is validated on simulated HFOs according to the analytical model, in the presence of noise, with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) ranging from -9 to 0 dB. The detector's sensitivity was 0.64 at an SNR of -9 dB, 0.98 at -6 dB, and >0.99 at -3 dB and 0 dB, while its positive prediction value was >0.95, regardless of the SNR. Using the same simulation dataset, our detector is benchmarked against four previously published HFO detectors. The F-measure, a combined metric that takes into account both sensitivity and positive prediction value, was used to compare detection algorithms. Our detector surpassed the other detectors at -6, -3, and 0 dB and had the second best F-score at -9 dB SNR after the MNI detector (0.77 vs. 0.83). The ability to detect HFOs in clinical recordings has been tested on a set of 36 intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) channels in six patients, with 89% of the detections being validated by two independent reviewers. The results demonstrate that the unsupervised detection of HFOs based on their 2D features in time-frequency maps is feasible and has a performance comparable or better than the most used HFO detectors.

Interictal scalp fast ripple occurrence and high frequency oscillation slow wave coupling in epileptic spasms	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Infantile spasms; Pediatric epilepsy; High frequency oscillations; Cross-frequency coupling	INFANTILE SPASMS; WEST-SYNDROME; TREATMENT RESPONSE; SLEEP; HYPSARRHYTHMIA; SEIZURES; PHASE; ONSET; HZ; SURGERY	Objective: Intracranial high frequency oscillation (HFO) occurrence rate (OR) and slow wave activity (SWA) coupling are potential markers of epileptogenicity in epileptic spasms (ES). Scalp ripple (R) detection and SWA coupling have been described in ES; however, the feasibility of scalp fast ripple (FR) detection and measurement of scalp FR coupling to SWA is not known. We evaluated interictal scalp R and FR OR and SWA coupling in pre-treatment EEG in children with short-term treatment-refractory ES compared to short-term treatment non-refractory ES. Methods: We retrospectively identified children with ES and identified HFOs using a semi-automated HFO detector on pre-treatment scalp EEG during sleep. We evaluated HFO OR and event-triggered modulation index (MI) to quantify R (100-250 Hz) and FR (250-600 Hz) coupling strength with different SWA passbands (0.5-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, and 4-8 Hz). We used HFO phasor transform and circular statistics to evaluate phase coupling angle distributions. Results: We identified 15 children with ES with pre-treatment EEG recorded at 2000 Hz. Thirteen out of 15 patients had HFOs and were included for analysis. There were six treatment responders and seven nonresponders three months after treatment initiation. Responders and nonresponders were similar in age (6.1 vs 7.2 mo), ES diagnosis duration (0.7 vs 2.6 mo), and HFO OR (R: 1.07 vs 2.30/min, FR: 0.43 vs 1.96/min). No differences between responders and nonresponders were seen in HFO MI at different SWA. Coupling of R and FR to 2-3 Hz SWA demonstrated increased incidence rate ratio in nonresponders relative to responders at distinct phase coupling angle distributions. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of interictal scalp R and FR detection and quantification of scalp R and FR coupling to SWA in ES.

We investigated the underlying neural mechanism by reanalyzing previously published simultaneous electroencephalogram-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) data from humans viewing oriented gratings during Pavlovian fear conditioning. In acquisition, one grating (CS+) was paired with a noxious noise, the unconditioned stimulus (US). The other grating (CS-) was never paired with the US. In habituation, which preceded acquisition, and in extinction, the same two gratings were presented without US. Using fMRI multivoxel patterns in primary visual cortex during habituation as reference, we found that during acquisition, aversive learning selectively prompted systematic changes in multivoxel patterns evoked by CS+. Specifically, CS+ evoked voxel patterns in V1 became sparser as aversive learning progressed, and the sparsified pattern appeared to be preserved in extinction. Concomitant with the voxel pattern changes, occipital alpha oscillations were increasingly more desynchronized during CS+ (but not CS-) trials. Across acquisition trials, the rate of change in CS+-related alpha desynchronization was correlated with the rate of change in multivoxel pattern representations of CS+. Furthermore, alpha oscillations co-varied with blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) data in the ventral attention network, but not with BOLD in the amygdala. Thus, fear conditioning prompts persistent sparsification of voxel patterns evoked by threat, likely mediated by attention-related mechanisms	[Yin, Siyang; Bo, Ke; Ding, Mingzhou] Univ Florida, J Crayton Pruitt Family Dept Biomed Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Liu, Yuelu] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Mind & Brain, Davis, CA 95618 USA; [Thigpen, Nina; Keil, Andreas] Univ Florida, Dept Psychol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA		Ding, MZ (corresponding author), Univ Florida, J Crayton Pruitt Family Dept Biomed Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.	mding@bme.ufl.edu			NIH [R01MH097320, R01 MH112558]	NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)	This work was supported by NIH grants R01MH097320 and R01 MH112558.		75	4	4	2	4	OXFORD UNIV PRESS	OXFORD	GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND	1749-5016	1749-5024		SOC COGN AFFECT NEUR	Soc.

Oscillatory brain dynamics constitute a fundamental mechanism for the coordinated communication of neural circuits. Such dynamics have been proposed to reflect impaired spatio-temporal integration of sensory and cognitive processes during object perception in schizophrenia. Method: EEG recordings of patients with schizophrenia (n = 23) and control participants (n = 23) were examined. Presented were either an ambiguous (multistable) stimulus, endogenously inducing switching between two perceptual alternatives, or a slightly modified unambiguous control stimulus, during which perceptual reversals were triggered by a minor change in the stimulus configuration. Event-related amplitude modulation induced by perceptual reversals was analyzed for theta (3-8 Hz) and gamma band oscillations (28-48 Hz). Results: Patients displayed increased reaction times and more errors when indicating unambiguous reversals. The patients ' amplitude enhancement of theta oscillations was diminished in both task conditions. During the control task were gamma amplitudes larger in patients than in healthy participants. Conclusion: The results indicate that impairments in generating coherent percepts are reflected in alterations of multiple frequency bands and time windows. Changes in gamma band oscillations may reflect the patients' impairments in perceptuo-cognitive integration processes. Diminished theta amplitude modulation in patients further emphasize diminished top-down cognitive control during perceptual reversals. Significance: This study provides insight into how theta and gamma oscillations underlie changes in object perception, and thereby possibly the generation of core symptoms, in schizophrenia. This paper is dedicated to Prof. Dr. Erol Basar, a pioneer in research on oscillatory braindynamics. He was tireless in his effort to understand brain functions and integratedphilosophy, physics, biology and psychology in his research. His vision on how informationis coded in brain networks inspired many researchers in the last 40 years.

However, the mechanisms of ketamine-induced unconsciousness are not clearly understood. The authors have investigated neuronal dynamics of ketamine-induced loss and return of consciousness and how multisensory processing is modified in the primate neocortex. Methods: The authors performed intracortical recordings of local field potentials and single unit activity during ketamine-induced altered states of consciousness in a somatosensory and ventral premotor network. The animals were trained to perform a button holding task to indicate alertness. Air puff to face or sound was randomly delivered in each trial regardless of their behavioral response. Ketamine was infused for 60 min. Results: Ketamine-induced loss of consciousness was identified during a gradual evolution of the high beta-gamma oscillations. The slow oscillations appeared to develop at a later stage of ketamine anesthesia. Return of consciousness and return of preanesthetic performance level (performance return) were observed during a gradual drift of the gamma oscillations toward the beta frequency. Ketamine-induced loss of consciousness, return of consciousness, and performance return are all identified during a gradual change of the dynamics, distinctive from the abrupt neural changes at propofol-induced loss of consciousness and return of consciousness. Multisensory responses indicate that puff evoked potentials and single-unit firing responses to puff were both preserved during ketamine anesthesia, but sound responses were selectively diminished. Units with suppressed responses and those with bimodal responses appeared to be inhibited under ketamine and delayed in recovery. Conclusions: Ketamine generates unique intracortical dynamics during its altered states of consciousness, suggesting fundamentally different neuronal processes from propofol. The gradually shifting dynamics suggest a continuously conscious or dreaming state while unresponsive under ketamine until its deeper stage with the slow-delta oscillations. Somatosensory processing is preserved during ketamine anesthesia, but multisensory processing appears to be diminished under ketamine and through recovery.

Therefore, different ADHD subtypes can be distinguished. Yet, it is widely elusive whether the specific subtype is critical to consider when examining treatment effects. Based on theoretical considerations, this could be the case for EEG theta/beta neurofeedback. We examine the effects of such an intervention on rapid response execution and inhibition processes using a Go/Nogo task in the inattentive (ADD) and the combined (ADHD-C) subtype. We show that a single neurofeedback protocol affects opposing deficits depending on the ADHD subtype - namely the execution (in ADD) and inhibition of action (in ADHD-C). No changes occurred in the healthy controls. These findings are discussed in relation to overarching principles of neural oscillations, particularly in the beta frequency band. The data suggest that theta/beta neurofeedback trains a superordinate system strongly related to the function of neural beta frequency oscillations to tune neural networks important for the sampling of sensory information used for behavioral control.

According to the new standard of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), the stages of sleep are divided into wakefulness (W), rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) which includes three sleep stages (N1, N2 and N3) that describe the depth of sleep. This study aims to establish an automatic sleep staging algorithm based on the improved weighted random forest (WRF) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using only the features extracted from double-channel EEG signals. The WRF classification model focuses on reducing the bias of the imbalance data, while the HMM model focuses on improving the detection rate of sleep staging through the relationship between adjacent sleep stages. In particular, the improved weighted RF classification model can increase the recognition rate of the N1 stage. In addition, the method of removing features with low variance is used to select meaningful and contributing feature parameters for model training. This is an innovative content of this paper. The sleep EEG data are first segmented into 30 s epochs, and the feature parameters of the epoch data are extracted from the double-channel by applying continuous wavelet packet transform (WPT). Each epoch is then segmented into 29 subepochs of 2 s long with 1 s overlap, and the frequency domain features and statistical features of each subepoch are extracted. The performance of the proposed method is tested by evaluating the accuracy (AC), Kappa coefficient, Recall (R), Precision (P) and F1-score (F1). In the Sleep-EDF database, the overall AC and Kappa coefficient obtained by WRF are 93.20% and 0.890, respectively using the subject-non-independent test. In the 10 sc* and 10 st* Sleep-EDF Expanded database, the overall AC and Kappa coefficient obtained by proposed method are 91.97% and 0.874, respectively using the subject-independent test. The best AC and Kappa coefficient of single subject can reach 96.3% and 0.912, respectively. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is competitive with the most current methods and results, and the recognition rate of N1 stage is significantly improved.

Immediate versus late effects of vigabatrin on spike and wave discharges	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Vigabatrin; WAG/Rij; Genetic absence epilepsy model; Spike-wave discharges; GABAA; GABAB; Rat	GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; GABA(B) ANTAGONIST CGP-35348; ABSENCE EPILEPSY; GENETIC MODEL; VINYL GABA; SEIZURES; BEHAVIOR; RATS; EEG; MECHANISMS	Vigabatrin increases GABA concentrations by inhibiting GABA transaminase. In previous studies, it was shown that vigabatrin increases the incidence of Spike and Wave Discharges (SWD) in the WAG/Rij rat model for absence epilepsy. Since following a single dose of vigabatrin GABA concentrations are known to be increased for several days, the present study sheds light on how the previously described changes in SWD characteristics develop over a longer time frame. To achieve this, we injected adult WAG/Rij rats with 500 mg/kg and recorded their EEG for 48 h. SWD were quantified, and their peak frequencies were calculated. Our results showed three rapid onset effects: a sharp increase in SWD incidence, from 12.5 /hour to 133/ hour), this increase lasted only 4.4 h, an increase in mean SWD duration, from 4.6 s to 8.1 s and a drop in peak frequency, from 8 to 6 Hz. Since it takes several hours before GABA concentrations are sufficiently increased, we propose that these immediate effects are caused by direct stimulation of both GABAA and GABAB receptors by the molecule vigabatrin. Next, the mean SWD duration decreased below baseline values after 4.4 h. Hazard rate analysis showed that this is caused by an increased probability of short SWD. We argue that these changes are caused by increased activation of both GABAA and GABAB receptors in the frontal cortex and the thalamus, and more specifically, in the Reticular Thalamic Nucleus (RTN). After approximately 34 h, the probability of short SWD returned to normal. This suggests the occurrence of downregulation of GABA receptors. The decrease in peak frequency was still present 48 h after injection. It has been argued that the balance between GABAA and GABAB receptor-mediated activity in the RTN is crucial for controlling this SWD characteristic. It can be concluded that a single dose of vigabatrin results in remarkable and opposite effects over time: an initial, proabsence effect is followed by an antiabsence effect.	[Perescis, Martin F.

Effects of an Orexin-2 Receptor Antagonist on Sleep and Event-Related Oscillations in Female Rats Exposed to Chronic Intermittent Ethanol During Adolescence	ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Alcohol; Adolescence; Sleep; Orexin; Hypocretin	ALCOHOL-USE; UNITED-STATES; VAPOR EXPOSURE; EEG POWER; DEPENDENCE; DRINKING; REM; CONSEQUENCES; ARCHITECTURE; CONSUMPTION	Background Alcohol use is on the rise among women in the United States which is especially concerning since women who drink have a higher risk of alcohol-related problems. Orexin (hypocretin) receptor antagonists may have some therapeutic value for alcohol-induced insomnia; however, the use of this class of drugs following female adolescent binge drinking is limited. The current study will address whether adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) in female rats can result in lasting changes in sleep pathology and whether orexin-targeted treatment can alleviate these deficits. Methods Following a 5-week AIE vapor model, young adult rats were evaluated on waking event-related oscillations (EROs) and EEG sleep. Subsequently, AIE rats were treated with orexin receptor 2 (OX2R) antagonist (MK-1064; 10, 20mg/kg) to test for modifications in sleep pathology and waking ERO. Results Female AIE rats exhibited lasting changes in sleep compared to controls. This was demonstrated by increased fragmentation of slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep, as well as reductions in delta and theta power during SWS. There was no impact of AIE on waking EROs. Acute MK-1064 hastened SWS onset and increased the number of SWS episodes, without increasing sleep fragmentation in AIE and controls. While treatment with MK-1064 did not impact sleep EEG spectra, waking ERO energy was increased in delta, theta, and beta frequency bands. Conclusions These results demonstrate that AIE can produce lasting changes in sleep in female rats, highly similar to what we previously found in males. Additionally, while the OX2R antagonist promoted sleep in both alcohol-exposed and unexposed rats, it did not reverse most of the alcohol-induced disruptions in sleep. Thus, OX2R antagonism may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of insomnia, but not the specific signs of alcohol-induced insomnia.

Recently, a link has been proposed between neuroinflammation and FTD. Objective: Here, we aim to investigate the effects of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) combined with luteoline (PEA-LUT), an endocannabinoid with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, on behavior, cognition, and cortical activity in a sample of FTD patients. Methods: Seventeen patients with a diagnosis of probable FTD were enrolled. Cognitive and neurophysiological evaluations were performed at baseline and after 4 weeks of PEA-LUT 700 mg x 2/day. Cognitive effects were assessed by Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Mini-Mental State Examination, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), Screening for Aphasia in Neurodegeneration, Activities of Daily Living-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration-modified Clinical Dementia Rating scale. To investigate in vivo neurophysiological effects of PEA-LUT, we used repetitive and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols assessing LTP-like cortical plasticity, short-interval intracortical inhibition, long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI), and short-latency afferent inhibition. Moreover, we used TMS combined with EEG to evaluate the effects on frontal lobe cortical oscillatory activity. Results: Treatment with PEA-LUT was associated with an improvement in NPI and FAB scores. Neurophysiological evaluation showed a restoration of LICI, in particular at ISI 100 ms, suggesting a modulation of GABA(B) activity. TMS-EEG showed a remarkable increase of TMS-evoked frontal lobe activity and of high-frequency oscillations in the beta/gamma range. Conclusion: PEA-LUT could reduce behavioral disturbances and improve frontal lobe functions in FTD patients through the modulation of cortical oscillatory activity and GABA(B)ergic transmission.

Therefore, neuronal mechanisms involved in speech processing should likewise operate at different (corresponding) time scales. The present study aimed to identify speech units relevant for selecting speech streams in a multi-talker situation. Functional connectivity was extracted from the continuous EEG while young adults detected targets within one stream in the presence of a different, task-irrelevant stream. In two separate groups, either the attended or the ignored stream was manipulated so that it contained intact, word-wise scrambled, syllable-wise scrambled, or spectrally scrambled speech. We found functional brain networks that were sensitive to the difference between the situations when speech was meaningful at sentence vs. at word level, but not between when speech was meaningful at word vs. only valid at syllable level, irrespective of whether the speech units were manipulated in the attended or the ignored stream. These functional brain networks operated in the delta and theta bands corresponding to integrating information from longer time windows. Further, the networks, which could be linked with sup-pressing information from the to-be-ignored stream included brain areas associated with high-level processing of speech. These results are compatible with late filtering models of auditory attention, as they suggest that the length of intact speech units in the to-be-ignored stream affects processes of attentional selection. However, we found no evidence for speech-to-brain coupling differences as a function of the intact unit of speech in either stream. Thus, although the current results do not rule out that early processes of speech processing affect stream selection in a cocktail party situation, neither do they provide supporting for it.

Brain-scale cortico-cortical functional connectivity in the delta-theta band is a robust signature of conscious states: an intracranial and scalp EEG study	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CORTICAL EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; TARGET-CONTROLLED INFUSION; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; MEG; BREAKDOWN; PROPOFOL; SLEEP; OSCILLATIONS; MULTICENTER; INFORMATION	Long-range cortico-cortical functional connectivity has long been theorized to be necessary for conscious states. In the present work, we estimate long-range cortical connectivity in a series of intracranial and scalp EEG recordings experiments. In the two first experiments intracranial-EEG (iEEG) was recorded during four distinct states within the same individuals: conscious wakefulness (CW), rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM), stable periods of slow-wave sleep (SWS) and deep propofol anaesthesia (PA). We estimated functional connectivity using the following two methods: weighted Symbolic-Mutual-Information (wSMI) and phase-locked value (PLV). Our results showed that long-range functional connectivity in the delta-theta frequency band specifically discriminated CW and REM from SWS and PA. In the third experiment, we generalized this original finding on a large cohort of brain-injured patients. FC in the delta-theta band was significantly higher in patients being in a minimally conscious state (MCS) than in those being in a vegetative state (or unresponsive wakefulness syndrome). Taken together the present results suggest that FC of cortical activity in this slow frequency band is a new and robust signature of conscious states.

In particular, studies have shown a consistent EEG alpha synchronization during performance on the Alternative Uses Task (AUT), a well-established DT task. However, there is a need for investigating the brain dynamics underlying the production of a sequence of multiple, alternative ideas at the AUT and their relationship with idea originality. In twenty young adults, we investigated changes in alpha power during performance on a structured version of the AUT, requiring to ideate four alternative uses for conventional objects in distinct and sequentially balanced time periods. Data analysis followed a three-step approach, including behaviour aspects, physiology aspects, and their mutual relationship. At the behavioural level, we observed a typical serial order effect during DT production, with an increase of originality associated with an increase in ideational time and a decrease in response percentage over the four responses. This pattern was paralleled by a shift from alpha desynchronization to alpha synchronization across production of the four alternative ideas. Remarkably, alpha power changes were able to explain response originality, with a differential role of alpha power over different sensor sites. In particular, alpha synchronization over frontal, central, and temporal sites was able to predict the generation of original ideas in the first phases of the DT process, whereas alpha synchronization over centro-parietal sites persistently predicted response originality during the entire DT production. Moreover, a bilateral hemispheric effect in frontal sites and a left-lateralized effect in central, temporal, and parietal sensor sites emerged as predictors of the increase in response originality. These findings highlight the temporal dynamics of DT production across the generation of alternative ideas and support a partially distinct functional role of specific cortical areas during DT.

However, there is a large variability among patients with first episode psychosis (FEP). Also, most studies report a single electrode site and on comparing case-control group differences. Few have taken advantage of the full wealth of multi-channel EEG signals to examine observable patterns. None, to our knowledge, have used machine learning (ML) approaches to investigate neurophysiological derived subgroups with distinct cognitive and functional outcome characteristics. In this study, we applied ML to empirically stratify individuals into homogeneous subgroups based on multi-channel MMN data. We then characterized the functional, cognitive, and clinical profiles of these neurobiologically derived subgroups. We also explored the underlying low frequency range responses (delta, theta, alpha) during MMN. Methods Clinical, neurocognitive, functioning data of 33 healthy controls and 20 FEP patients were collected. 90% of the patients had 6-month follow-up data. Neurocognition, social cognition, and functioning measures were assessed using the NCCB Cognitive Battery, the Awareness of Social Inference Test, UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment, and Multnomah Community Ability Scale. Symptom severity was collected using the PANSS. MMN amplitude and single-trial derived low frequency activity across 24 frontocentral channels were used as main variables in the ML k-means clustering analyses. Results We found a consistent pattern of two distinctive subgroups. We labeled them as "better functioning" and "poorer functioning" clusters, respectively. Each subgroup can be mapped onto either better or poorer clinical, cognitive, and functioning profiles. Also, we identified two subgroups of patients: one showed improved MMN and one showed worsening of MMN over time. Patients with improved MMN had better follow-up clinical, cognitive, and functioning profile than those with worsening MMN. Among the low frequency bands, delta frequency appeared to be the most relevant to the observed MMN responses in all individuals. However, higher delta responses were not necessarily associated with a better functioning profile, suggesting that delta frequency alone may not be useful in clinical characterization. Conclusions The ML approach could be a robust tool to explore heterogeneity and facilitate the identification of neurobiological homogeneous subgroups in FEP.

Lesions in this area are usually associated with abnormalities in the regulation of heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP). The analysis of the heart rate variability (HRV) is useful to evaluate the cardiac parasympathetic nervous system activity. This study aims at comparing HRV changes occurring in two groups of patients suffering from Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE). To that aim, we evaluated patients differentiated by the right or left location of the epileptic foci. Materials and Methods:Fifty-two adult patients with a diagnosis of TLE were enrolled. Each patient underwent a 20-min EEG + EKG recording in resting state. According to the localization of epileptic focus, patients were divided into two subgroups: right TLE (R-TLE) and left TLE (L-TLE). HRV parameters were calculated with a short-lasting analysis of EKG recordings. Time-domain and frequency domain-related, as well as non-linear analysis, parameters, were compared between the two groups. Results:Compared to the R-TLE group, L-TLE subjects showed a significant decrease in low frequency (LF) (p< 0.01) and low frequency/high-frequency ratio (LF/HF) (p< 0.001) as well as increased HF values (p< 0.01), a parameter indicative of the presence of an increased cardiac vagal tone. These results were also confirmed in the subgroup analysis that took into account the seizure types, responses to antiepileptic drugs, seizure frequencies, and etiology. Conclusions:The main finding of the study is that, compared to R-TLE, L-TLE is associated with increased cardiac vagal tone.

L-TLE patients may have a lower risk of developing cardiac dysfunctions and less susceptible to develop Sudden Death for Epilepsy (SUDEP).

Right frontal eye field has perceptual and oculomotor functions during optokinetic stimulation and nystagmus	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						FEF; optokinetic nystaginus; slow eye movements; TMS-EEG; visual perception	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; BILATERAL VESTIBULAR FAILURE; RIGHT-HEMISPHERIC DOMINANCE; SMOOTH-PURSUIT; VISUAL-ATTENTION; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; TMS; ALPHA; CORTEX	The right frontal eye field (rFEF) is associated with visual perception and eye movements. rFIFT is activated during optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), a reflex that moves the eye in response to visual motion (optokinetic stimulation, OKS). It remains unclear whether rFEF plays causal perceptual and/or oculomotor roles during OKS and OKN. To test this, participants viewed a leftward-moving visual scene of vertical bars and judged whether a flashed dot was moving. Single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) were applied to rFEF on half of trials. In half of blocks, to explore oculomotor control, participants performed an OKN in response to the OKS. rEliF TMS, during OKN, made participants more accurate on trials when the dot was still, and it slowed eye movements. In separate blocks. participants fixated during OKS. This not only controlled for eye movements but also allowed the use of EEG to explore the FEF's role in visual motion discrimination. In these blocks, by contrast. leftward dot motion discrimination was impaired, associated with a disruption of the frontal-posterior balance in alpha-band oscillations. None of these effects occurred in a control site (M1) experiment. These results demonstrate multiple related yet dissociable causal roles of the right FEF during optokinetic stimulation. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study demonstrates causal roles of the right frontal eye field (FEF) in motion discrimination and eye movement control during visual scene motion: previous work had only examined other stimuli and eye movements such as saccades. Using combined transcranial magnetic stimulation and EEG and a novel optokinetic stimulation motion-discrimination task, we find evidence for multiple related yet dissociable causal roles within the FEF: perceptual processing during optokinetic stimulation, generation of the optokinetic nystagmus, and the maintenance of alpha oscillations.

In reading, a single desynchronization surfaced 200-600 ms after target presentation, with a stronger power-decrease in lower beta frequencies for neutral compared to negative words. The typing task revealed two distinct desynchronizations. A first one surfaced within spatio-temporal coordinates closely resembling those of the desynchronization observed in the reading task, thus pointing towards a common origin at the level of linguistic processing of the input word stimuli. Additionally, a second motor-related desynchronization surfaced during the typed response, from 700 to 2000 ms after stimulus onset. Here, words' emotional connotation affected the higher beta band. The comparison between tasks thus suggests that different beta desynchronizations reflect distinct EEG landmarks for language and motor processing. Further, the effect of emotional connotation on the motor-related desynchronization of the typing task suggests that language processing can propagate its influence onto the stage of motor response execution, pointing against a serial flow of information from language onto motor processing.

Cuprizone-induced oligodendrocyte loss and demyelination impairs recording performance of chronically implanted neural interfaces	BIOMATERIALS			English	Article							TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; WHITE-MATTER; PERINEURONAL OLIGODENDROCYTES; SATELLITE OLIGODENDROCYTES; INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; TISSUE RESPONSES; PRECURSOR CELLS; EEG COHERENCE; MYELIN LOSS	Biological inflammation induced during penetrating cortical injury can disrupt functional neuronal and glial activity within the cortex, resulting in potential recording failure of chronically implanted neural interfaces. Oligodendrocytes provide critical support for neuronal health and function through direct contact with neuronal soma and axons within the cortex. Given their fundamental role to regulate neuronal activity via myelin, coupled with their heightened vulnerability to metabolic brain injury due to high energetic demands, oligodendrocytes are hypothesized as a possible source of biological failure in declining recording performances of intracortical microelectrode devices. To determine the extent of their contribution to neuronal activity and function, a cuprizone-inducible model of oligodendrocyte depletion and demyelination in mice was performed prior to microelectrode implantation. At 5 weeks of cuprizone exposure, mice demonstrated significantly reduced cortical oligodendrocyte density and myelin expression. Mice were then implanted with functional recording microelectrodes in the visual cortex and neuronal activity was evaluated up to 7 weeks alongside continued cuprizone administration. Cuprizone-induced oligodendrocyte loss and demyelination was associated with significantly reduced recording performances at the onset of implantation, which remained relatively stable over time. In contast, recording performances for mice on a normal diet were intially elevated before decreasing over time to the recording level of tcuprizone-treated mice. Further electro-physiological analysis revealed deficits in multi-unit firing rates, frequency-dependent disruptions in neuronal oscillations, and altered laminar communication within the cortex of cuprizone-treated mice. Post-mortem immunohistochemistry revealed robust depletion of oligodendrocytes around implanted microelectrode arrays alongside comparable neuronal densities to control mice, suggesting that oligodendrocyte loss was a possible contributor to chronically impaired device performances. This study highlights potentially significant contributions from the oligodendrocyte lineage population concerning the biological integration and long-term functional performance of neural interfacing technology.

Neural mechanisms underlying expectation-dependent inhibition of distracting information	ELIFE			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY; VISUAL-SEARCH; STATISTICAL REGULARITIES; ATTENTION; TARGET; SUPPRESSION; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; SOFTWARE; CAPTURE	Predictions based on learned statistical regularities in the visual world have been shown to facilitate attention and goal-directed behavior by sharpening the sensory representation of goal-relevant stimuli in advance. Yet, how the brain learns to ignore predictable goal-irrelevant or distracting information is unclear. Here, we used EEG and a visual search task in which the predictability of a distractor's location and/or spatial frequency was manipulated to determine how spatial and feature distractor expectations are neurally implemented and reduce distractor interference. We find that expected distractor features could not only be decoded pre-stimulus, but their representation differed from the representation of that same feature when part of the target. Spatial distractor expectations did not induce changes in preparatory neural activity, but a strongly reduced Pd, an ERP index of inhibition. These results demonstrate that neural effects of statistical learning critically depend on the task relevance and dimension (spatial, feature) of predictions.

EEG dynamics and neural generators of psychological flow during one tightrope performance	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SUPERIOR TEMPORAL GYRUS; VISUAL-SEARCH; BRAIN; EXPERIENCE; ATTENTION; INSIGHTS; BALANCE; ATLAS; DIRECTION; SIGNALS	Psychological "flow" emerges from a goal requiring action, and a match between skills and challenge. Using high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) recording, we quantified the neural generators characterizing psychological "flow" compared to a mindful "stress" state during a professional tightrope performance. Applying swLORETA based on self-reported mental states revealed the right superior temporal gyrus (BA38), right globus pallidus, and putamen as generators of delta, alpha, and beta oscillations, respectively, when comparing "flow" versus "stress". Comparison of "stress" versus "flow" identified the middle temporal gyrus (BA39) as the delta generator, and the medial frontal gyrus (BA10) as the alpha and beta generator. These results support that "flow" emergence required transient hypo-frontality. Applying swLORETA on the motor command represented by the tibialis anterior EMG burst identified the ipsilateral cerebellum and contralateral sensorimotor cortex in association with on-line control exerted during both "flow" and "stress", while the basal ganglia was identified only during "flow".

Slow waves are similar to 1 Hz, high amplitude, negative-positive deflections that are primarily generated and coordinated within the cortex, whereas sleep spindles are 12-16 Hz, waxing and waning oscillations that are initiated within the thalamus and regulated by thalamo-cortical circuits. In healthy subjects, these oscillations are thought to be responsible for the restorative aspects of sleep and have been increasingly shown to be involved in learning, memory and plasticity. Furthermore, deficits in sleep spindles and, to lesser extent, slow waves have been reported in both chronic schizophrenia (SCZ) and early course psychosis patients. In this article, we will first describe sleep spindle and slow wave characteristics, including their putative functional roles in the healthy brain. We will then review electrophysiological, genetic, and cognitive studies demonstrating spindle and slow wave impairments in SCZ and other psychotic disorders, with particularly emphasis on recent findings in early course patients. Finally, we will discuss how future work, including sleep studies in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis, may help position spindles and slow waves as candidate biomarkers, as well as novel treatment targets, for SCZ and related psychotic disorders.

HFOs and uGIC were compared within and outside the SOZ. Postsurgical outcome was compared to the colocalization of HFOs and resected SOZ. Results: There was significant correlation between uGIC and both broad (r = 0.69, p < 0.0005) and strict HFOs (r= 0.48, p < 0.0005). All were significantly greater within the SOZ overall, but only in 17/41 (strict, uGIC) or 18/41 (broad) patients. HFO markers were significantly greater within the SOZ for 8/15 patients with positive postsurgical outcomes, but not for any patients with negative outcomes (0/5). Conclusion: The uGIC is a marker of HFO activity, while HFOs and uGIC are markers of the SOZ overall. Colocalization of HFOs and the SOZ has strong positive predictive value for postsurgical outcome, but poor negative predictive value. Significance: The uGIC is an objective surrogate marker of HFO activity independent of identifying discrete HFO events. (C) 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

A skew-based method for identifying intracranial EEG channels with epileptic activity without detecting spikes, ripples, or fast ripples	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Skewness; Stockwell transform; NREM sleep; Biomarkers; High-frequency oscillations; Epileptogenic zone	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SLEEP; LOCALIZATION; MARKER; ZONE	Objective: To develop a method for identifying intracranial EEG (iEEG) channels with epileptic activity without the need to detect spikes, ripples, or fast ripples. Methods: We compared the skew of the distribution of power values from five minutes non-rapid eye movement stage N3 sleep for the 5-80 Hz, 80-250 Hz (ripple), and 250-500 Hz (fast ripple) bands of epileptic (located in seizure-onset or irritative zone) and non-epileptic iEEG channels recorded in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. We optimized settings in 120 bipolar channels from 10 patients, compared the results to 120 channels from another 10 patients, and applied the method to channels of 12 individual patients. Results: The distribution of power values was more skewed in epileptic than in non-epileptic channels in all three frequency bands. The differences in skew were correlated with the presence of spikes, ripples, and fast ripples. When classifying epileptic and non-epileptic channels, the mean accuracy over 12 patients was 0.82 (sensitivity: 0.76, specificity: 0.91). Conclusions: The 'skew method' can distinguish epileptic from non-epileptic channels with good accuracy and, in particular, high specificity. Significance: This is an easy-to-apply method that circumvents the need to visually mark or automatically detect interictal epileptic events.

Tools to detect cognitive decline are sparse. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether cognitive decline is accompanied by alterations in the temporal dynamics of steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). Methods: We included 162 men from the Danish Metropolit birth cohort. Their cognitive trajectory was based on their intelligence test score at youth (age similar to 18), middle age (age similar to 56), and late middle age (age similar to 62). Subjects underwent cognitive tests and steady-state visual stimulation. Temporal dynamics of SSVEPs were assessed in terms of amplitude and phase coherence. Results: The latency and magnitude of the amplitude modulation of the 36-Hz response correlated negatively with subjects' cognition indices. Furthermore, negative cognition index was associated with loss of SSVEPs at 36 Hz, and both 8 Hz and 36 Hz in severe cases. Conclusion: Latency and magnitude of gamma frequency SSVEPs increase with cognitive decline. This suggests that the facilitation of SSVEPs first becomes problematic at gamma frequencies, then at alpha frequencies. Significance: Our data suggests that the temporal dynamics of SSVEPs can be used as an indicator of cognitive impairment. Furthermore, evoked gamma oscillations are especially vulnerable in cognitive decline. (C) 2020 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An Exploratory Study	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						EEG; FFT; alpha desynchronization; attention orienting; alerting; attention inhibition; neurocognitive perceptual and motor workload; hypoxia; overt motor responses; hemispheric lateralization	HYPOBARIC HYPOXIA; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; MECHANISM; REFLECT; HUMANS; SYSTEM	While electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha desynchronization has been related to anticipatory orienting of visuospatial attention, an increase in alpha power has been associated to its inhibition. A separate line of findings indicated that alpha is affected by a deficient oxygenation of the brain or hypoxia, although leaving unclear whether the latter increases or decreases alpha synchronization. Here, we carried out an exploratory study on these issues by monitoring attention alerting, orienting, and control networks functionality by means of EEG recorded both in normoxia and hypoxia in college students engaged in four attentional cue-target conditions induced by a redesigned Attention Network Test. Alpha power was computed through Fast Fourier Transform. Regardless of brain oxygenation condition, alpha desynchronization was the highest during exogenous, uncued orienting of spatial attention, the lowest during alerting but spatially unpredictable, cued exogenous orienting of attention, and of intermediate level during validly cued endogenous orienting of attention, no matter the motor response workload demanded by the latter, especially over the left hemisphere. Hypoxia induced an increase in alpha power over the right-sided occipital and parietal scalp areas independent of attention cueing and conflict conditions. All in all, these findings prove that attention orienting is undergirded by alpha desynchronization and that alpha right-sided synchronization in hypoxia might sub-serve either the effort to sustain attention over time or an overall suppression of attention networks functionality.

However, it is unclear to what extent the specific behavior assessed in these questionnaires elicit lateralized neural activity when performed in real-life situations. To illuminate this unresolved issue, we assessed EEG alpha and beta asymmetries during real-life performance of the behaviors assessed in the EHI and WFQ using a mobile EEG system. This methodology provides high ecological validity for studying neural correlates of motor behavior under more naturalistic conditions. Our results indicate that behavioral performance of items of both the EHI and WFQ differentiate between left- and right-handers and left- and right-footers on the neural level, especially in the alpha frequency band. These results were unaffected by movement parameters. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that neural activity elicited specifically during left-sided task performance provides predictive power for the EHI or WFQ score of the participants. Overall, our results show that these prominent questionnaires not only distinguish between different motor preferences on the behavioral level, but also on the neurophysiological level. Furthermore, we could show that mobile EEG systems are a powerful tool to investigate motor asymmetries in ecologically valid situations outside of the laboratory setting. Future research should focus on other lateralized behavioral phenotypes in real-life settings to provide more insights into lateralized motor functions.

The aim of this study is to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of HFOs in channel-wise instead of event-level as usual and to develop an automated the seizure onset zone (SOZ) identification by using a support vector machine (SVM) approach on the channel-wise features in a short-term recording. In this work, five consecutive patients with medically intractable epilepsy were enrolled. For each patient, ten-minute segments were defined from two hours of iEEG recordings during sleep state. A total of 17 channel-wise features including 6 rate-based, 6 duration-based, 3 amplitude-based, and 2 power-based features of HFOs were extracted from each 10-min segment, which including ripples (Rs, 80-250 Hz) and fast ripples (FRs, 250-500Hz) were detected automatically using validated detectors. Each channel-wise feature was ranked by using the Student & x2019;s <italic>t-test</italic> method and the most distinctive features were selected to explore the characteristics of HFOs in each channel. A supervised-learning based SVM classifier with the selected channel-wise features or their combinations was developed to identify each channel within the independently clinician-defined SOZ or not. Over 3,816 chanel-10-min segments of iEEG recordings, the evaluated accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the proposed approach with the optimal combination of top five ranked features for SOZ identification are 86.6 & x0025;, 73.0 & x0025;, and 94.1 & x0025;, respectively, for ten-fold cross-validation, and 86.0 & x0025;, 79.2 & x0025;, and 91.8 & x0025;, respectively, for the leave-1-out cross-validation. Compared with the recently reported SOZ detectors based on event-wise feature of HFOs, the channel-wise features and the combination with machine learning approach demonstrate its feasibility in SOZ identification with a relative higher performance and potentially reduce the time needed currently for long-term recording and manual inspection.

Specifically, the present research wanted to explore if gift exchange, increased emotional sharing, gratitude and interpersonal cooperation, leading to an improvement in cognitive and behavioral performance. In this regard, neural connectivity and cognitive performance of 14 pairs of friends were recorded during the development of a joint attention task that involved a gift exchange at the beginning or halfway through the task. The moment of gift exchange was randomized within the pairs: for seven couples, it happened at task beginning, for the remaining seven later. Individuals' simultaneous brain activity was recorded through the use of two electroencephalograms (EEG) systems that were used in hyperscanning. Results The results showed that after gift exchange there was an improvement in behavioral performance in terms of accuracy. For what concerns EEG, instead, an increase of delta and theta activation was observed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) when gift exchange occurred at the beginning of the task. Furthermore, an increase in neural connectivity for delta and theta bands was observed. Conclusion The present research provides a significant contribution to the exploration of the factors contributing to the strengthening of social bonds, increasing cooperation, gratitude and prosocial behavior.

One-Shot Tagging During Wake and Cueing During Sleep With Spatiotemporal Patterns of Transcranial Electrical Stimulation Can Boost Long-Term Metamemory of Individual Episodes in Humans	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						memory consolidation; non-invasive stimulation; learning and memory; metamemory; targeted memory reactivation		Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during slow-wave oscillations (SWOs) in sleep has been demonstrated with sensory cues to achieve about 5-12% improvement in post-nap memory performance on simple laboratory tasks. But prior work has not yet addressed the one-shot aspect of episodic memory acquisition, or dealt with the presence of interference from ambient environmental cues in real-world settings. Further, TMR with sensory cues may not be scalable to the multitude of experiences over one's lifetime. We designed a novel non-invasive non-sensory paradigm that tags one-shot experiences of minute-long naturalistic episodes in immersive virtual reality (VR) with unique spatiotemporal amplitude-modulated patterns (STAMPs) of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES). In particular, we demonstrated that these STAMPs can be reapplied as brief pulses during SWOs in sleep to achieve about 10-20% improvement in the metamemory of targeted episodes compared to the control episodes at 48 hours after initial viewing. We found that STAMPs can not only facilitate but also impair metamemory for the targeted episodes based on an interaction between presleep metamemory and the number of STAMP applications during sleep. Overnight metamemory improvements were mediated by spectral power increases following the offset of STAMPs in the slow-spindle band (8-12 Hz) for left temporal areas in the scalp electroencephalography (EEG) during sleep. These results prescribe an optimal strategy to leverage STAMPs for boosting metamemory and suggest that real-world episodic memories can be modulated in a targeted manner even with coarser, non-invasive spatiotemporal stimulation.

This would help in detection of seizures, understanding and modeling epileptic activity. Baseline activity and spike-wave discharges (SWDs) were considered as regimes. Three channels relevant for absence epilepsy were studied: the parietal cortex, the ventroposterial medial nucleus of thalamus, and the reticular thalamic nucleus. Experimental data and two types of models were investigated. The result show that SWDs often treated as more or less regular oscillations are characterized by large positive Lyapunov exponent, not very different from the value obtained for baseline activity. The mesoscale network model of epilepsy is mostly able to reproduce this phenomenon, including absolute values. The more simple neuron mass model exhibits Lyapunov exponent during SWDs twice smaller than in baseline.	[Medvedeva, T.

Usually, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series connections are estimated through zero-lag correlation metrics that quantify the statistical similarity between pairs of regions or spectral measures that assess synchronization at a frequency band of interest. Here, we explored the application of a new metric to assess the functional synchronization in phase space between fMRI time series in a resting state. We applied a complete topological analysis to the resulting connectivity matrix to uncover both the macro-scale organization of the brain and detect the most important nodes. The synchronization metric is also compared with Pearson's correlation coefficient and spectral coherence to highlight similarities and differences between the topologies of the three functional networks. We found that the individual topological organization of the resulting synchronization-based connectivity networks shows a finer modular organization than that identified with the other two metrics and a low overlap with the modular partitions of the other two networks suggesting that the derived topological information is not redundant and could be potentially integrated to provide a multi-scale description of functional connectivity.

The slope of slow-waves, a major characteristic of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, has been shown to directly reflect synaptic strength, when accounting for amplitude changes across the night. In this study, we aimed to investigate overnight slope changes in the course of development in an age-, amplitude-, and region-dependent manner. Methods: All-night high-density electroencephalography data were analyzed in a cross-sectional population of 60 healthy participants in the age range of 8-29 years. To control for amplitude changes across the night, we matched slow-waves from the first and the last hour of NREM sleep according to their amplitude. Results: We found a reduction of slow-wave slopes from the first to the last hour of NREM sleep across all investigated ages, amplitudes, and most brain regions. The overnight slope change was largest in children and decreased toward early adulthood. A topographical analysis revealed regional differences in slope change. Specifically, for small amplitude waves the decrease was smallest in an occipital area, whereas for large amplitude waves, the decrease was smallest in a central area. Conclusions: The larger slope decrease in children might be indicative of a boosted renormalization of synapses during sleep in childhood, which, in turn, might be related to increased plasticity during brain maturation. Regional differences in the extent of slow-wave slope reduction may reflect a "smart" down-selection process or, alternatively, indicate amplitude-dependent differences in the generation of slow-waves.

EEG MU RHYTHM REACTIVITY DURING SPEECH PERCEPTION IN CHILDREN AGED FROM TWO TO THREE YEARS: INFLUENCE OF REARING CONDITIONS	ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA			Russian	Article						speech perception; EEG mu rhythm; children; orphans	DEVELOPMENTAL DIFFERENCES; ALPHA RHYTHMS; LANGUAGE; THETA; OSCILLATIONS; BETA; CONTAMINATION; INFORMATION; MECHANISMS; INFANTS	The level of speech development in children is the most important factor underlying their cognitive and social development. Hence of high relevance is studying the influence of rearing conditions on the formation of the speech capacity in children aged from two to three and a half years. With the aim to compare the speech perception development in the institution-reared orphan children (n = 54) and the children reared in biological families (n = 53), they underwent psychometric testing and EEG power recording (at 12 electrodes associated with frontal, central, temporal and parietal cortex regions) in individually determined mu rhythm frequency ranges under a condition of wakeful rest and when attending to recorded audio fragments of a normal speech (native speech) and its reversal version. By means of the Bailey test, the group of institution reared children demonstrated certain difficulties in speech perception. The process of perception of both native and reversed speech stimuli was accompanied by an increase in the mu rhythm power at the majority of electrodes in the family-reared children, while the mu power in the group of institution-reared children mostly decreased. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that parentless children have a delayed speech perception development and the test of listening to the native and reversed speech stimuli may be helpful in discerning the individually determined EEG mu rhythm reactivity which is reflective of children's rearing condition and life experience.

During brain development, activity-dependent mechanisms are essential for synaptic connectivity formation, and abolishing burst activity in animal models leads to weak disorganised synaptic connectivity. Moreover, synaptic pruning shares similar mechanisms to spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), suggesting that the timing of activity may play a critical role in connectivity formation. We investigated, in a computational model of leaky integrate-and-fire neurones, whether the temporal ordering of burst activity within an external driving input could modulate connectivity formation in the network. Connectivity evolved across the course of simulations using an approach analogous to STDP, from networks with initial random connectivity. Small-world connectivity and hub neurones emerged in the network structure-characteristic properties of mature brain networks. Notably, driving the network with an external input which exhibited LRTCs in the temporal ordering of burst activity facilitated the emergence of these network properties, increasing the speed with which they emerged compared with when the network was driven by the same input with the bursts randomly ordered in time. Moreover, the emergence of small-world properties was dependent on the strength of the LRTCs. These results suggest that the temporal ordering of burst activity could play an important role in synaptic connectivity formation and the emergence of small-world topology in the developing brain.

Such differential processing could be mediated by a swift network reconfiguration on the macroscopic level, but this remains a poorly understood process. To tackle this issue, we used a behavioral paradigm to introduce a shift of selective attention between the visual and auditory domains, and recorded scalp electroencephalographic signals from eight healthy participants. The changes in effective connectivity caused by the cross-modal attentional shift were delineated by analyzing spectral Granger Causality (GC), a metric of frequency-specific effective connectivity. Using data-driven methods of pattern-classification and feature-analysis, we found that a change in the alpha band (12 Hz-15 Hz) of GC is a stable feature across different individuals that can be used to decode the attentional shift. Specifically, auditory attention induces more pronounced information flow in the alpha band, especially from the parietal-occipital areas to the temporal-parietal areas, compared to the case of visual attention, reflecting a reconfiguration of interaction in the macroscopic brain network accompanying different processing. Our results support the role of alpha oscillation in organizing the information flow across spatially-separated brain areas and, thereby, mediating cross-modal selective attention.

Rajendra			Automated phase classification in cyclic alternating patterns in sleep stages using Wigner-Ville Distribution based features	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Cyclic alternating patterns (CAP); Electroencephalogram (EEG); A-phase; Non rapid eye movements (NREM); Wigner-Ville Transform; Renyi entropy	CROSS-TERMS; INFORMATION; DIAGNOSIS; CAP	Sleep is one of the most important body mechanisms responsible for the proper functioning of human body. Cyclic alternating patterns (CAP) play an indispensable role in the analysis of sleep quality and related disorders like nocturnal front lobe epilepsy, insomnia, narcolepsy etc. The traditional manual segregation methods of CAP phases by the medical experts are prone to human fatigue and errors which may lead to inaccurate diagnosis of sleep stages. In this paper, we present an automated approach for the classification of CAP phases (A and B) using Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD) and Renyi entropy (RE) features. The WVD provides a high-resolution time-frequency analysis of the signals whereas RE provides least time-frequency uncertainty with WVD. The classification is performed using medium Gaussian kernel-based support vector machine with 10-fold cross-validation technique. We have presented the results for randomly sampled balanced data sets. The proposed approach does not require any pre-processing or post-processing stages, making it simple as compared to the existing techniques. The proposed method is able to achieve an average classification accuracy of 72.35% and 87.45% for balanced and unbalanced data sets respectively. The proposed method can aid the medical experts to analyze the cerebral stability as well as the sleep quality of a person.

The important role of self-esteem is to buffer negative emotions, and individuals with low self-esteem are prone to instigating various forms of defensive behaviors. Thus, we thought that the relationships between trait creativity and executive control brain networks might be modulated by self-esteem. The resting-state electroencephalogram (RS-EEG) microstates can be divided into four classical types (MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS4), which can reflect the brain networks as well as their dynamic characteristic. Thus, the Williams Creative Tendency Scale (WCTS) and Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (RSES) were used to investigate the modulating role of self-esteem on the relationships between trait creativity and the RS-EEG microstates. As our results showed, self-esteem consistently modulated the relationships between creativity and the duration and contribution of MS2 related to visual or imagery processing, the occurrence of MS3 related to cingulo-opercular networks, and transitions between MS2 and MS4, which were related to frontoparietal control networks. Based on these results, we thought that trait creativity was related to the executive control of bottom-up processing for individuals with low self-esteem, while the bottom-up information from vision or visual imagery might be related to trait creativity for individuals with high self-esteem.

Methods: Non-diabetic, diabetic-controlled, and diabetic-uncontrolled patients underwent a visuospatial incidental-intentional memory test under simultaneous recording of temporal, parietal, and frontal EEG. The test required patients to solve a maze, with eight objects irrelevant to the task, embedded in it, after an interference instruction, participants were asked to recall the positions of the objects (incidental test). Finally, the participants were explicitly told to study the object positions, and then were asked to recall the objects again (intentional test). Power from baseline, incidental learning, incidental memory, and intentional learning conditions was obtained in alpha, theta, and low-gamma bands. Comparisons were made across groups and conditions for each band, with age, sex, and years from the diagnosis as covariates (ANCOVA with blocking). Results: Diabetic patients showed spared incidental but deficient intentional visuospatial learning. Uncontrolled patients showed a more profound intentional learning deficit as they scored similar numbers of correct positions under incidental and intentional conditions; whereas, non-diabetic and diabetic-controlled patients increased their number after the intentional study. Non-diabetic participants showed increased power during intentional learning compared with the baseline condition in frontal theta, frontoparietal gamma (Fp2 and P4) and frontal alpha (F4) bands; whereas in diabetic patients the power increased in the theta band, in T5 (uncontrolled) and T5 and F7 (controlled). Conclusions: Diabetic patients without mild cognitive impairment show deficient intentional visuospatial learning which was worse in uncontrolled patients. Theta and gamma power increased in healthy participants during intentional learning principally in frontal areas. These EEG power changes were absent in diabetic patients. The reduced accuracy of diabetic patients in intentional visuospatial learning was associated with different EEG learning-related patterns.

However, limited information exists on the aftereffects of tACS on motor learning and neurophysiological profiles such as entrainment and neural plasticity in parallel. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effect of tACS on motor learning and neurophysiological profiles using an off-line tACS condition. Methods Thirty-three healthy participants were randomly assigned to 10 Hz, 20 Hz, or the sham group. Participants performed visuomotor learning tasks consisting of a baseline task (preadaptation task) and training task (adaptation task) to reach a target with a lever-type controller. Electroencephalography was recorded from eight locations during the learning tasks. tACS was performed between the preadaptation task and adaptation task over the left primary motor cortex for 10 min at 1 mA. Results As a result, 10 Hz tACS was shown to be effective for initial angular error correction in the visuomotor learning tasks. However, there were no significant differences in neural oscillatory activities among the three groups. Conclusion These results suggest that initial motor learning can be facilitated even when 10 Hz tACS is applied under off-line conditions. However, neurophysiological aftereffects were recently demonstrated to be induced by tACS at individual alpha frequencies rather than fixed alpha tACS, which suggests that the neurophysiological aftereffects by fixed frequency stimulation in the present study may have been insufficient to generate changes in oscillatory neural activity.

Learning the Law of Reflection: Event-Related Potentials of Children Aged 6-12 during Educational Video Game Play	MIND BRAIN AND EDUCATION			English	Article							MENTAL ROTATION; SPATIAL THINKING; PREMOTOR CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; PERFORMANCE; METAANALYSIS; INFORMATION; ATTENTION; BEHAVIOR; OBJECT	This exploratory study investigated behavioral and neural correlates of spatial reasoning in 21 children aged 6-12 years-old during educational video game play. Behavioral measures included child performance in learning the concept during the pretest, practice, and posttest portions of the game. Neural correlates using electroencephalography focused on event-related potentials, N2 and P3, and joint-time frequencies specifically alpha at three sites; F3, F4, and Pz. Results indicate that all of the participants exhibited naive conceptions regarding the optics concept, and children 8-12 were successful in learning through video game play. Analyses of correct versus incorrect trials uncovered several interaction effects at the left superior frontal sulcus (F3). Suppression of alpha waves at F3 coincided with correct responses on the posttest. We conclude that suppression of alpha at F3 is essential for spatial concept learning and suggest further research into the field of optical spatial reasoning and spatial learning limitations exhibited by young children.

Brainstem function, brain injury, and hemorrhage scores (increasing from 0 to 3) were assessed after striking the head against a concrete floor. Electroencephalograms (EEG) from a subset of 15 piglets were recorded before and after blunt force trauma for electrophysiological assessments. Blunt force trauma was performed by a single experienced farmer in a commercial farm by holding the piglet by its both hind legs and striking the head against the concrete floor. All piglets remained recumbent and did not show brainstem reflexes. Only one piglet did not presented tonic/clonic physical activity. The mean time to the onset of persistent isoelectric EEG was 64.3 +/- 7.3 s (range 18 to 115). Total power, theta, alpha, and beta power decreased to approximately 45%, 30%, 20%, and 15% from pretreatment power, respectively, by 15-s post-impact. There were no periods of normal-like EEG after the culling. Bruises in the neck and shoulder were found in 67% and 70% of piglets, respectively. All piglets presented skull fractures with 20% having the nasal bone(s) fractured. Brain damage was found in all piglets, mainly in the frontal lobe(s). The occipital lobe(s) presented the greatest frequency of severe damage. The analysis of the radiographs also found a high frequency of fractures in this region. Hemorrhage was most frequent in the frontal, parietal, occipital lobes, and midbrain. When performed correctly with the appropriate weight class, blunt force trauma can be used as an effective method for the on-farm killing of nursing piglets resulting in death. However, this method should not be promoted over more reliable and repeatable cull methods such as captive bolt gun. As with blunt force trauma, there is a significant potential for animal welfare harm associated with inappropriate practice, lack of accuracy, issues with repeatability, and operator fatigue.

Attention modulates the gating of primary somatosensory oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Attention; Somatosensation; Sensory gating; Neural oscillations	ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; RELEVANT MODULATION; BAND OSCILLATIONS; MEG; INHIBITION; CORTEX; P50; BETA; EEG; SUPPRESSION	Sensory gating (SG) is a well-studied phenomenon in which neural responses are reduced to identical stimuli presented in succession, and is thought to represent the functional inhibition of primary sensory information that is redundant in nature. SG is traditionally considered pre-attentive, but little is known about the effects of attentional state on this process. In this study, we investigate the impact of directed attention on somatosensory SG using magnetoencephalography. Healthy young adults (n = 26) performed a novel somato-visual paired-pulse oddball paradigm, in which attention was directed towards or away from paired-pulse stimulation of the left median nerve. We observed a robust evoked (i.e., phase-locked) somatosensory response in the time domain, and three stereotyped oscillatory responses in the time-frequency domain including an early theta response (4-8 Hz), and later alpha (8-14 Hz) and beta (20-26 Hz) responses across attentional states. The amplitudes of the evoked response and the theta and beta oscillations were gated for the second stimulus, however, only the gating of the oscillatory responses was altered by attention. Specifically, directing attention to the somatosensory domain enhanced SG of the early theta response, while reducing SG of the later alpha and beta responses. Further, prefrontal alpha-band coherence with the primary somatosensory cortex was greater when attention was directed towards the somatosensory domain, supporting a frontal modulatory effect on the alpha response in primary somatosensory regions. These findings highlight the dynamic effects of attentional modulation on somatosensory processing, and the importance of considering attentional state in studies of SG.

This study assesses the neurophysiological differences between children with ADHD and matched healthy controls during a face emotional recognition task. The study also explores how brain connectivity is affected by ADHD. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded from 64 scalp electrodes. Event-related phase coherence (ERPCOH) method was applied to pre-processed signals, and functional connectivity between any pair of electrodes was computed in different frequency bands. A logistic regression (LR) classifier with elastic net regularization (ENR) was trained to classify ADHD and HC participants using the functional connectivity of frequency bands as a potential biomarker. Subsequently, the brain network is constructed using graph-theoretic techniques, and graph indices such as clustering coefficient (C) and shortest path length (L) were calculated. Significant intra-hemispheric and the inter-hemispheric discrepancy between ADHD and healthy control (HC) groups in the beta band was observed. The graph features indicate that the clustering coefficient is significantly higher in the ADHD group than that in the HC group. At the same time, the shortest path length is significantly lower in the beta band. ADHD's brain networks have a problem in transferring information among various neural regions, which can cause a deficiency in the processing of facial emotions. The beta band seems better to reflect the differences between ADHD and HC. The observed functional connectivity and graph differences could also be helpful in ADHD investigations.

This concept has been derived predominantly from local measures of inhibition, while large-scale network mechanisms to guide information flow are largely unknown. Here, we investigated functional connectivity changes on a whole-brain level by concurrent transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and resting-state functional MRI in humans. We specifically focused on somatosensory alpha-band oscillations by adjusting the tACS frequency to each individual's somatosensory (mu-) alpha peak frequency (mu-tACS). Potential differences of Eigenvector Centrality of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) as well as on a whole brain level between mu-tACS and sham were analyzed. Our results demonstrate that mu-tACS induces a locally-specific decrease in whole-brain functional connectivity of left S1. An additional exploratory analysis revealed that this effect primarily depends on a decrease in functional connectivity between S1 and a network of regions that are crucially involved in somatosensory processing. Furthermore, the decrease in functional centrality was specific to mu-tACS and was not observed when tACS was applied in the gamma-range in an independent study. Our findings provide evidence that modulated somatosensory (mu-) alpha-activity may affect whole-brain network level activity by decoupling primary sensory areas from other hubs involved in sensory processing.

The main challenge is to identify the patient's motor intention based on large training datasets with noise contamination in the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. New method: To address this problem, this paper proposed a self-adaptively denoised Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD)-based motor intention recognition algorithm (DeERD) in order to enable BMI training with a small sample of calibration data. This study recruited 8 stroke patients. Each patient was required to execute paralyzed upper-limb motor attempt for 20 trials and remain in resting state for 20 trials randomly. ERD-based motor intention recognition algorithm, Common spatial filter algorithm (CSP) and Directed Transfer Function analysis (DTF) were used to extract features for classification respectively and compared with the proposed DeERD analysis. Results: DeERD can filter the noise and extract the average lines as the principal trends. With denoising processing, Accuracy (ACC) was up to 70% for all 8 patients and they could be included in this BMI system effectively. Comparison with existing methods: The proposed DeERD model generated statistically significant increase in True Positive Rate (TPR) and in ACC than the DTF model. TPR and ACC standard deviation of DeERD was smaller than that of CSP. Conclusions: The proposed DeERD model can eliminate the principal noise and extract the principal trend of the time-frequency analysis. It provides a practical method to recruit more stroke patients into BMI training with fewer calibration trainings.

However, across subjects emotional recognition has become an insurmountable gap which researchers cannot step across for a long time due to the poor generalizability of features across subjects. In response to this difficulty, in this study, the moving average(MA) technology is introduced to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles. Based on the MA technology, an effective method for cross-subject emotion recognition was then developed, which designed a method of salient region extraction based on attention mechanism, with the purpose of enhancing the capability of representations generated by a network by modelling the interdependencies between the channels of its informative features. The effectiveness of our method was validated on a dataset for emotion analysis using physiological signals (DEAP) and the MAHNOB-HCT multi modal tagging database. Compared with recent similar works, the method developed in this study for emotion recognition across all subjects was found to be effective, and its accuracy was 66.23% fir valence and 68.50% for arousal (DEAP) and 70.25% for valence and 73.27% for arousal (MAHNOB) on the Gamma frequency band. And benefiting from the strong representational learning capacity in the two-dimensional space, our method is efficient in emotion recognition especially on Beta and Gamma waves.

We previously showed in rats that hippocampal disinhibition by local microinfusion of the GABA-A receptor antagonist picrotoxin disrupted memory and attention and enhanced hippocampal multi-unit burst firing recorded around the infusion site under isoflurane anesthesia. Here, we analyzed the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) recorded alongside the multi-unit data. We predicted frequency-specific LFP changes, based on previous studies implicating GABA in hippocampal oscillations, with the weight of evidence suggesting that disinhibition would facilitate theta and disrupt gamma oscillations. Using a new semi-automated method based on the kurtosis of the LFP peak-amplitude distribution as well as on amplitude envelope thresholding, we separated three distinct hippocampal LFP states under isoflurane anesthesia: "burst" and "suppression" states-high-amplitude LFP spike bursts and the interspersed low-amplitudeperiods-and a medium-amplitude "continuous" state. The burst state showed greater overall power than suppression and continuous states and higher relative delta/theta power, but lower relative beta/gamma power. The burst state also showed reduced functional connectivity across the hippocampal recording area, especially around theta and beta frequencies. Overall neuronal firing was higher in the burst than the other two states, whereas the proportion of burst firing was higher in burst and continuous states than the suppression state. Disinhibition caused state- and frequency-dependent LFP changes, tending to increase power at lower frequencies (<20 Hz), but to decrease power and connectivity at higher frequencies (>20 Hz) in burst and suppression states. The disinhibition-induced enhancement of multi-unit bursting was also state-dependent, tending to be more pronounced in burst and suppression states than the continuous state. Overall, we characterized three distinct hippocampal LFP states in isoflurane-anesthetized rats. Disinhibition changed hippocampal LFP oscillations in a state- and frequency-dependent way. Moreover, the disinhibition-induced enhancement of multi-unit bursting was also LFP state-dependent.

However, a specific modulation of other distinct physiological or pathological oscillatory activities could also play an important role in symptom control and motor function recovery during deep brain stimulation. Finely tuned gamma oscillations have been suggested to be prokinetic in nature, facilitating the preferential processing of physiological neural activity. In this study, we postulate that clinically effective high-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus imposes cross-frequency interactions with gamma oscillations in a cortico-subcortical network of interconnected regions and normalizes the balance between beta and gamma oscillations. To this end we acquired resting state high-density (256 channels) EEG from 31 patients with Parkinson's disease who underwent deep brain stimulation to compare spectral power and power-to-power cross-frequency coupling using a beamformer algorithm for coherent sources. To show that modulations exclusively relate to stimulation frequencies that alleviate motor symptoms, two clinically ineffective frequencies were tested as control conditions. We observed a robust reduction of beta and increase of gamma power, attested in the regions of a cortical (motor cortex, supplementary motor area, premotor cortex) and subcortical network (subthalamic nucleus and cerebellum). Additionally, we found a clear cross-frequency coupling of narrowband gamma frequencies to the stimulation frequency in all of these nodes, which negatively correlated with motor impairment. No such dynamics were revealed within the control posterior parietal cortex region. Furthermore, deep brain stimulation at clinically ineffective frequencies did not alter the source power spectra or cross-frequency coupling in any region. These findings demonstrate that clinically effective deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus differentially modifies different oscillatory activities in a widespread network of cortical and subcortical regions. Particularly the cross-frequency interactions between finely tuned gamma oscillations and the stimulation frequency may suggest an entrainment mechanism that could promote dynamic neural processing underlying motor symptom alleviation.

However, results from previous studies are inconsistent and occasionally contradictory. This inconsistency may be attributed to methodological and individual differences during experiments. This study therefore investigated two hypotheses: (1) A multichannel-optimized montage was expected to be more effective than a classical bipolar montage, because of increased focality. (2) The subjects were expected to benefit differently from the stimulation depending on their initial task performance. In a sham-controlled crossover study, 24 healthy participants received bipolar, multichannel, and sham stimulation for 20 min in randomized order, targeting the lDLPFC while performing a 2-back WM task. After stimulation, electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded at rest and during 2-back and nontarget continuous performance task (CPT) performance. Bipolar and multichannel stimulations were both well tolerated and effectively blinded. We found no effect of stimulation on behavioral performance or neuronal oscillations comparing the classical bipolar or multichannel montage with sham stimulation. We did, however, find an interaction between stimulation and initial task performance. For multichannel stimulation, initially low-performing participants tended to improve their WM performance while initially high-performing participants tended to worsen their performance compared to sham stimulation. Both tDCS montages induced changes in neural oscillatory power, which correlated with baseline performance. The worse the participants' initial WM performance was, the more task-related theta power was induced by multichannel and bipolar stimulation. The same effect was observed for alpha power in the nontarget task following multichannel stimulation. Notably, we were not able to show a superiority of multichannel stimulation compared to bipolar stimulation. Still, comparing both montages with sham stimulation, multichannel stimulation led to stronger effects than bipolar stimulation. The current study highlights the importance of investigating different parameters with potential influence on tDCS effects in combination. Our results demonstrate how individual differences in cognitive performance and electrode montages influence effects of tDCS on neuropsychological performance. These findings support the idea of an individualized and optimized stimulation setting, potentially leading to increased tDCS effects.

In this context, the employment of artificial intelligence methods could be the missing piece to achieve this goal. This work proposed a double-step procedure based on machine learning algorithms and tested it on an intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) dataset available online. The first step aimed to define the optimal length for signal segmentation, allowing for an optimal discrimination of segments with HFO relative to those without. In this case, binary classifiers have been tested on a set of energy features. The second step aimed to classify these segments into ripples, fast ripples and fast ripples occurring during ripples. Results suggest that LDA applied to 10 ms segmentation could provide the highest sensitivity (0.874) and 0.776 specificity for the discrimination of HFOs from no-HFO segments. Regarding the three-class classification, non-linear methods provided the highest values (around 90%) in terms of specificity and sensitivity, significantly different to the other three employed algorithms. Therefore, this machine-learning-based procedure could help clinicians to automatically reduce the quantity of irrelevant data.

One interaction that is gaining importance during cognitive brain functions is phase amplitude coupling (PAC), where the phase of a slow oscillation modulates the amplitude of a fast oscillation. Current techniques for calculating PAC provide a numerical index that represents an average value across a pre-determined time window. However, there is growing empirical evidence that PAC is dynamic, varying across time. Current approaches to quantify time-varying PAC relies on computing PAC over sliding short time windows. This approach suffers from the arbitrary selection of the window length and does not adapt to the signal dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven approach to quantify dynamic PAC. The proposed approach relies on decomposing the signal using matching pursuit (MP) to extract time and frequency localized atoms that best describe the given signal. These atoms are then used to compute PAC across time and frequency. As the atoms are time and frequency localized, we only compute PAC across time and frequency regions determined by the selected atoms rather than the whole time-frequency range. The proposed approach is evaluated on both simulated and real electroencephalogram (EEG) signals.	[Munia, Tamanna T.

Low Frontal Alpha Power Is Associated With the Propensity for Burst Suppression: An Electroencephalogram Phenotype for a "Vulnerable Brain"	ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA			English	Article							AEROBIC GLYCOLYSIS; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; PROPOFOL; ASTROCYTES; DELIRIUM; SEVOFLURANE; SURGERY; MODEL	BACKGROUND: A number of recent studies have reported an association between intraoperative burst suppression and postoperative delirium. These studies suggest that anesthesia-induced burst suppression may be an indicator of underlying brain vulnerability. A prominent feature of electroencephalogram (EEG) under propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia is the frontal alpha oscillation. This frontal alpha oscillation is known to decline significantly during aging and is generated by prefrontal brain regions that are particularly prone to age-related neurodegeneration. Given that burst suppression and frontal alpha oscillations are both associated with brain vulnerability, we hypothesized that anesthesia-induced frontal alpha power could also be associated with burst suppression. METHODS: We analyzed EEG data from a previously reported cohort in which 155 patients received propofol (n = 60) or sevoflurane (n = 95) as the primary anesthetic. We computed the EEG spectrum during stable anesthetic maintenance and identified whether or not burst suppression occurred during the anesthetic. We characterized the relationship between burst suppression and alpha power using logistic regression. We proposed 5 different models consisting of different combinations of potential contributing factors associated with burst suppression: (1) a Base Model consisting of alpha power; (2) an Extended Mechanistic Model consisting of alpha power, age, and drug dosing information; (3) a Clinical Confounding Factors Model consisting of alpha power, hypotension, and other confounds; (4) a Simplified Model consisting only of alpha power and propofol bolus administration; and (5) a Full Model consisting of all of these variables to control for as much confounding as possible. RESULTS: All models show a consistent significant association between alpha power and burst suppression while adjusting for different sets of covariates, all with consistent effect size estimates. Using the Simplified Model, we found that for each decibel decrease in alpha power, the odds of experiencing burst suppression increased by 1.33-fold. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we show how a decrease in anesthesia-induced frontal alpha power is associated with an increased propensity for burst suppression, in a manner that captures individualized information above and beyond a patient's chronological age. Lower frontal alpha band power is strongly associated with higher propensity for burst suppression and, therefore, potentially higher risk of postoperative neurocognitive disorders. We hypothesize that low frontal alpha power and increased propensity for burst suppression together characterize a "vulnerable brain" phenotype under anesthesia that could be mechanistically linked to brain metabolism, cognition, and brain aging.

While older adults showed lower memory performance than young adults, we found subsequent memory effects (SME) in alpha/beta and theta frequency bands in both age groups. Using logistic mixed effects models, we investigated whether interindividual differences in structural integrity of key memory regions could account for interindividual differences in the strength of the SME. Structural integrity of inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and hippocampus was reduced in older adults. SME in the alpha/beta band were modulated by the cortical thickness of IFG, in line with its hypothesized role for deep semantic elaboration. Importantly, this structure-function relationship did not differ by age group. However, older adults were more frequently represented among the participants with low cortical thickness and consequently weaker SME in the alpha band. Thus, our results suggest that differences in the structural integrity of the IFG contribute not only to interindividual, but also to age differences in memory formation.

Despite the fundamental role of touch in infancy, the existence of similar visuo-tactile mirroring processes, supporting both felt and seen touch, still needs an in-depth empirical investigation. To this aim, we explored 8-month-olds mu desynchronization over somatosensory sites in response to felt and observed touch in a live experimental setting. EEG desynchronization (6-8 Hz mu frequency range) was measured during three experimental conditions: i) infants were stroked on their right hand by a parent (Touch condition); ii) infants observed a right hand being stroked (Observation Touch condition); iii) infants observed a right hand moving over the left hand without making contact (Action Control condition). Mu desynchronization of somatosensory sites contralateral to the hand being stroked emerged in response to both Touch and Observation Touch conditions, but not in the Action control condition. Further, greater mu desynchronization was found in the Touch and Observation Touch conditions as compared to the Action control condition. Our results highlight the early involvement of a shared somatosensory system, likely supporting infants' understanding of others' tactile sensations.

Beta oscillations following performance feedback predict subsequent recall of task-relevant information	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; COMPUTATIONAL MODEL; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; FRONTAL THETA; REWARD; DOPAMINE; DYNAMICS; PARIETAL; RHYTHMS	Reward delivery in reinforcement learning tasks elicits increased beta power in the human EEG over frontal areas of the scalp but it is unclear whether these 20-30 Hz oscillations directly facilitate reward learning. We previously proposed that frontal beta is not specific to reward processing but rather reflects the role of prefrontal cortex in maintaining and transferring task-related information to other brain areas. To test this proposal, we had subjects perform a reinforcement learning task followed by a memory recall task in which subjects were asked to recall stimuli associated either with reward feedback (Reward Recall condition) or error feedback (Error Recall condition). We trained a classifier on post-feedback beta power in the Reward Recall condition to discriminate trials associated with reward feedback from those associated with error feedback and then tested the classifier on post-feedback beta power in the Error Recall condition. Crucially, the model classified error-related beta in the Error Recall condition as reward-related. The model also predicted stimulus recall from post-feedback beta power irrespective of feedback valence and task condition. These results indicate that post-feedback beta power is not specific to reward processing but rather reflects a more general task-related process.

Neural Mechanisms of Attentional Control for Objects: Decoding EEG Alpha When Anticipating Faces, Scenes, and Tools	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; attention; decoding; EEG; objects; vision	TOP-DOWN MODULATION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; VISUAL-CORTEX; AREA; SYNCHRONIZATION; FLUCTUATIONS; OSCILLATIONS; RECOGNITION; POTENTIALS	Attentional selection mechanisms in visual cortex involve changes in oscillatory activity in the EEG alpha band (8-12 Hz), with decreased alpha indicating focal cortical enhancement and increased alpha indicating suppression. This has been observed for spatial selective attention and attention to stimulus features such as color versus motion. We investigated whether attention to objects involves similar alpha-mediated changes in focal cortical excitability. In experiment 1, 20 volunteers (8 males; 12 females) were cued (80% predictive) on a trial-by-trial basis to different objects (faces, scenes, or tools). Support vector machine decoding of alpha power patterns revealed that late (>500 ms latency) in the cue-to-target foreperiod, only EEG alpha differed with the to-be-attended object category. In experiment 2, to eliminate the possibility that decoding of the physical features of cues led to our results, 25 participants (9 males; 16 females) performed a similar task where cues were nonpredictive of the object category. Alpha decoding was now only significant in the early (<200 ms) foreperiod. In experiment 3, to eliminate the possibility that task set differences between the different object categories led to our experiment 1 results, 12 participants (5 males; 7 females) performed a predictive cuing task where the discrimination task for different objects was identical across object categories. The results replicated experiment 1. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that the neural mechanisms of visual selective attention involve focal cortical changes in alpha power not only for simple spatial and feature attention, but also for high-level object attention in humans.

Methods In this prospective cohort study including 600 patients, AD during stable anesthesia was assessed by clinical judgement of the attending, EEG-blinded anesthesiologist (using a scale staging the AD as mid-adequate, adequate but fairly deep, or adequate but fairly light) and by simultaneously recorded Narcotrend measurements. Results In 42% of patients (n = 250), the anesthesiologist's clinical judgement was in agreement with anesthetic levels as measured by the Narcotrend monitor. In 46% of patients (n = 274), the anesthesiologist's judgement and the Narcotrend monitor differed by one AD level (minor discordance). Major discordance was observed in 76 (13%) measurements (judged deeper than measured, n = 29 [5%]; judged lighter than measured, n = 47 [8%]). In 7% of patients (n = 44), the Narcotrend index was outside the limits of adequate AD (too deep, n = 28 [5%]; too superficial, n = 16 [3%]). The overall level of agreement between the anesthesiologist's judgement and the Narcotrend monitor was not statistically significant (Cohen's kappa, -0.039; P = 0.17). Using a random forests algorithm, age, mean blood pressure, the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, body mass index, and frailty were the variables with the highest relative feature importance to predict the level of agreement. Conclusion These results suggest that clinical judgement of AD during stable anesthesia was not in agreement with EEG-based assessment of anesthetic depth in 58% of cases. Nevertheless, this finding could be influenced by the lack of validated scales to clinically judge AD.

J	Chen, YR; Farivar, R				Chen, Yiran; Farivar, Reza			Natural scene representations in the gamma band are prototypical across subjects	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							BRAIN ACTIVITY; EEG; RESPONSES; MEG; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; SIMILARITY; PATTERNS; IMAGES; CORTEX	Prototypical brain responses describe similarity in neural representations between subjects in response to a natural stimulus. During natural movie viewing, for example, inter-subject correlation (ISC) measured by fMRI is high in visual areas (Hasson et al., 2004). But the electrophysiological basis for this fMRI ISC has been controversial. Previous reports have only found ISC in low frequency bands-below 12 Hz (Chang et al., 2015). These findings stand in contrast to reports that gamma band oscillations-30 to 90 Hz-are highly stimulus-driven in visual cortex (Perry et al., 2015). To resolve this discrepancy, we carried out both ISC estimation and a novel inter-subject representational correlation analysis across six frequency bands extracted from MEG data of 24 subjects who each viewed four 5-min clips of an underwater documentary. Region-of-interest-based and vertex-based temporal ISC estimates confirmed that low-frequency bands are significantly synchronized in visual areas and that gamma band has low temporal correlation. We also found the representational geometry of movie scenes were related to structural statistics from the stimuli. Crucially, our results show that the gamma band oscillations also reflect prototypical brain response in scene representations formed in response to naturalistic stimuli as revealed by inter-subject representational correlation.

In this study, ictal stereo-electroencephalography data from 35 patients with refractory focal epilepsy were analyzed. Effective networks based on partial directed coherence were analyzed, and a gray level co-occurrence matrix was applied to extract the time-varying features of the indegree. These features, combined with the single-channel signal time-frequency features, including approximate entropy and line length, were used to localize the EZ based on a cluster algorithm. For all seizure-free patients (n = 23), the proposed method was effective in identifying the clinical-EZ-contacts and clinical-EZ-blocks, with an Fl-score of 62.47 % and 72.18 %, respectively. The sensitivity was 96.00 % for the clinical-EZ-block identification, which provided the information for the decision-making of clinicians, prompting clinicians to focus on the identified EZ-blocks and their nearby contacts. The agreement between the EZ identified by the proposed method and the clinical-EZ was worse for non-seizure-free patients (n = 12) than for seizure-free patients. Furthermore, our method provided better results than using only brain network or single-channel signal features. This suggests that combining these complementary features can facilitate more accurate localization of the EZ.

The present study aims to investigate whether the unsupervised training on action video games contributes to the visuomotor adaptation of working memory or not, considering neural measures. Twenty-seven-Channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from 35 participants are recorded while performing Corsi block-tapping task (CBTT), a working memory task incorporating recall of visual and sequential-spatial information, and are analyzed employing wavelet transform-based feature extraction techniques. For removing artifacts, we have used the wavelet denoising method. Different mother wavelet functions, with different thresholding algorithms, are compared. The dmeyer mother wavelet function along with Rigorous SURE soft thresholding emerged as the best combination for denoising. Comparison of wavelet energy features has revealed improved rhythmic activity in AVGPs. Also, two measures of engagement index beta/(alpha + theta) and beta/alpha are computed which has provided good classification accuracies with ANFIS classifier. Higher engagement indexes are found in the frontal, right parietal and occipital cortex of AVGPs. These results evidence the neurocortical modulation among the players that may attribute to the effective cognitive processes in AVGPs related to the task.

Dynamic network properties of the interictal brain determine whether seizures appear focal or generalised	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ILAE COMMISSION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; POSITION PAPER; EPILEPSY; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; MISDIAGNOSIS; OSCILLATIONS; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS	Current explanatory concepts suggest seizures emerge from ongoing dynamics of brain networks. It is unclear how brain network properties determine focal or generalised seizure onset, or how network properties can be described in a clinically-useful manner. Understanding network properties would cast light on seizure-generating mechanisms and allow to quantify to which extent a seizure is focal or generalised. Functional brain networks were estimated in segments of scalp-EEG without interictal discharges (68 people with epilepsy, 38 controls). Simplified brain dynamics were simulated using a computer model. We introduce: Critical Coupling (C-c), the ability of a network to generate seizures; Onset Index (OI), the tendency of a region to generate seizures; and Participation Index (PI), the tendency of a region to become involved in seizures. C-c was lower in both patient groups compared with controls. OI and PI were more variable in focal-onset than generalised-onset cases. In focal cases, the regions with highest OI and PI corresponded to the side of seizure onset. Properties of interictal functional networks from scalp EEG can be estimated using a computer model and used to predict seizure likelihood and onset patterns. This may offer potential to enhance diagnosis through quantification of seizure type using inter-ictal recordings.

Cognitive remediation is a promising treatment for neurocognitive dysfunction in depression. However, treatment studies have shown that those with depression often do not apply their cognitive gains to everyday life. Features of depression may account for mixed outcomes, including avoidance and negative perceptions of abilities. The present investigation examined how individuals with depression engage with a novel cognitive task created to resemble exercises used in cognitive remediation. Methods Twenty-eight individuals with depression and 24 healthy comparison (HC) participants completed a computerized cognitive task while EEG was recorded. Participants were asked to indicate how they would like to adjust task difficulty and how many of the trials they believed they got correct. Results Participants with depression did not significantly differ from HC on objective performance accuracy. However, participants with depression opted to decrease their difficulty level significantly more than HC on high challenge levels. Additionally, individuals with depression had significantly greater EEG alpha power on high challenge levels than low challenge levels, suggesting increased disengagement from the task on more challenging levels. Conclusions Avoidance of cognitive challenges in depression has implications for understanding mechanisms related to cognitive performance and efforts to modify cognitive impairment.

Phase-dependent amplification of working memory content and performance	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							THETA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; FRONTAL THETA; GAMMA-POWER; ALPHA; REPRESENTATIONS; EXCITABILITY; MECHANISM; OBJECTS	Successful working memory performance has been related to oscillatory mechanisms operating in low-frequency ranges. Yet, their mechanistic interaction with the distributed neural activity patterns representing the content of the memorized information remains unclear. Here, we record EEG during a working memory retention interval, while a task-irrelevant, high-intensity visual impulse stimulus is presented to boost the read-out of distributed neural activity related to the content held in working memory. Decoding of this activity with a linear classifier reveals significant modulations of classification accuracy by oscillatory phase in the theta/alpha ranges at the moment of impulse presentation. Additionally, behavioral accuracy is highest at the phases showing maximized decoding accuracy. At those phases, behavioral accuracy is higher in trials with the impulse compared to no-impulse trials. This constitutes the first evidence in humans that working memory information is maximized within limited phase ranges, and that phase-selective, sensory impulse stimulation can improve working memory. Neuronal patterns during working memory show low-frequency oscillatory activity. Here, the authors demonstrate a rhythmic retention of working memory information in theta and alpha frequency ranges. Moreover, phase-locked amplification of the retained information improves working memory performance.

We sought to better define these changes using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and source space connectivity analysis for optimal neurophysiological and anatomical localisation. Methods: We consecutively recruited 26 patients with JME who underwent resting state MEG recording, along with 26 age-and-sex matched controls. Whole brain connectivity was determined through correlation of Automated Anatomical Labelling (AAL) atlas source space MEG timeseries in conventional frequency bands of interest delta (1- 4 Hz), theta (4 - 8 Hz), alpha (8 -13 Hz), beta (13 - 30 Hz) and gamma (40 - 60 Hz). We used a Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV) beamformer to extract voxel wise time series of 'virtual sensors' for the desired frequency bands, followed by connectivity analysis using correlation between frequency-and node-specific power fluctuations, for the voxel maxima in each AAL atlas label, correcting for noise, potentially spurious connections and multiple comparisons. Results: We found increased connectivity in the theta band in posterior brain regions, surviving statistical correction for multiple comparisons (corrected p < 0.05), and decreased connectivity in the beta band in sensorimotor cortex, between right pre- and post- central gyrus (p < 0.05) in JME compared to controls. Conclusions: Altered resting-state MEG connectivity in JME comprised increased connectivity in posterior theta - the frequency band associated with long range connections affecting attention and arousal - and decreased beta-band sensorimotor connectivity. These findings likely relate to altered regulation of the sensorimotor network and seizure prone states in JME.

Thus, there is strong value in methods that provide a temporally resolved index of WM load. While univariate EEG signals have been identified that vary with WM load, recent advances in multivariate analytic approaches suggest that there may be rich sources of information that do not generate reliable univariate signatures. Here, using data from four published studies (n = 286 and >250,000 trials), we demonstrate that multivariate analysis of EEG voltage topography provides a sensitive index of the number of items stored in WM that generalizes to novel human observers. Moreover, multivariate load detection ("mvLoad") can provide robust information at the single-trial level, exceeding the sensitivity of extant univariate approaches. We show that this method tracks WM load in a manner that is (1) independent of the spatial position of the memoranda, (2) precise enough to differentiate item-by-item increments in the number of stored items, (3) generalizable across distinct tasks and stimulus displays, and (4) correlated with individual differences in WM behavior. Thus, this approach provides a powerful complement to univariate analytic approaches, enabling temporally resolved tracking of online memory storage in humans.	[Adam, Kirsten C.

Previous studies have aimed to extract the causal relations between brain regions, but the validity of the derived connectivity has not yet been fully determined. This is because it is generally difficult to identify causality in the usual experimental framework based on observations alone. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a framework in which a controllable perturbation is applied to a local brain region and the effect is examined by comparing the neural activity with and without this stimulation. This study evaluates two methods for effective connectivity analysis, symbolic transfer entropy (STE) and vector autoregression (VAR), by applying them to TMS-EEG data. In terms of the consistency of results from different experimental sessions, STE is found to yield robust results irrespective of sessions, whereas VAR produces less correlation between sessions. Furthermore, STE preferentially detects the directional information flow from the TMS target. Taken together, our results suggest that STE is a reliable method for detecting the effect of TMS, implying that it would also be useful for identifying neural activity during cognitive tasks and resting states.

Since strict synchronization is only possible for harmonic frequencies, a recent theory proposes that the interaction between different brain rhythms is facilitated by transient harmonic frequency arrangements. In this line, it has been recently shown that the transient occurrence of 2:1 harmonic cross-frequency relationships between alpha and theta rhythms (i.e. f(alpha)approximate to 12Hz; f(theta)approximate to 6Hz) is enhanced during effortful cognition. In this study, we tested whether achieving a state of 'mental emptiness' during meditation is accompanied by a relative decrease in the occurrence of 2:1 harmonic cross-frequency relationships between alpha and theta rhythms. Continuous EEG recordings (19 electrodes) were obtained from 43 highly experienced meditators during meditation practice, rest and an arithmetic task. We show that the occurrence of transient alpha:theta 2:1 harmonic relationships increased linearly from a meditative to an active cognitive processing state (i.e. meditation<rest<arithmetic task). It is argued that transient EEG cross-frequency arrangements that prevent alpha:theta cross-frequency coupling could facilitate the experience of 'mental emptiness' by avoiding the interaction between the memory and executive components of cognition.

The effects of cognitive distraction on behavioural, oculomotor and electrophysiological metrics during a driving hazard perception task	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Hazard perception; Distraction; Eye movements; Eye fixation related potentials	FIXATION-RELATED POTENTIALS; EYE-MOVEMENTS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; SLEEP-DEPRIVATION; SACCADIC VELOCITY; MEMORY; DRIVER; EEG; ACTIVATION	Previous research has demonstrated that the distraction caused by holding a mobile telephone conversation is not limited to the period of the actual conversation (Haigney, 1995; Redelmeier & Tibshirani, 1997; Savage a al., 2013). In a prior study we identified potential eye movement and EEG markers of cognitive distraction during driving hazard perception. However the extent to which these markers are affected by the demands of the hazard perception task are unclear. Therefore in the current study we assessed the effects of secondary cognitive task demand on eye movement and EEG metrics separately for periods prior to, during and after the hazard was visible. We found that when no hazard was present (prior and post hazard windows), distraction resulted in changes to various elements of saccadic eye movements. However, when the target was present, distraction did not affect eye movements. We have previously found evidence that distraction resulted in an overall decrease in theta band output at occipital sites of the brain. This was interpreted as evidence that distraction results in a reduction in visual processing. The current study confirmed this by examining the effects of distraction on the lambda response component of subjects eye fixation related potentials (EFRPs). Furthermore, we demonstrated that although detections of hazards were not affected by distraction, both eye movement and EEG metrics prior to the onset of the hazard were sensitive to changes in cognitive workload. This suggests that changes to specific aspects of the saccadic eye movement system could act as unobtrusive markers of distraction even prior to a breakdown in driving performance.

Previous research on ISC reported anecdotal evidence of larger ISC during emotional scenes compared to neutral ones, but this effect has not been systematically investigated using standardized emotional movies. Moreover, the complex interplay between neuronal populations oscillating at different timescales was mainly studied through fMRI, thus with limited temporal resolution. This study aimed at showing how emotional movies synchronize brain activity in the main frequency bands characterizing cortical activity. Thirty-nine participants watched 18 movie clips selected from a standardized database of emotional movies (E-MOVIE) while their EEG activity was recorded. Spectrally resolved ISC was computed based on the coherence of homologous channels for each possible subject pair in the Delta, Alpha, and Gamma bands. Permutation-based statistics revealed that all emotional categories prompted larger ISC compared to the Neutral in each band. Moreover, high arousal erotic and fearful scenes prompted larger Delta-ISC and Gamma-ISC compared to the other categories. Finally, ISC topography followed a spatial gradient. At slower frequencies, ISC involved wider regions of the scalp, becoming more restricted to occipito-parietal regions at higher frequencies. Taken together, these results show that emotions trigger brain synchronization between individuals at multiple spatial and spectral scales. Different emotional states are reflected in specific topographical patterns of ISC in different frequency bands.

Currently, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), are proposed as tools able to modulate cognitive functions in brain aging, acting on networks properties and connectivity. Segregation and integration measures are used and evaluated by means of local clustering (segregation) and path length (integration). Moreover, to assess the balancing between them, the Small World (SW) parameter is employed, evaluating functional coupling in normal brain aging and in pathological conditions including neurodegeneration. The aim of this study was to systematically investigate the tDCS-induced effects on brain network proprieties in physiological aging. In order to reach this aim, cortical activity was acquired from healthy young and elderly subjects by means of EEG recorded before, during, and after anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS sessions. Specifically, the aim to exploring tDCS polarity-dependent changes in the age-dependent network dynamics was based on a network graph theory application on two groups divided in young and elderly subjects. Eighteen healthy young (9 females; mean age = 24.7, SD = 3.2) and fifteen elderly subjects (9 females; mean = 70.1, SD = 5.1) were enrolled. Each participant received anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS over the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) in three separate experimental sessions performed 1 week apart. SW was computed to evaluate brain network organization. The present study demonstrates that tDCS delivered in PFC can change brain network dynamics, and tDCS-EEG coregistration data can be analyzed using graph theory to understand the induced effects of different tDCS polarities in physiological and pathological brain aging.

EEG alpha reactivity, which refers to the reduction in alpha power over occipital electrodes upon opening the eyes, has been suggested as a potential marker of cholinergic system integrity. Methods Eyes-open and eyes-closed resting state EEG data were recorded from 41 LBD patients (including 24 patients with DLB and 17 with PDD), 21 patients with AD, and 40 age-matched healthy controls. Alpha reactivity was calculated as the relative reduction in alpha power over occipital electrodes when opening the eyes. Structural MRI data were used to assess volumetric changes within the NBM using a probabilistic anatomical map. Results Alpha reactivity was reduced in AD and LBD patients compared to controls with a significantly greater reduction in LBD compared to AD. Reduced alpha reactivity was associated with smaller volumes of the NBM across all groups (rho = 0.42, p(FDR) = 0.0001) and in the PDD group specifically (rho = 0.66, p(FDR) = 0.01). Conclusions We demonstrate that LBD patients show an impairment in alpha reactivity upon opening the eyes which distinguishes this form of dementia from AD. Furthermore, our results suggest that reduced alpha reactivity might be related to a loss of cholinergic drive from the NBM, specifically in PDD.

Perceived pleasantness of gentle touch in healthy individuals is related to salivary oxytocin response and EEG markers of arousal	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Affective touch; C-tactile afferents; EEG; Alpha rhythm; Salivary oxytocin; Pleasure	ALPHA PEAK FREQUENCY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; TACTILE AFFERENTS; PLASMA; RELEASE; SUPPORT; STATE; SYNCHRONIZATION; ASSOCIATIONS; STIMULATION	Affective touch plays an important role in human social bonding, affiliative behavior, and in general emotional well-being. A system of unmyelinated low-threshold mechanosensitive C-type afferents innervating hairy skin (C-tactile or CT system) is postulated to provide the neurophysiological background of affective touch perception. C-tactile afferents respond optimally to soft and slow strokes, and this response correlates positively with pleasure ratings of tactile stimuli. As gentle touch is consistently associated with oxytocin release further promoting prosocial behavior, it has been suggested that this effect is mediated by the response of C-tactile afferents. This study assesses a possible link between CT-optimal touch, its subjective pleasantness, EEG indices of cortical arousal, and peripheral oxytocin response. EEG was recorded in 28 healthy volunteers during resting state and tactile stimulation[gentle slow brush strokes on forearm (CT-targeted touch) and palm (non-CT-targeted touch)]. Saliva samples were collected before and after the touch stimulation. Oxytocin concentration increase was significantly associated with greater subjective ratings of CT-targeted touch but not of non-CT-targeted touch, and with lower peak alpha frequency values indicating decreased cortical arousal. The findings suggest that CT-targeted stimulation triggers oxytocin release but only when the touch is perceived at an individual level as having clearly positive affective salience. This corresponds to previous studies reporting that oxytocin response to touch can be related to different personality factors, and bears important implications for planning touch-based interventions in social and medical care.

The 360 degrees rotating stimuli of frequencies 3 Hz, 7.5 Hz and 10 Hz are considered and compared to the performance with non -rotating flickering stimuli using signal-to-noise ratio at four channels O-z, P-z, O-1 and O-2. In addition, the authors have also attempted to study the effect of stimuli in varying combinations of four channels in discriminating stimuli frequencies. This paper investigated the discrimination of stimuli frequencies using power spectral density analysis (PSDA) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) with information transfer rate (ITR). The results revealed the maximum average classification accuracy of 87.6 % is achieved from the single channel O-z, for clockwise rotating slow (CS) stimuli using CCA. The maximum average accuracy of 90.6 % is achieved from the channel combinations O-z, P-z, and O-1 for CS rotating stimulus from CCA. It is noticed that, counter clockwise fast rotating stimulus is poor performing in single channel performance analysis. However, counter clockwise fast rotating stimulus has shown maximum average accuracy of 90 % considering all four channels with CCA. The maximum average ITR of 58.5 bit/min is achieved using signals of CS stimuli from the O-z channel and 65.1 bit/min is achieved with multichannel combination of O-z, P-z, O-1 for clockwise slow rotating stimuli. The results indicate an enhancement in performance of SSVEP based BCI with clockwise rotating stimuli and may be considered for communication and or control applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

As reviewed here, resting-state MEG exams are of interest as well as MEG paradigms that assess neural function across domains (e.g., auditory, resting state). To date, MEG research has primarily focused on group-level differences. Research is needed to explore whether MEG measures can predict, at the individual level, ASD diagnosis, prognosis (future severity), and response to therapy.	[Green, Heather L.; Edgar, J.

We employ the mathematical framework of graph signal processing in order to derive the Fourier modes of the brain structural connectivity graph, or "network harmonics". These network harmonics are naturally ordered by smoothness. Smoothness in this context can be understood as the amount of variation along the cortex, leading to a multi-scale representation of brain connectivity. We demonstrate that network harmonics provide a sparse representation of the EEG signal, where, at certain times, the smoothest 15 network harmonics capture 90% of the signal power. This suggests that network harmonics are functionally meaningful, which we demonstrate by using them as a basis for the functional EEG data recorded from a face detection task. There, only 13 network harmonics are sufficient to track the large-scale cortical activity during the processing of the stimuli with a 50 ms resolution, reproducing well-known activity in the fusiform face area as well as revealing co-activation patterns in somatosensory/motor and frontal cortices that an unconstrained ROI-by-ROI analysis fails to capture. The proposed approach is simple and fast, provides a means of integration of multimodal datasets, and is tied to a theoretical framework in mathematics and physics. Thus, network harmonics point towards promising research directions both theoretically - for example in exploring the relationship between structure and function in the brain - and practically - for example for network tracking in different tasks and groups of individuals, such as patients.

In nocturnal animals, acute light exposure can induce sleep, and acute dark can increase wakefulness. This study aims to investigate the effect of acute continuous nocturnal light exposure (ACNLE) on burst-suppression patterns under sevoflurane anesthesia using electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring in mice. We set the initial sevoflurane dose to 2.0% and increased it by 0.5% every 20 min until it reached 4.0%. Burst-suppression ratio (BSR), EEG power and quantitative burst analysis were used to assess the effects of ACNLE on burst suppression patterns under sevoflurane anesthesia. Blood serum corticosterone measurement and c-Fos immunofluorescent staining of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) were used to demonstrate the biological consequence induced by ACNLE. Compared to darkness, ACNLE caused significant changes in EEG power and de- crease of BSR at 2.5%, 3.0% and 3.5% sevoflurane. ACNLE was also associated with an increase in burst duration and burst frequency as well as a decrease in burst maximum peak-to-peak amplitude and burst power in the beta (15-25 Hz) and gamma (25-80 Hz) bands. ACNLE increased the concentration of serum corticosterone and the expression of c-Fos in the SCN, while not changed c-Fos expression in the VLPO. These results demonstrated that ACNLE influences the BSR under sevoflurane anesthesia, possibly by activating light-sensitive nonvisual pathways including SCN and increasing of peripheral serum corticosterone levels.

Over the past 40 years, many BCI applications have been developed in a variety of domains, from entertainment to medical field and even to computer security mechanisms. Until now, the development of BCI systems has focused on improving their accuracy, functionality, and ease of use, and not enough effort and attention has been invested in securing these systems and the sensitive data they acquire. In this article, we present the principles of brain activity data acquisition, with a special focus on EEG, and we present a taxonomy of BCI applications and domains. We also provide a comprehensive survey that covers eight possible attacks aimed at BCI systems. For each BCI application, we created an ecosystem and data and attack flow-diagram, which comprehensively describes the roles and interactions of the players associated with the BCI application and presents the most vulnerable vectors and components within its ecosystem; we identified gaps between existing security solutions and the presented attacks and vulnerabilities. Finally, we provide several concrete suggestions for improving the security of BCI systems in cyber-space.

The link between resting state theta activity and its relevance for theta-related neural mechanisms during cognitive control is still undetermined. Yet, theoretical considerations suggest that there may be a connection. To examine the link between resting state theta activity and conflict-related theta activity, we combined temporal EEG signal decomposition methods with time-frequency decomposition and beamforming methods inN= 86 healthy participants. Results indicate that resting state theta activity is closely associated with the strength of conflict-related neural activity at the level of ERPs and total theta power (consisting of phase-locked and nonphase-locked aspects of theta activity). The data reveal that resting state theta activity is related to a specific aspect of conflict-related theta activity, mainly in superior frontal regions and in the supplemental motor area (SMA, BA6) in particular. The signal decomposition showed that only stimulus-related, but not motor-response-related coding levels in the EEG signal and the event-related total theta activity were associated with resting theta activity. This specificity of effects may explain why the association between resting state theta activity and overt conflict monitoring performance may not be as strong as often assumed. The results suggest that resting state theta activity is particularly important to consider for input integration processes during cognitive control.

J	Jung, JY; Cho, HY; Kang, CK				Jung, Ju-Yeon; Cho, Hwi-Young; Kang, Chang-Ki			Brain activity during a working memory task in different postures: an EEG study	ERGONOMICS			English	Article						Working memory; n-back; postural change; EEG; sit; stand workstation	ENERGY-EXPENDITURE; SEDENTARY BEHAVIORS; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; PERFORMANCE; HEALTH; SUPINE; STAND; BACK; DESYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS	While working is more comfortable in a supine position and healthier in a standing, most people work in a sitting. However, it is unclear whether there are differences in brain activity efficiency in different postures. Here, we, therefore, compared changes in brain activity across three different postures to determine the optimal posture for performing working memory tasks. Their effect on brain activity was examined using EEG signals together with the information of accuracy and reaction times during 2-back task in 24 subjects. Substantial differences in brain waves were observed at sitting and standing positions compared to the supine, especially in delta waves and frontal lobe, where is known to improve the modulation of brain activity efficiently. Brain efficiency was higher during standing and sitting than in a supine. These findings show that postural changes may affect the efficiency of brain activity during working memory tasks. Practitioner summary:Differences in brain efficiency between different postures during working memory tasks have not been explored. This study suggests that efficiency in several brain areas is higher during sitting and standing than in a supine position. This finding has important implications regarding workplace environments. Furthermore, this result would be useful to improve accomplishment and reduce negative effects of work posture.

Among these measures, connectivity strength (CS) estimates the degree of functional connectivity of the whole network. Previous studies in schizophrenia patients have reported higher baseline CS values and modulation deficits in EEG spectral properties during cognitive activity. The specificity of these alterations and their relationships with pharmacological treatments remain unknown. Therefore, in the present study, we assessed functional CS on EEG-based brain networks in 79 schizophrenia and 29 bipolar patients in addition to 63 healthy controls. The subjects performed a P300 task during the EEG recordings from which the pre-stimulus and the task-related modulation CS values were computed in the global and theta bands. These values were compared between the groups and between the patients who had and had not received different treatments. The global band pre-stimulus CS was significantly higher in the schizophrenia group compared with the bipolar and control groups. Theta band CS modulation was decreased in schizophrenia and bipolar patients. Treatment with antipsychotics, lithium, benzodiazepines, and anticonvulsants did not significantly alter these CS values. The first-episode and chronic schizophrenia patients did not show significant differences in CS values. Higher global band pre-stimulus CS values were associated with worse general cognition in schizophrenia patients. These data support increased connectivity in the whole-brain network that is specific to schizophrenia and suggest a general hyper-synchronized basal state that might hamper cognition in this syndrome.

Spectral sleep electroencephalographic correlates of sleep efficiency, and discrepancies between actigraphy and self-reported measures, in older men	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						beta; hyper-arousal; misperception; sigma; sleep perception	NREM SLEEP; EEG SIGMA; INSOMNIA	Discrepancies between actigraphic and self-reported sleep measures are common. Studies of people with insomnia, in whom both sleep disturbances and discrepancy are common, suggest disturbances and discrepancy reflect differences in the sleeping brain's activity measurable using spectral electroencephalogram (EEG). Disentangling effects of discrepancy and disturbance on sleep EEG could help target research on the consequences and treatments of different sleep phenotypes. We therefore categorized participants in a cohort study including 2,850 men (average age = 76 years, standard deviation = 5.5) into four groups using median splits on actigraphic and self-reported sleep efficiency (SE). We compared spectral power between these groups in 1-Hz bins up to 24 Hz. Compared with the concordant-high SE group: (a) the group with high actigraphic and low self-reported SE had higher spectral power from 11-15 Hz across the night; (b) both groups with low actigraphic SE had higher power across the 15-24 Hz range, predominantly in early cycles, and greater slow frequency power in later cycles. These findings suggest that perceived wakefulness undetected by actigraphy may result from or drive activity corresponding to spindles. We also found, consistent with hyperarousal models, that low SE detectable via actigraphy was related to higher frequency power in the beta range; actigraph-measured inefficiency was also associated with later slow oscillations, potentially representing attempts to dissipate homeostatic drive elevated from earlier hyperarousal. These distinct spectral EEG markers (of low SE measured with actigraphy vs. low perceived SE that is not captured by actigraphy) may have different causes or consequences.

Global genetic deletion of Ca(V)3.3 channels facilitates anaesthetic induction and enhances isoflurane-sparing effects of T-type calcium channel blockers	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; ABSENCE SEIZURES; CA2+ CHANNELS; RAT; CURRENTS; NEURONS; TARGETS; SLEEP; EEG	We previously documented that the Ca(V)3.3 isoform of T-type calcium channels (T-channels) is inhibited by clinically relevant concentrations of volatile anaesthetics, including isoflurane. However, little is understood about the functional role of Ca(V)3.3 channels in anaesthetic-induced hypnosis and underlying neuronal oscillations. To address this issue, we used Ca(V)3.3 knock-out (KO) mice and a panselective T-channel blocker 3,5-dichloro-N-[1-(2,2-dimethyltetrahydro-pyran-4-ylmethyl)-4-fluoro-piperidin-4-ylmethyl]-benzamide (TTA-P2). We found that mutant mice injected with the vehicle showed faster induction of hypnosis than wild-type (WT) mice, while the percent isoflurane at which hypnosis and immobility occurred was not different between two genotypes. Furthermore, we found that TTA-P2 facilitated isoflurane induction of hypnosis in the Ca(V)3.3 KO mice more robustly than in the WT mice. Isoflurane-induced hypnosis following injections of TTA-P2 was accompanied with more prominent delta and theta EEG oscillations in the mutant mice, and reached burst-suppression pattern earlier when compared to the WT mice. Our findings point to a relatively specific value of Ca(V)3.3 channels in anaesthetic induced hypnosis. Furthermore, we propose that T-channel blockers may be further explored as a valuable adjunct to reducing the usage of potent volatile anaesthetics, thereby improving their safety.

Low levels of alpha activity (8-13Hz) mirror a state of enhanced responsiveness, whereas high levels of alpha are a state of reduced responsiveness. Tinnitus is accompanied by reduction of alpha activity in the perisylvian regions compared to normal hearing controls. This reduction might be a key mechanism in the chain of reactions leading to tinnitus. We devised a novel spatial filter as an on-line source monitoring method, which can be used to control alpha activity in the primary auditory cortex. In addition, we designed an innovative experimental procedure to enable suppression of visual and somatosensory alpha, facilitating auditory alpha control during alpha neurofeedback. Approach. An amplitude-modulated auditory stimulation with 40 Hz modulation frequency and 1000 Hz carrier frequency specifically activates the primary auditory cortex. The topography of 40 Hz oscillation depicts the activity of the auditory cortices. We used this map as a spatial filter, which passes the activity originating from the auditory cortex. To suppress superposition of auditory alpha by somatosensory and visual alpha, we used a continuous tactile jaw-stimulation and visual stimulation protocol to suppress somatosensory alpha of regions adjacent to the auditory cortex and visual alpha for local regulation of auditory alpha activity only. Main results. This novel spatial filter for online detection of auditory alpha activity and the usage of multi-sensory stimulation facilitate the appearance of alpha activity from the auditory cortex at the sensor level. Significance. The proposed procedure can be used in an EEG-neurofeedback-treatment approach allowing online auditory alpha self-regulation training in patients with chronic tinnitus.

J	Dubey, A; Ray, S				Dubey, Agrita; Ray, Supratim			Comparison of tuning properties of gamma and high-gamma power in local field potential (LFP) versus electrocorticogram (ECoG) in visual cortex	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; HIGH-FREQUENCY; HUMAN BRAIN; NEURAL ACTIVITY; SPATIAL SPREAD; CORTICAL AREA; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; RECORDINGS	Electrocorticogram (ECoG), obtained from macroelectrodes placed on the cortex, is typically used in drug-resistant epilepsy patients, and is increasingly being used to study cognition in humans. These studies often use power in gamma (30-70Hz) or high-gamma (>80Hz) ranges to make inferences about neural processing. However, while the stimulus tuning properties of gamma/high-gamma power have been well characterized in local field potential (LFP; obtained from microelectrodes), analogous characterization has not been done for ECoG. Using a hybrid array containing both micro and ECoG electrodes implanted in the primary visual cortex of two female macaques (for some stimulus conditions, separate ECoG and microelectrode arrays in two additional male macaques were also used), we compared the stimulus tuning preferences of gamma/high-gamma power in LFP versus ECoG in up to four monkeys, and found them to be surprisingly similar. High-gamma power, thought to index the average firing rate around the electrode, was highest for the smallest stimulus (0.3 degrees radius), and decreased with increasing size in both LFP and ECoG, suggesting local origins of both signals. Further, gamma oscillations were similarly tuned in LFP and ECoG to stimulus orientation, contrast and spatial frequency. This tuning was significantly weaker in electroencephalogram (EEG), suggesting that ECoG is more like LFP than EEG. Overall, our results validate the use of ECoG in clinical and basic cognitive research.

Temporal Signatures of Criticality in Human Cortical Excitability as Probed by Early Somatosensory Responses	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						complexity; criticality; EEG; excitability; oscillations; somatosensory	EVOKED-POTENTIALS; HUMAN BRAIN; SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; NEURONAL AVALANCHES; NEURAL VARIABILITY; EEG; DYNAMICS; RANGE; OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA	Brain responses vary considerably from moment to moment, even to identical sensory stimuli. This has been attributed to changes in instantaneous neuronal states determining the system's excitability. Yet the spatiotemporal organization of these dynamics remains poorly understood. Here we test whether variability in stimulus-evoked activity can be interpreted within the framework of criticality, which postulates dynamics of neural systems to be tuned toward the phase transition between stability and instability as is reflected in scale-free fluctuations in spontaneous neural activity. Using a novel noninvasive approach in 33 male human participants, we tracked instantaneous cortical excitability by inferring the magnitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents from the N20 component of the somatosensory evoked potential. Fluctuations of cortical excitability demonstrated long-range temporal dependencies decaying according to a power law across trials, a hallmark of systems at critical states. As these dynamics covaried with changes in prestimulus oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz), we establish a mechanistic link between ongoing and evoked activity through cortical excitability and argue that the co-emergence of common temporal power laws may indeed originate from neural networks poised close to a critical state. In contrast, no signatures of criticality were found in subcortical or peripheral nerve activity. Thus, criticality may represent a parsimonious organizing principle of variability in stimulus-related brain processes on a cortical level, possibly reflecting a delicate equilibrium between robustness and flexibility of neural responses to external stimuli.

Rapastinel, an NMDAR positive modulator, produces distinct behavioral, sleep, and EEG profiles compared with ketamine	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Depression; Ketamine; NMDA receptor; Rapastinel	MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTERS; RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; PREPULSE INHIBITION; PARTIAL AGONIST; DEFICITS; GLYX-13; GLYCINE	Rapastinel, a positive NMDAR modulator, produces rapid-acting and long-lasting antidepressant-like effects; however, unlike ketamine, the abuse potential for rapastinel is minimal. Ketamine has also been shown to induce psychotomimetic/dissociative side effects, aberrant gamma oscillations, and effects similar to sleep deprivation, which may potentially limit its clinical use. In this study, we compared the side effect profile and potential sleep-altering properties of rapastinel (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg) to ketamine (30 mg/kg) in rodents. In addition, we investigated corresponding changes in transcriptomics and proteomics. Rapastinel exhibited no effect on locomotor activity and prepulse inhibition in mice, while ketamine induced a significant increase in locomotor activity and a significant decrease in prepulse inhibition, which are indications of a psychosis-like state. The effects of rapastinel on sleep architecture were minimal, and rapastinel did not alter gamma frequency oscillations. In contrast, ketamine administration resulted in a greater latency to slow wave and REM sleep, disrupted duration of sleep, and affected duration of wakefulness during sleep. Further, ketamine increased cortical oscillations in the gamma frequency range, which is a property associated with psychosis. Rapastinel induced similar plasticity-related changes in transcriptomics to ketamine in rats but differed in several gene ontology classes, some of which may be involved in the regulation of sleep. In conclusion, rapastinel demonstrated a lower propensity than ketamine to induce CNS-related adverse side effects and sleep disturbances.

We aimed to use network analysis of resting-state electro-encephalography (EEG) recordings of patients with DM1 and matched unaffected controls to investigate changes in network organization in large-scale functional brain networks and correlations with cognitive deficits. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 28 adult patients with genetically confirmed DM1 and 26 age-, sex- and education-matched unaffected controls underwent resting-state EEG and neuropsychological assessment. We calculated the Phase Lag Index (PLI) to determine EEG frequency-dependent functional connectivity between brain regions. Functional brain networks were characterized by applying concepts from graph theory and compared between-groups. Network topology was evaluated using the minimum spanning tree (MST). We evaluated correlations between network metrics and neuropsychological tests that showed statistically significant between-group differences. Results: Functional connectivity estimated as whole-brain median PLI for DM1 patients versus healthy controls was higher in theta band (0.141 [0.050] versus 0.125 [0.018], p = 0.029), and lower in the upper alpha band (0.154 [0.048] versus 0.182 [0.073], p = 0.038), respectively. Functional MST-constructed networks in DM1 patients were significantly dissimilar from healthy controls in the delta, (p = 0.009); theta, (p = 0.009); lower alpha, (p = 0.036); and upper alpha, (p = 0.008) bands. In evaluation of local MST network measures, trends toward networks with higher global integration in the theta band and lower global integration in the upper alpha band were observed. Compared to unaffected controls, DM1 patients performed worse on tests of attention, motor function, executive function and visuospatial memory. Visuospatial memory correlated with the global median PLI in the upper alpha band; the Stroop interference test correlated with betweenness centrality in this band. Conclusion: This study supports the hypothesis that brain changes in DM1 give rise to disrupted functional network organization, as modelled with EEG-based networks. Further study may help unravel the relations with clinical brain-related DM1 symptoms. Significance: EEG network analysis has potential to help understand brain related DM1 phenotypes.

Their alterations are pathologically involved in various psychiatric disorders. Results of earlier studies suggest that imagery behaviors are correlated with the modulated activities of the respective modality-specific regions and the additional activities of supramodal imagery-related regions. Additionally, despite the availability of complexity analysis in the neuroimaging field, it has not been used for neural decoding approaches. Therefore, we sought to characterize neural oscillation related to multimodal imagery through complexity-based neural decoding. For this study, we modified existing complexity measures to characterize the time evolution of temporal complexity. We took magnetoencephalography (MEG) data of eight healthy subjects as they performed multimodal imagery and non-imagery tasks. The MEG data were decomposed into amplitude and phase of sub-band frequencies by Hilbert-Huang transform. Subsequently, we calculated the complexity values of each reconstructed time series, along with raw data and band power for comparison, and applied these results as inputs to decode visual perception (VP), visual imagery (VI), motor execution (ME), and motor imagery (MI) functions. Consequently, intra-subject decoding with the complexity yielded a characteristic sensitivity map for each task with high decoding accuracy. The map is inverted in the occipital regions between VP and VI and in the central regions between ME and MI. Additionally, replacement of the labels into two classes as imagery and non-imagery also yielded better classification performance and characteristic sensitivity with the complexity. It is particularly interesting that some subjects showed characteristic sensitivities not only in modality-specific regions, but also in supramodal regions. These analyses indicate that two-class and four-class classifications each provided better performance when using complexity than when using raw data or band power as input. When inter-subject decoding was used with the same model, characteristic sensitivity maps were also obtained, although their decoding performance was lower. Results of this study underscore the availability of complexity measures in neural decoding approaches and suggest the possibility of a modality-independent imagery-related mechanism. The use of time evolution of temporal complexity in neural decoding might extend our knowledge of the neural bases of hierarchical functions in the human brain.

Yet, distractions compete for cognitive resources with the evaluation process and may change how individuals evaluate ideas. In this paper, we investigate whether attentional demands from these distractions bias creativity evaluations. This question is examined using 1,065 creativity evaluations of 15 alternative uses of everyday objects by 71 study participants. Participants in the distraction group (Treatment) rated the alternative uses as more creative on the novelty dimension, but not the usefulness dimension, than did participants in the baseline group (Control). Psychophysiological measurements-event-related and spectral EEG and pupillometry-confirm attentional resources in the Treatment group are being diverted to a distractor task and that the Control group expended significantly more cognitive resources on the evaluation of the alternative uses. These data show direct physiological evidence that distractor tasks draw cognitive resources from creative evaluation and that such distractions will bias judgements of creativity.

Evaluating the Mental Workload During Robot-Assisted Surgery Utilizing Network Flexibility of Human Brain	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Robot-assisted surgery; mental workload; brain functional network; convolutional neural network	DYNAMIC RECONFIGURATION; EEG-ALPHA; SKILLS; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; COGNITION; INDEXES	Mental Workload (MWL) is traditionally evaluated by psychophysiological signals using spectral analysis and event-related potentials. Robot-assisted Surgery (RAS) is a complex task that involves human-robot interaction, multitasking, quick and appropriate reactions to various stimuli and unforeseen circumstances, as well as frequent switches between surgical subtasks. There is a lack of standardized methodology for objectively monitoring a surgeon's MWL during RAS. In this study, we propose an innovative framework, using dynamic functional brain network measurements and a deep convolutional neural network, to assess MWL. A model was developed and validated using Electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 22 trainees who performed basic surgical tasks, as well as four surgical fellows and an expert surgeon who carried out cystectomies and prostatectomies. The resulting accuracies of the MWL classification into low, intermediate and high were 93%, 89%, and 91% respectively. The proposed method can be used for continually monitoring mental workload levels in an objective fashion.

Frontal theta and beta oscillations during lower-limb movement in Parkinson's disease	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Lower-limb movement; Freezing of gait; Oscillations; Frontal region	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; GAIT INITIATION; BASAL GANGLIA; OLDER-ADULTS; MOTOR; DISORDERS; LEVODOPA; FALLS; NUCLEUS; BALANCE	Objectives: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have deficits in lower-limb functions such as gait, which involves both cognitive and motor dysfunction. In PD, theta and beta brain rhythms are associated with cognitive and motor functions, respectively. We tested the hypothesis that PD patients with lower-limb abnormalities would exhibit abnormal theta and beta rhythms in the mid-frontal cortical region during lower-limb action. Methods: This study included thirty-nine participants; 13 PD patients with FOG (PDFOG+), 13 without FOG (PDFOG-), and 13 demographically-matched controls. We recorded scalp electroencephalograms (EEG) during a lower-limb pedaling motor task, which required intentional initiation and stopping of a motor movement. Results: FOG scores were correlated with disease severity and cognition. PDFOG+ patients pedaled with reduced speed and decreased acceleration compared to PDFOG- patients and controls. PDFOG+ patients exhibited attenuated theta-band (4-8 Hz) power and increased beta-band (13-30 Hz) power at midfrontal electrode Cz during pedaling. Frontal theta- and beta-band oscillations also correlated with motor and cognitive deficits. Conclusion: Frontal theta and beta oscillations are predictors of lower-limb motor symptoms in PD and could be used to design neuromodulation for PD-related lower-limb abnormalities. Significance: These data provide insight into mechanisms of lower-limb dysfunction in PD with FOG. (C) 2020 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical effect of a manualized 12-session MBT for PNES in an uncontrolled trial. We hypothesized reductions in PNES frequency, intensity, and duration, and improvements in quality of life and psychiatric symptom severity at treatment completion. Methods: Between August 2014 and February 2018, 49 patients with documented PNES (with video electroen-cephalography [EEG]) were recruited at Brigham and Women's Hospital to participate in the MBT for PNES treatment study. Baseline demographic and clinical information and self-rating scales were obtained during the diagnostic evaluation (T0). Baseline PNES frequency, intensity, and duration were collected at the first follow-up postdiagnosis (T1). Frequency was obtained at each subsequent MBT session and analyzed over time with median regression analysis. Outcomes for other measures were collected at the last MBT session (T3), and compared to baseline measures using linear mixed models. Results: Twenty-six patients completed the 12-session MBT program and were included in the analysis. Median PNES frequency decreased by 0.12 events/week on average with each successive MBT session (p= 0.002). At session 12, 70% of participants endorsed a reduction in PNES frequency of at least 50%. Freedom from PNES was reported by 50% of participants by treatment conclusion. Seventy percent reported a 50% reduction in frequency from baseline and 50% reported remission at session 12. By treatment end, PNES intensity decreased (p = 0.012) and quality of life improved (p = 0.002). Event duration and psychiatric symptom severity were lower after treatment, but reductions were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Completion of a manualized 12-session MBT for PNES provides improvement in PNES frequency, intensity, and quality of life. The high dropout rate is consistent with adherence studies in PNES. Possible reasons for dropout are discussed. Randomized controlled trials and longer-term outcomes are needed to demonstrate the efficacy of MBT in PNES. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Tariq, M; Trivailo, PM; Simic, M				Tariq, Madiha; Trivailo, Pavel M.; Simic, Milan			Classification of left and right foot kinaesthetic motor imagery using common spatial pattern	BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS			English	Article						common spatial pattern (CSP); filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP); kinaesthetic motor imagery (KMI); brain-computer interface (BCI); supervised machine learning; EEG	EEG; FILTERS; PERFORMANCE; INTERFACES; AGREEMENT; MOVEMENTS; DESIGN	Background and objectives: Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems typically deploy common spatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction of mu and beta rhythms based on upper-limbs kinaesthetic motor imageries (KMI). However, it was not used to classify the left versus right foot KMI, due to its location inside the mesial wall of sensorimotor cortex, which makes it difficult to be detected. We report novel classification of mu and beta EEG features, during left and right foot KMI cognitive task, using CSP, and filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) method, to optimize the subject-specific band selection. We initially proposed CSP method, followed by the implementation of FBCSP for optimization of individual spatial patterns, wherein a set of CSP filters was learned, for each of the time/frequency filters in a supervised way. This was followed by the log-variance feature extraction and concatenation of all features (over all chosen spectral-filters). Subsequently, supervised machine learning was implemented, i.e. logistic regression (Logreg) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), in order to compare the respective foot KMI classification rates. Training and testing data, used in the model, was validated using 10-fold cross validation. Four methodology paradigms are reported, i.e. CSP LDA, CSP Logreg, and FBCSP LDA, FBCSP Logreg. All paradigms resulted in an average classification accuracy rate above the statistical chance level of 60.0% (P<0.01). On average, FBCSP LDA outperformed remaining paradigms with kappa score of 0.41 and classification accuracy of 70.28% 4.23. Similarly, this paradigm enabled discrimination between right and left foot KMI cognitive task at highest accuracy rate i.e. maximum 77.5% with kappa=0.55 and the area under ROC curve as 0.70 (in single-trial analysis). The proposed novel paradigms, using CSP and FBCSP, established a potential to exploit the left versus right foot imagery classification, in synchronous 2-class BCI for controlling robotic foot, or foot neuroprosthesis.

Many studies have proved that the Multivariate synchronization index (MSI) is an efficient method for recognizing the frequency components in SSVEP-based BCIs. Despite its success, the recognition accuracy has not been satisfactory because the simplified pre-constructed sine-cosine waves lack abundant features from the real electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Recent advances in addressing this issue have achieved a significant improvement in recognition accuracy by using individual calibration data. In this study, a new extension based on inter- and intra-subject template signals is introduced to improve the performance of the standard MSI method. Through template transfer, inter-subject similarity and variability are employed to enhance the robustness of SSVEP recognition. Additionally, most existed methods for SSVEP recognition utilize a fixed time window (TW) to perform frequency domain analysis, which limits the information transfer rate (ITR) of BCIs. For addressing this problem, a novel adaptive threshold strategy is integrated into the extension of MSI, which uses a dynamic window to extract the temporal features of SSVEPs and recognizes the stimulus frequency based on a pre-set threshold. The pre-set threshold contributes to obtaining an appropriate and shorter signal length for frequency recognition and filtering ignored-invalid trials. The proposed method is evaluated on a 12-class SSVEP dataset recorded from 10 subjects, and the result shows that this achieves higher recognition accuracy and information transfer rate when compared with the CCA, MSI, Multi-set CCA, and Individual Template-based CCA. This paper demonstrates that the proposed method is a promising approach for developing high-speed BCIs.

J	Frauscher, B				Frauscher, Birgit			Localizing the epileptogenic zone	CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY			English	Review						drug-resistant epilepsy; electrical stimulation; electroencephalography; high-frequency oscillations; multimarker	EPILEPSY; LOCALIZATION	Purpose of review Epilepsy surgery is the therapy of choice for 30-40% of people with focal drug-resistant epilepsy. Currently only similar to 60% of well selected patients become postsurgically seizure-free underlining the need for better tools to identify the epileptogenic zone. This article reviews the latest neurophysiological advances for EZ localization with emphasis on ictal EZ identification, interictal EZ markers, and noninvasive neurophysiological mapping procedures. Recent findings We will review methods for computerized EZ assessment, summarize computational network approaches for outcome prediction and individualized surgical planning. We will discuss electrical stimulation as an option to reduce the time needed for presurgical work-up. We will summarize recent research regarding high-frequency oscillations, connectivity measures, and combinations of multiple markers using machine learning. This latter was shown to outperform single markers. The role of NREM sleep for best identification of the EZ interictally will be discussed. We will summarize recent large-scale studies using electrical or magnetic source imaging for clinical decision-making. New approaches based on technical advancements paired with artificial intelligence are on the horizon for better EZ identification. They are ultimately expected to result in a more efficient, less invasive, and less time-demanding presurgical investigation.

In a task involving audio-visual conflict, using magnetoencephalography recordings in humans, we first demonstrated that the neuronal dominance - auditory cortex functionally influencing visual cortex - was associated with the sensory dominance - sound qualitatively altering visual perception. Further, we found that prestimulus auditory-to-visual connectivity could predict the perceptual outcome on a trial-by-trial basis. Subsequently, we performed an effective connectivity-guided neurofeedback electroencephalography experiment and showed that participants who were briefly trained to increase the neuronal dominance from auditory to visual cortex showed higher sensory, that is auditory, dominance during the conflict task immediately after the training. These results shed new light into the interactive neuronal nature of multisensory integration and open up exciting opportunities by enhancing or suppressing targeted mental functions subserved by effective connectivity.

Real-time EEG Feedback on Alpha Power Lateralization Leads to Behavioral Improvements in a Covert Attention Task	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Covert visuospatial attention; Brain-computer interface; EEG; Closed-loop; Alpha band lateralization; Hemispatial neglect	HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; SPATIAL ATTENTION; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; PARIETAL; SUPPRESSION; MECHANISMS; ABSENCE; BIAS	Visual attention can be spatially oriented, even in the absence of saccadic eye-movements, to facilitate the processing of incoming visual information. One behavioral proxy for this so-called covert visuospatial attention (CVSA) is the validity effect (VE): the reduction in reaction time (RT) to visual stimuli at attended locations and the increase in RT to stimuli at unattended locations. At the electrophysiological level, one correlate of CVSA is the lateralization in the occipital alpha\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\alpha$$\end{document}-band oscillations, resulting from alpha\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\alpha$$\end{document}-power increases ipsilateral and decreases contralateral to the attended hemifield.

Intact Auditory Cortical Cross-Frequency Coupling in Early and Chronic Schizophrenia	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						schziophrenia; ASSR = auditory steady-state response; phase amplitude coupling; biomarker; Cross Frequency Coupling (CFC); magnetoencephalagraphy (MEG)	GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; THETA; MEG; PHASE; EEG; NETWORK; CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; STIMULATION	Background Previous work has identified a hierarchical organization of neural oscillations that supports performance of complex cognitive and perceptual tasks, and can be indexed with phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between low- and high-frequency oscillations. Our aim was to employ enhanced source localization afforded by magnetoencephalography (MEG) to expand on earlier reports of intact auditory cortical PAC in schizophrenia and to investigate how PAC may evolve over the early and chronic phases of the illness. Methods Individuals with early schizophrenia (n=12) (<= 5 years of illness duration), chronic schizophrenia (n=16) (>5 years of illness duration) and healthy comparators (n = 17) performed the auditory steady state response (ASSR) to 40, 30, and 20 Hz stimuli during MEG recordings. We estimated amplitude and PAC on the MEG ASSR source localized to the auditory cortices. Results Gamma amplitude during 40-Hz ASSR exhibited a significant group by hemisphere interaction, with both patient groups showing reduced right hemisphere amplitude and no overall lateralization in contrast to the right hemisphere lateralization demonstrated in controls. We found significant PAC in the right auditory cortex during the 40-Hz entrainment condition relative to baseline, however, PAC did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusions In the current study, we demonstrated an apparent sparing of ASSR-related PAC across phases of the illness, in contrast with impaired cortical gamma oscillation amplitudes. The distinction between our PAC and evoked ASSR findings supports the notion of separate but interacting circuits for the generation and maintenance of sensory gamma oscillations. The apparent sparing of PAC in both early and chronic schizophrenia patients could imply that the neuropathology of schizophrenia differentially affects these mechanisms across different stages of the disease. Future studies should investigate the distinction between PAC during passive tasks and more cognitively demanding task such as working memory so that we can begin to understand the influence of schizophrenia neuropathology on the larger framework for modulating neurocomputational capacity.

Disruption of NREM sleep and sleep-related spatial memory consolidation in mice lacking adult hippocampal neurogenesis	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SHARP-WAVE-RIPPLE; CYCLIN D2; DEPENDENT MEMORY; SPINDLES; INCREASES; OSCILLATIONS; PLASTICITY; NEURONS; PROLIFERATION; INFORMATION	Cellular plasticity at the structural level and sleep at the behavioural level are both essential for memory formation. The link between the two is not well understood. A functional connection between adult neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation during NREM sleep has been hypothesized but not experimentally shown. Here, we present evidence that during a three-day learning session in the Morris water maze task a genetic knockout model of adult neurogenesis (Cyclin D2(-/-)) showed changes in sleep macro- and microstructure. Sleep EEG analyses revealed a lower total sleep time and NREM fraction in Cyclin D2(-/-) mice as well as an impairment of sleep specific neuronal oscillations that are associated with memory consolidation. Better performance in the memory task was associated with specific sleep parameters in wild-type, but not in Cyclin D2(-/-) mice. In wild-type animals the number of proliferating cells correlated with the amount of NREM sleep. The lack of adult neurogenesis led to changes in sleep architecture and oscillations that represent the dialog between hippocampus and neocortex during sleep. We suggest that adult neurogenesis-as a key event of hippocampal plasticity-might play an important role for sleep-dependent memory consolidation and modulates learning-induced changes of sleep macro- and microstructure.

However, post-DBS rehabilitation is essential, with particular regard to gait. Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS)-assisted treadmill gait rehabilitation within conventional physiotherapy program plays a major role in gait recovery. We explored the effects of a monthly RAS-assisted treadmill training within a conventional physiotherapy program on gait performance and gait-related EEG dynamics (while walking on the RAS-aided treadmill) in PD patients with (n= 10) and without DBS (n= 10). Patients with DBS achieved superior results than those without DBS concerning gait velocity, overall motor performance, and the timed velocity and self-confidence in balance, sit-to-stand (and vice versa) and walking, whereas both groups improved in dynamic and static balance, overall cognitive performance, and the fear of falling. The difference in motor outcomes between the two groups was paralleled by a stronger remodulation of gait cycle-related beta oscillations in patients with DBS as compared to those without DBS. Our work suggests that RAS-assisted gait training plus conventional physiotherapy is a useful strategy to improve gait performance in PD patients with and without DBS. Interestingly, patients with DBS may benefit more from this approach owing to a more focused and dynamic re-configuration of sensorimotor network beta oscillations related to gait secondary to the association between RAS-treadmill, conventional physiotherapy, and DBS. Actually, the coupling of these approaches may help restoring a residually altered beta-band response profile despite DBS intervention, thus better tailoring the gait rehabilitation of these PD patients.

It was posited that reward and value would hasten RTs and increase cognitive effort by boosting activation in the sensorimotor cortex and inhibition in the frontal cortex, similar to the horse-race model of motor actions. Participants performed a series of speeded responses while expecting differing monetary rewards (0 pence (p), 1 p, and 10 p) if they responded faster than their median RT. Amplitudes of cortical alpha, beta, and theta oscillations were analysed using the event-related desynchronization method. In experiment 1 (N = 29, with 12 females), reward was consistent within block, while in experiment 2 (N = 17, with 12 females), reward amount was displayed before each trial. Each experiment evaluated the baseline amplitude of cortical oscillations differently. The value of effort was evaluated using a cognitive effort discounting task (COGED). In both experiments, RTs decreased significantly with higher rewards. Reward level sharpened the increased amplitudes of beta oscillations during fast responses in experiment 1. In experiment 2, reward decreased the amplitudes of beta oscillations in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex. Individual effort values did not significantly correlate with oscillatory changes in either experiment. Results suggest that reward level and response speed interacted with the task- and baseline-dependent patterns of cortical inhibition in the frontal cortex and with activation in the sensorimotor cortex during the period of motor preparation in a sustained vigilance task. However, neither the shortening of RT with increasing reward nor the value of effort correlated with oscillatory changes. This implies that amplitudes of cortical oscillations may shape upcoming motor responses but do not translate higher-order motivational factors into motor performance.

Chronic pain, however, is considered maladaptive since it provides no apparent protective or recuperative benefits. Currently, approximately 20% of adults around the world suffer from chronic pain, which seriously affects their quality of life. Besides, the extent of the chronic pain problem poses a significant economic burden for both patients and the whole society (in China, the annual cost of pain exceeds $100 billion). Unfortunately, most of the patients had not received adequate treatment for their pain. Therefore, effective treatment of chronic pain is highly needed, which necessitates reliable and valid pain assessment. Since pain a subjective first-person experience, self-report using a visual analog scale or a numeric rating scale is the gold standard to determine the intensity of pain in clinical practice. However, self-report of pain is well known to be easily contaminated with reporting biases, and could not be used in some vulnerable populations, e.g., infants and patients with disorders of consciousness. As a result, the lack of an accurate assessment of pain could lead to an inadequate or suboptimal treatment of pain in these vulnerable populations. To solve this issue, it would be necessary to explore the possibility of assessing pain objectively using neural indicators that could complement the self-report of pain. Recent studies showed that pain-induced gamma band oscillations are one of the most promising biomarkers of the perceived intensity of both stimulus-evoked and spontaneous pain across different populations. First, being elicited by nociceptive stimuli, gamma band oscillations in the primary somatosensory cortex encode subjective pain perception reliably and selectively: Reliably, because they consistently reflect pain at both within-subject and between-subject levels; selectively, because they always track the intensity of pain, even when saliency of nociceptive stimuli is modulated. Second, gamma band oscillations in the prefrontal cortex encode selectively subjective ratings of tonic pain. Third, gamma band oscillations in the prefrontal area are positively correlated with subjective ratings of ongoing pain in chronic pain patients. All these findings demonstrated that gamma band oscillations could be identified as an objective neural indicator of pain perception, which could be useful for the assessment of pain in the future. However, the neural origin and neural mechanisms of pain-induced gamma band oscillations are largely unknown due to a series of technical issues, e.g., the low signal-to-noise ratio of gamma band oscillations, the low spatial resolution of the sampling techniques to record gamma band oscillations, and the intrinsic limitation of correlation analysis in current studies (unable to reveal causal relationship). To achieve a better understanding of the functional significance of pain-induced gamma band oscillations, novel analytical strategies are required to process neural responses that are collected using advanced experimental techniques on different species. With these efforts, we will understand better the neural mechanisms of pain-induced gamma band oscillations, which will increase the accuracy of the diagnosis of pain and the prediction of treatment outcome in various clinical conditions. In addition, the development of approaches to modulate pain-induced gamma band oscillations, e.g. , via transcranial alternating current stimulation coupled with neurofeedback, could provide a promising avenue for effective pain treatment in the future.

Yet, how incoming sensory information interacts with ongoing spontaneous brain activity, what features of the neuronal microcircuitry underlie spontaneous and stimulus-evoked spectral fin-gerprints, and what these fingerprints entail for stimulus encoding, remain largely open questions. We used a combination of human invasive electrophysiology, computational modeling and decoding techniques to assess the information encoding properties of brain activity and to relate them to a plausible underlying neuronal micro -architecture. We analyzed intracortical auditory EEG activity from 10 patients while they were listening to short sentences. Pre-stimulus neural activity in early auditory cortical regions often exhibited power spectra with a shoulder in the delta range and a small bump in the beta range. Speech decreased power in the beta range, and increased power in the delta-theta and gamma ranges. Using multivariate machine learning techniques, we assessed the spectral profile of information content for two aspects of speech processing: detection and discrimination. We obtained better phase than power information decoding, and a bimodal spectral profile of information content with better decoding at low (delta-theta) and high (gamma) frequencies than at intermediate (beta) frequencies. These experimental data were reproduced by a simple rate model made of two subnetworks with different timescales, each composed of coupled excitatory and inhibitory units, and connected via a negative feedback loop. Modeling and experimental results were similar in terms of pre-stimulus spectral profile (except for the iEEG beta bump), spectral modulations with speech, and spectral profile of information content. Altogether, we provide converging evidence from both univariate spectral analysis and decoding approaches for a dual timescale processing infrastructure in human auditory cortex, and show that it is consistent with the dynamics of a simple rate model.

We focused on power-based associations that could reveal unique timescale dependence independently of interacting frequencies. Large spectral-power fluctuations across all sites occurred at two characteristic timescales, sub-second and seconds, yielding distinct patterns of cross-frequency associations. On the fast sub-second timescale, within-site (local) associations were consistently between pairs of beta-gamma frequencies differing by a constant Delta f (particularly Delta f similar to 10 Hz at posterior sites and Delta f similar to 16 Hz at lateral sites) suggesting that higher-frequency oscillations are organized into Delta f amplitude-modulated packets, whereas cross-site (long-distance) associations were all within-frequency (particularly in the > 30 Hz and 6-12 Hz ranges, suggestive of feedforward and feedback interactions). On the slower seconds timescale, within-site (local) associations were characterized by a broad range of frequencies selectively associated with similar to 10 Hz at posterior sites and associations among higher (> 20 Hz) frequencies at lateral sites, whereas cross-site (long-distance) associations were characterized by a broad range of frequencies at posterior sites selectively associated with similar to 10 Hz at other sites, associations among higher (>20 Hz) frequencies among lateral and anterior sites, and prevalent associations at similar to 10 Hz. Regardless of timescale, within-site (local) cross-frequency associations were weak at anterior sites indicative of frequency-specific operations. Overall, these results suggest that the fast sub-second-timescale coordination of spectral power is limited to local amplitude modulation and insulated within-frequency long-distance interactions (likely feedforward and feedback interactions), while characteristic patterns of cross-frequency interactions emerge on the slower seconds timescale. The results also suggest that the occipital a oscillations play a role in organizing higher-frequency oscillations into similar to 10 Hz amplitude-modulated packets to communicate with other regions. Functional implications of these timescale-dependent cross-frequency associations await future investigations.

With aging, there is decreased sensitivity to somatosensory stimuli. It is essential to examine the effect of TENS application on the sensory functions in the brain by recording the spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) activity and the effect of aging on the sensory functions of the brain during the application. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of the application of TENS on the brain's electrical activity and the effect of aging on the sensory functions of the brain during application of TENS. A total of 15 young (24.2 +/- 3.59) and 14 elderly (65.64 +/- 4.92) subjects were included in the study. Spontaneous EEG was recorded from 32 channels during TENS application. Power spectrum analysis was performed by Fast Fourier Transform in the alpha frequency band (8-13 Hz) for all subjects. Repeated measures of analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). Young subjects had increased alpha power during the TENS application and had gradually increased alpha power by increasing the current intensity of TENS (p = 0.035). Young subjects had higher alpha power than elderly subjects in the occipital and parietal locations (p = 0.073). We can, therefore, conclude that TENS indicated increased alpha activity in young subjects. Young subjects had higher alpha activity than elderly subjects in the occipital and somatosensory areas. To our knowledge, the present study is one of the first studies examining the effect of TENS on spontaneous EEG in healthy subjects. Based on the results of the present study, TENS may be used as an objective method for the examination of sensory impairments, and in the evaluative efficiency of the treatment of pain conditions.

This study aimed to assess the interindividual variation in first-hand physical pain and empathy for pain, and whether their relationship is dependent upon attention. We recruited participants exhibiting high and low sensitivity to first-hand pain (HPS and LPS), and adopted pain empathy paradigms involving attention directed toward or withdrawn from pain of another. Relative to the LPS group, participants in the HPS group estimated greater pain intensity experienced by others, felt greater unpleasantness when viewing others in pain, and exhibited greater sensitivity in discriminating others' pain. Electroencephalographic data showed that when attention was directed toward others' pain, only participants in the HPS group exhibited significant pain empathic effects on the N1 component of event-related potentials and on the alpha-oscillation response. These empathic neural responses mediated the linkage between first-hand pain sensitivity and empathic behavioral responses. Nevertheless, empathic responses were comparable between two groups when attention was withdrawn from others' pain. These results demonstrate a shared sensitivity to first-hand pain and empathy for pain provided that attention is directed toward pain.

NMDA receptors on parvalbumin-positive interneurons and pyramidal neurons both contribute to MK-801 induced gamma oscillatory disturbances: Complex relationships with behaviour	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						NMDA receptor antagonism; Behaviour; Electrophysiology; Gamma oscillations; Mice; Schizophrenia; Parvalbumin interneurons	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; PREPULSE INHIBITION; DOPAMINE NEURONS; KETAMINE; NETWORK; HYPOFUNCTION; ANTAGONIST; EEG; SCHIZOPHRENIA; COHERENCE	Background: NMDAr antagonists induce disturbances to gamma frequency oscillations, including increasing ongoing gamma activity and reducing evoked gamma oscillations. We sought to investigate the role parvalbumin (PV+) neurons and CaMKII alpha + pyramidal cells in NMDAr antagonist-induced disturbances in gamma oscillatory activity and relate these to common behavioural consequences of these drugs by selectively deleting the obligatory GluN1 subunit from these cells in mice. Methods: Adult mice (total n = 99) with GluN1 deleted from PV interneurons (PV:GluN1 KO) or CaMKII alpha + pyramidal cells (CaMKII alpha:GluN1 KO), and WT littermates, were used. We assessed effects of the NMDAr antagonist MK-801 on prepulse inhibition (PPI) and locomotor behaviour. Then, mice were implanted with electrodes in the prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (dHPC), and the effects of MK-801 on gamma oscillations assessed. Results: In WT mice, MK-801 increased ongoing gamma power, reduced evoked gamma power and increased gamma coherence. These changes were accompanied by hyperlocomotion and deficient PPI. The consequences of NMDAr antagonism were differentially regulated in the transgenic mice. The MK-801-induced increase in ongoing gamma power was significantly attenuated in both transgenic strains, but deficits to evoked gamma activity were unaffected by genotype. Deficient PPI was not affected by genotype, and only in PV:GluN1 KO mice was the hyperlocomotor phenotype of MK-801 attenuated. The emergence of abnormal gamma band hyperconnectivity between the mPFC and dHPC was absent in CaMKII alpha:GluN1 KO mice. Conclusion: This study suggests that the effects of NMDAr antagonism on gamma band responses and behaviour have complex relationships, and rely on different populations of neurons.

Recent spatiotemporal analyses suggest that alpha oscillations support DMN functioning via interregional synchronization and sensory cortical inhibition. Therefore, we examined a unifying pathology of alpha deficits in the visual-cortex-DMN system in PTSD. Human patients with PTSD (N = 25) and two control groups, patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; N = 24) and healthy controls (HCs; N = 20), underwent a standard eyes-open resting state (S-RS) and a modified resting state (M-RS) of passively viewing salient images (known to deactivate the DMN). High-density electroencephalogram (hdEEG) were recorded, from which intracortical alpha activity (power and connectivity/Granger causality) was extracted using the exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA). Patients with PTSD (vs GAD/HC) demonstrated attenuated alpha power in the visual cortex (VC) and key hubs of the DMN [posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)] at both states, the severity of which further correlated with hypervigilance symptoms. With increased visual input (at M-RS vs S-RS), patients with PTSD further demonstrated reduced alpha-frequency directed connectivity within the DMN (PCC -> mPFC) and, importantly, from the VC to both DMN hubs (VC -> PCC and VC -> mPFC), linking alpha deficits in the two systems. These interrelated alpha deficits align with DMN hypoactivity/hypoconnectivity, sensory disinhibition, and hypervigilance in PTSD, representing a unifying neural underpinning of these anomalies. The identification of visual-cortex-DMN alpha dysrhythmia in PTSD further presents a novel therapeutic target, promoting network-based intervention of neural oscillations.

Multiple Midfrontal Thetas Revealed by Source Separation of Simultaneous MEG and EEG	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						conflict processing; midfrontal cortex; multivariate analysis; response conflict; source separation; theta	CONFLICT DETECTION; DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; ADAPTATION; STIMULUS; TOOLBOX; POWER	Theta-band (similar to 6 Hz) rhythmic activity within and over the medial PFC ("midfrontal theta") has been identified as a distinctive signature of "response conflict," the competition between multiple actions when only one action is goal-relevant. Midfrontal theta is traditionally conceptualized and analyzed under the assumption that it is a unitary signature of conflict that can be uniquely identified at one electrode (typically FCz). Here we recorded simultaneous MEG and EEG (total of 328 sensors) in 9 human subjects (7 female) and applied a feature-guided multivariate source-separation decomposition to determine whether conflict-related midfrontal theta is a unitary or multidimensional feature of the data. For each subject, a generalized eigendecomposition yielded spatial filters (components) that maximized the ratio between theta and broadband activity. Components were retained based on significance thresholding and midfrontal EEG topography. All of the subjects individually exhibited multiple (mean 5.89, SD 2.47) midfrontal components that contributed to sensor-level midfrontal theta power during the task. Component signals were temporally uncorrelated and asynchronous, suggesting that each midfrontal theta component was unique. Our findings call into question the dominant notion that midfrontal theta represents a unitary process. Instead, we suggest that midfrontal theta spans a multidimensional space, indicating multiple origins, but can manifest as a single feature at the sensor level because of signal mixing.

Neural Field Theory of Evoked Response Potentials With Attentional Gain Dynamics	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						corticothalamic system; neural field theory; evoked potentials; brain filters; synaptic gain adjustment; local feedback; attention; brain oscillations	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; ALPHA-BAND; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; MODEL; MODULATION; MECHANISMS	A generalized neural field model of large-scale activity in the corticothalamic system is used to predict standard evoked potentials. This model embodies local feedbacks that modulate the gains of neural activity as part of the response to incoming stimuli and thus enables both activity changes and effective connectivity changes to be calculated as parts of a generalized evoked response, and their relative contributions to be determined. The results show that incorporation of gain modulations enables a compact and physically justifiable description of the differences in gain between background-EEG and standard-ERP conditions, with the latter able to be initiated from the background state, rather than requiring distinct parameters as in earlier work. In particular, top-down gains are found to be reduced during an ERP, consistent with recent theoretical suggestions that the role of internal models is diminished in favor of external inputs when the latter change suddenly. The static-gain and modulated-gain system transfer functions are analyzed via control theory in terms of system resonances that were recently shown to implement data filtering whose gain adjustments can be interpreted as attention. These filters are shown to govern early and late features in standard evoked responses and their gain parameters are shown to be dynamically adjusted in a way that implements a form of attention. The results show that dynamically modulated resonant filters responsible for the low-frequency oscillations in an evoked potential response have different parameters than those responsible for low-frequency resting EEG responses, while both responses share similar mid- and high-frequency resonant filters. These results provide a biophysical mechanism by which oscillatory activity in the theta, alpha, and beta frequency ranges of an evoked response are modulated as reflections of attention; notably theta is enhanced and alpha suppressed during the latter parts of the ERP. Furthermore, the model enables the part of the ERP response induced by gain modulations to be estimated and interpreted in terms of attention.

An artificial chaotic neural network is a highly nonlinear dynamic system, which can realize a series of complex dynamic behaviors, optimize global search and neural computation, and generate pseudo-random sequences for information encryption. According to the superposition theory of sinusoidal signals with different frequencies of brain waves, a non-monotone activation function based on the multifrequency-frequency conversion sinusoidal function and a piecewise function is proposed to make a neural network more consistent with the biological characteristics. The analysis shows that by adjusting the parameters, the activation function can exhibit the EEG signals in its different states, which can simulate the rich and varying brain activities when the brain waves of different frequencies and types work at the same time. According to the activation function we design a new chaotic cellular neural network. The complexity of the chaotic neural network is analyzed by the structural complexity based SE algorithm and C0 algorithm. By means of Lyapunov exponential spectrum, bifurcation diagram and basin of attraction, the effects of the activation function's parameters on its dynamic characteristics are analyzed in detail, and it is found that a series of complex phenomena appears in the chaotic neural network, such as many different types of chaotic attractors, coexistent chaotic attractors and coexistence limit cycles, which improves the performance of the chaotic neural network, and proves that the multi-frequency sinusoidal chaotic neural network has rich dynamic characteristics, so it has a good prospect in information processing, information encryption and other aspects.

Previous work established that serotonergic psychedelics can have a dysregulating effect on brain activity, leading to subjective effects that present a considerable overlap with the phenomenology of certain meditative states. Here we propose that the prolonged practice of meditation results in endogenous increased entropy of brain oscillatory activity. We estimated the entropy of band-specific oscillations during the meditative state of traditions classified as 'focused attention' (Himalayan Yoga), 'open monitoring' (Vipassana), and 'open awareness' (Isha Shoonya Yoga). Among all traditions, Vipassana resulted in the highest entropy increases, predominantly in the alpha and low/high gamma bands. In agreement with previous studies, all meditation traditions increased the global coherence in the gamma band, but also stabilized gamma-range dynamics by lowering the metastability. Finally, machine learning classifiers could successfully generalize between certain pairs of meditation traditions based on the scalp distribution of gamma band entropies. Our results extend previous findings on the spectral changes observed during meditation, showing how long-term practice can lead to the capacity for achieving brain states of high entropy. This constitutes an example of an endogenous, self-induced high entropy state. (C) 2020 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we noted frequency increases in delta -waves in sleep-deprived mice, prompting us to re-evaluate how slow-wave characteristics relate to prior sleep-wake history. We identified two classes of delta -waves; one responding to sleep deprivation with high initial power and fast, discontinuous decay during recovery sleep (delta 2) and another unrelated to time-spent-awake with slow, linear decay (delta 1). Reanalysis of previously published datasets demonstrates that delta -band heterogeneity after sleep deprivation is also present in human subjects. Similar to sleep deprivation, silencing of centromedial thalamus neurons boosted subsequent delta 2-waves, specifically. delta 2-dynamics paralleled that of temperature, muscle tone, heart rate, and neuronal ON-/OFF-state lengths, all reverting to characteristic NREMS levels within the first recovery hour. Thus, prolonged waking seems to necessitate a physiological recalibration before typical NREMS can be reinstated. Changes in EEG delta-activity are widely used as proxy of sleep propensity. Here the authors demonstrate in mice and humans the presence of two types of delta-waves, only one of which reports on prior sleep-wake history with dynamics denoting a wake-inertia process accompanying deepest non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREM) sleep.

In this paper, a feature analysis method based on the combination of brain functional network and common spatial pattern is proposed to solve the dichotomy of unilateral (right) hand motor imagination. Firstly, the phase analysis between Mu rhythm and Beta rhythm signals is carried out, and then the brain functional network topology is drawn according to the phase synchronization information matrix. Through analysis, Mu rhythm of MI - EEG signals than Beta rhythm is more active, and phase synchronization oscillation is concentrated in the center of the brain area C, FC and CP. Then, the concept of graph theory is used to extract the network attribute features under two rhythms: clustering coefficient and shortest path length, and the common space mode method is used to extract the spatial domain features, and the two types of features form an 8-dimensional feature vector. Finally, the features are classified by SVM, and the average classification accuracy is 94.69%, which is higher than that of the two methods. The research content of this paper breaks through the traditional right-handed MIEEG classification problem, and the method in this paper does not need to consider the ERD/ERS phenomenon, thus expanding the range of data that can be classified.

In adults, this so-called mirroring is modulated not only by the saliency of an action but also by top-down processes, like the intention to imitate it. Yet, it remains unknown whether neural processing of others' actions can be modulated by top-down processes in young children who heavily rely on learning from observing and imitating others but also still develop top-down control skills. Using EEG, we examined whether the intention to imitate increases 4-year-olds' motor activation while observing others' actions. In a within-subjects design, children observed identical actions preceded by distinct instructions, namely to either imitate the action or to name the toy's color. As motor activation index, children's alpha (7-12 Hz) and beta (16-20 Hz) power over motor cortices was analyzed. The results revealed more motor activity reflected by significantly lower beta power for the Imitation compared to the Color-naming Task. The same conditional difference, although differently located, was detected for alpha power. Together, our results show that children's neural processing of others' actions was amplified by their intention to imitate the action. Thus, already at age 4 top-down attention to others' actions can modulate neural action processing.

Electroencephalographical (EEG) coherence, which measures the degree of synchrony between brain regions, may be a useful measure of connectivity patterns in neural networks for studying the genetics of AUD. In 8810 individuals (6644 of European and 2166 of African ancestry) from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), we performed a Multi-Trait Analyses of genome-wide association studies (MTAG) on parietal resting-state theta (3-7 Hz) EEG coherence, which previously have been associated with AUD. We also examined developmental effects of GWAS findings on trajectories of neural connectivity in a longitudinal subsample of 2316 adolescent/young adult offspring from COGA families (ages 12-30) and examined the functional and clinical significance of GWAS variants. Six correlated single nucleotide polymorphisms located in a brain-expressed lincRNA (ENSG00000266213) on chromosome 18q23 were associated with posterior interhemispheric low theta EEG coherence (3-5 Hz). These same variants were also associated with alcohol use behavior and posterior corpus callosum volume, both in a subset of COGA and in the UK Biobank. Analyses in the subsample of COGA offspring indicated that the association of rs12954372 with low theta EEG coherence occurred only in females, most prominently between ages 25 and 30 (p < 2 x 10(-9)). Converging data provide support for the role of genetic variants on chromosome 18q23 in regulating neural connectivity and alcohol use behavior, potentially via dysregulated myelination. While findings were less robust, genome-wide associations were also observed with rs151174000 and parieto-frontal low theta coherence, rs14429078 and parieto-occipital interhemispheric high theta coherence, and rs116445911 with centro-parietal low theta coherence. These novel genetic findings highlight the utility of the endophenotype approach in enhancing our understanding of mechanisms underlying addiction susceptibility.

However, little is known of what function the rhythmic dynamic may serve in thalamocortical couplings. This work introduced a general approach to investigate the modulatory contribution of rhythmic scalp network to the thalamo-frontal couplings in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) and frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE). Here, time-varying rhythmic network was constructed using the adapted directed transfer function between EEG electrodes, and then was applied as a modulator in fMRI-based thalamocortical functional couplings. Furthermore, the relationship between corticocortical connectivity and rhythm-dependent thalamocortical coupling was examined. The results revealed thalamocortical couplings modulated by EEG scalp network have frequency-dependent characteristics. Increased thalamus sensorimotor network (SMN) and thalamus-default mode network (DMN) couplings in JME were strongly modulated by alpha band. These thalamus-SMN couplings demonstrated enhanced association with SMN-related corticocortical connectivity. In addition, altered theta-dependent and beta-dependent thalamus-frontoparietal network (FPN) couplings were found in FLE. The reduced theta-dependent thalamus-FPN couplings were associated with the decreased FPN-related corticocortical connectivity. This study proposed interactive links between the rhythmic modulation and thalamocortical coupling. The crucial role of SMN and FPN in subcortical-cortical circuit may have implications for intervention in generalized and focal epilepsy.

We introduce a novel, phase-based, functional connectivity descriptor that encapsulates not only the synchronization strength between distinct brain regions, but also the time-lag between the involved neural oscillations. The new estimator employs complex-valued measurements and results in a brain network sketch that lives on the smooth manifold of Hermitian Positive Definite (HPD) matrices. Approach: Leveraging the HPD property of the proposed descriptor, we adapt a recently introduced dimensionality reduction methodology that is based on Riemannian Geometry and discriminatively detects the recording sites which best reflect the differences in network organization between contrasting recording conditions in order to overcome the problem of high-dimensionality, usually encountered in the connectivity patterns derived from multisite encephalographic recordings. Main results. The proposed framework is validated using an EEG dataset that refers to the challenging problem of differentiating between attentive and passive visual responses. We provide evidence that the reduced connectivity representation facilitates high classification performance and caters for neuroscientific explorations. Significance. Our paper is the very first that introduces an advanced connectivity descriptor that can take advantage of Riemannian geometry tools. The proposed descriptor, that inherently and simultaneously captures both the strength and the corresponding time-lag of the phase synchronization, is the first phase-based descriptor tailored to leverage the benefits of Riemannian geometry.

J	Batterink, L				Batterink, Laura			Syllables in Sync Form a Link: Neural Phase-locking Reflects Word Knowledge during Language Learning	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL TRACKING; CONTINUOUS SPEECH; ENTRAINMENT; VARIABILITY; COMPONENT	Language is composed of small building blocks, which combine to form larger meaningful structures. To understand language, we must process, track, and concatenate these building blocks into larger linguistic units as speech unfolds over time. An influential idea is that phase-locking of neural oscillations across different levels of linguistic structure provides a mechanism for this process. Building on this framework, the goal of the current study was to determine whether neural phase-locking occurs more robustly to novel linguistic items that are successfully learned and encoded into memory, compared to items that are not learned. Participants listened to a continuous speech stream composed of repeating nonsense words while their EEG was recorded and then performed a recognition test on the component words. Neural phase-locking to individual words during the learning period strongly predicted the strength of subsequent word knowledge, suggesting that neural phase-locking indexes the subjective perception of specific linguistic items during real-time language learning. These findings support neural oscillatory models of language, demonstrating that words that are successfully perceived as functional units are tracked by oscillatory activity at the matching word rate. In contrast, words that are not learned are processed merely as a sequence of unrelated syllables and thus not tracked by corresponding word-rate oscillations.

Intrinsic activity temporal structure reactivity to behavioural state change is correlated with depressive symptoms	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						criticality; long-range temporal correlations; negative thought; self-focus	NEURONAL AVALANCHES; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; EEG DIFFERENCES; RUMINATION; DYNAMICS; INFLEXIBILITY; CRITICALITY; LOCOMOTION	The brain's intrinsic activity plays a fundamental role in its function. In normal conditions this activity is responsive to behavioural context, changing as an individual switches between directed tasks and task-free conditions. A key feature of such changes is the movement of the brain between corresponding critical and sub-critical states, with these dynamics supporting efficient cognitive processing. Breakdowns in processing efficiency can occur, however, in brain disorders such as depression. It was therefore hypothesised that depressive symptoms would be related to reduced intrinsic activity responsiveness to changes in behavioural state. This was tested in a mixed group of major depressive disorder patients (n = 26) and healthy participants (n = 37) by measuring intrinsic EEG activity temporal structure, quantified with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), in eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open task-free states and contrasting between the conditions. The degree to which DFA values changed between the states was found to correlate negatively with depressive symptoms. DFA values did not differ between states in those with higher symptom levels, meaning that the brain remained in a less flexible sub-critical condition. This sub-critical condition in the EC state was further found to correlate with levels of maladaptive rumination. This may reflect a general cognitive inflexibility resulting from a lack in neural activity reactivity that may predispose people to overly engage in self-directed attention. These results provide an initial link between intrinsic activity reactivity and psychological features found in psychiatric disorders.

However, it is still unknown how the brain governs this asymmetry. In this study, we conducted behavioral and electrophysiological experiments to evaluate anti-predatory behaviors and dynamic brain activities in Emei music frogs (Nidirana daunchina), to explore the potential eye bias for anti-predation and the underlying neural mechanisms. To do this, predator stimuli (a model snake head and a leaf as a control) were moved around the subjects in clockwise and anti-clockwise directions at steady velocity. We counted the number of anti-predatory responses and measured electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectra for each band and brain area (telencephalon, diencephalon and mesencephalon). Our results showed that (1) no significant eye preferences could be found for the control (leaf); however, the laterality index was significantly lower than zero when the predator stimulus was moved anti-clockwise, suggesting that left-eye advantage exists in this species for anti-predation; (2) compared with no stimulus in the visual field, the power spectra of delta and alpha bands were significantly greater when the predator stimulus was moved into the left visual field anti-clockwise; and, (3) generally, the power spectra of each band in the right-hemisphere for the left visual field were higher than those in the left counterpart. These results support that the left eye mediates the monitoring of a predator in music frogs and lower-frequency EEG oscillations govern this visual lateralization.

To date, the mechanisms underlying their occurrence remain obscure. Here, we show how the interactions between pyramidal cells, parvalbumin-positive (PV+) basket cells, and an unidentified class of anti-SWR interneurons can contribute to the initiation and termination of SWRs. Using a biophysically constrained model of a network of spiking neurons and a rate-model approximation, we demonstrate that SWRs emerge as a result of the competition between two interneuron populations and the resulting disinhibition of pyramidal cells. Our models explain how the activation of pyramidal cells or PV+ cells can trigger SWRs, as shown in vitro, and suggests that PV+ cell-mediated short-term synaptic depression influences the experimentally reported dynamics of SWR events. Furthermore, we predict that the silencing of anti-SWR interneurons can trigger SWRs. These results broaden our understanding of the microcircuits supporting the generation of memory-related network dynamics.

Nevertheless, idiopathic nightmare disorder is considered a REM parasomnia, but the pathophysiology of REM sleep in relation to frequent nightmares is controversial. Cortical oscillatory activity in REM sleep is largely modulated by phasic and tonic REM periods and seems to be linked to different functions and dysfunctions of REM sleep. Here, we examined cortical activity and functional synchronization in frequent nightmare recallers and healthy controls, during phasic and tonic REM. Methods: Frequent nightmare recallers (N = 22) and healthy controls (N = 22) matched for high dream recall spent two nights in the laboratory. Phasic and tonic REM periods from the second nights' re-cordings were selected to examine differences in EEG spectral power and weighted phase lag index (WPLI) across groups and REM states. Results: Phasic REM showed increased power and synchronization in delta and gamma frequency bands, whereas tonic REM featured increased power and synchronization in the alpha and beta bands. In the theta band, power was higher during tonic, and synchronization was higher during phasic REM sleep. No differences across nightmare and control participants or patterns representing interactions between the groups and REM microstates emerged. Conclusions: Our findings do not support the idea that abnormal REM sleep power and synchronization play a role in the pathophysiology of frequent nightmares. Altered REM sleep in nightmare disorder could have been confounded with comorbid pathologies and increased dream recall, or might be linked to more specific state factors (nightmare episodes).

However, the effect of threat may be attenuated for those high in interdependent self-construal (SC) because this SC affords a sense of protection against the threat. Here, we tested this possibility by priming or not priming young American adults with a pathogen threat. We then had participants read norm-violating or normal behaviors while assessing two electrocortical markers: N400 (indexing the detection of norm violations) and suppression of upper a-band power (indexing vigilance to the violations). In the threat priming condition, interdependent SC predicted decreased responsiveness to norm violations. In the control priming condition, however, interdependent SC predicted increased responsiveness. Our work suggests that interdependent SC may provide a sense of security under threat.

We systematically investigated subjective and objective sleepiness in an observational cross-sectional cohort of adults with epilepsy (AWE). Methods: This is a prospective study of AWE consecutively recruited without foreknowledge of sleep/wake complaints. Polysomnography (PSG) with 18-channel electroencephalography (EEG) followed by multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) was performed. Patients completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), a single-item question assessing excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), and a 7-day sleep and seizure diary. Multivariable linear models were used to assess the association between MSLT mean sleep latency (MSL) and interests with adjustment of covariates of interest. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate the discrimination capability of ESS on MSL < 8 min and <5 min and investigate the optimal cutpoints. Results: Among 127 AWE (mean age: 38.7 +/- 13.7 years), abnormal MSL (<8min) was observed in 49.6% and MSL <5 min in 31.5%. While 78% reported feeling sleepy during the day on a single-item question, only 24% had elevated scores on the ESS (>10/24). The ESS score was associated with MSL even after adjusting for seizure frequency, antiseizure medication (ASM) standardized dose and number, age, gender, depression and insomnia symptom severity, and apnea-hypopnea index (HPI) and total sleep time on PSG (coefficients [95% confidence interval (CI)]: -0.26 [- 0.48, - 0.05], p = 0.018). The area under the curve (AUC) of the ESS ROC predicting MSL < 8 min and MSL < 5 min were similar: 0.62 (95%CI: 0.52-0.72) and 0.62 (95%CI: 0.51-0.74). Conclusions: This is the largest prospective cross-sectional observational study to date using MSLT in AWE. We found subjective and objective daytime sleepiness highly prevalent in AWE and not explained by seizure frequency, ASM burden, symptoms of insomnia/depression, or PSG findings although those with MSL < 5 min were more likely to have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Pathologic sleepiness with MSL < 8 min was present in half of AWE. Nearly one-third of AWE unselected for sleep/wake complaints had MSL < 5 min, a range typical of narcolepsy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Persistently active neurons are thought to be a mechanism to maintain WMs, but it remains unclear how such activity is coordinated when multiple items are kept in memory. We show that memoranda-selective persistently active neurons in the human medial temporal lobe phase lock to ongoing slow-frequency (1-7 Hz) oscillations during WM maintenance. The properties of phase locking are dependent on memory content and load. During high memory loads, the phase of the oscillatory activity to which neurons phase lock provides information about memory content not available in the firing rate of the neurons. We provide a computational model that reveals that inhibitory-feedback-mediated competition between multiple persistently active neurons reproduces this phenomenon. This work reveals a mechanism for the active maintenance of multiple items in WM that relies on persistently active neurons whose activation is orchestrated by oscillatory activity.

One of the main challenges to cross-study comparison in this area of research is the diversity of the cognitive tasks used to measure memory performance. Objective: We hypothesized that the tasks that differentially engage the hippocampus may be differentially influenced by hippocampal stimulation and the behavioral effects would be related to the underlying hippocampal activity. Methods: To investigate this issue, we recorded intracranial EEG from and directly applied stimulation to the hippocampus of 10 epilepsy patients while they performed two different verbal memory tasks - a word pair associative memory task and a single item memory task. Results: Hippocampal stimulation modulated memory performance in a task-dependent manner, improving associative memory performance, while impairing item memory performance. In addition, subjects with poorer baseline cognitive function improved much more with stimulation. iEEG recordings from the hippocampus during non-stimulation encoding blocks revealed that the associative memory task elicited stronger theta oscillations than did item memory and that stronger theta power was related to memory performance. Conclusions: We show here for the first time that stimulation-induced associative memory enhancement was linked to increased theta power during retrieval. These results suggest that hippocampal stimulation enhances associative memory but not item memory because it engages more hippocampal theta activity and that, in general, increasing hippocampal theta may provide a neural mechanism for successful memory enhancement.

Possible effects of RF-EMF emitted by Wi-Fi networks on sleep-dependent memory consolidation processes have not been investigated so far. The present study explored the impact of an all-night Wi-Fi (2.45 GHz) exposure on sleep-dependent memory consolidation and its associated physiological correlates. Thirty young males (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]: 24.1 +/- 2.9 years) participated in this double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled crossover study. Participants spent five nights in the laboratory. The first night was an adaptation/screening night. The second and fourth nights were baseline nights, each followed consecutively by an experimental night with either Wi-Fi (maximum: psSAR10g = <25 mW/kg; 6 min average: <6.4 mW/kg) or sham exposure. Declarative, emotional and procedural memory performances were measured using a word pair, a sequential finger tapping and a face recognition task, respectively. Furthermore, learning-associated brain activity parameters (power spectra for slow oscillations and in the spindle frequency range) were analysed. Although emotional and procedural memory were not affected by RF-EMF exposure, overnight improvement in the declarative task was significantly better in the Wi-Fi condition. However, none of the post-learning sleep-specific parameters was affected by exposure. Thus, the significant effect of Wi-Fi exposure on declarative memory observed at the behavioural level was not supported by results at the physiological level. Due to these inconsistencies, this result could also be a random finding.

Previous studies highlight a strong mutual interaction between sleep and stress. In the present study, we investigated the effects of multiple stresses, provoked by animal immobilization in the narrow Plexiglas boxes with additional stress by placing some stones on the floor. Male Wistar rats (n = 14) were subjected to 2 h of immobilization per day in a narrow, uneven and stony place for 3 consecutive days. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded with stainless steel screw electrodes placed over the skull and the electromyogram (EMG) was recorded from dorsal neck muscles. The sleep stages were recorded during 2 h before and 2 h after stress exposure for 3 days. Apart from sleep stages' variations, sleep spindles' density as well as their time- and frequency-domain characteristics were investigated rigorously by a semi-automatic sleep scoring method developed in MATLAB. Results indicate that multiple stresses containing immobilization as well as physical stress attenuate rapid eye movement sleep (REM). However, the stress effect on spindles is more sophisticated in NREM stages. Although spindle density does not undergo a significant change, spindle amplitude and sigma power of EEG during spindles raised significantly. Besides, a decrease in the mean frequency of spindles depicts a dramatic multiplication in delta slow oscillations. An especially mixed immobility including psychological and physical stress which we applied could affect sleep stability through an alteration in the sleep spindles' amplitude and frequency but not the density of spindles and also through a reduction in REM sleep.

Cognitive control improvement serves different functions that differ in part by the type of interference to resolve. Indeed, resisting to interference at the task-set level or at the response-preparation level is, respectively, associated with cognitive flexibility and inhibition. It is, however, unknown whether the same neural mechanism underlies these two functions across development. Studies in adults have revealed the contribution of midfrontal theta (MFT) oscillations in interference resolution. This study investigated whether MFT is involved in the resolution of different types of interference in two age groups identified as corresponding to different latent structures of executive functions. Preschool (4-6 years) and school children (6-8 years) were tested with a task involving interference at the response level and/or the task-set level while (electroencephalogram) EEG was recorded. Behaviorally, response time and accuracy were affected by task-set. Both age groups were less accurate when the interference occurred at the task-set level and only the younger group showed decreased accuracy when interference was presented at the response-preparation level. Furthermore, MFT power was increased, relative to the baseline, during the resolution of both types of interference and in both age groups. These findings suggest that MFT is involved in immature cognitive control (i.e., preschool and school-ages), by orchestrating its different cognitive processes, irrespective of the interference to resolve and of the level of cognitive control development (i.e., the degree of differentiation of executive functions).

The effects of roflumilast, a phosphodiesterase type-4 inhibitor, on EEG biomarkers in schizophrenia: A randomised controlled trial	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; roflumilast; PDE4; PDE4 inhibition; cognition; EEG	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; FRONTAL THETA; ROLIPRAM; P300; ABNORMALITIES	Background: Patients with schizophrenia have significant cognitive deficits, which may profoundly impair quality of life. These deficits are also evident at the neurophysiological level with patients demonstrating altered event-related potential in several stages of cognitive processing compared to healthy controls; within the auditory domain, for example, there are replicated alterations in Mismatch Negativity, P300 and Auditory Steady State Response. However, there are no approved pharmacological treatments for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Aims: Here we examine whether the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, roflumilast, can improve neurophysiological deficits in schizophrenia. Methods: Using a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design study in 18 patients with schizophrenia, the effect of the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, roflumilast (100 mu g and 250 mu g) on auditory steady state response (early stage), mismatch negativity and theta (intermediate stage) and P300 (late stage) was examined using electroencephalogram. A total of 18 subjects were randomised and included in the analysis. Results: Roflumilast 250 mu g significantly enhanced the amplitude of both the mismatch negativity (p=0.04) and working memory-related theta oscillations (p=0.02) compared to placebo but not in the other (early- or late-stage) cognitive markers. Conclusions: The results suggest that phosphodiesterase-4 inhibition, with roflumilast, can improve electroencephalogram cognitive markers, which are impaired in schizophrenia, and that phosphodiesterase-4 inhibition acts at an intermediate rather than early or late cognitive processing stage. This study also underlines the use of neurophysiological measures as cognitive biomarkers in experimental medicine.

Small vessel disease is considered a global brain disease impacting the integrity of neuronal networks resulting in disturbances of structural and functional connectivity. A core feature of cerebral small vessel disease commonly present on neuroimaging is white matter hyperintensities. We studied high-resolution resting-state EEG, leveraging source reconstruction methods, in 35 participants with varying degree of white matter hyperintensities without clinically evident cognitive impairment in an observational study. In patients with increasing white matter lesion load, global theta power was increased independently of age. Whole-brain functional connectivity revealed a disrupted network confined to the alpha band in participants with higher white matter hyperintensities lesion load. The decrease of functional connectivity was evident in long-range connections, mostly originating or terminating in the frontal lobe. Cognitive testing revealed no global cognitive impairment; however, some participants revealed deficits of executive functions that were related to larger white matter hyperintensities lesion load. In summary, participants without clinical signs of mild cognitive impairment or dementia showed oscillatory changes that were significantly related to white matter lesion load. Hence, oscillatory neuronal network changes due to white matter lesions might act as biomarker prior to clinically relevant behavioural impairment.

Neural oscillations in the theta band are increasingly recognized as having a crucial role in executive control network. The purpose of this study was to investigate the alterations in the theta band in executive control network and explore the functional brain network mechanisms of executive control dysfunction in TLE patients. Methods A total of 20 TLE patients and 20 matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited in the present study. All participants were trained to perform the executive control task by attention network test while the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded. The resting state signals were collected from the EEG in the subjects with quiet and closed eyes conditions. Functional connectivity among EEGs in the executive control network and resting state network were respectively calculated. Results We found the significant executive control impairment in the TLE group. Compared to the HCs, the TLE group showed significantly weaker functional connectivity among EEGs in the executive control network. Moreover, in the TLE group, we found that the functional connectivity was significantly positively correlated with accuracy and negatively correlated with EC_effect. In addition, the functional connectivity of the executive control network was significantly higher than that of the resting state network in the HCs. In the TLE group, however, there was no significant change in functional connectivity strengths between the executive control network and resting state network. Conclusion Our results indicate that the decreased functional connectivity in theta band may provide a potential mechanism for executive control deficits in TLE patients.

Jeffrey			Anterior insula stimulation increases pain threshold in humans: a pilot study	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						insula; pain; EEG; brain stimulation; neuromodulation; laser-evoked potentials; quantitative sensory testing; epilepsy	ATTENTION; CORTEX	OBJECTIVE Chronic pain results in an enormous societal and financial burden. Opioids are the mainstay of treatment, but opioid abuse has led to an epidemic in the United States. Nonpharmacological treatment strategies like deep brain stimulation could be applied to refractory chronic pain if safe and effective brain targets are identified. The anterior insula is a putative mediator of pain-related affective-motivational and cognitive-evaluative cerebral processing. However, the effect of anterior insula stimulation on pain perception is still unknown. Here, the authors provide behavioral and neurophysiological evidence for stimulating the anterior insula as a means of potential therapeutic intervention for patients with chronic pain. METHODS Six patients with epilepsy in whom intracerebral electrodes had been implanted for seizure localization were recruited to the study. The direct anterior insula stimulations were performed in the inpatient epilepsy monitoring unit while subjects were fully awake, comfortable, and without sedating medications. The effects of anterior insula stimulation were assessed with quantitative sensory testing for heat pain threshold, nociceptive-specific cutaneous laser-evoked potentials, and intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Control stimulation of noninsular brain regions was performed to test stimulation specificity. Sham stimulations, in which no current was delivered, were also performed to control for potential placebo effects. The safety of these stimulations was evaluated by bedside physicians, real-time intracranial EEG monitoring, and electrocardiogram recordings. RESULTS Following anterior insula stimulations, the heat pain threshold of each patient significantly increased from baseline (p < 0.001) and correlated with stimulation intensity (regression analysis: beta = 0.5712, standard error 0.070, p < 0.001). Significant changes in ongoing intracranial EEG frequency band powers (p < 0.001), reduction in laser pain inten- sity, and attenuated laser-evoked potentials were also observed following stimulations. Furthermore, the observed behavioral and neurophysiological effects persisted beyond the stimulations. Subjects were not aware of the stimulations, and there were no cardiovascular or untoward effects. CONCLUSIONS Additional, nonpharmacological therapies are imperative for the future management of chronic pain conditions and to mitigate the ongoing opioid crisis. This study suggests that direct stimulation of the anterior insula can safely alter cerebral pain processing in humans. Further investigation of the anterior insula as a potential target for therapeutic neuromodulation is underway.	[Liu, Chang-Chia; Moosa, Shayan; Elias, W.

Evidence accumulation during perceptual decision-making is sensitive to the dynamics of attentional selection	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Decision making; Visual attention; Encephalography; Mixture distribution modelling; Frequency tagging; Multivariate analyses	GAIN-CONTROL; MULTIPLE; SIGNALS; ONSET; TEMPLATE; MODELS; MOTION; SHIFTS; TIME	The ability to select and combine multiple sensory inputs in support of accurate decisions is a hallmark of adaptive behaviour. Attentional selection is often needed to prioritize task-relevant stimuli relative to irrelevant, potentially distracting stimuli. As most studies of perceptual decision-making to date have made use of task-relevant stimuli only, relatively little is known about how attention modulates decision making. To address this issue, we developed a novel 'integrated' decision-making task, in which participants judged the average direction of successive target motion signals while ignoring concurrent and spatially overlapping distractor motion signals. In two experiments that varied the role of attentional selection, we used regression to quantify the influence of target and distractor stimuli on behaviour. Using electroencephalography, we characterised the neural correlates of decision making, attentional selection and feature-specific responses to target and distractor signals. While targets strongly influenced perceptual decisions and associated neural activity, we also found that concurrent and spatially coincident distractors exerted a measurable bias on both behaviour and brain activity. Our findings suggest that attention operates as a real-time but imperfect filter during perceptual decision-making by dynamically modulating the contributions of task-relevant and irrelevant sensory inputs.

However, whether sleep can strengthen deteriorated memories caused by insufficient sleep remains unknown. Here, we showed that sleep restriction in a group of participants caused a reduction in the stability of EEG activity patterns across multiple encoding of the same event during awake, compared with a group of participants that got a full night's sleep. The decrease of neural stability patterns in the sleep-restricted group was associated with higher slow oscillation-spindle coupling during a subsequent night of normal sleep duration, thereby suggesting the instantiation of restorative neural mechanisms adaptively supporting cognition and memory. Importantly, upon awaking, the two groups of participants showed equivalent retrieval accuracy supported by subtle differences in the reinstatement of encoding-related activity: it was longer lasting in sleep-restricted individuals than in controls. In addition, sustained reinstatement over time was associated with increased coupling between spindles and slow oscillations. Taken together, these results suggest that the strength of prior encoding might be an important moderator of memory consolidation during sleep. Supporting this view, spindles nesting in the slow oscillation increased the probability of correct recognition only for weakly encoded memories. Current results demonstrate the benefit that a full night's sleep can induce to impaired memory traces caused by an inadequate amount of sleep.

J	Tamburro, G; di Fronso, S; Robazza, C; Bertollo, M; Comani, S				Tamburro, Gabriella; di Fronso, Selenia; Robazza, Claudio; Bertollo, Maurizio; Comani, Silvia			Modulation of Brain Functional Connectivity and Efficiency During an Endurance Cycling Task: A Source-Level EEG and Graph Theory Approach	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; cycling; functional connectivity; source level; Graph Theory; efficiency; endurance task	MOTOR CORTEX; PROBABILISTIC ATLAS; EXERCISE; FATIGUE; COMMUNICATION; ACTIVATION; COHERENCE	Various methods have been employed to investigate different aspects of brain activity modulation related to the performance of a cycling task. In our study, we examined how functional connectivity and brain network efficiency varied during an endurance cycling task. For this purpose, we reconstructed EEG signals at source level: we computed current densities in 28 anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) through the eLORETA algorithm, and then we calculated the lagged coherence of the 28 current density signals to define the adjacency matrix. To quantify changes of functional network efficiency during an exhaustive cycling task, we computed three graph theoretical indices: local efficiency (LE), global efficiency (GE), and density (D) in two different frequency bands, Alpha and Beta bands, that indicate alertness processes and motor binding/fatigue, respectively. LE is a measure of functional segregation that quantifies the ability of a network to exchange information locally. GE is a measure of functional integration that quantifies the ability of a network to exchange information globally. D is a global measure of connectivity that describes the extent of connectivity in a network. This analysis was conducted for six different task intervals: pre-cycling; initial, intermediate, and final stages of cycling; and active recovery and passive recovery. Fourteen participants performed an incremental cycling task with simultaneous EEG recording and rated perceived exertion monitoring to detect the participants' exhaustion. LE remained constant during the endurance cycling task in both bands. Therefore, we speculate that fatigue processes did not affect the segregated neural processing. We observed an increase of GE in the Alpha band only during cycling, which could be due to greater alertness processes and preparedness to stimuli during exercise. Conversely, although D did not change significantly over time in the Alpha band, its general reduction in the Beta bands during cycling could be interpreted within the framework of the neural efficiency hypothesis, which posits a reduced neural activity for expert/automated performances. We argue that the use of graph theoretical indices represents a clear methodological advancement in studying endurance performance.

It either uses selective attention to individuate a complex, dynamic scene into a few focal objects (i.e., object individuation), or it represents multiple objects as an ensemble by distributing attention more globally across the scene (i.e., ensemble grouping). Neural oscillations may be a key signature for focal object individuation versus distributed ensemble grouping, because they are thought to regulate neural excitability over visual areas through inhibitory control mechanisms. We recorded whole-head MEG data during a multiple-object tracking paradigm, in which human participants (13 female, 11 male) switched between different instructions for object individuation and ensemble grouping on different trials. The stimuli, responses, and the demand to keep track of multiple spatial locations over time were held constant between the two conditions. We observed increased alpha-band power (9-13 Hz) packed into oscillatory bursts in bilateral inferior parietal cortex during multiple-object processing. Single-trial analysis revealed greater burst occurrences on object individuation versus ensemble grouping trials. By contrast, we found no differences using standard analyses on across-trials averaged alpha-band power. Moreover, the bursting effects occurred only below/at, but not above, the typical capacity limits for multiple-object processing (at similar to 4 objects). Our findings reveal the real-time neural correlates underlying the dynamic processing of multiple-object scenarios, which are modulated by grouping strategies and capacity. They support a rhythmic, alpha-pulsed organization of dynamic attention to multiple objects and ensembles.

We also computed sensory-level activity using EEG data and investigated theta and alpha neural oscillations, phase-locking values (PLV), and brain networks. Based on the scores from the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) and Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS), an ADHD-trait group (n= 40) and a normal control group (n= 41) were selected. Participants were required to respond to whether the presented stimulus was at the same location as that presented two trials earlier. The ADHD-trait group showed significantly slower response times than the control group in the spatial 2-back task. In terms of spectrum, the ADHD-trait group showed significantly reduced theta power than the control group. In contrast, the ADHD-trait group exhibited an increased alpha power compared to the control group with the 250-1000 ms interval after stimulus onset. In terms of the PLV, the ADHD-trait group showed significantly weaker theta phase synchrony and fewer connection numbers in frontal-occipital areas than the control group. In terms of the theta brain network, the ADHD-trait group showed a significantly lower clustering coefficient and longer characteristic path length than the control group for the theta band. The present results indicate that college students with ADHD traits have deficits in spatial working memory and that these abnormal activities in neural oscillation, functional connectivity, and the network may contribute to spatial working memory deficits.

These processes are crucial for rehearsing PM intentions in memory and for monitoring the presence of the PM cue in the environment, respectively. Aim: The study took advantage of the excellent spatial and temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to delineate the neural mechanisms of the memory and monitoring processes underlying PM. Method: The spatio-temporal dynamic of theta and alpha oscillations were explored in 21 participants in two PM tasks compared to a baseline condition (i.e., a lexical decision task with no PM instruction). The PM tasks varied for the load of internally-directed attention (Retrospective-load task) vs externally-directed attention (Monitoringload task). Results: Increase in theta activity was observed in the Retrospective-load task, and was particularly expressed in the regions of the Default Mode Network, such as in medial temporal regions, precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex. Alpha decrease was the most relevant feature of the Monitoring-load task, and it was expressed over bilateral occipital, occipito-parietal and fronto-temporal regions, as well as over left dorsal fronto-parietal regions. Conclusions: Theta and alpha oscillations are strictly associated with the direction of attention during the PM tasks. In particular, theta increase is linked to internal attention necessary for maintaining the intention active in working memory, whereas alpha decrease supports the external attention for detecting the PM cue in the environment.

An Investigation Into the Nonlinear Coupling Between CA1 Layers and the Dentate Gyrus	BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cross-frequency coupling; dentate gyrus; nonlinearity; slow gamma; velocity	SOURCE-DENSITY ANALYSIS; HIPPOCAMPAL ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; THETA-RHYTHM; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; UNIT-ACTIVITY; SHARP WAVES; EEG; FREQUENCY	Although the activity from the dentate gyrus is known to have strong connections with other hippocampal layers, the functionality of these connections, that is, the degree to which it drives activity in the downstream regions of the hippocampus, is not well understood. This question is particularly relevant for mesoscale localfield potential (LFP) rhythms such as gamma oscillations. Following the hypothesis that fundamental features of the LFP are consistent with turbulent dynamics, we investigate the crosslayer relationship between the CA1 layers and the dentate gyrus as a function of running speed. In agreement with previous studies, same-layer spectral and bispectral analyses show that increasing input (rat speed) results in an increase of power and nonlinearity (phase coupling) between theta and gamma. The effectiveness of the connection between the 2 regions is investigated using cross-bicoherence analysis. Based on the turbulence interpretation of the evolution of spectra and bispectra as a function of the power input rate, we propose a measure for estimating the strength of the cross-frequency, cross-layer nonlinear forcing, that compares the magnitude of bicoherence (same-layer) and cross-bicoherence (cross-layer). Our results suggest that at moderate speeds gamma in CA1 is mainly driven by local theta, while the coupling of the CA1 gamma to the dentate-gyrus gamma becomes significant. Overall, these data are consistent with the hypothesis of theta-to-gamma energy cascade model for the organization of hippocampal LFP, with theta playing the role of a global pacemaker across the entire hippocampus while gamma is a local oscillation generated by through local anatomical connections.

Although some functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have documented the relationship between reactive and intentional inhibitions, they could not provide pertinent temporal dynamics information due to fMRI's low temporal resolution. Therefore, in the current study, we explored this issue by extracting the time-domain dynamics and oscillatory-power dynamics from electroencephalographic (EEG) data while participants performed a modified Go/NoGo/Choose task, in which free choices trials were integrated with conventional go/nogo trials. Participants were asked to decide for themselves to either inhibit or execute an action for free choices trials, and to respond properly according to go/nogo signal for conventional go/nogo trials. Two important results were obtained. First, for the reactive condition, nogo trials elicited greater N2 and P3 amplitudes and induced more pronounced delta, theta, and beta band oscillations than go trials, while for the intentional condition, nogo trials only elicited greater P3 amplitudes and triggered pronounced beta band oscillations compared to go trials. Second, while the P3/delta, theta, and beta oscillations were larger for reactive nogo trials than for intentional go/nogo trials, the P3/delta and theta oscillations were larger for intentional go/nogo trials than for reactive go trials. Together, these results suggest that there are both similarities and differences in oscillatory dynamics between reactive and intentional inhibitions. This study is the first to investigate the relationship between reactive and intentional inhibitions at the time-frequency domain, and the current results expand our understanding about different inhibitions.

J	Wang, LJ; Suo, T; Zhao, GX				Wang Lijun; Suo Tao; Zhao Guoxiang			The influence of unaware errors on post-error adjustment: Evidence from ectrophysiological analysis	ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						error awareness; post-error adjustment; alpha; proactive control; reactive control	COGNITIVE CONTROL; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; AWARENESS; THETA	Following errors, participants usually recruit more cognitive resources to change error-related behaviors; this phenomenon is termed post-error adjustment. Generally, behavioral adjustments in post-error trials behave as slower subsequent responses and improved accuracy. It is worth noting that we cannot successfully perceive every error we commit in daily life. Several studies found that post-error slowing occurred only after aware errors, suggesting that only aware errors contribute to the phenomenon of post-error adjustment. Moreover, these studies emphasized the role of top-down control in the processing of error awareness. However, a few studies came to the opposite conclusion, finding that post-error adjustment could be modulated by unaware errors in an implicit manner. These studies emphasized the role of bottom-up control in the processing of error awareness. Notably, previous studies have demonstrated that post-error adjustment involves both proactive and reactive cognitive control. Proactive control refers to a goal-driven manner that is actively maintained with sustained attention before the occurrence of cognitively demanding events. Reactive control refers to a bottom-up manner, in which the attentional control is mobilized when the goal-related event is reactivated. Thus, whether different control strategies are adopted by aware and unaware errors remains unclear. To investigate the above issue, we recruited 36 participants to execute an error awareness task based on the go/no-go task. However, data from five participants were removed due to poor EEG records or poor behavioral performance. In the go/no-go error awareness task, participants were instructed to withhold their responses in certain circumstances. The first was when a word was presented on two consecutive trials, and the second was when the font color of the word and its meaning were inconsistent. Additionally, the usage of an error signal button might lead to a response bias toward signaling or not signaling an error. If participants tended to signal errors, they might signal their correct responses as errors, increasing the false alarm rates. If participants did not tend to signal errors, aware errors might be classed as unaware errors. In this case, the measurement of unaware errors might be contaminated by potential conscious error trials. Thus, participants were instructed to respond to indicate their perceived response accuracy in both error and correct cases during the rating screen in the current experiment. Since previous studies have found that neural oscillations reveal the processing of proactive and reactive control. the time-frequency analysis is conducted in this experiment. It has been suggested that the alpha band (8-14 Hz) reflects the trial-by-trial behavioral adjustment. Thus, alpha power is chosen as the neural indicator. As a result, the post-error reaction time indicated two dissociated behavior patterns with speeding up following aware errors and slowing down following unaware errors. However, accuracy in trials following aware and unaware errors was significantly higher than for trials following correct go. At the neural level, alpha (-500 to 500 ms) power was stronger for aware errors than for unaware errors. Moreover, the alpha was activated before the subjective report of error awareness for aware errors, but the alpha was activated after the subjective report of error awareness for unaware errors. Current behavioral results showed that aware and unaware errors both successfully optimized post-error performance, but the two error types adopted different methods to adjust post-error behaviors. The time-frequency analysis revealed that aware errors led to sustained attention control after responses, but unaware errors led to temporary attention control induced by the subjective report of error awareness. Therefore. these findings might suggest that the adjustments following aware errors were based on a strategy such as proactive control, whereas the adjustments following unaware errors were based on a strategy such as reactive control.

Evidence from previous studies has highlighted the relationship between neural oscillatory activities and motor timing processing in neurotypical younger adults; however, it remains unclear how normal aging affects the underlying neural mechanisms of movement in older populations. In the present study, we recorded EEG activities in two groups of younger and older adults while they performed randomized speech and limb motor reaction time tasks cued by temporally predictable and unpredictable sensory stimuli. Our data showed that older adults were significantly slower than their younger counterparts during speech production and limb movement, especially in response to temporally unpredictable sensory stimuli. This behavioral effect was accompanied by significant desynchronization of alpha (7-12 Hz) and beta (13-25 Hz) band neural oscillatory activities in older compared with younger adults, primarily during the preparatory pre-motor phase of responses for speech production and limb movement. In addition, we found that faster motor reaction times in younger adults were significantly correlated with weaker desynchronization of pre-motor alpha and beta band neural activities irrespective of stimulus timing and response modality. However, the pre-motor components of alpha and beta activities were timing-specific in older adults and were more strongly desynchronized in response to temporally predictable sensory stimuli. These findings highlight the role of alpha and beta band neural oscillations in motor timing processing mechanisms and reflect their functional deficits during the planning phase of speech production and limb movement in normal aging.

J	Young, CK; McNaughton, N				Young, Calvin K.; McNaughton, Neil			Mixed Effects of Low-dose Ethanol on Cortical and Hippocampal Theta Oscillations	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						prefrontal; cingulate; retrosplenial; theta; alcohol; anxiolytic	SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; BODY-TEMPERATURE; GRID CELLS; ALCOHOL; BEHAVIOR; RATS; EEG; FREQUENCY; RHYTHM	Ethanol is one of the most widely used drugs - with many psychoactive effects, including anxiolysis. The deleterious effects on brain function and general health of chronic and high-level ethanol use are well-studied. However, the neurophysiology of acute low dose ethanol has not been systematically investigated. Here, we examined the effects of low dose (0.25 and 0.5 g/kg) ethanol on midline (prefrontal, cingulate and retrosplenial) neocortical and hippocampal theta oscillations in freely moving rats. We also tested low dose ethanol on reticular-elicited and running-elicited hippocampal theta frequency and assessed the linear relationship of theta frequency to stimulation intensity and running speed, respectively. Low dose ethanol had mixed effects on neocortical theta oscillations. It most reliably reduced theta frequency, produced a weak inverted-U effect on theta power, and had no detectable effect on cortico-hippocampal theta coherence. Ethanol dose-dependently decreased the y-intercept of the speed-theta frequency function without affecting the slope, but decreased the slope of the stimulation intensity-theta frequency function without affecting the y-intercept; thus decreasing theta frequency in both cases. We conclude low dose ethanol has weak but detectable effects on neocortical and hippocampal theta oscillations. These effects may underlie positive cognitive and behavioural outcomes reported in the literature using low dose ethanol. The double dissociation of slope and y-intercept specific changes relating to different methods of hippocampal theta elicitation presents the potential to probe multiple mechanisms contributing to anxiolytic effects on theta and so hippocampal function.

We hypothesized that sleep spindle and slow oscillation (SO) activity is impaired in RLS, and that this dysfunction may contribute to sleep disturbance in these patients. To address this issue, we characterized sleep spindle and SO activity in RLS. Methods: Fifteen drug-naive, idiopathic RLS patients (13 female and 2 male) and 15 female healthy controls participated in this study. Nineteen-channel electroencephalograms were obtained during polysomnographic (PSG) recordings. An automated sleep spindle and SO detection algorithm was used to detect sleep spindle (12-16 Hz) and SO (<1 Hz) activity. The quantitative characteristics of sleep spindle and SO activity were investigated. Results: Compared with the healthy controls, in RLS patients, we observed density and power reduction in sleep spindles. In SOs, density reduction and duration increment were shown in RLS patients. In addition, SO-spindle coordination was deficient in RLS as revealed by reduced SO locked spindle power, dispersed and delayed spindle phase, and decreased SO-spindle coupling. Although sleep spindle power was negatively correlated with wake after sleep onset (WASO) time, SO duration was positively correlated with the arousal index in RLS. Conclusions: Our study suggests that sleep disturbances may be mediated by a combined deficit in spindle and SO activity and SO-spindle coordination. The abnormal SO and spindle activity observed in RLS support the notion that thalamocortical abnormalities underlie this condition and may promote disturbed sleep integrity. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Patterns of the EEG theta rhythm modulations when attending to speech by orphans in early childhood	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA			Russian	Article						speech perception; EEG; theta rhythm; normal speech; reversed speech; Orphanage	MU RHYTHM; DEVELOPMENTAL DIFFERENCES; LANGUAGE; PERCEPTION; CHILDREN; DYNAMICS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; REACTIVITY; RESPONSES	The first years of a child's life are a critical period for the development of cognitive functions, in particular, a capacity for speech. Rearing conditions when applied to orphans may have an effect on neurophysiological mechanisms underlying their speech understanding, which is reflected in the EEG theta rhythm power changes. Individual theta rhythm frequency ranges are to be determined first, as they may vary for each child depending on age and individual characteristics of the central nervous system. The aim of our work was to analyze the EEG theta rhythm power reactivity in its individually determined frequency ranges when institutionally reared early-aged orphans attended to normal speech and speech-like signals, compared to their peers reared in their biological families. The study involved 107 children aged 24 to 42 months. The main group included 54 children (19 girls and 35 boys) brought up in the orphanage. The control group comprised 53 children (21 girls and 32 boys) reared by their biological parents. The EEG was recorded at frontal (F3, F4, F7, F8), central (C3, C4), temporal (T3, T4, T5, T6) and parietal (P3, P4) sites in three experimental conditions: in a wakeful rest state with open eyes (baseline EEG, duration 20-30 s); when listening to a normal speech (a verse with animal-characters, duration 20 s, female voice); when listening to the same speech reversed with the help of the Wave Editor software application (reversed speech). The order of presentation for the second and third conditions was randomized. To determine individual theta rhythm frequency bands, we calculated means of spectral density power, first log-transformed to help normalize distributions. To compare the EEG theta rhythm power reactivity when children in both groups attended to the normal and reversed speech stimuli relative to the baseline condition, power reactivity indices were calculated for each of the EEG sites. Significance of changes in the EEG theta rhythm power when attending to the normal or reversed speech relative to the baseline, as well as inter-group differences in reactivity indices, were assessed with the repeated measures ANOVA. The study revealed the patterns of the EEG theta rhythm power changes depending on experimental situations and EEG sites characteristic for children in both groups (See Table 1). We found ssignificant theta rhythm power changes yet of opposite directions for the control group under the normal speech condition. Theta rhythm power increased in the right frontal locus, the left anterior temporal locus and the parietal loci in both hemispheres, and decreased in the left frontal and posterior temporal loci and the right central and posterior loci (See Fig. 1, a). It seems plausible that the process of speech perception in typically developing children is associated both with searching one's memory for phonological, syntactic and semantic features in heard words and their integration into a holistic message, and with attentional processes, associated with increases and decreases in theta rhythm power in different areas of the cerebral cortex. Compared to normal speech, presentation of a reversed signal to the control group children caused a more pronounced and widespread theta activity growth in different cortex areas. This phenomenon is likely to be associated with an increase in load on memory when children tried to recognize familiar words in a reversed audio signal. In the group of institution-reared children, when they attended both to the normal and reversed speech stimuli, significant changes in theta rhythm power were found at fewer sites compared to the control group children. When they attended to the normal speech, a significant power increase occurred only at the right posterior temporal site. When attending to the reversed signal, theta rhythm power increased in the frontal (F3, F8) and posterior temporal (T5, T6) loci (See Fig. 1, b). We found differences in theta rhythm reactivity indices under conditions of attending to the normal and reversed speech in children as depending on group and site factors (See Table 2). Theta rhythm reactivity when attending to the normal and reversed speech in the main group compared to the control revealed a large number of significant differences at different sites (See Fig. 2). It is suggested that when recognizing or trying to recognize individual words, meaning and emotional load in sentences, institutionally reared children tend to contribute considerably less cognitive resources than family-reared children. We consider the reduced orphans'capacity to engage cognitive resources in mentioned situations to be the result of insufficient experience of close social interactions with adults. Given the established association between theta oscillations and memory processes, we can assume that speech memory traces in children belonging to the studied groups are represented differently in various neocortex areas due to a different experience of their formation when raised in the family and the orphanage.

However, there is less evidence on the alterations of brain complexity in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we investigated the altered complexity of resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent signals in AD-related neurodegeneration using multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis. All participants were recruited from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, including healthy controls (HC, n=62), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, n=81) patients, and Alzheimer's disease (AD, n=25) patients. Our results showed time scale-dependent MSE differences across the three groups. In scale=1, significantly changed MSE patterns (HC>aMCI>AD) were found in four brain regions, including the hippocampus, middle frontal gyrus, intraparietal lobe, and superior frontal gyrus. In scale=4, reversed MSE patterns (HC<aMCI<AD) were found in the middle frontal gyrus and middle occipital gyrus. Furthermore, the values of regional entropy were significantly associated with cognitive functions positively on the short time scale, while negatively on the longer time scale. Our findings suggest that MSE could be a reliable measure for characterizing brain deterioration in AD and may provide insights into the neural mechanism of AD-related neurodegeneration.

Entraining Alpha Activity Using Visual Stimulation in Patients With Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain: A Feasibility Study	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha activity; chronic pain; electroencephalography; entrainment; visual stimulation	PERIPHERAL ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; LOW-BACK-PAIN; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; HOSPITAL ANXIETY; CLINICAL-TRIALS; HZ FLICKER; BOTTOM-UP; TOP-DOWN; EEG; PERCEPTION	Entraining alpha activity with rhythmic visual, auditory, and electrical stimulation can reduce experimentally induced pain. However, evidence for alpha entrainment and pain reduction in patients with chronic pain is limited. This feasibility study investigated whether visual alpha stimulation can increase alpha power in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain and, secondarily, if chronic pain was reduced following stimulation. In a within-subject design, 20 patients underwent 4-min periods of stimulation at 10 Hz (alpha), 7 Hz (high-theta, control), and 1 Hz (control) in a pseudo-randomized order. Patients underwent stimulation both sitting and standing and verbally rated their pain before and after each stimulation block on a 0-10 numerical rating scale. Global alpha power was significantly higher during 10 Hz compared to 1 Hz stimulation when patients were standing (t= -6.08,p< 0.001). On a more regional level, a significant increase of alpha power was found for 10 Hz stimulation in the right-middle and left-posterior region when patients were sitting. With respect to our secondary aim, no significant reduction of pain intensity and unpleasantness was found. However, only the alpha stimulation resulted in a minimal clinically important difference in at least 50% of participants for pain intensity (50%) and unpleasantness ratings (65%) in the sitting condition. This study provides initial evidence for the potential of visual stimulation as a means to enhance alpha activity in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. The brief period of stimulation was insufficient to reduce chronic pain significantly. This study is the first to provide evidence that a brief period of visual stimulation at alpha frequency can significantly increase alpha power in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. A further larger study is warranted to investigate optimal dose and individual stimulation parameters to achieve pain relief in these patients.

Compared to age-matched healthy individuals, patients with Parkinson's disease bear a 6-fold lifetime risk of dementia. For individualized counselling and treatment, prognostic biomarkers for assessing future cognitive deterioration in early stages of Parkinson's disease are needed. In a case-control study, 42 cognitively normal patients with Parkinson's disease were compared with 24 healthy control participants matched for age, sex and education. Tsallis entropy and band power of the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma-band were evaluated in baseline EEG at eyes-open and eyes-closed condition. As the theta-band showed the most pronounced differences between Parkinson's disease and healthy control groups, further analysis focussed on this band. Tsallis entropy was then compared across groups with 16 psychological test scores at baseline and follow-ups at 6 months and 3 years. In group comparison, patients with Parkinson's disease showed lower Tsallis entropy than healthy control participants. Cognitive deterioration at 3 years was correlated with Tsallis entropy in the eyes-open condition (P < 0.00079), whereas correlation at 6 months was not yet significant. Tsallis entropy measured in the eyes-closed condition did not correlate with cognitive outcome. In conclusion, the lower the EEG entropy levels at baseline in the eyes-open condition, the higher the probability of cognitive decline over 3 years. This makes Tsallis entropy a candidate prognostic biomarker for dementia in Parkinson's disease. The ability of the cortex to execute complex functions underlies cognitive health, whereas cognitive decline might clinically appear when compensatory capacity is exhausted.

Recent findings from our lab reveal significant sleep and sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) changes owing to three months exposure to dim-light-at-night (DLAN). Aiming to further explore the detrimental effects of DLAN exposure, in the present study, we continuously recorded sleep EEG and the electromyogram for baseline 24-h and following 6-h sleep deprivation in a varied DLAN duration scheme. C57BL/6J mice were exposed to a 12:12 h light:DLAN cycle (75lux:5lux) vs. a 12:12 h light:dark cycle (75lux:0lux) for one day, one week, and one month. Our results show that sleep was already affected by a mere day of DLAN exposure with additional complications emerging with increasing DLAN exposure duration, such as the gradual delay of the daily 24-h vigilance state rhythms. We conducted detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) on the locomotor activity data following 1-month and 3-month DLAN exposure, and a significantly less healthy rest-activity pattern, based on the decreased alpha values, was found in both conditions compared to the control light-dark. Taking into account the behavioral, sleep and the sleep EEG parameters, our data suggest that DLAN exposure, even in the shortest duration, induces deleterious effects; nevertheless, potential compensatory mechanisms render the organism partly adjustable and able to cope. We think that, for this reason, our data do not always depict linear divergence among groups, as compared with control conditions. Chronic DLAN exposure impacts the sleep regulatory system, but also brain integrity, diminishing its adaptability and reactivity, especially apparent in the sleep EEG alterations and particular low alpha values following DFA.

In order to identify general, task-independent MI ability correlates, 16 volunteers were stratified with MIQ-3. The scores in the kinaesthetic (K) and 1st-person visual (V) perspectives were associated with EEG patterns obtained during K-MI and V-MI of the same complex MIQ-3 movements during these MI tasks (Spearman's correlation, significance at <0.05, SnPM corrected). EEG measures were relative to rest (relaxation, closed eyes), and based on six electrode clusters both for band spectral content and connectivity (Granger causality). Lower K-MI ability was associated with greater theta decreases during tasks in fronto-central clusters and greater inward information flow to prefrontal clusters for theta, high alpha and beta bands. On the other hand, power band relative decreases were associated with V-MI ability in fronto-central clusters for low alpha and left fronto-central and both centro-parietal clusters for beta bands. The results thus suggest different computational mechanisms for MI-V and MI-K. The association between low alpha/beta desynchronization and V-MIQ scores and between theta changes and K-MIQ scores suggest a cognitive effort with greater cerebral activation in participants with lower V-MI ability. The association between information flow to prefrontal hub and K-MI ability suggest the need for a continuous update of information to support MI-related executive functions in subjects with poor K-MI ability.

We reviewed the electroencephalogram (EEG) database of Linyi People's Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University and medical records of patients with ENM onset. The characteristics of epileptic seizures, onset age, treatment process, growth and development history, past disease history, family history, degree of mental deterioration, cranial imaging, and video-EEG were studied retrospectively and followed up. There were 4 cases with ENM onset and 1 with continuous ENM, 3 males and 1 female. The onset age was from 2 years 3 months to 8 years 7 months. The cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and developmental quotient, as well as the family, personal, and past disease history, were normal. Frequent falls and drops were the main clinical manifestations. Five months after the onset of ENM, case 1 had focal seizures in sleep. ENM was the first and only manifestation in all the other 3 children. Discharges of interictal EEG were in bilateral rolandic areas, especially in midline areas (Cz, Pz), electrical status epilepticus in sleep was found in 3 cases. One child was sensitive to levetiracetam, the other 3 were sensitive to clonazepam. ENM can affect the upper or lower extremities. ENM as the first or only symptom was a special phenomenon in benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) variants. Ignorance of midline spikes mainly in Cz or Pz in BECTS might lead to missed diagnosis of ENM. Whether benzodiazepines are viable as a choice of BECTS variants with electrical status epilepticus in sleep when ENM is the first symptom still needs a large sample evidence-based observation.

According to this model, three specific subnets (or modules) of the brain self-referential network (SRN) are responsible for the manifestation of three aspects/features of the subjective sense of Selfhood. Follow up multiple studies established a tight relation between alterations in the functional integrity of the triad of SRN modules and related to them three aspects/features of the sense of self; however, the causality of this relation is yet to be shown. In this article we approached the question of causality by exploring functional integrity within the three SRN modules that are thought to underlie the three phenomenal components of Selfhood while these components were manipulated mentally by experienced meditators in a controlled and independent manner. Participants were requested, in a block-randomised manner, to mentally induce states representing either increased (up-regulation) or decreased (down-regulation) sense of (a) witnessing agency ("Self"), or (b) body representational-emotional agency ("Me"), or (c) reflective/narrative agency ("I"), while their brain activity was recorded by an electroencephalogram (EEG). This EEG-data was complemented by first-person phenomenological reports and standardised questionnaires which focused on subjective contents of three aspects of Selfhood. The results of the study strengthen the case for a direct causative relationship between three phenomenological aspects of Selfhood and related to them three modules of the brain SRN. Furthermore, the putative integrative model of the dynamic interrelations among three modules of the SRN has been proposed.

In this paper, to decode pigeon behavior outcomes in goal-directed decision task, an experiment based on plus maze was designed and the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) of the pigeon was selected as the target brain region. The local field potential (LFP) signals in the waiting area (WA) and turning area (TA) were recorded when the pigeons performed the goal-directed tasks. Then, the brain functional connection networks of the LFPs were constructed and the extracted features were applied to decode pigeon behavior outcomes. Firstly, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was used to carried out time-frequency analysis and the task-related frequency band (40-60 Hz) was extracted. Then, weighted sparse representation (WSR) method was used to construct the functional connectivity network and the related network features were selected. Finally, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm was used to decode behavior outcomes. The results show that the energy difference between TA and WA in 40-60 Hz band is significantly higher than those in other bands. The selected features have good discriminability for the representation of the differences between WA and TA. The decoding results also suggest the classification performance of the different behavior outcomes. These results show the effectiveness of the WSR to construct the function network to decode behavior outcomes.

J	Menceloglu, M; Grabowecky, M; Suzuki, S				Menceloglu, Melisa; Grabowecky, Marcia; Suzuki, Satoru			EEG state-trajectory instability and speed reveal global rules of intrinsic spatiotemporal neural dynamics	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BAND OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; BETA	Spatiotemporal dynamics of EEG/MEG (electro-/magneto-encephalogram) have typically been investigated by applying time-frequency decomposition and examining amplitude-amplitude, phase-phase, or phase-amplitude associations between combinations of frequency bands and scalp sites, primarily to identify neural correlates of behaviors and traits. Instead, we directly extracted global EEG spatiotemporal dynamics as trajectories ofk-dimensional state vectors (k = the number of estimated current sources) to investigate potential global rules governing neural dynamics. We chose timescale-dependent measures of trajectory instability (approximately the 2(nd) temporal derivative) and speed (approximately the 1(st)temporal derivative) as state variables, that succinctly characterized trajectory forms. We compared trajectories across posterior, central, anterior, and lateral scalp regions as the current sources under those regions may serve distinct functions. We recorded EEG while participants rested with their eyes closed (likely engaged in spontaneous thoughts) to investigate intrinsic neural dynamics. Some potential global rules emerged. Time-averaged trajectory instability from all five regions tightly converged (with their variability minimized) at the level of generating nearly unconstrained but slightly conservative turns (similar to 100 degrees on average) on the timescale of similar to 25 ms, suggesting that spectral-amplitude profiles are globally adjusted to maintain this convergence. Further, within-frequency and cross-frequency phase relations appear to be independently coordinated to reduce average trajectory speed and increase the variability in trajectory speed and instability in a relatively timescale-invariant manner, and to make trajectories less oscillatory. Future research may investigate the functional relevance of these intrinsic global-dynamics rules by examining how they adjust to various sensory environments and task demands or remain invariant. The current results also provide macroscopic constraints for quantitative modeling of neural dynamics as the timescale dependencies of trajectory instability and speed are relatable to oscillatory dynamics.

Inhibition of a previous response and mismatch interference induced by response-repetition have been proposed as sources of negative response-repetition effects by the response inhibition account and episodic binding and retrieval model, respectively. The present study utilized electroencephalograph (EEG) to investigate the mechanism underlying negative response-repetition effects. Lateralized enhancements in the upper-alpha and beta bands served as indexes of response inhibition, and significant lateralized beta enhancements appeared after the previous response execution. About 500-600 ms after the onset of current stimuli, event-related potentials presented significant response-repeat negativity in the task-switch sequence, indicating the occurrence of mismatch interference induced by response repetition. Moreover, lateralized beta enhancements and response-repeat negativity were each positively related to behavioral negative response-repetition effects. These results suggest that both response inhibition and mismatch interference induced by response repetition make contributions to negative response-repetition effects.

Epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are common and complexly related to sleep disorders. We tested whether well characterized mutations in KCNJ10 could result in specific sleep electrophysiological features, paving the way to the discovery of a potentially relevant biomarker for Kir4.1-related disorders. Methods: For this case-control study, we recruited seven children with ASD either comorbid or not with epilepsy and/or EEG paroxysmal abnormalities (AEP) carrying GoF mutations of KCNJ10 and seven children with similar phenotypes but wild-type for the same gene, comparing period-amplitude features of slow waves detected by fronto-central bipolar EEG derivations (F3-C3, F4-C4, and Fz-Cz) during daytime naps. Results: Children with Kir4.1 mutations displayed longer slow waves periods than controls, in Fz-Cz (mean period = 112,617 ms SE = 0.465 in mutated versus mean period = 105,249 ms +/- SE = 0.375 in controls, p < 0.001). An analog result was found in F3-C3 (mean period = 125,706 ms +/- SE = 0.397 in mutated versus mean period = 120,872 ms +/- SE = 0.472 in controls, p < 0.001) and F4-C4 (mean period = 127,914 ms +/- SE = 0.557 in mutated versus mean period = 118,174 ms +/- SE = 0.442 in controls, p < 0.001). Conclusion: This preliminary finding suggests that period-amplitude slow wave features are modified in subjects carrying Kir4.1 GoF mutations. Potential clinical applications of this finding are discussed.

Methods EEG data were collected while 28 satiated adolescents (14 overweight/obese) viewed pictures of neutral, low-calorie food, and high-calorie food stimuli and rated their desire to eat, before having access to high-calorie snacks. Results Unlike normal-weight adolescents, overweight/obese participants showed similar P300 amplitudes for high- and low-calorie food, and strongest event-related alpha band desynchronization for low-calorie stimuli. P300 amplitudes and state craving for low-calorie food furthermore predicted snack intake in this group. Conclusions The current research focus in overweight/obesity might need to be extended to include low-calorie food. While all participants showed an attentional bias for high-calorie food, it was the processing of low-calorie food which distinguished the two weight groups on measures of neural activity and which was associated with snack food intake in the overweight/obese group.

Delta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling as a biomarker of postictal generalized EEG suppression	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						epilepsy; seizure; PGES; phase-amplitude coupling; SUDEP	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; ONSET ZONE LOCALIZATION; SUDEP; CONNECTIVITY; SERIES; STATE	Postictal generalized EEG suppression is the state of suppression of electrical activity at the end of a seizure. Prolongation of this state has been associated with increased risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, making characterization of underlying electrical rhythmic activity during postictal suppression an important step in improving epilepsy treatment. Phase-amplitude coupling in EEG reflects cognitive coding within brain networks and some of those codes highlight epileptic activity; therefore, we hypothesized that there are distinct phase-amplitude coupling features in the postictal suppression state that can provide an improved estimate of this state in the context of patient risk for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. We used both intracranial and scalp EEG data from eleven patients (six male, five female; age range 21-41 years) containing 25 seizures, to identify frequency dynamics, both in the ictal and postictal EEG suppression states. Cross-frequency coupling analysis identified that during seizures there was a gradual decrease of phase frequency in the coupling between delta (0.5-4 Hz) and gamma (30+ Hz), which was followed by an increased coupling between the phase of 0.5-1.5 Hz signal and amplitude of 30-50 Hz signal in the postictal state as compared to the pre-seizure baseline. This marker was consistent across patients. Then, using these postictal-specific features, an unsupervised state classifier-a hidden Markov model-was able to reliably classify four distinct states of seizure episodes, including a postictal suppression state. Furthermore, a connectome analysis of the postictal suppression states showed increased information flow within the network during postictal suppression states as compared to the pre-seizure baseline, suggesting enhanced network communication. When the same tools were applied to the EEG of an epilepsy patient who died unexpectedly, ictal coupling dynamics disappeared and postictal phase-amplitude coupling remained constant throughout. Overall, our findings suggest that there are active postictal networks, as defined through coupling dynamics that can be used to objectively classify the postictal suppression state; furthermore, in a case study of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, the network does not show ictal-like phase-amplitude coupling features despite the presence of convulsive seizures, and instead demonstrates activity similar to postictal. The postictal suppression state is a period of elevated network activity as compared to the baseline activity which can provide key insights into the epileptic pathology.

Rescue of PB-resistant neonatal seizures with single-dose of small-molecule TrkB antagonist show long-term benefits	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Refractory seizures; Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; Gamma oscillations; Sleep dysfunction; Hyperactivity	HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; OUTCOME SECONDARY ANALYSES; NO INDEPENDENT IMPACT; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; CLINICAL SEIZURES; MOUSE MODEL; RAT MODEL; FREQUENCY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; SUSCEPTIBILITY	A recently characterized CD-1 mouse model of phenobarbital (PB)-resistant neonatal ischemic-seizures (i.e.; unilateral carotid ligation) was shown to be associated with age-dependent (P7 vs. P10) acute seizure severity and PB-efficacy (i.e.; PB-resistant vs. PB-responsive). ANA12, a novel small-molecule TrkB antagonist, rescued the PB-resistance at P7 in a dose-dependent manner and prevented the post-ischemic downregulation of KCC2, the chief Cl- extruder in neurons. The long-term consequences of this novel rescue-intervention with ANA12 + PB in P7 and P10 ligated pups was investigated and compared to the standard first-line protocol of PB-alone loading dose. The mice underwent neurobehavioral testing, 24 h video-EEG-EMG monitoring, and immunohistochemistry in ipsi- and contralateral cortices as adults following the neonatal interventions. ANA12 + PB rescued the emergence of hyperactivity in post-ischemic P7, but not in P10 pups as adults. ANA12 + PB administration at neither P7 nor P10 significantly altered 24 h macro-sleep architecture in adults when compared to PB-alone. Behavioral state-dependent gamma (35-50 Hz) power homeostasis showed the most significant between-group differences that were age-dependent. ANA12 + PB treatment, but not PB-alone, rescued the loss of gamma power homeostasis present in P7 ligate-control but absent in P10 ligate group, highlighting the age-dependence. In contrast, PB-alone treatment, but not ANA12 + PB, significantly reduced the elevated delta-AUC observed in P10 ligate-controls, when PB is efficacious by itself. These results indicate that the rescue of acute PB-resistant neonatal seizures using a novel intervention positively modulates the long-term outcomes at P7 when the seizures are refractory.	[Kang, S.

Development of Neural Structure and Function in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Potential Implications for Learning Language	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY			English	Article							CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; CHILDREN; SPEECH; CONNECTIVITY; METAANALYSIS; INFANTS; RISK; FMRI	Purpose: Neurodevelopmental processes that begin during gestation and continue throughout childhood typically support language development. Understanding these processes can help us to understand the disruptions to language that occur in neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Method: For this tutorial, we conducted a focused literature review on typical postnatal brain development and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, magnetoencephalography, and electroencephalography studies of the neurodevelopmental differences that occur in ASD. We then integrated this knowledge with the literature on evidence-based speech-language intervention practices for autistic children. Results: In ASD, structural differences include altered patterns of cortical growth and myelination. Functional differences occur at all brain levels, from lateralization of cortical functions to the rhythmic activations of single neurons. Neuronal oscillations, in particular, could help explain disrupted language development by elucidating the timing differences that contribute to altered functional connectivity, complex information processing, and speech parsing. Findings related to implicit statistical learning, explicit task learning, multisensory integration, and reinforcement in ASD are also discussed. Conclusions: Consideration of the neural differences in autistic children provides additional scientific support for current recommended language intervention practices. Recommendations consistent with these neurological findings include the use of short, simple utterances; repetition of syntactic structures using varied vocabulary; pause time; visual supports; and individualized sensory modifications.

Methods Sixty-seven patients (36 women, mean age = 50.34 +/- 12.94 years) with chronic tinnitus were assigned to either a high (HD) or low (LD) tinnitus-related distress group based on THI results. All participants took part in the EEG study comprising two 3-4 min blocks of focusing on either tinnitus (Tinnitus Focus Condition, TFC) or the sensations from one's own body (Body Focus Condition, BFC). The absolute power and current density of 8 frequency bands in 7 clusters were compared between conditions and groups. Results The most pronounced differences were found in the HD patients in the TFC, relative to the BFC, i.e. reduced power of frontally distributed low alpha (8-10 Hz) and posterior high alpha (10-12 Hz) as well as lower current density of 8-10 Hz rhythm over the right frontal/anterior cingulate cortex and higher middle beta (15-18 Hz) density in the precuneus. The HD, relative to LD patients, in both conditions, exhibited increased low beta (12-15 Hz) power over the left middle area and greater higher beta (15-25 Hz) power in the left posterior region. Conclusions The present study contrasted bioelectrical activity, acquired when concentrating on tinnitus with EEG data collected whilst patients focused on their body. Decreased alpha power and current density in the frontal/cingulate cortex when listening to bothersome tinnitus might reflect greater cortical arousal whereas increased beta power and density in the precuneus/posterior cingulate activity in this condition could be indicative for elevated tension or augmented cognitive/emotional processing of tinnitus sound. Enhanced beta rhythm in patients with highversuslow tinnitus distress, observed independently of the study condition, may be due to greater self-focused attention or more active processing of sensations derived from the own body.

Here, we investigated the extent to which difficulties in refocusing attention extend to naturalistic settings such as simulated driving. A total of 118 participants in five age groups (18-30; 40-49; 50-59; 60-69; 70-91 years) were compared during continuous simulated driving, where they repeatedly switched from braking due to traffic ahead (a spatially focal yet temporally complex task) to reading a motorway road sign (a spatially more distributed task). Sequential-Task (switching) performance was compared to Single-Task performance (road sign only) to calculate age-related switch-costs. Electroencephalography was recorded in 34 participants (17 in the 18-30 and 17 in the 60+ years groups) to explore age-related changes in the neural oscillatory signatures of refocusing attention while driving. We indeed observed age-related impairments in attentional refocusing, evidenced by increased switch-costs in response times and by deficient modulation of theta and alpha frequencies. Our findings highlight virtual reality (VR) and Neuro-VR as important methodologies for future psychological and gerontological research.

EEG microstates of dreams	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							NREM SLEEP; REM-SLEEP; BRAIN; STATE; MENTATION; NUMBER; RECALL; OSCILLATIONS; WAKEFULNESS; ACTIVATION	Why do people sometimes report that they remember dreams, while at other times they recall no experience? Despite the interest in dreams that may happen during the night, it has remained unclear which brain states determine whether these conscious experiences will occur and what prevents us from waking up during these episodes. Here we address this issue by comparing the EEG activity preceding awakenings with recalled vs. no recall of dreams using the EEG microstate approach. This approach characterizes transiently stable brain states of sub-second duration that involve neural networks with nearly synchronous dynamics. We found that two microstates (3 and 4) dominated during NREM sleep compared to resting wake. Further, within NREM sleep, microstate 3 was more expressed during periods followed by dream recall, whereas microstate 4 was less expressed. Source localization showed that microstate 3 encompassed the medial frontal lobe, whereas microstate 4 involved the occipital cortex, as well as thalamic and brainstem structures. Since NREM sleep is characterized by low-frequency synchronization, indicative of neuronal bistability, we interpret the increased presence of the "frontal" microstate 3 as a sign of deeper local deactivation, and the reduced presence of the "occipital" microstate 4 as a sign of local activation. The latter may account for the occurrence of dreaming with rich perceptual content, while the former may account for why the dreaming brain may undergo executive disconnection and remain asleep. This study demonstrates that NREM sleep consists of alternating brain states whose temporal dynamics determine whether conscious experience arises.

One major challenge is to understand how cortical circuits at drastically different spatial scales, from local networks to brain-scale networks, operate in concert to enable consciousness, and how those processes are impaired in DOC patients. In this review, we attempt to relate available neurophysiological and clinical data with existing theoretical models of consciousness, while linking the micro- and macrocircuit levels. First, we address the relationships between awareness and wakefulness on the one hand, and cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical connectivity on the other hand. Second, we discuss the role of three main types of GABAergic interneurons in specific circuits responsible for the dynamical reorganization of functional networks. Third, we explore advances in the functional role of nested oscillations for neural synchronization and communication, emphasizing the importance of the balance between local (high-frequency) and distant (low-frequency) activity for efficient information processing. The clinical implications of these theoretical considerations are presented. We propose that such cellular-scale mechanisms could extend current theories of consciousness.

Lateralized alpha oscillations are irrelevant for the behavioral retro-cueing benefit in visual working memory	PEERJ			English	Article						Neural oscillations; Alpha rhythm; Alpha lateralization; Visual attention; Vision; Working memory; Hemispheric lateralization; Retro-cue; Short term memory	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; ORIENTING ATTENTION; EEG; INHIBITION; DYNAMICS; REPRESENTATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; MAINTENANCE; SUPPRESSION; MODULATION	The limited capacity of visual working memory (vWM) necessitates the efficient allocation of available resources by prioritizing relevant over irrelevant items. Retrocues, which inform about the future relevance of items after encoding has already finished, can improve the quality of memory representations of the relevant items. A candidate mechanism of this retro-cueing benefit is lateralization of neural oscillations in the alpha-band, but its precise role is still debated. The relative decrease of alpha power contralateral to the relevant items has been interpreted as supporting inhibition of irrelevant distractors or as supporting maintenance of relevant items. Here, we aimed at resolving this debate by testing how the magnitude of alpha-band lateralization affects behavioral performance: does stronger lateralization improve the precision of the relevant memory or does it reduce the biasing influence of the irrelevant distractor? We found that it does neither: while the data showed a clear retro-cue benefit and a biasing influence of non-target items as well as clear cue-induced alpha-band lateralization, the magnitude of this lateralization was not correlated with any performance parameter. This finding may indicate that alpha-band lateralization, which is typically observed in response to mnemonic cues, indicates an automatic shift of attention that only coincides with, but is not directly involved in mnemonic prioritization.

Spatial Attentional Selection Modulates Early Visual Stimulus Processing Independently of Visual Alpha Modulations	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						alpha oscillations; EEG; spatial attention; steady-state visual evoked potentials; vision	STEADY-STATE; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; TIME-COURSE; BEHAVIORAL PERFORMANCE; OSCILLATORY POWER; BAND ACTIVITY; CUED SHIFTS; CORTEX; SUPPRESSION; PERCEPTION	The capacity-limited human brain is constantly confronted with a huge amount of sensory information. Selective attention is needed for biasing neural processing towards relevant information and consequently allows meaningful interaction with the environment. Activity in the alpha-band has been proposed to be related to top-down modulation of neural inhibition and could thus represent a viable candidate to control the priority of stimulus processing. It is, however, unknown whether modulations in the alpha-band directly relate to changes in the sensory gain control of the early visual cortex. Here, we used a spatial cueing paradigm while simultaneously measuring ongoing alpha-band oscillations and steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) as a marker of continuous early sensory processing in the human visual cortex. Thereby, the effects of spatial attention for both of these signals and their potential interactions were assessed. As expected, spatial attention modulated both alpha-band and SSVEP responses. However, their modulations were independent of each other and the corresponding activity profiles differed across task demands. Thus, our results challenge the view that modulations of alpha-band activity represent a mechanism that directly alters or controls sensory gain. The potential role of alpha-band oscillations beyond sensory processing will be discussed in light of the present results.	[Gundlach, C.; Forschack, N.; Mueller, M.

Machine Learning techniques are required to expand the understanding of oscillatory signatures. In this work, we propose a methodological pipeline to develop machine learning models for the classification between expert and nonexpert meditative state. We carried out this study utilizing the online repository consisting of EEG dataset of 24 meditators that categorized as 12 experts and 12 nonexperts meditators. The pipeline consists of four stages that include feature engineering, machine learning classifiers, feature selection, and visualization. We decomposed signals using five wavelet families consisting of Haar, Biorthogonal(1.3-6.8), Daubechies( orders 2-10), Coiflet(orders 1-5), and Symlet(2-8), followed by feature extraction using relative entropy and power. We classified the meditative state between expert and non-expert meditators employing twelve classifiers to build machine learning models. Wavelet coefficients d8 shows the maximum classification accuracy in all the wavelet families. Wavelet orders Bior3.5 and Coif3 produce the maximum classification performance with the detail coefficient d8 using relative power. We have successfully classified the meditative state between expert and non-expert with 100% accuracy using d5,d6,d7,d8,a8 coefficients. Multi-Layer Perceptron and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis attain the highest accuracy. We have figured out the most discriminating channels during classification and reported 20 channels involving frontal, central and parietal regions. We plot the high dimensional structure of data by utilizing two feature reduction techniques PCA and t-SNE.

However, these phenomena have mainly been studied focussing on individual performance. Here, we explored EEG responses to motor prediction errors during a human-avatar interaction and show that Theta/Alpha activity of the frontal error-monitoring system works in phase with activity of the occipito-temporal node of the action observation network. Our motor interaction paradigm required healthy individuals to synchronize their reach-to-grasp movements with those of a virtual partner in conditions that did (Interactive) or did not require (Cued) movement prediction and adaptation to the partner's actions. Crucially, in 30% of the trials the virtual partner suddenly and unpredictably changed its movement trajectory thereby violating the human participant's expectation. These changes elicited error-related neuromarkers (ERN/Pe - Theta/Alpha modulations) over fronto-central electrodes during the Interactive condition. Source localization and connectivity analyses showed that the frontal Theta/Alpha activity induced by violations of the expected interactive movements was in phase with occipito-temporal Theta/Alpha activity. These results expand current knowledge about the neural correlates of on-line interpersonal motor interactions linking the frontal error-monitoring system to visual, body motion-related, responses.

Numerical working memory alters alpha-beta oscillations and connectivity in the parietal cortices	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						neural oscillations; numerical processing; superior parietal cortex; working memory	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; LEFT INTRAPARIETAL SULCUS; ABERRANT NEURAL DYNAMICS; MEG; ATTENTION; EEG; REPRESENTATION; MODULATION; VETERANS; CIRCUITS	Although the neural bases of numerical processing and memory have been extensively studied, much remains to be elucidated concerning the spectral and temporal dynamics surrounding these important cognitive processes. To further this understanding, we employed a novel numerical working memory paradigm in 28 young, healthy adults who underwent magnetoencephalography (MEG). The resulting data were examined in the time-frequency domain prior to image reconstruction using a beamformer. Whole-brain, spectrally-constrained coherence was also employed to determine network connectivity. In response to the numerical task, participants exhibited robust alpha/beta oscillations in the bilateral parietal cortices. Whole-brain statistical comparisons examining the effect of numerical manipulation during memory-item maintenance revealed a difference centered in the right superior parietal cortex, such that oscillatory responses during numerical manipulation were significantly stronger than when no manipulation was necessary. Additionally, there was significantly reduced cortico-cortical coherence between the right and left superior parietal regions during the manipulation compared to the maintenance trials, indicating that these regions were functioning more independently when the numerical information had to be actively processed. In sum, these results support previous studies that have implicated the importance of parietal regions in numerical processing, but also provide new knowledge on the spectral, temporal, and network dynamics that serve this critical cognitive function during active working memory maintenance.

Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) algorithm can be utilized for processing such signals by reconstructing the signal from the sum of a small number of independent and interpretable components. However, in case of extremely lower signal-to-ratio (SNR) signals, the components to be extracted are often located at the back of the eigentriple list. By analyzing the filtering characteristics of the SSA algorithm, a target component advancing method based on template addition is proposed. The template is constructed based on the frequency features of the processed signal. By splicing the template at the starting point of the processed signal, the energy of the components to be extracted is enhanced and therefore the eigentriples of interest can be effectively advanced to the front of the list. This method is applied to denoising and feature extraction of human physiologic signals with lower SNRs, such as non-contact Electrocardiogram (ECG), Ballistocardiogram (BCG) and Electroencephalogram (EEG). Experimental results show that, with the aid of the proposed method, the computational cost of the eigentriple selection in SSA can be effectively reduced.

Direct brain recordings identify hippocampal and cortical networks that distinguish successful versus failed episodic memory retrieval	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Core recollection network; Intracranial EEG; Gamma oscillations; Phase synchrony; Phase-amplitude coupling	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; PARIETAL CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RECOGNITION MEMORY; WORKING-MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; FMRI; INCREASES; ATTENTION; REGIONS	Human data collected using noninvasive imaging techniques have established the importance of parietal regions towards episodic memory retrieval, including the angular gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex. Such regions comprise part of a putative core episodic retrieval network. In free recall, comparisons between contextually appropriate and inappropriate recall events (i.e. prior list intrusions) provide the opportunity to study memory retrieval networks supporting veridical recall, and existing findings predict that differences in electrical activity in these brain regions should be identified according to the accuracy of recall. However, prior iEEG studies, utilizing principally subdural grid electrodes, have not fully characterized brain activity in parietal regions during memory retrieval and have not examined connectivity between core recollection areas and the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex. Here, we employed a data set obtained from 100 human patients implanted with stereo EEG electrodes for seizure mapping purposes as they performed a free recall task. This data set allowed us to separately analyze activity in midline versus lateral parietal brain regions, and in anterior versus posterior hippocampus, to identify areas in which retrieval-related activity predicted the recollection of a correct versus an incorrect memory. With the wide coverage afforded by the stereo EEG approach, we were also able to examine interregional connectivity. Our key findings were that differences in gamma band activity in the angular gyrus, precuneus, posterior temporal cortex, and posterior (more than anterior) hippocampus discriminated accurate versus inaccurate recall as well as active retrieval versus memory search. The left angular gyrus exhibited a significant power decrease preceding list intrusions as well as unique phase-amplitude coupling properties, whereas the prefrontal cortex was unique in exhibiting a power increase during list intrusions. Analysis of connectivity revealed significant hemispheric asymmetry, with relatively sparse left-sided functional connections compared to the right hemisphere. One exception to this finding was elevated connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and left angular gyrus. This finding is interpreted as evidence for the engagement of prefrontal cortex in memory monitoring and mnemonic decision-making.

In our study, we relied on the unique spatio-temporal resolution provided by intracranial stereotactic electroencephalographic (SEEG) recordings in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy to characterize the signal extracted from early visual (calcarine and pericalcarine) and auditory (Heschl's gyrus and planum temporale) regions during a simple audio-visual oddball task. We provide evidences that both cross-modal responses (visual responses in auditory cortex or the reverse) and multisensory processing (alteration of the unimodal responses during bimodal stimulation) can be observed in intracranial event-related potentials (iERPs) and in power modulations of oscillatory activity at different temporal scales within the first 150 msec after stimulus onset. The temporal profiles of the iERPs are compatible with the hypothesis that MSI occurs by means of direct pathways linking early visual and auditory regions. Our data indicate, moreover, that MSI mainly relies on modulations of the low-frequency bands (foremost the theta band in the auditory cortex and the alpha band in the visual cortex), suggesting the involvement of feedback pathways between the two sensory regions. Remarkably, we also observed high-gamma power modulations by sounds in the early visual cortex, thus suggesting the presence of neuronal populations involved in auditory processing in the calcarine and pericalcarine region in humans.

Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Its Treatment in Aging: Effects on Alzheimer's disease Biomarkers, Cognition, Brain Structure and Neurophysiology	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Review							POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE; RAPID-EYE-MOVEMENT; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; APOE EPSILON-4 ALLELE; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; SERUM YKL-40 LEVELS; EEG SPECTRAL POWER; DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTION; APOLIPOPROTEIN-E	Here we review the impact of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, neuroanatomy, cognition and neurophysiology, and present the research investigating the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. OSA is associated with an increase in AD markers amyloid-beta and tau measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and in blood serum. There is some evidence suggesting CPAP therapy normalizes AD biomarkers in CSF but since mechanisms for amyloid-beta and tau production/clearance in humans are not completely understood, these findings remain preliminary. Deficits in the cognitive domains of attention, vigilance, memory and executive functioning are observed in OSA patients with the magnitude of impairment appearing stronger in younger people from clinical settings than in older community samples. Cognition improves with varying degrees after CPAP use, with the greatest effect seen for attention in middle age adults with more severe OSA and sleepiness. Paradigms in which encoding and retrieval of information are separated by periods of sleep with or without OSA have been done only rarely, but perhaps offer a better chance to understand cognitive effects of OSA than isolated daytime testing. In cognitively normal individuals, changes in EEG microstructure during sleep, particularly slow oscillations and spindles, are associated with biomarkers of AD, and measures of cognition and memory. Similar changes in EEG activity are reported in AD and OSA, such as "EEG slowing" during wake and REM sleep, and a degradation of NREM EEG microstructure. There is evidence that CPAP therapy partially reverses these changes but large longitudinal studies demonstrating this are lacking. A diagnostic definition of OSA relying solely on the Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) does not assist in understanding the high degree of inter-individual variation in daytime impairments related to OSA or response to CPAP therapy. We conclude by discussing conceptual challenges to a clinical trial of OSA treatment for AD prevention, including inclusion criteria for age, OSA severity, and associated symptoms, the need for a potentially long trial, defining relevant primary outcomes, and which treatments to target to optimize treatment adherence.

Periodic oscillations have been linked to numerous physiological, cognitive, behavioral and disease states. Emerging evidence demonstrates that the aperiodic component has putative physiological interpretations and that it dynamically changes with age, task demands and cognitive states. Electrophysiological neural activity is typically analyzed using canonically defined frequency bands, without consideration of the aperiodic (1/f-like) component. We show that standard analytic approaches can conflate periodic parameters (center frequency, power, bandwidth) with aperiodic ones (offset, exponent), compromising physiological interpretations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an algorithm to parameterize neural power spectra as a combination of an aperiodic component and putative periodic oscillatory peaks. This algorithm requires no a priori specification of frequency bands. We validate this algorithm on simulated data, and demonstrate how it can be used in applications ranging from analyzing age-related changes in working memory to large-scale data exploration and analysis. A method for parameterizing electrophysiological neural power spectra into periodic and aperiodic components is introduced, addressing limitations of common approaches. The method is validated in simulation and demonstrated on real data applications.

In this paper, a novel method that estimates the oxyhemoglobin changes caused by neuronal activations is proposed and validated. In monitoring the time responses of blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), the early trajectories of both oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobins in their phase space are scrutinized. Furthermore, to reduce the detection time, a prediction method based upon a kernel-based recursive least squares (KRLS) algorithm is implemented. In validating the proposed approach, the fNIRS signals of finger tapping tasks measured from the left motor cortex are examined. The results show that the KRLS algorithm using the Gaussian kernel yields the best fitting for both Delta HbO (i.e., 87.5%) and Delta HbR (i.e., 85.2%) at q = 15 steps ahead (i.e., 1.63 s ahead at a sampling frequency of 9.19 Hz). This concludes that a neuronal activation can be concluded in about 0.1 s with fNIRS using prediction, which enables an almost real-time practice if combined with EEG.

Reduced ability to efficiently launch a coherent cognitive activity might be a significant factor contributing to poor results in time-limited tasks obtained by schizophrenia patients. The aim of this study was to identify neurophysiological predictors of expected cognitive initiation failures in a group of first-episode schizophrenia individuals (SZ). To evaluate the effectiveness of initiation, a dynamic analysis of design fluency test was applied, assessing to what extent the productivity was focused within the first interval of the performance, what is a typical way healthy subjects execute this task. Resting-state EEG recordings were obtained from SZ patients (n = 34) and controls (n = 30) to examine functional connectivity between 84 intra-cortical current sources determined by eLORETA (exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography) for six conventionally analyzed frequencies. The nonparametric randomization approach was used to identify hypo- and hyper-connections, i.e. synchronizations significantly differentiating the studied samples in terms of connectivity strength. Generally, SZ patients obtained poor outcomes in fluency test and dynamic analysis of performance confirmed the presence of initiation deficit in clinical sample, which was a single factor explaining the intergroup difference regarding the entire task. In the majority of frequencies, the arrangement of synchronizations in SZ group was dominated by hypo-connections, except for the theta band, in which the strength of synchronizations between posterior cingulate cortex, cuneus and precuneus was significantly higher for SZ group. These theta-band hyper-connections turned out to be significant predictors of cognitive initiation failure in the clinical sample. Additionally, theta hyper-connections correlated negatively with the total number of unique designs generated by patients, however, the strength of this correlation was weaker than regarding initiation index. The results of this study suggest that baseline hyperconnectivity within the posterior hub of the Default Mode Network, containing posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus, might disturb effective cognitive outcome, not only by interfering with task-positive functional networks but also by delaying the starting phase of performance, which might be specifically deleterious for the execution of time-limited tests.

Although these biases should be considered during the clinical examinations using magnetoencephalography, they have yet to be standardized. In the present study, resting-state magnetoencephalography data were recorded from 54 healthy females and 48 males aged 22 to 75 years, who were controlled for cognitive performance. The regional oscillatory power was estimated for each frequency band (delta, theta, alpha, beta, low-gamma, and high-gamma) using the sLORETA-like algorithm and the biases of age and gender were evaluated, respectively. The results showed that faster oscillatory powers increased with age in the rostral regions and decreased in the caudal regions, while few slower oscillatory powers changed with age. Gender differences in oscillatory powers were found in a broad frequency range, mostly in the caudal brain regions. The present study characterized the effects of healthy aging and gender asymmetricity on the regional resting-state brain activity, with the aim to facilitate the accurate and efficient use of magnetoencephalography in clinical practice.

On the other hand, the synchronized delta wave of electroencephalogram (EEG) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep facilitates seizure, while the desynchronized EEG of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep suppresses it. We also elucidated that unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of thalamus (ANT) suppresses seizure recurrence. In the present study, we intraperitoneally injected pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 40 mg/kg) for 14 consecutive days (PTZ kindling) to induce spontaneous seizure in rats, and a 30-min (delivered 10 min before each PTZ injection) or a 3-h DBS of unilateral ANT (delivered 1 h before each PTZ injection) was applied to suppress seizure. The frequency of DBS stimulation was 200 Hz and the electrical current consisted of biphasic square pulses with 50-mu A intensity, 100-mu s pulse width, and 4.1-ms stimulation interval. Our results found that PTZ-induced spontaneous seizure did not cause a significant change in the quantity of NREM sleep but suppressed the amount of REM sleep. Unilateral ANT DBS prolonged the onset latency of ictal seizure, decreased the spontaneous seizure duration, and increased the survival rate but did not change the amplitude of epileptiform EEGs during ictal period. Unilateral ANT DBS did not significantly alter NREM sleep but increased the amount of REM sleep. An analysis of the spectrograms of fast Fourier transform indicated that the intensities of all frequencies were enhanced during the PTZ-induced ictal period and the subsequent spontaneous seizure. Thirty minutes of unilateral ANT DBS suppressed the augmentation of low-frequency (<10 Hz) intensities during the spontaneous seizure induced by PTZ kindling. We further found that consecutive injections of PTZ progressively increased the enhancement of the delta powers during NREM sleep, whereas unilateral ANT DBS inhibited this progressive enhancement. It was also noticed that 30 min of ANT DBS exhibited a better efficacy in epilepsy suppression than 3 h of ANT DBS. These results elucidated that unilateral ANT DBS enhanced the seizure threshold by increasing the amount of REM sleep and decreasing the progressive enhancement of delta power during NREM sleep to suppress spontaneous seizure recurrences in PTZ kindling-induced epileptic rats.

Using highly controlled speech materials, previous studies have demonstrated that cortical activity is synchronous to the rhythms of perceived linguistic units, for example, words and phrases, on top of basic acoustic features, for example, the speech envelope. When listening to natural speech, it remains unclear, however, how cortical activity jointly encodes acoustic and linguistic information. Here we investigate the neural encoding of words using electroencephalography and observe neural activity synchronous to multi-syllabic words when participants naturally listen to narratives. An amplitude modulation (AM) cue for word rhythm enhances the word-level response, but the effect is only observed during passive listening. Furthermore, words and the AM cue are encoded by spatially separable neural responses that are differentially modulated by attention. These results suggest that bottom-up acoustic cues and top-down linguistic knowledge separately contribute to cortical encoding of linguistic units in spoken narratives.

The current study uses electroencephalography to explore how the push-pull interaction between top-down and bottom-up attention manifests itself in dynamic auditory scenes. Using natural soundscapes as distractors while subjects attend to a controlled rhythmic sound sequence, we find that salient events in background scenes significantly suppress phase-locking and gamma responses to the attended sequence, countering enhancement effects observed for attended targets. In line with a hypothesis of limited attentional resources, the modulation of neural activity by bottom-up attention is graded by degree of salience of ambient events. The study also provides insights into the interplay between endogenous and exogenous attention during natural soundscapes, with both forms of attention engaging a common fronto-parietal network at different time lags.

There are persistent concerns that radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure might affect health. Possible effects of RF-EMF exposure on human sleep were examined with regard to mobile phones and base stations, but not with regard to Wi-Fi exposure. Objectives: The present double-blind, sham-controlled, randomized, fully counterbalanced cross-over study addressed for the first time the question whether a whole night Wi-Fi exposure has an effect on sleep. Methods: Thirty-four healthy young male subjects (mean +/- SD: 24.1 +/- 2.9 years) spent five nights in the sleep laboratory. A screening and adaptation night was followed by two experimental nights. Each of the experimental nights was preceded by a baseline night. Sleep was evaluated at the subjective level by a questionnaire and at the objective level (macro- and microstructure) by polysomnography. Either 2.45 GHz Wi-Fi (max psSAR10g of 6.4 mW/kg) or sham signals were delivered by a newly developed head exposure facility. Results: Results showed no statistically significant acute effects of a whole-night Wi-Fi exposure on subjective sleep parameters as well as on parameters characterizing the macrostructure of sleep. Analyses of the microstructure of sleep revealed a reduction in global EEG power in the alpha frequency band (8.00-11.75 Hz) during NREM sleep under acute Wi-Fi exposure compared to sham. Discussion: The results of the present human experimental study are well in line with several other neurophysiological studies showing that acute RF-EMF exposure has no effect on the macrostructure of sleep. The slight physiological changes in EEG power observed under Wi-Fi exposure are neither reflected in the subjective assessment of sleep nor at the level of objective measurements. The present results are not indicative of a sleep disturbing effect of Wi-Fi exposure.

Context-specific control over the neural dynamics of temporal attention by the human cerebellum	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; ORIENTING ATTENTION; BASAL GANGLIA; BETA-RHYTHMS; TIME; MOTOR; ENTRAINMENT; MODULATION	Physiological methods have identified a number of signatures of temporal prediction, a core component of attention. While the underlying neural dynamics have been linked to activity within cortico-striatal networks, recent work has shown that the behavioral benefits of temporal prediction rely on the cerebellum. Here, we examine the involvement of the human cerebellum in the generation and/or temporal adjustment of anticipatory neural dynamics, measuring scalp electroencephalography in individuals with cerebellar degeneration. When the temporal prediction relied on an interval representation, duration-dependent adjustments were impaired in the cerebellar group compared to matched controls. This impairment was evident in ramping activity, beta-band power, and phase locking of delta-band activity. These same neural adjustments were preserved when the prediction relied on a rhythmic stream. Thus, the cerebellum has a context-specific causal role in the adjustment of anticipatory neural dynamics of temporal prediction, providing the requisite modulation to optimize behavior.

To guide the processing resources to the related visual scene aspects, covert attention should be decoded from human brain. Here, a novel expert system is designed to decode covert visual attention based on the EEG signal provided from 15 subjects during a new task based on a change in lumination to two blue and orange color on the right and the left side of the screen, which is evaluated in two cases of binary and multi-class systems. For the first time, Phase transfer entropy (PTE) has been used in these systems, and after selecting the optimal decoding feature, the frequency band (8-13 Hz) Alpha and Beta1 (13-20 Hz) have the best performance compared to other frequency bands. Two-class classification accuracies of the designed system in two frequency bands (Alpha and Beta1) are 91.87% and 89.53%, respectively. Also, the accuracies are 65.11% and 63.38% for multi-class classification in specified frequency bands. In these frequency bands, the parietal and frontal lobes showed the most significant difference in comparison to the other lobes. Also, the obtained results declared that the expert system's performance in the Alpha band by the extracted features from the Posterior region is better than all frequency bands in other different brain regions. The performance of the proposed expert system by PTE is significantly better than the previous phase synchronization based features. Results have shown that the PTE feature performs better than the common methods for decoding covert visual attention.

Individual test-retest reliability of evoked and induced alpha activity in human EEG data	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; BAND; SYNCHRONIZATION; VARIABILITY; CONSISTENCY; POTENTIALS; MODULATION; COMPONENTS; STABILITY	Diverse psychological mechanisms have been associated with modulations of different EEG frequencies. To the extent of our knowledge, there are few studies of the test-retest reliability of these modulations in the human brain. To assess evoked and induced alpha reliabilities related to cognitive processing, EEG data from twenty subjects were recorded in 58 derivations in two different sessions separated by 49.5 +/- 48.9 (mean +/- standard deviation) days. A visual oddball was selected as the cognitive task, and three main parameters were analyzed for evoked and induced alpha modulations (latency, amplitude and topography). Latency and amplitude for evoked and induced modulations showed stable behavior between the two sessions. The correlation between sessions for alpha evoked and induced topographies in the grand average (group level) was r = 0.923, p<0.001; r = 0.962, p<0.001, respectively. The within-subject correlation values for evoked modulation ranged from 0.472 to 0.974 (mean: 0.766), whereas induced activity showed a different range, 0.193 to 0.892 (mean: 0.655). Individual analysis of the test-retest reliability showed a higher heterogeneity in the induced modulation, probably due to the heterogeneous phases found in the second case. However, despite this heterogeneity in phase values for induced activity relative to the onset of the stimuli, an excellent correlation score was obtained for group topography, with values that were better than those of the grand average evoked topography. As a main conclusion, induced alpha activity can be observed as a stable and reproducible response in the cognitive processing of the human brain.

Sensorimotor Functional Connectivity: A Neurophysiological Factor Related to BCI Performance	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						connectivity; sensorimotor signals; BCI performance; mu-band; BCI efficiency; pre-stimulus	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; EEG SOURCE LOCALIZATION; MOTOR IMAGERY; RHYTHMS; CLASSIFICATION; MOVEMENT; DYNAMICS; CORTEX; PATTERNS; VOLUME	Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are systems that allow users to control devices using brain activity alone. However, the ability of participants to command BCIs varies from subject to subject. About 20% of potential users of sensorimotor BCIs do not gain reliable control of the system. The inefficiency to decode user's intentions requires the identification of neurophysiological factors determining "good" and "poor" BCI performers. One of the important neurophysiological aspects in BCI research is that the neuronal oscillations, used to control these systems, show a rich repertoire of spatial sensorimotor interactions. Considering this, we hypothesized that neuronal connectivity in sensorimotor areas would define BCI performance. Analyses for this study were performed on a large dataset of 80 inexperienced participants. They took part in a calibration and an online feedback session recorded on the same day. Undirected functional connectivity was computed over sensorimotor areas by means of the imaginary part of coherency. The results show that post- as well as pre-stimulus connectivity in the calibration recording is significantly correlated to online feedback performance in mu and feedback frequency bands. Importantly, the significance of the correlation between connectivity and BCI feedback accuracy was not due to the signal-to-noise ratio of the oscillations in the corresponding post and pre-stimulus intervals. Thus, this study demonstrates that BCI performance is not only dependent on the amplitude of sensorimotor oscillations as shown previously, but that it also relates to sensorimotor connectivity measured during the preceding training session. The presence of such connectivity between motor and somatosensory systems is likely to facilitate motor imagery, which in turn is associated with the generation of a more pronounced modulation of sensorimotor oscillations (manifested in ERD/ERS) required for the adequate BCI performance. We also discuss strategies for the up-regulation of such connectivity in order to enhance BCI performance.

However, not all patients with MCI convert to AD. EEG spectral power has shown promise as a marker of progression, but brain oscillations in different frequencies are not isolated entities. Coupling between different frequency bands, so-called cross-frequency coupling (CFC), has been associated with memory function and may further contribute to our understanding of what characterizes patients with MCI who progress to AD. In the current study, we wanted to investigate the changes in gamma/theta CFC in patients with AD and MCI compared to HC and in patients with pMCI compared to patients with sMCI. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate the association with cognitive test scores. EEGs were included at baseline for 15 patients with AD, 25 patients with MCI, and 36 older HC, and the participants were followed for up to 3 years. To investigate CFC, we calculated the modulation index (MI), which has been shown to be less affected by noisy data compared to other techniques. We found that patients with pMCI showed a significantly lower global gamma/theta CFC compared to patients with sMCI. In addition, global gamma/theta CFC was significantly correlated with Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE) score (p-value = 0.030, rho = 0.527). Although not significant, patients with AD and MCI showed a lower gamma/theta CFC compared to HC. These findings suggest that gamma/theta CFC is important for proper cognitive functioning and that a decrease in gamma/theta CFC in patients with MCI may be a sign of progression. Gamma/theta CFC may therefore serve as a progression marker in MCI, but larger studies are needed to validate these findings.

Even though some well-known features of motor-related electroencephalograms have been revealed using traditionally applied methods, they still lack a robust classification of motor-related patterns. Here, we introduce new features of motor-related brain activity and uncover hidden mechanisms of the underlying neuronal dynamics by considering event-related desynchronization (ERD) of mu-rhythm in the sensorimotor cortex, i.e., tracking the decrease of the power spectral density in the corresponding frequency band. We hypothesize that motor-related ERD is associated with the suppression of random fluctuations of mu-band neuronal activity. This is due to the lowering of the number of active neuronal populations involved in the corresponding oscillation mode. In this case, we expect more regular dynamics and a decrease in complexity of the EEG signal recorded over the sensorimotor cortex. In order to support this, we apply measures of signal complexity by means of recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). In particular, we demonstrate that certain RQA quantifiers are very useful to detect the moment of movement onset and, therefore, are able to classify the laterality of executed movements.

One of the key questions is whether perceptual or cognitive processes underlie the phenomenon, as both sensory and higher-order brain regions have been associated with AP. To integrate the perceptual and cognitive views on AP, here, we investigated joint contributions of sensory and higher-order brain regions to AP resting-state networks. We performed a comprehensive functional network analysis of source-level EEG in a large sample of AP musicians (n = 54) and non-AP musicians (n = 51), adopting two analysis approaches: First, we applied an ROIbased analysis to examine the connectivity between the auditory cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using several established functional connectivity measures. This analysis is a replication of a previous study which reported increased connectivity between these two regions in AP musicians. Second, we performed a whole-brain network-based analysis on the same functional connectivity measures to gain a more complete picture of the brain regions involved in a possibly large-scale network supporting AP ability. In our sample, the ROI-based analysis did not provide evidence for an AP-specific connectivity increase between the auditory cortex and the DLPFC. The whole-brain analysis revealed three networks with increased connectivity in AP musicians comprising nodes in frontal, temporal, subcortical, and occipital areas. Commonalities of the networks were found in both sensory and higher-order brain regions of the perisylvian area. Further research will be needed to confirm these exploratory results.

However, while there is some neurophysiological evidence for mechanisms that underlie the phenomenon, the neural basis of visually induced effects on auditory perception remains unknown. Combining fMRI and EEG with psychophysical measurements in two independent studies, we identified the neural underpinnings and temporal dynamics of visually induced auditory enhancement. Lower- and higher-intensity sounds were paired with a non-informative visual stimulus, while participants performed an auditory detection task. Behaviourally, visual co-stimulation enhanced auditory sensitivity. Using fMRI, enhanced BOLD signals were observed in primary auditory cortex for low-intensity audiovisual stimuli which scaled with subject-specific enhancement in perceptual sensitivity. Concordantly, a modulation of event-related potentials could already be observed over frontal electrodes at an early latency (30-80 ms), which again scaled with subject-specific behavioural benefits. Later modulations starting around 280 ms, that is in the time range of the P3, did not fit this pattern of brain-behaviour correspondence. Hence, the latency of the corresponding fMRI-EEG brain-behaviour modulation points at an early interplay of visual and auditory signals in low-level auditory cortex, potentially mediated by crosstalk at the level of the thalamus. However, fMRI signals in primary auditory cortex, auditory thalamus and the P50 for higher-intensity auditory stimuli were also elevated by visual co-stimulation (in the absence of any behavioural effect) suggesting a general, intensity-independent integration mechanism. We propose that this automatic interaction occurs at the level of the thalamus and might signify a first step of audiovisual interplay necessary for visually induced perceptual enhancement of auditory perception.

NFT targeted increasing the amplitude of individual's upper Alpha frequency band at the parietal midline scalp location (Pz), and WMT consisted of an established computerized protocol with working memory updating and set-shifting components. Healthy participants (n = 140) were randomly allocated to five combinations of training, including visual search training used as an active control training for the WMT; all five groups were compared to a sixth silent control group receiving no training. All groups were evaluated before and after training for resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) and behavioral executive function measures. The participants in the silent control group were unaware of this procedure, and received one of the training protocols only after study has ended. Results demonstrated significant improvement in the practice tasks in all training groups including non-specific influence of NFT on resting-state EEG spectral topography. There was only a near transfer effect (improvement in working memory task) for WMT, which remained significant in the delayed post-test (after 1 month), in comparison to silent control group but not in comparison to active control training group. The NFT + WMT combined group showed improved mental rotation ability both in the post-training and in the follow-up evaluations. This improvement, however, did not differ significantly from that in the silent control group. We conclude that the current training protocols, including their combination, have very limited influence on the executive functions that were assessed in this study.

J	Barraza, P; Perez, A; Rodriguez, E				Barraza, Paulo; Perez, Alejandro; Rodriguez, Eugenio			Brain-to-Brain Coupling in the Gamma-Band as a Marker of Shared Intentionality	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cooperation; hyperscanning; EEG; gamma; shared intentionality	SOCIAL COGNITION; FRONTAL-CORTEX; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; DECISION-MAKING; COOPERATION; THETA; MECHANISM; EMPATHY; FMRI	Cooperation and competition are two ways of social interaction keys to life in society. Recent EEG-based hyperscanning studies reveal that cooperative and competitive interactions induce an increase in interbrain coupling. However, whether this interbrain coupling effect is just a reflection of inter-subject motor coordination or can also signal the type of social interaction is unknown. Here, we show that behavioral coordination and social interaction type can be distinguished according to the frequency of oscillation in which the brains are coupled. We use EEG to simultaneously measure the brain activity of pairs of subjects, while they were performing a visual cue-target task in a cooperative and competitive manner. Behavioral responses were quasi-simultaneous between subject pairs for both competitive and cooperative conditions, with faster average response times for the competitive condition. Concerning brain activity, we found increased interbrain coupling in theta band (3-7 Hz) during cooperation and competition, with stronger coupling during competitive interactions. This increase of interbrain theta coupling correlated with a decrease in reaction times of the dyads. Interestingly, we also found an increase in brain-to-brain coupling in gamma band (38-42 Hz) only during cooperative interactions. Unlike the theta coupling effect, the gamma interbrain coupling did not correlate with dyads' reaction times. Taken together, these results suggest that theta interbrain coupling could be linked to motor coordination processes common to cooperative and competitive interactions, while gamma brain-to-brain coupling emerges as an electrophysiological marker of shared intentionality during cooperative interactions.

As one of the most inheritable sleep EEG signatures, sleep spindles probably reflect the strength and malleability of thalamocortical circuits that underlie individual cognitive profiles. We review the characteristics, organization, regulation, and origins of sleep spindles and their implication in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) and its functions, focusing on human and rodent. Spatially, sleep spindle-related neuronal activity appears on scales ranging from small thalamic circuits to functional cortical areas, and generates a cortical state favoring intracortical plasticity while limiting cortical output. Temporally, sleep spindles are discrete events, part of a continuous power band, and elements grouped on an infraslow time scale over which NREMS alternates between continuity and fragility. We synthesize diverse and seemingly unlinked functions of sleep spindles for sleep architecture, sensory processing, synaptic plasticity, memory formation, and cognitive abilities into a unifying sleep spindle concept, according to which sleep spindles 1) generate neural conditions of large-scale functional connectivity and plasticity that outlast their appearance as discrete EEG events, 2) appear preferentially in thalamic circuits engaged in learning and attention-based experience during wakefulness, and 3) enable a selective reactivation and routing of wake-instated neuronal traces between brain areas such as hippocampus and cortex. Their fine spatiotemporal organization reflects NREMS as a physiological state coordinated over brain and body and may indicate, if not anticipate and ultimately differentiate, pathologies in sleep and neurodevelopmental, -degenerative, and -psychiatric conditions.

Interictal epileptiform discharges are associated with higher risk but have limited sensitivity and specificity. High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are newer biomarkers for epileptogenesis. We prospectively evaluated the predictive value of HFOs for developing epilepsy in scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) of children after a first unprovoked seizure. Methods After their first seizure, 56 children were followed prospectively over 12 months and then grouped in "epilepsy" or "no epilepsy." Initial EEGs were visually analyzed for spikes, spike ripples, and ripples. Inter-group comparisons of spike-rates and HFO-rates were done by Mann-Whitney U test. Predictive values and optimal thresholds were calculated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results In the epilepsy group (n = 26, 46%), mean rates of ripples (0.3 vs 0.09 / minute, p < 0.0001) and spike ripples (0.6 vs 0.06 / minute, p < 0.05) were significantly higher, with no difference in spike rates (1.7 vs 3.0 / minute, p = 0.38). Of those 3 markers, ripples showed the best predictive value (area under the curve [AUC](ripples) = 0.88). The optimal threshold for ripples was calculated to be >= 0.125 / minute with a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 85%. Ripple rates were negatively correlated to days passing before epilepsy-diagnosis (R = -0.59, p < 0.0001) and time to a second seizure (R = -0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.77 to 0.43, p < 0.0001). Interpretation We could show that in a cohort of children with a first unprovoked seizure, ripples predict the development of epilepsy better than spikes or spike ripples and might be useful biomarkers in the estimation of prognosis and question of treatment.

Previous research on the mechanisms underlying stress effects on human memory focused on stress-induced changes in the neural activity elicited by a stimulus. We tested an alternative mechanism and hypothesized that stress may already alter the neural context for successful memory formation, reflected in the neural activity preceding a stimulus. Therefore, 69 participants underwent a stress or control procedure before encoding neutral and negative pictures. During encoding, we recorded high-density EEG and analyzed-based on multivariate searchlight analyses-oscillatory activity and cross-frequency coupling patterns before stimulus onset that were predictive of memory tested 24 hr later. Prestimulus theta predicted subsequent memory in controls but not in stressed participants. Instead, prestimulus gamma predicted successful memory formation after stress, specifically for emotional material. Likewise, stress altered the patterns of prestimulus theta-beta and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling predictive of subsequent memory, again depending on the emotionality of the presented material. Our data suggest that stress changes the neural context for building new memories, tuning this neural context specifically to the encoding of emotionally salient events. These findings point to a yet unknown mechanism through which stressful events may change (emotional) memory formation.

JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY; GAMMA; EEG; REPRODUCTION; STIMULATION; INVOLVEMENT; PERCEPTION; MECHANISM; DURATION; CORTEX	Precise timing is crucial for many behaviors ranging from conversational speech to athletic performance. The precision of motor timing has been suggested to result from the strength of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between the phase of alpha oscillations (alpha, 8-12 Hz) and the power of beta activity (beta, 14-30 Hz), herein referred to as alpha-beta PAC. The amplitude of beta oscillations has been proposed to code for temporally relevant information and the locking of beta power to the phase of alpha oscillations to maintain timing precision. Motor timing precision has at least two sources of variability: variability of timekeeping mechanism and variability of motor control. It is ambiguous to which of these two factors alpha-beta PAC should be ascribed: alpha-beta PAC could index precision of stopwatch-like internal timekeeping mechanisms, or alpha-beta PAC could index motor control precision. To disentangle these two hypotheses, we tested how oscillatory coupling at different stages of a time reproduction task related to temporal precision. Human participants encoded and subsequently reproduced a time interval while magnetoencephalography was recorded. The data show a robust alpha-beta PAC during both the encoding and reproduction of a temporal interval, a pattern that cannot be predicted by motor control accounts. Specifically, we found that timing precision resulted from the trade-off between the strength of alpha-beta PAC during the encoding and during the reproduction of intervals. These results support the hypothesis that alpha-beta PAC codes for the precision of temporal representations in the human brain.

SLEEP MEDICINE REVIEWS			English	Review						REM; EEG; Information processing; Sleep disorders; Sleep regulation; Arousal	RAPID-EYE-MOVEMENT; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; EEG SPECTRAL POWER; SLOW WAVES; PONTOGENICULOOCCIPITAL WAVES; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; DEPENDENT CHANGES; PREFRONTAL THETA; BRAIN-STEM; OSCILLATIONS	Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is a peculiar neural state that occupies 20-25% of nighttime sleep in healthy human adults and seems to play critical roles in a variety of functions spanning from basic physiological mechanisms to complex cognitive processes. REM sleep exhibits a plethora of transient neurophysiological features, such as eye movements, muscle twitches, and changes in autonomic activity, however, despite its heterogeneous nature, it is usually conceptualized as a homogeneous sleep state. We propose here that differentiating and exploring the fine microstructure of REM sleep, especially its phasic and tonic constituents would provide a novel framework to examine the mechanisms and putative functions of REM sleep. In this review, we show that phasic and tonic REM periods are remarkably different neural states with respect to environmental alertness, spontaneous and evoked cortical activity, information processing, and seem to contribute differently to the dysfunctions of REM sleep in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. We highlight that a distinctive view on phasic and tonic REM microstates would facilitate the understanding of the mechanisms and functions of REM sleep in healthy and pathological conditions.

Seizure onset location shapes dynamics of initiation	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Seizure generation; Seizure onset-pattern; Infraslow-activity; High-frequency oscillation; Phase-amplitude coupling	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; DIRECT-CURRENT SHIFTS; INFRASLOW ACTIVITY; EPILEPSY SURGERY; INTRACRANIAL EEG; LOBE EPILEPSY; ICTAL ONSET; 80-500 HZ; PATTERNS; LOCALIZATION	Objective: Ictal electrographic patterns are widely thought to reflect underlying neural mechanisms of seizures. Here we studied the degree to which seizure patterns are consistent in a given patient, relate to particular brain regions and if two candidate biomarkers (high-frequency oscillations, HFOs; infraslow activity, ISA) and network activity, as assessed with cross-frequency interactions, can discriminate between seizure types. Methods: We analyzed temporal changes in low and high frequency oscillations recorded during seizures, as well as phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) to monitor the interactions between delta/theta and ripple/-fast ripple frequency bands at seizure onset. Results: Seizures of multiple electrographic patterns were observed in a given patient and brain region. While there was an increase in HFO rate across different electrographic patterns, there are specific relationships between types of HFO activity and onset region. Similarly, changes in PAC dynamics were more closely related to seizure onset region than they were to electrographic patterns while ISA was a poor indicator for seizure onset. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the onset region sculpts neurodynamics at seizure initiation and that unique features of the cytoarchitecture and/or connectivity of that region play a significant role in determining seizure mechanism. Significance: To learn how seizures are initiated, researchers would do well to consider other aspects of their manifestation, in addition to their electrographic patterns. Examination of onset pattern in conjunction with the interactions between different oscillatory frequencies in the context of different brain regions might be more informative and lead to more reliable clinical inference as well as novel therapeutic approaches.

Specifically, we hypothesized, that a smaller volume of hippocampus, parahippocampal and medial prefrontal cortex negatively impacts declarative, but not procedural, memory consolidation. Explorative analyses were conducted to demonstrate whether a decrease in slow-wave activity negatively impacts declarative memory consolidation, and whether these factors mediate age effects on memory consolidation. Thirty-eight healthy participants underwent an acquisition session in the evening and a retrieval session in the morning after night-time sleep with polysomnographic monitoring. Declarative memory was assessed with the paired-associate word list task, while procedural memory was tested using the mirror-tracing task. All participants underwent high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Participants with smaller hippocampal, parahippocampal and medial prefrontal cortex volumes displayed a reduced overnight declarative, but not procedural memory consolidation. Mediation analyses showed significant age effects on overnight declarative memory consolidation, but no significant mediation effects of brain morphology on this association. Further mediation analyses showed that the effects of age and brain morphology on overnight declarative memory consolidation were not mediated by polysomnographic variables or sleep electroencephalogram spectral power variables. Thus, the results suggest that the association between age, specific brain area volume and overnight memory consolidation is highly relevant, but does not necessarily depend on slow-wave sleep as previously conceptualized.

MEG findings include slowness of the oscillatory activity, accompanied by a reduction of the alpha band power, and dysfunction of the functional networks. These findings are associated with the neuropathology of the disease and cognitive impairment. These neurophysiological biomarkers predict which patients with mild cognitive impairment will develop dementia. MEG has demonstrated its utility as a noninvasive biomarker for early detection of AD.

Their efficacy strongly relies on the possibility to assess individual levels of impairment and recovery rate. However, commonly used clinical scales rely mainly on subjective functional assessments and are not able to provide a complete description of patients' neuro-biomechanical status. Therefore, current clinical tests should be integrated with specific physiological measurements, i.e. kinematic, muscular, and brain activities, to obtain a deep understanding of patients' condition and of its evolution through time and rehabilitative intervention.Approach.We proposed a multivariate approach for motor control assessment that simultaneously measures kinematic, muscle and brain activity and combines the main physiological variables extracted from these signals using principal component analysis (PCA). We tested it in a group of six sub-acute stroke subjects evaluated extensively before and after a four-week training, using an upper-limb exoskeleton while performing a reaching task, along with brain and muscle measurements.Main results.After training, all subjects exhibited clinical improvements correlating with changes in kinematics, muscle synergies, and spinal maps. Movements were smoother and faster, while muscle synergies increased in numbers and became more similar to those of the healthy controls. These findings were coupled with changes in cortical oscillations depicted by EEG-topographies. When combining these physiological variables using PCA, we found that (i) patients' kinematic and spinal maps parameters improved continuously during the four assessments; (ii) muscle coordination augmented mainly during treatment, and (iii) brain oscillations recovered mostly pre-treatment as a consequence of short-term subacute changes.Significance.Although these are preliminary results, the proposed approach has the potential of identifying significant biomarkers for patient stratification as well as for the design of more effective rehabilitation protocols.

Methods: Event-related potentials (early posterior negativity [EPN]/ late positive potential [LPP]) and event-related oscillations (Theta) were obtained by electroencephalographic (EEG) recording during the viewing of International Affective Picture System (ZAPS) images with positive, negative and neutral valence, as well as alcohol-related cues. The total sample was comprised of 60 participants, divided into two groups: one group consisted of OA (30) and the control group of participants with negative family history of alcohol use disorders (30). Results: Theta power analysis implies a significant interaction between condition, region and group factors. Post-hoc analysis indicates an increased theta power for the OA at different regions, during pleasant (frontal, central, parietal, occipital, right temporal); unpleasant (frontal, central, occipital); alcohol (frontal, central, parietal, occipital, right and left temporal) and neutral (occipital) cues. There are no group differences regarding any of the event-related potential measurements (EPN/LPP). Conclusions: There is evidence of alterations in the processing of affective stimuli and alcohol-related information, evidenced by changes in theta brain oscillations. These alterations are characterized by an increased emotional reactivity, evidenced by increased theta at posterior sites. There is also an increased recruitment of emotion control, which could be a compensation mechanism, evidenced by increased theta power at anterior sites during affective stimuli and alcohol cues.

Programming experience associated with neural efficiency during figural reasoning	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							DUAL-PROCESS THEORIES; COMPUTATIONAL THINKING; WORKING-MEMORY; TASK CONTENT; EEG ALPHA; INTELLIGENCE; BRAIN; PERFORMANCE; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS	In the present study, we investigated neural processes underlying programming experience. Individuals with high programming experience might develop a form of computational thinking, which they can apply on complex problem-solving tasks such as reasoning tests. Therefore, N=20 healthy young participants with previous programming experience and N=21 participants without any programming experience performed three reasoning tests: Figural Inductive Reasoning (FIR), Numerical Inductive Reasoning (NIR), Verbal Deductive Reasoning (VDR). Using multi-channel EEG measurements, task-related changes in alpha and theta power as well as brain connectivity were investigated. Group differences were only observed in the FIR task. Programmers showed an improved performance in the FIR task as compared to non-programmers. Additionally, programmers exhibited a more efficient neural processing when solving FIR tasks, as indicated by lower brain activation and brain connectivity especially in easy tasks. Hence, behavioral and neural measures differed between groups only in tasks that are similar to mental processes required during programming, such as pattern recognition and algorithmic thinking by applying complex rules (FIR), rather than in tasks that require more the application of mathematical operations (NIR) or verbal tasks (VDR). Our results provide new evidence for neural efficiency in individuals with higher programming experience in problem-solving tasks.

The proposed hardware finds usage in many practical applications e.g. finding hidden periodicities in DNA and proteins, detecting absence seizures in the EEG signal, identifying periodic movements of cosmic bodies, etc. The algorithm used for hidden periodicity detection is based on Ramanujan Filter Bank (RFB). The novelty of the present work is in making the first attempt in designing dedicated hardware for hidden periodicity detection. Two different architectures based on RFB have been proposed - a classic architecture and a multiplier-less architecture. These are structurally modeled in Verilog HDL and implemented on Artix 7 FPGA kit. The multiplier-less architecture utilizes fewer hardware resources and is faster than the classic one due to a lower critical path delay. Thus, lesser chip area and higher operating frequency are achieved. The dedicated hardware is shown to be more than 1000 times faster than its software counterpart. An ideal hidden periodicity detector has also been introduced to present an accuracy analysis of the proposed architecture but the analysis is applicable for all kinds of hidden periodicity detectors.

Only recently, however, has it become possible to record sleep-related brain activity in newborn rodents. Using such methods in rat pups, it is now clear that sleep, more so than wake, provides a crucial context for the processing of sensory input and the expression of functional connectivity throughout the sensorimotor system. In addition, sleep uniquely reveals functional activity in the developing primary motor cortex, which establishes a somatosensory map long before its role in motor control emerges. These findings will inform our understanding of the developmental processes that contribute to the nascent sense of embodiment in human infants.

Frequency-specific neural synchrony in autism during memory encoding, maintenance and recognition	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						autism; connectivity; working memory; alpha; theta	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; EEG-ALPHA; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; SPECTRUM DISORDER; COGNITIVE CONTROL; EPISODIC MEMORY	Working memory impairment is associated with symptom severity and poor functional outcome in autistic individuals, and yet the neurobiology underlying such deficits is poorly understood. Neural oscillations are an area of investigation that can shed light on this issue. Theta and alpha oscillations have been found consistently to support working memory in typically developing individuals and have also been shown to be functionally altered in people with autism. While there is evidence, largely from functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, that neural processing underlying working memory is altered in autism, there remains a dearth of information concerning how sub-processes supporting working memory (namely encoding, maintenance and recognition) are impacted. In this study, we used magnetoencephalography to investigate inter-regional theta and alpha brain synchronization elicited during the widely used one-back task across encoding, maintenance and recognition in 24 adults with autism and 30 controls. While both groups performed comparably on the working-memory task, we found process- and frequency-specific differences in networks recruited between groups. In the theta frequency band, both groups used similar networks during encoding and recognition, but different networks specifically during maintenance. In comparison, the two groups recruited distinct networks across encoding, maintenance and recognition in alpha that showed little overlap. These differences may reflect a breakdown of coherent theta and alpha synchronization that supports mnemonic functioning, or in the case of alpha, impaired inhibition of task-irrelevant neural processing. Thus, these data provide evidence for specific theta and widespread alpha synchrony alterations in autism, and underscore that a detailed examination of the sub-processes that comprise working memory is warranted for a complete understanding of cognitive impairment in this population.

We aim to explore whether cognitive challenge combined with quantitative EEG (qEEG) can unmask abnormal gamma frequency power in healthy individuals at high risk of developing AD. We analyzed low (30-50 Hz) and high gamma (50-80 Hz) power over six brain regions at EEG sensor level (frontal/central/parietal/left temporal/right temporal/occipital) in a dataset collected from an aging cohort during N-back working memory (WM) testing at two different load conditions (N = 0 or 2). Cognitively healthy (CH) study participants (>= 60 years old) of both sexes were divided into two subgroups: normal amyloid/tau ratios (CH-NAT, n = 10) or pathological amyloid/tau (CH-PAT, n = 14) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). During low load (0-back) challenge, low gamma is higher in CH-PATs than CH-NATs over frontal and central regions (p = 0.014 similar to 0.032, effect size (Cohen's d) = 0.95 similar to 1.11). However, during high load (2-back) challenge, low gamma is lower in CH-PATs compared to CH-NATs over the left temporal region (p = 0.045, Cohen's d = -0.96), and high gamma is lower over the parietal region (p = 0.035, Cohen's d = -1.02). Overall, our studies show a medium to large negative effect size across the scalp (Cohen's d = -0.51 similar to-1.02). In addition, low gamma during 2-back is positively correlated with 0-back accuracy over all regions except the occipital region only in CH-NATs (r = 0.69 similar to 0.77, p = 0.0098 similar to 0.027); high gamma during 2-back correlated positively with 0-back accuracy over all regions in CH-NATs (r = 0.68 similar to 0.78, p = 0.007 similar to 0.030); high gamma during 2-back negatively correlated with 0-back response time over parietal, right temporal, and occipital regions in CH-NATs (r = -0.70 similar to-0.66, p = 0.025 similar to 0.037). We interpret these preliminary results to show: (1) gamma power is compromised in AD-biomarker positive individuals, who are otherwise cognitively healthy (CH-PATs); (2) gamma is associated with WM performance in normal aging (CH-NATs) (most significantly in the frontoparietal region). Our pilot findings encourage further investigations in combining cognitive challenges and qEEG in developing neurophysiology-based markers for identifying individuals in the prodromal stage, to help improving our understanding of AD pathophysiology and the contributions of low- and high-frequency gamma oscillations in cognitive functions.

Non-invasive recording from the human olfactory bulb	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ODOR IDENTIFICATION; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; HABITUATION; RATS; DISCRIMINATION; RELIABILITY; DYSFUNCTION; TESTS; GAMMA	Measures of neural processing can be obtained non-invasively from all areas of the human brain but one, the olfactory bulb. Here, the authors show that signals obtained from EEG electrodes at the nasal bridge represent responses from the human olfactory bulb, the so-called Electrobulbogram. Current non-invasive neuroimaging methods can assess neural activity in all areas of the human brain but the olfactory bulb (OB). The OB has been suggested to fulfill a role comparable to that of V1 and the thalamus in the visual system and have been closely linked to a wide range of olfactory tasks and neuropathologies. Here we present a method for non-invasive recording of signals from the human OB with millisecond precision. We demonstrate that signals obtained via recordings from EEG electrodes at the nasal bridge represent responses from the human olfactory bulb - recordings we term Electrobulbogram (EBG). The EBG will aid future olfactory-related translational work but can also potentially be implemented as an everyday clinical tool to detect pathology-related changes in human central olfactory processing in neurodegenerative diseases. In conclusion, the EBG is localized to the OB, is reliable, and follows response patterns demonstrated in non-human animal models.

To explore this hypothesis in children, we applied a graph theory approach to examine connectivity in neural networks in the resting-state EEG in 35 children with PNES, 31 children with other functional neurological symptoms (but no PNES), and 75 healthy controls. Methods The networks were extracted from Laplacian-transformed time series by a coherence connectivity estimation method. Results Children with PNES (vs. controls) showed widespread changes in network metrics: increased global efficiency (gamma and beta bands), increased local efficiency (gamma band), and increased modularity (gamma and alpha bands). Compared to controls, they also had higher levels of autonomic arousal (e.g., lower heart variability); more anxiety, depression, and stress on the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales; and more adverse childhood experiences on the Early Life Stress Questionnaire. Increases in network metrics correlated with arousal. Children with other functional neurological symptoms (but no PNES) showed scattered and less pronounced changes in network metrics. Conclusion The results indicate that children with PNES present with increased activation of neural networks coupled with increased physiological arousal. While this shift in functional organization may confer a short-term adaptive advantage-one that facilitates neural communication and the child's capacity to respond self-protectively in the face of stressful life events-it may also have a significant biological cost. It may predispose the child's neural networks to periods of instability-presenting clinically as PNES-when the neural networks are faced with perturbations in energy flow or with additional demands.

Nonspatial Features Reduce the Reliance on Sustained Spatial Auditory Attention	EAR AND HEARING			English	Article						Auditory attention; Auditory event-related potentials; Electroencephalography; Nonspatial attention; Parietal alpha oscillations; Spatial attention	SURFACE LAPLACIAN; DYNAMICS; MODULATION; MECHANISMS; CONTINUITY; COMPONENTS; RESPONSES; CORRELATE; SYSTEM	Objective: Top-down spatial attention is effective at selecting a target sound from a mixture. However, nonspatial features often distinguish sources in addition to location. This study explores whether redundant nonspatial features are used to maintain selective auditory attention for a spatially defined target. Design: We recorded electroencephalography while subjects focused attention on one of three simultaneous melodies. In one experiment, subjects (n = 17) were given an auditory cue indicating both the location and pitch of the target melody. In a second experiment (n = 17 subjects), the cue only indicated target location, and we compared two conditions: one in which the pitch separation of competing melodies was large, and one in which this separation was small. Results: In both experiments, responses evoked by onsets of events in sound streams were modulated by attention, and we found no significant difference in this modulation between small and large pitch separation conditions. Therefore, the evoked response reflected that target stimuli were the focus of attention, and distractors were suppressed successfully for all experimental conditions. In all cases, parietal alpha was lateralized following the cue, but before melody onset, indicating that subjects initially focused attention in space. During the stimulus presentation, this lateralization disappeared when pitch cues were strong but remained significant when pitch cues were weak, suggesting that strong pitch cues reduced reliance on sustained spatial attention. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that once a well-defined target stream at a known location is selected, top-down spatial attention plays a weak role in filtering out a segregated competing stream.

Temporally-precise disruption of prefrontal cortex informed by the timing of beta bursts impairs human action-stopping	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Cognitive control; Electroencephalography; Oscillations; Stop signal task; Transcranial magnetic stimulation	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; INFERIOR FRONTAL-CORTEX; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; WORKING-MEMORY; SILENT PERIOD; MOTOR; OSCILLATIONS; SUPPRESSION; ACTIVATION	Human action-stopping is thought to rely on a prefronto-basal ganglia-thalamocortical network, with right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) posited to play a critical role in the early stage of implementation. Here we sought causal evidence for this idea in experiments involving healthy human participants. We first show that action-stopping is preceded by bursts of electroencephalographic activity in the beta band over prefrontal electrodes, putatively rIFC, and that the timing of these bursts correlates with the latency of stopping at a single-trial level: earlier bursts are associated with faster stopping. From this we reasoned that the integrity of rIFC at the time of beta bursts might be critical to successful stopping. We then used fMRI-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to disrupt rIFC at the approximate time of beta bursting. Stimulation prolonged stopping latencies and, moreover, the prolongation was most pronounced in individuals for whom the pulse appeared closer to the presumed time of beta bursting. These results help validate a model of the neural architecture and temporal dynamics of actionstopping. They also highlight the usefulness of prefrontal beta bursts to index an apparently important sub-process of stopping, the timing of which might help explain within- and between-individual variation in impulse control.

Linear Predictive Approaches Separate Field Potentials in Animal Model of Parkinson's Disease	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						levodopa; linear predictive coding; local field potential; mice; Parkinson's disease	DEEP-BRAIN-STIMULATION; TIME-SERIES PREDICTION; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SYMPTOMS; LEVODOPA; HUMANS; 6-OHDA	Parkinson's disease (PD) causes impaired movement and cognition. PD can involve profound changes in cortical and subcortical brain activity as measured by electroencephalography or intracranial recordings of local field potentials (LFP). Such signals can adaptively guide deep-brain stimulation (DBS) as part of PD therapy. However, adaptive DBS requires the identification of triggers of neuronal activity dependent on real time monitoring and analysis. Current methods do not always identify PD-related signals and can entail delays. We test an alternative approach based on linear predictive coding (LPC), which fits autoregressive (AR) models to time-series data. Parameters of these AR models can be calculated by fast algorithms in real time. We compare LFPs from the striatum in an animal model of PD with dopamine depletion in the absence and presence of the dopamine precursor levodopa, which is used to treat motor symptoms of PD. We show that in dopamine-depleted mice a first order AR model characterized by a single LPC parameter obtained by LFP sampling at 1 kHz for just 1 min can distinguish between levodopa-treated and saline-treated mice and outperform current methods. This suggests that LPC may be useful in online analysis of neuronal signals to guide DBS in real time and could contribute to DBS-based treatment of PD.

In a recent study (Lasaponara et al., 2018) we showed during orienting of spatial attention with endogenous central cues, both the EEG markers reflecting the early phases of orienting (Early Directing Attention Negativity) and those reflecting the late setting-up of sensory facilitation in the visual cortex (Late Directing Attention Positivity) are disturbed in N+ when these patients attend the left side of space. In the healthy brain, endogenous cues also elicit EEG activity related to the preparation of manual responses to upcoming spatial targets. Here, we wished to expand on our previous findings and investigate the EEG correlates of cue-related response preparation in N+ patients. To this aim we investigated the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) response and the pre-motor Beta-oscillatory activity evoked by spatially informative central cues during the performance of a Posner task. Due to concomitant contralesional motor impairments, N+ an N- patients performed the task only with the ipsilesional right-hand. Compared to healthy controls and patients without neglect, N+ displayed a pathological suppression of CNV component that was independent of cue direction. In addition, the amplitude of the CNV in response to right-pointing cues was positively correlated with neglect severity in line bisection. N+ also displayed a pathological enhancement of pre-motor Beta oscillations over the left hemisphere during the time period that preceded manual responses to targets in the left side of space, particularly to invalidly cued ones. Synchronization in the Beta-band (ERS) was also correlated with lower detection rate and slower RTs to Invalid targets in the left side of space. These results provide new insights on the premotor components of the spatial orienting deficits suffered by patients with left spatial neglect and can help improving its diagnosis and rehabilitation.

Besides magnetic resonance imaging functional connectivity, electroencephalographic synchrony is also an available biomarker. However, the clinical relevance of electroencephalographic synchrony in hemiparesis has not been fully understood.Objective.We aimed to demonstrate the usefulness of the phase synchrony index (PSI) by showing associations between the PSI and poststroke outcome in patients with hemiparesis.Methods.This observational study included 40 participants with cortical ischemic stroke (aged 69.8 +/- 13.8 years) and 22 healthy controls (aged 66.9 +/- 6.5 years). Nineteen-channel electroencephalography was recorded at 36.9 +/- 11.8 days poststroke. Upper extremity Fugl-Meyer scores were assessed at the time of admission/before discharge (FM-UE1/FM-UE2; 32.6 +/- 12.3/121.0 +/- 44.7 days poststroke). Then, correlations between the PSIs and FM-UE1 as well as impairment reduction after rehabilitation (FM-UEgain) were analyzed.Results. The interhemispheric PSI (alpha band) between the primary motor areas (M1s) was lower in patients than in controls and was selectively correlated with FM-UE1 (P= .001). In contrast, the PSI (theta band) centered on the contralesional M1 was higher in patients than in controls and was selectively correlated with FM-UEgain (P= .003). These correlations remained significant after adjusting for confounding factors (age, time poststroke, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, and lesion volume). Furthermore, the latter correlation was significant in severely impaired patients (FM-UE1 <= 10).Conclusions.This study showed that the PSIs were selectively correlated with motor impairment and recovery. Therefore, the PSIs may be potential biomarkers in persons with a hemispheric infarction.

Tracking Cognitive Spare Capacity During Speech Perception With EEG/ERP: Effects of Cognitive Load and Sentence Predictability	EAR AND HEARING			English	Article						Auditory neuroscience; Cognitive hearing science; Cognitive spare capacity; EEG; Electrophysiology; ERP; Event-related potential; Listening effort; Speech perception	WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; SPOKEN WORD RECOGNITION; LISTENING EFFORT; ALPHA-BAND; BRAIN POTENTIALS; EEG ALPHA; HEARING IMPAIRMENT; RECOGNIZING SPEECH; OSCILLATIONS; LANGUAGE	Objectives: Listening to speech in adverse listening conditions is effortful. Objective assessment of cognitive spare capacity during listening can serve as an index of the effort needed to understand speech. Cognitive spare capacity is influenced both by signal-driven demands posed by listening conditions and top-down demands intrinsic to spoken language processing, such as memory use and semantic processing. Previous research indicates that electrophysiological responses, particularly alpha oscillatory power, may index listening effort. However, it is not known how these indices respond to memory and semantic processing demands during spoken language processing in adverse listening conditions. The aim of the present study was twofold: first, to assess the impact of memory demands on electrophysiological responses during recognition of degraded, spoken sentences, and second, to examine whether predictable sentence contexts increase or decrease cognitive spare capacity during listening. Design: Cognitive demand was varied in a memory load task in which young adult participants (n = 20) viewed either low-load (one digit) or high-load (seven digits) sequences of digits, then listened to noise-vocoded spoken sentences that were either predictable or unpredictable, and then reported the final word of the sentence and the digits. Alpha oscillations in the frequency domain and event-related potentials in the time domain of the electrophysiological data were analyzed, as was behavioral accuracy for both words and digits. Results: Measured during sentence processing, event-related desynchronization of alpha power was greater (more negative) under high load than low load and was also greater for unpredictable than predictable sentences. A complementary pattern was observed for the P300/late positive complex (LPC) to sentence-final words, such that P300/LPC amplitude was reduced under high load compared with low load and for unpredictable compared with predictable sentences. Both words and digits were identified more quickly and accurately on trials in which spoken sentences were predictable. Conclusions: Results indicate that during a sentence-recognition task, both cognitive load and sentence predictability modulate electrophysiological indices of cognitive spare capacity, namely alpha oscillatory power and P300/LPC amplitude. Both electrophysiological and behavioral results indicate that a predictive sentence context reduces cognitive demands during listening. Findings contribute to a growing literature on objective measures of cognitive demand during listening and indicate predictable sentence context as a top-down factor that can support ease of listening.

Recent evidence also supports the contribution of the cerebellum to the oscillatory activity of brain networks involved in a wide range of disorders. Kainate, a potent analog of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, can be used to induce dystonia, a neurological movement disorder syndrome consisting of sustained or repetitive involuntary muscle contractions, when applied on the surface of the cerebellum. This research aims to study the interhemispheric cortical communication between the primary motor cortices after repeated kainate application on cerebellar vermis for five consecutive days, in mice. We recorded left and right primary motor cortices electrocorticograms and neck muscle electromyograms, and quantified the motor behavior abnormalities. The results indicated a reduced coherence between left and right motor cortices in low-frequency bands. In addition, we observed a phenomenon of long-lasting adaptation with a modification of the baseline interhemispheric coherence. Our research provides evidence that the cerebellum can control the flow of information along the cerebello-thalamo-cortical neural pathways and can influence interhemispheric communication. This phenomenon could function as a compensatory mechanism for impaired regional networks.

In this study, in addition to behavioral measures, we analyzed oscillations in alpha 2 frequency band in the frontal, occipital, and parietal regions, in response to the application of two neuromodulation protocols in fibromyalgia. The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with 31 women diagnosed with fibromyalgia. The participants were allocated to three groups with the anodic stimulation applied on the left motor cortex: Group 1, for five consecutive days; Group 2, for 10 consecutive days; and Group 3, sham stimulation for five consecutive days. Statistical analysis showed a reduction in pain intensity after treatment for groups in general [F (1.28) = 8.02; p = 0.008;eta(2) = 0.223], in addition to a reduction in alpha 2 in the frontal (p = 0.039; d = 0.384) and parietal (p = 0.021; d = 0.520) regions after the treatment on five consecutive days. We conclude that neuromodulation protocols produced similar effects on pain reduction, but differed with respect to the changes in the alpha 2 frequency band in the frontal and parietal regions.

A novel sleep stage scoring system: Combining expert-based features with the generalized linear model	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						automated scoring; polysomnography; sleep; sleep stages	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; AMERICAN ACADEMY; NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; CHANNEL; RECHTSCHAFFEN; RELIABILITY; COMBINATION; KALES	In this study, we aim to automate the sleep stage scoring process of overnight polysomnography (PSG) data while adhering to expert-based rules. We developed a sleep stage scoring algorithm utilizing the generalized linear modelling (GLM) framework and extracted features from electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyography (EMG) and electrooculogram (EOG) signals based on predefined rules of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) Manual for Scoring Sleep. Specifically, features were computed in 30-s epochs in the time and frequency domains of the signals and were then used to model the probability of an epoch being in each of five sleep stages: N3, N2, N1, REM or Wake. Finally, each epoch was assigned to a sleep stage based on model predictions. The algorithm was trained and tested on PSG data from 38 healthy individuals with no reported sleep disturbances. The overall scoring accuracy reached on the test set was 81.50 +/- 1.14% (Cohen's kappa, kappa=0.73 +/- 0.02). The test set results were highly comparable to the training set, indicating robustness of the algorithm. Furthermore, our algorithm was compared to three well-known commercialized sleep-staging tools and achieved higher accuracies than all of them. Our results suggest that automatic classification is highly consistent with visual scoring. We conclude that our algorithm can reproduce the judgement of a scoring expert and is also highly interpretable. This tool can assist visual scorers to speed up their process (from hours to minutes) and provides a method for a more robust, quantitative, reproducible and cost-effective PSG evaluation, supporting assessment of sleep and sleep disorders.

Moreover, a direct developmental impact is seen in patients with good surgical outcomes, and early and aggressive surgery may increase that developmental gain. Newer techniques including stereoelectroencephalography and magnetic resonance -thermography-guided laser-induced thermal therapy are increasingly used but still need clinical validation. This chapter introduces TSC and its neuroimaging findings. Next, it discusses key challenges specifically associated with pediatric epilepsy surgery in TSC, including the identification of an epileptogenic tuber among many other lesions, the fuzzy boundaries of tubers, and the varying surgical objectives of surgery in challenging cases. A detailed overview of the presurgical workup in TSC is provided, including some newer techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging, alpha-[11C] methyl-l-tryptophan positron emission tomography, and high-frequency oscillations. Finally, several surgical controversies are highlighted, including whether seizures originate in tubers versus the perituber rim, the potential of seizures to propagate to other tubers, and minimally invasive techniques versus maximally aggressive resections, among other topics.

These sleep-specific rhythms seem to be important for brain recovery and memory consolidation. Recently, it was demonstrated that by targeting slow waves in a particular region at a specific phase with closed-loop auditory stimulation, it is possible to locally manipulate slow-wave activity and interact with training-induced neuroplastic changes. In our study, we tested whether closed-loop auditory stimulation targeting the up-phase of slow waves might not only interact with the main sleep rhythms but also with their coupling within the circumscribed region. We demonstrate that while closed-loop auditory stimulation globally enhances delta, theta and sigma power, changes in cross-frequency coupling of these oscillations were more spatially restricted. Importantly, a significant increase in delta-sigma coupling was observed over the right parietal area, located directly posterior to the target electrode. These findings suggest that closed-loop auditory stimulation locally modulates coupling between delta phase and sigma power in a targeted region, which could be used to manipulate sleep-dependent neuroplasticity within the brain network of interest.

In this work, we consider separable inverse problems, where the data are modeled as a linear combination of functions that depend nonlinearly on certain parameters of interest. These parameters may represent neuronal activity in a human brain, frequencies of electromagnetic waves, fluorescent probes in a cell, or magnetic relaxation times of biological tissues. Separable nonlinear inverse problems can be reformulated as underdetermined sparse-recovery problems, and solved using convex programming. This approach has had empirical success in a variety of domains, from geophysics to medical imaging, but lacks a theoretical justification. In particular, compressed-sensing theory does not apply, because the measurement operators are deterministic and violate incoherence conditions such as the restricted-isometry property. Our main contribution is a theory for sparse recovery adapted to deterministic settings. We show that convex programming succeeds in recovering the parameters of interest, as long as their values are sufficiently distinct with respect to the correlation structure of the measurement operator. The theoretical results are illustrated through numerical experiments for two applications: heat-source localization and estimation of brain activity from electroencephalography data.

Hence, a method of brain activity detection based on microwave scattering technology instead of scalp electroencephalogram was developed to evaluate the sleep stage. First, microwaves at a specific frequency were used to penetrate the functional sites of the brain in patients with sleep disorders to change the firing frequency of the activated areas of the brain and analyze and evaluate statistically the effects on sleep improvement. Then, a wavelet packet algorithm was used to decompose the microwave transmission signal, the refined composite multiscale sample entropy, the refined composite multiscale fluctuation-based dispersion entropy and multivariate multiscale weighted permutation entropy were obtained as features from the wavelet packet coefficient. Finally, the mutual information-principal component analysis feature selection method was used to optimize the feature set and random forest was used to classify and evaluate the sleep stage. The results show that after four times of microwave modulation treatment, sleep efficiency improved continuously, the overall maintenance was above 80%, and the insomnia rate was reduced gradually. The overall classification accuracy of the four sleep stages was 86.4%. The results indicate that the microwaves with a certain frequency can treat sleep disorders and detect abnormal brain activity. Therefore, the microwave scattering method is of great significance in the development of a new brain disease treatment, diagnosis and clinical application system.

Broadband slow-wave modulation in posterior and anterior cortex tracks distinct states of propofol-induced unconsciousness	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CONSCIOUSNESS; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; ANESTHESIA; NETWORKS	A controversy has developed in recent years over the roles of frontal and posterior cortices in mediating consciousness and unconsciousness. Disruption of posterior cortex during sleep appears to suppress the contents of dreaming, yet activation of frontal cortex appears necessary for perception and can reverse unconsciousness under anesthesia. We used anesthesia to study how regional cortical disruption, mediated by slow wave modulation of broadband activity, changes during unconsciousness in humans. We found that broadband slow-wave modulation enveloped posterior cortex when subjects initially became unconscious, but later encompassed both frontal and posterior cortex when subjects were more deeply anesthetized and likely unarousable. Our results suggest that unconsciousness under anesthesia comprises several distinct shifts in brain state that disrupt the contents of consciousness distinct from arousal and awareness of those contents.

The origin of these frequency maxima is unknown and remains a mystery. We propose that over billions of years during the evolutionary history of living organisms on Earth, the natural electromagnetic resonant frequencies in the atmosphere, continuously generated by global lightning activity, provided the background electric fields for the development of cellular electrical activity. In some animals, the electrical spectrum is difficult to differentiate from the natural background atmospheric electric field produced by lightning. In this paper, we present evidence for the link between the natural ELF fields and those found in many living organisms, including humans.

Dimensions of anxiety and depression and neurophysiological indicators of error-monitoring: Relationship with delta and theta oscillatory power and error-related negativity amplitude	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						comorbid disorders; delta power; error-related negativity (ERN); GAD; MDD; theta power	OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; BLUNTED NEURAL RESPONSE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; ERN; POTENTIALS; SYMPTOMS; CONFLICT; RELIABILITY; VALIDATION	Error-monitoring processes may be affected by transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology symptoms including trait anxiety, worry, and severity of depressive symptoms. We tested the relationship between continuous measures of anxiety and depressive symptomology and neural correlates of error-monitoring as measured by time-frequency domain delta and theta oscillatory power and time-domain error-related negativity (ERN) amplitude extracted from the electroencephalogram (EEG). Secondary analyses tested for diagnostic group differences in error-related neural responses in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and comorbid psychiatric disorders. About 178 participants (104 female, M[SD](age) = 21.7[4.6]) with a wide range of psychopathology symptoms completed a modified version of the Eriksen flanker task and symptom questionnaires. Residualized difference values between correct and error trials for delta/theta power and error/correct ERN amplitude were used as dependent variables. Linear regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, and task accuracy showed nonsignificant associations of symptom dimension measures with error-related residualized delta/theta power or residualized ERN amplitude. Subset analyses on those with confirmed psychopathology diagnoses also did not predict residualized error-related delta/theta power nor residualized ERN amplitude (n(GAD) = 14, n(MDD) = 28, n(Comorbid) = 19, n(Control) = 85). Taken in the context of the previous literature, results suggest a heterogeneous relationship between depressive and anxiety symptom dimensions and neurophysiological indices of error-monitoring.

Recently, there has been a trend in describing neurophysiological recordings as a series of transient bursts of neural activity rather than averaged sustained oscillations as burst characteristics may be more directly correlated with the neurological generators of brain activity. In this work, we investigate how beta burst characteristics change with age in a large open access dataset. The objectives are (1) to detect and characterize transient beta bursts over the ipsilateral and contralateral primary sensorimotor cortices during a unilateral motor task performance and during wakeful resting, and (2) to identify age-related changes in beta burst characteristics, in the context of earlier reports of age-related changes in beta suppression and the post-movement beta rebound. MEG data, acquired at the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience, of roughly 600 participants with a nearly uniform distribution of ages between 18 and 88 years old was used for analysis. We found that burst rate is the predominant factor related to age-related changes in the amplitude of the induced beta rhythm responses associated with a button press task. Furthermore, we present a cross-validation of burst parameters detected at the sensor- (peak sensor and sensor ROI) and source-level (beamformer spatial filter). This work is as an important step in characterizing transient bursts in neuromagnetic signals in the temporal domain, towards a better understanding of the healthy aging human brain.

Oscillatory activity in the visual cortex can be entrained by transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) as well as periodic visual stimulation (i.e., flicker). Combined tACS and visual flicker stimulation modulates BOLD response, and concurrent 4-Hz auditory click train, and tACS modulate auditory perception in a phase-dependent way. In this study, we investigated whether phase synchrony between concurrent tACS and periodic visual stimulation (i.e., flicker) can modulate performance on a visual matching task. Participants completed a visual matching task on a flickering visual stimulus while receiving either in-phase (0 degrees) or asynchronous (180 degrees, 90 degrees, or 270 degrees) tACS at alpha or theta frequency. Stimulation was applied over either occipital cortex or dorsolateral pFC. Visual performance was significantly better during theta frequency tACS over the visual cortex when it was in-phase (0 degrees) with visual stimulus flicker, compared with antiphase (180 degrees). This effect did not appear with alpha frequency flicker or with dorsolateral pFC stimulation. Furthermore, a control sham group showed no effect. There were no significant performance differences among the asynchronous (180 degrees, 90 degrees, and 270 degrees) phase conditions. Extending previous studies on visual and auditory perception, our results support a crucial role of oscillatory phase in sensory perception and demonstrate a behaviorally relevant combination of visual flicker and tACS. The spatial and frequency specificity of our results have implications for research on the functional organization of perception.

Few studies have documented the effects of a history of adolescent binge drinking on neurophysiological consequences in young adulthood. Synchrony of phase (phase locking (PL)) of event-related oscillations (EROs) within and between different brain areas reflects communication exchange between neural networks and is a sensitive measure of adolescent development in both rats and humans, and thus may be a good translational measure of the potential harmful effects of alcohol exposure during adolescence. In this study, EROs were collected from 1041 young adults of Mexican American and American Indian ancestry (age 18-30 years) with and without a history of adolescent binge drinking (five drinks for boys and four for girls per occasion at least once per month) and in 74 young adult rats with and without a history of 5 weeks of adolescent alcohol vapor exposure. PL of theta and beta frequencies between frontal and parietal cortex were estimated using an auditory-oddball paradigm in the rats and a visual facial expression paradigm in the humans. Significantly lower PL between frontal and parietal cortices in the theta frequencies was seen in both the humans and the rats with a history of adolescent alcohol exposure as compared with their controls. These findings suggest that alcohol exposure during adolescence may result in decreases in synchrony between cortical neuronal networks, suggesting a developmental delay, in young adult humans and in rats.

J	Ogata, K				Ogata, Katsuya			Non-invasive brain stimulation and short-term cortical plasticity	NEUROLOGY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						informed open-loop stimulation; modified ischemic nerve block; non-invasive brain stimulation; transcranial alternating current stimulation; transcranial magnetic stimulation	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; THETA-BURST STIMULATION; MOTOR CORTEX; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EXCITABILITY; OSCILLATIONS; TACS	Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have been widely used to study central nervous system pathophysiology and have revealed new information about the functional roles of specific brain structures. This review first outlines the basic technologies and neural mechanisms associated with NIBS. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was first utilized to obtain motor-evoked potentials, which reflect corticospinal tract function. Later, studies using repetitive TMS and patterned TMS-like theta-burst stimulation reported the presence of aftereffects, which can enhance or inhibit cortical excitability depending on the stimulus frequency or continuous/intermittent stimulation. Over the past two decades, transcranial electrical stimulation has become increasingly popular for neuromodulation, which includes direct current stimulation (tDCS) and alternating current stimulation (tACS). While tDCS modulates cortical excitability depending on the stimulation polarity, tACS exerts its effects in a frequency-phase-dependent manner. Although entrainment may be an important underlying mechanism, the recorded aftereffects are likely due to spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Second, recent innovations using NIBS to induce short-term cortical plasticity are highlighted. State-dependent or informed open-loop stimulation can be used to explore the interactions between endogenous cortical oscillations and TMS. Electroencephalographic oscillations prior to TMS stimulation reflect instantaneous cortical excitability depending on the stimulation power and phase, and repetitive TMS at a certain EEG state can enhance cortical excitability. Finally, temporal deafferentation of the peripheral nerve induced by a modified ischemic nerve block can modulate sensorimotor function after tourniquet deflation. Overall, NIBS techniques are promising tools for investigating human brain functions and developing new protocols for neurorehabilitation.

Many studies have linked this rhythm to motor functions. However, its associations to the movement speed are still unclear. We make a hypothesis that PMBS will be modulated with increasing of movement speeds. We assessed the MRBD and PMBS during isotonic slower self-paced and ballistic movements with 15 healthy subjects. Furthermore, we conduct an additional control experiment with the isometric contraction with two levels of forces to match those in the isotonic slower self-paced and ballistic movements separately. We found that the amplitude of PMBS but not MRBD in motor cortex is modulated by the speed during voluntary movement. PMBS was positively correlated with movement speed and acceleration through the partial correlation analysis. However, there were no changes in the PMBS and MRBD during the isometric contraction with two levels of forces. These results demonstrate a different function of PMBS and MRBD to the movement speed during voluntary activity and suggest that the movement speed would affect the amplitude of PMBS. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Beta-band oscillations are a dominant feature in the sensorimotor system that associate to the motor function. We found that the movement-related postmovement beta synchronization (PMBS) over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex was positively correlated with the speed of a voluntary movement, but the movement-related beta desynchronization (MRBD) was not. Our results show a differential response of the PMBS and MRBD to the movement speed during voluntary movement.

Dynamics of a neuron-glia system: the occurrence of seizures and the influence of electroconvulsive stimuli A mathematical and numerical study	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Nonlinear dynamics; Bifurcation theory; Neuron-glia cell system; Monodomain and bidomain model; Seizure; Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)	LARGE-SCALE BRAIN; BIFURCATION-ANALYSIS; MEMBRANE-TRANSPORT; POTASSIUM DYNAMICS; MODEL; OSCILLATIONS; EXCITABILITY; LEADS; TRANSITIONS; INHIBITION	In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a neuron-glia cell system and the underlying mechanism for the occurrence of seizures. For our mathematical and numerical investigation of the cell model we will use bifurcation analysis and some computational methods. It turns out that an increase of the potassium concentration in the reservoir is one trigger for seizures and is related to a torus bifurcation. In addition, we will study potassium dynamics of the model by considering a reduced version and we will show how both mechanisms are linked to each other. Moreover, the reduction of the potassium leak current will also induce seizures. Our study will show that an enhancement of the extracellular potassium concentration, which influences the Nernst potential of the potassium current, may lead to seizures. Furthermore, we will show that an external forcing term (e.g. electroshocks as unidirectional rectangular pulses also known as electroconvulsive therapy) will establish seizures similar to the unforced system with the increased extracellular potassium concentration. To this end, we describe the unidirectional rectangular pulses as an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations. These approaches will explain the appearance of seizures in the cellular model. Moreover, seizures, as they are measured by electroencephalography (EEG), spread on the macro-scale (cm). Therefore, we extend the cell model with a suitable homogenised monodomain model, propose a set of (numerical) experiment to complement the bifurcation analysis performed on the single-cell model. Based on these experiments, we introduce a bidomain model for a more realistic modelling of white and grey matter of the brain. Performing similar (numerical) experiment as for the monodomain model leads to a suitable comparison of both models. The individual cell model, with its seizures explained in terms of a torus bifurcation, extends directly to corresponding results in both the monodomain and bidomain models where the neural firing spreads almost synchronous through the domain as fast traveling waves, for physiologically relevant paramenters.

Sinusoidal alternating electric currents are delivered to the scalp to affect mostly cortical neurons. tACS is supposed to modulate brain function and, in turn, cognitive processes by entraining brain oscillations and inducing long-term synaptic plasticity. Therefore, tACS has been investigated in cognitive neuroscience, but only recently, it has been also introduced in psychiatric clinical trials. This review describes current concepts and first findings of applying tACS as a potential therapeutic tool in the field of psychiatry. The current understanding of its mechanisms of action is explained, bridging cellular neuronal activity and the brain network mechanism. Revisiting the relevance of altered brain oscillations found in six major psychiatric disorders, putative targets for the management of mental disorders using tACS are discussed. A systematic literature search on PubMed was conducted to report findings of the clinical studies applying tACS in patients with psychiatric conditions. In conclusion, the initial results may support the feasibility of tACS in clinical psychiatric populations without serious adverse events. Moreover, these results showed the ability of tACS to reset disturbed brain oscillations, and thus to improve behavioural outcomes. In addition to its potential therapeutic role, the reactivity of the brain circuits to tACS could serve as a possible tool to determine the diagnosis, classification or prognosis of psychiatric disorders. Future double-blind randomised controlled trials are necessary to answer currently unresolved questions. They may aim to detect response predictors and control for various confounding factors.

NeuroSky Mindwave Mobile Headset 2 as an Intervention for Reduction of Stress and Anxiety Measured With Pulse Rate Variability	2020 COMPUTING IN CARDIOLOGY	Computing in Cardiology Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	Computing in Cardiology Conference (CinC)	SEP 13-16, 2020	Rimini, ITALY				METHODOLOGY; ATTENTION	NeuroSky Mindwave Mobile headset 2 (MMH2) is an EEG-based biofeedback device that can be used to assist in relaxation by providing users feedback on their level of relaxation. In this study, we aimed to assess the effect of using MMH2 on pulse rate variability (PRV) as a measure of relaxation in addition to the in-App real-time data. Six participants were recruited and provided information about the study once they contacted the university. Participants were required to use the Brainwave Visualizer application as part of the NeuroSky suite for relaxation for 10 minutes. PRV of each participant was determined before and after use of the MMH2. Biosignals were initially preprocessed to remove artifacts and resampled at 8Hz for time and frequency domain analysis using purpose written Matlab software. We obtained multiple parameters including the average value of the inter-pulse intervals, standard deviation, root mean square of the successive differences, and stress index, The stress score from the MMH2 screen indicated a decrease in overall stress by the participants. RMSSD decreased from pre-MMH2 to Post-MMH2 (4.6 +/- 5.9; 2.9 +/- 0.9; p=) whilst the Kubios Stress Index decreased as well (0.74 +/- 1.5; 0.44 +/- 1.1, p =) MMH2 can be used to help reduce stress and anxiety levels, making it a potentially useful tool for home use.

Although metacognition is critical in many daily life settings, it remains unclear what information is actually being monitored and what kind of information is being used for metacognitive decisions. In the present study, we investigated whether response information connected to perceptual events contribute to metacognitive decision-making. Therefore, we recorded EEG signals during a perceptual color discrimination task while participants were asked to provide an estimate about the quality of their decision on each trial. Critically, the moment participants provided their confidence judgments varied across conditions, thereby changing the amount of action information (e.g., response competition or response fluency) available for metacognitive decisions. Results from three experiments demonstrate that metacognitive performance improved when first-order action information was available at the moment metacognitive decisions about the perceptual task had to be provided. This behavioral effect was accompanied by enhanced functional connectivity (beta phase synchrony) between motor areas and prefrontal regions, exclusively observed during metacognitive decision-making. Our findings demonstrate that action information contributes to metacognitive decision-making, thereby painting a picture of metacognition as a process that integrates sensory evidence and information about our interactions with the world.

Among these are 2-(3,5-dimethoxy-4-((2-methylallyl)oxy)phenyl)ethanamine (MAL) and 2-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-methoxyethan-1-amine (BOD). However, studies characterizing their abuse potential are still lacking. Aim: The purpose of this study was to investigate the abuse potential of MAL and BOD. Methods: The psychostimulant, reinforcing, and rewarding properties of MAL and BOD were analyzed using locomotor sensitization, self-administration, and conditioned place preference tests. Dopamine antagonists (i.e. SCH23390, haloperidol) were administered during conditioned place preference to evaluate the involvement of the mesolimbic dopamine system. Furthermore, dopamine-related protein expression in the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area was measured along with dopamine concentrations in the nucleus accumbens. Electroencephalography was conducted to determine effects of MAL and BOD on brain wave activity. Results: MAL induced psychostimulant effects and sensitization, while BOD induced locomotor depression in mice. Only MAL was self-administered by rats. Both drugs induced conditioned place preference in mice at different doses; dopamine receptor antagonists blocked MAL- and BOD-induced conditioned place preference. Both the compounds altered the expression of dopamine receptor D(1)and D(2)proteins in the nucleus accumbens and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter in the ventral tegmental area, enhanced dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens, and increased delta and gamma wave activities in the brain. Conclusions: MAL may induce abuse potential via the mesolimbic dopaminergic system and possibly accompanied by alterations in brain wave activity. Moreover, the lack of rewarding and reinforcing effects in BOD suggest that this drug may have little to no capability to engender compulsive behavior, though having found to induce alterations in dopaminergic system and brain wave activities.

Age-related executive deficits are said to be associated with a deterioration of the frontal lobes. Neurofeedback is a training method which aims at acquiring self-control over certain brain activity patterns. It is considered as an effective approach to help improve attentional and self-management capabilities. However, studies evaluating the efficacy of neurofeedback training to boost executive functioning in an elderly population are still relatively rare and controversial. The aim of our study was to contribute to the assessment of the efficacy of neurofeedback as a method for enhancing executive functioning in the elderly. We provided a group of seniors with beta up-training (12-22 Hz), consisting of 20 sessions (30 minutes each), on the Cz site and tested its possible beneficiary influence on attentional control assessed by means of the Stroop and Simon tasks. The analysis of the subjects' mean reaction times during consecutive tasks in the test and the retest, after implementation of neurofeedback training, showed a significant improvement. In contrast, the difference in reaction times between the test and the retest in the control group who had not been submitted to neurofeedback training was not significant.

Dynamic network interactions among distinct brain rhythms as a hallmark of physiologic state and function	COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY			English	Article							MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; EEG ALPHA; THETA; PHASE; COHERENCE; SLEEP; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; PLASTICITY	Lin & Liu et al. analyze EEG recordings and report that each sleep stage is characterized by a specific ensemble of coupling profiles and a network of brain-rhythm communications. Their work challenges the current paradigm of understanding physiologic states through distinct or dominant brain rhythms and identifies networks of brain-rhythm interactions as a signature of physiologic state and function. Brain rhythms are associated with a range of physiologic states, and thus, studies have traditionally focused on neuronal origin, temporal dynamics and fundamental role of individual brain rhythms, and more recently on specific pair-wise interactions. Here, we aim to understand integrated physiologic function as an emergent phenomenon of dynamic network interactions among brain rhythms. We hypothesize that brain rhythms continuously coordinate their activations to facilitate physiologic states and functions. We analyze healthy subjects during sleep, and we demonstrate the presence of stable interaction patterns among brain rhythms. Probing transient modulations in brain wave activation, we discover three classes of interaction patterns that form an ensemble representative for each sleep stage, indicating an association of each state with a specific network of brain-rhythm communications. The observations are universal across subjects and identify networks of brain-rhythm interactions as a hallmark of physiologic state and function, providing new insights on neurophysiological regulation with broad clinical implications.

Whether regulation strategies may alter brain oscillatory activity and how they are influenced by format and emotional dimensions is still under debate. We investigated oscillatory brain dynamics during the implementation of the strategy of Distancing and during the regulation of the emotions elicited by neutral and unpleasant pictures and, for the first time, words. When implementing the strategy, an early increase in theta band in posterior regions was observed (Effect of Strategy). We interpret this effect as a marker of emotion regulation, and we suggest an integrative framework of the role of theta on regulatory processes. When regulating the emotional impact elicited by stimuli, a decrease in the theta and beta bands in posterior regions for pictures, but not for words, was observed (Effect of Regulation). Behaviorally, the Effect of Regulation was evident for both pictures and words and more pronounced for Valence than for Arousal. These results contribute to better understand the neural and behavioral features of Distancing (both Effect of Strategy and of Regulation), and open up the possibility to clarify which strategy works better to modulate specific stimulus types and emotional dimensions.

Electrophysiological (EEG) and Inter-Brain Connectivity Evidence	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						gestures; hyperscanning; inter-brain connectivity	FRONTAL-CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; MOTOR; THETA; COOPERATION; SELF; RECOGNITION; ATTENTION; EMPATHY	Communication can be considered as a joint action that involves two or more individuals transmitting different information. In particular, non-verbal communication involves body movements used to communicate different information, characterized by the use of specific gestures. The present study aims to investigate the electrophysiological (EEG) correlates underlying the use of affective, social, and informative gestures during a non-verbal interaction between an encoder and decoder. From the results of the single brain and inter-brain analyses, an increase of frontal alpha, delta, and theta brain responsiveness and inter-brain connectivity emerged for affective and social gestures; while, for informative gestures, an increase of parietal alpha brain responsiveness and alpha, delta, and theta inter-brain connectivity was observed. Regarding the inter-agents' role, an increase of frontal alpha activity was observed in the encoder compared to the decoder for social and affective gestures. Finally, regarding gesture valence, an increase of theta brain responsiveness and theta and beta inter-brain connectivity was observed for positive gestures on the left side compared to the right one.

Microelectrode recordings in human epilepsy: a case for clinical translation	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Review						microelectrode; single units; extracellular action potential; stereoelectroencephalography; subdural grid	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN TEMPORAL-LOBE; INTERICTAL SPIKE GENERATION; HUMAN LIMBIC NEURONS; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPAL; IN-VIVO; FIRING PATTERNS; SINGLE NEURONS; HUMAN BRAIN; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY	With their 'all-or-none' action potential responses, single neurons (or units) are accepted as the basic computational unit of the brain. There is extensive animal literature to support the mechanistic importance of studying neuronal firing as a way to understand neuronal microcircuits and brain function. Although most studies have emphasized physiology, there is increasing recognition that studying single units provides novel insight into system-level mechanisms of disease. Microelectrode recordings are becoming more common in humans, paralleling the increasing use of intracranial electroencephalography recordings in the context of presurgical evaluation in focal epilepsy. In addition to single-unit data, microelectrode recordings also record local field potentials and high-frequency oscillations, some of which may be different to that recorded by clinical macroelectrodes. However, microelectrodes are being used almost exclusively in research contexts and there are currently no indications for incorporating microelectrode recordings into routine clinical care. In this review, we summarize the lessons learnt from 65 years of microelectrode recordings in human epilepsy patients. We cover the electrode constructs that can be utilized, principles of how to record and process microelectrode data and insights into ictal dynamics, interictal dynamics and cognition. We end with a critique on the possibilities of incorporating single-unit recordings into clinical care, with a focus on potential clinical indications, each with their specific evidence base and challenges.

J	Brandmeyer, T; Delorme, A				Brandmeyer, Tracy; Delorme, Arnaud			Closed-Loop Frontal Midline theta Neurofeedback: A Novel Approach for Training Focused-Attention Meditation	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						adaptive neurofeedback; frontal mid-line theta; meditation; EEG; attention training	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; COGNITIVE CONTROL; CONFLICT DETECTION; HUMAN ANTERIOR; BRAIN; MEMORY; PERFORMANCE; LONG; DYNAMICS; ADHD	Cortical oscillations serve as an index of both sensory and cognitive processes and represent one of the most promising candidates for training and targeting the top-down mechanisms underlying executive functions. Research findings suggest that theta (theta) oscillations (3-7 Hz) recorded over frontal-midline electrodes are broadly associated with a number of higher-order cognitive processes and may serve as the mechanistic backbone for cognitive control. Frontal-midline theta (FM theta) oscillations have also been shown to inversely correlate with activity in the default mode network (DMN), a network in the brain linked to spontaneous thought processes such as mind-wandering and rumination. In line with these findings, we previously observed increased FM theta oscillations in expert meditation practitioners during reported periods of focused-attention meditation practice when compared to periods of mind-wandering. In an effort to narrow the explanatory gap by directly connecting observed neurophysiological activity in the brain to the phenomenological nature of reported experience, we designed a methodologically novel and adaptive neurofeedback protocol with the aim of modulating FM theta while having meditation novice participants implement breath-focus strategies derived from focused-attention mediation practices. Participants who received eight sessions of the adaptive FM theta-meditation neurofeedback protocol were able to significantly modulate FM theta over frontal electrodes using focused-attention meditation strategies relative to their baseline by the end of the training and demonstrated significantly faster reaction times on correct trials during the n-back working memory task assessed before and after the FM theta-meditation neurofeedback protocol. No significant differences in frontal theta activity or behavior were observed in the active control participants who received age and gender matched sham neurofeedback. These findings help lay the groundwork for the development of brain training protocols and neurofeedback applications that aim to train features of the mental states and traits associated with focused-attention meditation.

The role of node dynamics in shaping emergent functional connectivity patterns in the brain	NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Structural connectivity; Functional connectivity; Neural mass model; Coupled oscillator theory; Hopf bifurcation; False bifurcation	BIFURCATION-ANALYSIS; NETWORK; SYNCHRONIZATION; MODELS; EEG; ORGANIZATION; CRITICALITY; COHERENCE; MEG	The contribution of structural connectivity to functional brain states remains poorly understood. We present a mathematical and computational study suited to assess the structure-function issue, treating a system of Jansen-Rit neural mass nodes with heterogeneous structural connections estimated from diffusion MRI data provided by the Human Connectome Project. Via direct simulations we determine the similarity of functional (inferred from correlated activity between nodes) and structural connectivity matrices under variation of the parameters controlling single-node dynamics, highlighting a nontrivial structure-function relationship in regimes that support limit cycle oscillations. To determine their relationship, we firstly calculate network instabilities giving rise to oscillations, and the so-called 'false bifurcations' (for which a significant qualitative change in the orbit is observed, without a change of stability) occurring beyond this onset. We highlight that functional connectivity (FC) is inherited robustly from structure when node dynamics are poised near a Hopf bifurcation, whilst near false bifurcations, and structure only weakly influences FC. Secondly, we develop a weakly coupled oscillator description to analyse oscillatory phase-locked states and, furthermore, show how the modular structure of FC matrices can be predicted via linear stability analysis. This study thereby emphasises the substantial role that local dynamics can have in shaping large-scale functional brain states. Author SummaryPatterns of oscillation across the brain arise because of structural connections between brain regions. However, the type of oscillation at a site may also play a contributory role. We focus on an idealised model of a neural mass network, coupled using estimates of structural connections obtained via tractography on Human Connectome Project MRI data. Using a mixture of computational and mathematical techniques, we show that functional connectivity is inherited most strongly from structural connectivity when the network nodes are poised at a Hopf bifurcation. However, beyond the onset of this oscillatory instability a phase-locked network state can undergo a false bifurcation, and structural connectivity only weakly influences functional connectivity. This highlights the important effect that local dynamics can have on large-scale brain states.

Proper brain function requires an efficient web of connections and once certain complexity is attained due to the number and coordinated activities of the brain cell networks, the emergent properties of cognition and consciousness take place. Seeking to identify main features of the nervous system organization for optimal function, it is here proposed that while catalytic closure yielded life, neuroglial closure produced cognition/consciousness.

We develop new clustering methods for identifying synchronized brain regions, where the EEGs show similar oscillations or waveforms according to their spectral densities. We treat the estimated spectral densities from many epochs or trials as functional data and develop clustering algorithms based on functional data ranking. The two proposed clustering algorithms use different dissimilarity measures: distance of the functional medians and the area of the central region. The performance of the proposed algorithms is examined by simulation studies. We show that, when contaminations are present, the proposed methods for clustering spectral densities are more robust than the mean-based methods. The developed methods are applied to two stages of resting state EEG data from a male college student, corresponding to early exploration of functional connectivity in the human brain.

Resolving this so-called exploitation-exploration dilemma involves the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Using human intracranial electrophysiological recordings, we discovered that neural activity in the ventral mPFC infers and tracks the reliability of the ongoing plan to proactively encode upcoming action outcomes as either learning signals or potential triggers to explore new plans. By contrast, the dorsal mPFC exhibits neural responses to action outcomes, which results in either improving or abandoning the ongoing plan. Thus, the mPFC resolves the exploitation-exploration dilemma through a two-stage, predictive coding process: a proactive ventromedial stage that constructs the functional signification of upcoming action outcomes and a reactive dorsomedial stage that guides behavior in response to action outcomes.

Feedforward prediction error signals during episodic memory retrieval	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; WORKING-MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPUS; NEOCORTEX; FEEDBACK; REGIONS; MODELS; CORTEX; RIPPLE	Our memories enable us to form expectations for our future experiences, yet the precise neural mechanisms underlying how we compare any experience to our memory remain unknown. Here, using intracranial EEG recordings, we show that episodic memories formed after a single visual experience establish expectations for future experience within neocortical-medial temporal lobe circuits. When subsequent experiences violate these expectations, we find a 80-120 Hz prediction error signal that emerges in both visual association areas and the medial temporal lobe. Critically, this error signal emerges in visual association areas first and then propagates to the medial temporal lobe. This error signal is accompanied by alpha coherence between the two regions. Our data therefore suggest that internal models formed from episodic memories are generated throughout the visual hierarchy after just a single exposure, and that these internal models are then used for comparison with future experiences.

Sleep slow-wave homeostasis and cognitive functioning in children with electrical status epilepticus in sleep	SLEEP			English	Article						synaptic downscaling; slow waves; ESES; CSWS; sleep; cognition	CONTINUOUS SPIKE-WAVES; CORTICAL SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURONAL NETWORKS; FOCAL EPILEPSIES; GRIN2A MUTATIONS; EEG; ENCEPHALOPATHY; ESES; CONSOLIDATION; OSCILLATION	Study Objectives: Encephalopathy with electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES) is characterized by non-rapid eye movement (non-REM)-sleep-induced epileptiform activity and acquired cognitive deficits. The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis describes the process of daytime synaptic potentiation balanced by synaptic downscaling in non-REM-sleep and is considered crucial to retain an efficient cortical network. We aimed to study the overnight decline of slow waves, an indirect marker of synaptic downscaling, in patients with ESES and explore whether altered downscaling relates to neurodevelopmental and behavioral problems. Methods: Retrospective study of patients with ESES with at least one whole-night electroencephalogram (EEG) and neuropsychological assessment (NPA) within 4 months. Slow waves in the first and last hour of non-REM-sleep were analyzed. Differences in slow-wave slope (SWS) and overnight slope course between the epileptic focus and non-focus electrodes and relations to neurodevelopment and behavior were analyzed. Results: A total of 29 patients with 44 EEG similar to NPA combinations were included. Mean SWS decreased from 357 to 327 mu V/s (-8%, p < 0.001) across the night and the overnight decrease was less pronounced in epileptic focus than in non-focus electrodes (-5.6% vs. -8.7%, p = 0.003). We found no relation between SWS and neurodevelopmental test results in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Patients with behavioral problems showed less SWS decline than patients without and the difference was most strildng in the epileptic focus (-0.9% vs. -8.8%, p= 0.006). Conclusions: Slow-wave homeostasis-a marker of synaptic homeostasis-is disturbed by epileptiform activity in ESES. Behavioral problems, but not neurodevelopmental test results, were related to severity of this disturbance.	[van den Munckhof, Bart; Gefferie, Silvano R.; van Noort, Suus A.

Studies have shown that such resources diminish with aging and disease. EEG spectral analysis is a method that has the potential to provide insight into neural alterations affecting motor-cognitive performance. The aim of this study was to assess changes in spectral analysis during dual-task walking in aging and disease Methods 10 young adults, ten older adults, and ten patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) completed an auditory oddball task while standing and while walking on a treadmill. Spectral power within four frequency bandwidths, delta (< 4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and beta (12-30 Hz), was calculated using Event-Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) analyses and compared between single task and dual task and between groups. Results Differences in ERSP were found in all groups between the single and dual-task conditions. In response to dual-task walking, beta increased in all groups (p < 0.026), delta decreased in young adults (p = 0.03) and patients with PD (0.015) while theta increased in young adults (p = 0.028) but decreased in older adults (p = 0.02) and patients with PD (p = 0.015). Differences were seen between the young, the older adults, and the patients with PD. Conclusions These findings are the first to show changes in the power of different frequency bands during dual-task walking with aging and disease. These specific brain modulations may reflect deficits in readiness and allocation of attention that may be responsible for the deficits in dual-task performance.

Abnormal beta and gamma frequency neural oscillations mediate auditory sensory gating deficit in schizophrenia	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Gamma; Beta; EEG; P50; Gating; Schizophrenia	EVOKED RESPONSE SUPPRESSION; POOR P50 SUPPRESSION; POTENTIAL ABNORMALITIES; COMPUTER-MODEL; CA3 REGION; MODULATION; MECHANISMS; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; STIMULATION	Background: Sensory gating is a process in which the brain's response to irrelevant and repetitive stimuli is inhibited. The sensory gating deficit in schizophrenia (SZ) is typically measured by the ratio or difference score of the P50 event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes in response to a paired click paradigm. While the P50 gating effect has usually been measured in relation to the peak amplitude of the S1 and S2 P50 ERPs, there is increasing evidence that inhibitory processes may be reflected by evoked or induced oscillatory activity during the interclick interval in the beta (20-30 Hz) and gamma (30-50 Hz) frequency bands. We therefore examined the relationship between frequency specific activity in the inter-click interval with gating effects in the time and frequency domains. Method: Paired-auditory stimuli were presented to 131 participants with schizophrenia and 196 healthy controls (HC). P50 ERP amplitudes to S1 and S2as well as averaged- and single-trial beta (20-30 Hz) and gamma (30-50 Hz) frequency power during the inter-click interval were measured from the CZ electrode site. Results: In the time domain, P50 gating deficits were apparent in both ratio and difference scores. This effect was mainly due to smaller S1 amplitudes in the patient group. SZ patients exhibited less evoked beta and gamma power, particularly at the 0-100 ms time point, in response to S1. Early (0-100 ms) evoked beta and gamma responses were critical in determining the S1 amplitude and extent of P50 gating across the delay interval for both HC and SZ. Conclusion: Our findings support a disruption in initial sensory registration in those with SZ, and do not support an active mechanism throughout the delay interval. The degree of response to S1 and early beta and gamma frequency oscillations in the delay interval provides information about the mechanisms supporting auditory sensory gating, and may provide a framework for studying the mechanisms that support sensory inhibition.

Theta burst stimulation (TBS), a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, can be used to influence cerebellar activity. Our aim was to explore the potential of cerebellar TBS in modulating visuo-motor adaptation, a form of motor learning, in young healthy subjects. Cerebellar TBS was applied immediately before the learning phase of a visuo-motor adaptation task (VAT), in two different experiments. Firstly, we evaluated the behavioral effects of continuous (cTBS), intermittent (iTBS) or sham TBS on the learning, re-adaptation and de-adaptation phases of VAT. Subsequently, we investigated the changes induced by iTBS or sham TBS on motor cortical activity related to each phase of VAT, as measured by concomitant TMS/EEG recordings. We found that cerebellar TBS induced a robust bidirectional modulation of the VAT performance. More specifically, cerebellar iTBS accelerated visuo-motor adaptation, by speeding up error reduction in response to a novel perturbation. This gain of function was still maintained when the novel acquired motor plan was tested during a subsequent phase of re-adaptation. On the other hand, cerebellar cTBS induced the opposite effect, slowing the rate of error reduction in both learning and re-adaptation phases. Additionally, TMS/EEG recordings showed that cerebellar iTBS induced specific changes of cortical activity in the interconnected motor networks. The improved performance was accompanied by an increase of TMS-evoked cortical activity and a generalized desynchronization of TMS-evoked cortical oscillations. Taken together, our behavioral and neurophysiological findings provide the first-time multimodal evidence of the potential efficacy of cerebellar TBS in improving motor learning, by promoting successful cerebellar-cortical reorganization.

Transcranial random noise stimulation is more effective than transcranial direct current stimulation for enhancing working memory in healthy individuals: Behavioural and electrophysiological evidence	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						tDCS; tRNS; DLPFC; EEG; Working memory	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NONINVASIVE BRAIN-STIMULATION; SERIAL-ADDITION TASK; OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA; TDCS; ENHANCEMENT; MAINTENANCE; COGNITION; LOAD	Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to improve working memory (WM) performance in healthy individuals, however effects tend to be modest and variable. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) can be delivered with a direct-current offset (DC-offset) to induce equal or even greater effects on cortical excitability than tDCS. To-date, no research has directly compared the effects of these techniques on WM performance or underlying neurophysiological activity. Objective: To compare the effects of anodal tDCS, tRNS + DC-offset, or sham stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on WM performance and task-related EEG oscillatory activity in healthy adults. Methods: Using a between-subjects design, 49 participants were allocated to receive either anodal tDCS (N = 16), high-frequency tRNS + DC-offset (N = 16), or sham stimulation (N = 17) to the left DLPFC. Changes in WM performance were assessed using the Sternberg WM task completed before and 5- and 25-min post-stimulation. Event-related synchronisation/desynchronisation (ERS/ERD) of oscillatory activity was analysed from EEG recorded during WM encoding and maintenance. Results: tRNS induced more pronounced and consistent enhancements in WM accuracy when compared to both tDCS and sham stimulation. Improvements in WM performance following tRNS were accompanied by increased theta ERS and diminished gamma ERD during WM encoding, which were significantly greater than those observed following anodal tDCS or sham stimulation. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the potential of tRNS + DC-offset to modulate cognitive and electrophysiological measures of WM and raise the possibility that tRNS + DC-offset may be more effective and reliable than tDCS for enhancing WM performance in healthy individuals.

J	Li, XY; Yang, XL; Sun, ZK				Li, XiaoYuan; Yang, XiaoLi; Sun, ZhongKui			Alpha rhythm slowing in a modified thalamo-cortico-thalamic model related with Alzheimer's disease	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEURAL MASS MODEL; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EEG; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; MECHANISMS; SIMULATION; GENERATION; FREQUENCY; BAND	A decrease in alpha band power is defined as a hallmark of electroencephalogram (EEG) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study devotes to understanding the neuronal correlates of alpha rhythm slowing associated with AD from the view of neurocomputation. Firstly, a modified computational model of thalamo-cortico-thalamic (TCT) circuitry is constructed by incorporating two important biologically plausible ingredients. One is the disinhibition property between different inhibitory interneurons in the cortical module. The other is the full relay function of thalamic relay nucleus (TCR) to the cortical module. Then, by decreasing synaptic connectivity parameters to mimic the neuropathological condition of synapse loss in AD, the correlation between neuronal synaptic behavior and abnormal alpha rhythm is simulated by means of power spectral analysis. The results indicate that these decreases of synaptic activity, i.e., not only the excitatory synaptic connections from TCR to fast inhibitory interneurons C-fte and from excitatory interneurons to pyramidal neurons C-pxe but also the inhibitory synaptic connections from fast inhibitory interneurons to slow inhibitory interneurons C-lfi and from inhibitory interneurons to TCR C-tii, can significantly diminish the peak power density over the alpha band of the thalamic output, which implies that there is a slowing of alpha band. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism behind the alpha rhythmic changes is analyzed using nonlinear dynamical technique. The results reveal that decreases of C-fte, C-pxe, C-lfi and C-tii can make the thalamic module transfer from a limit cycle mode to a point attractor mode, which may lead to the alpha rhythm slowing in the modified TCT model. We expect this work can be helpful in identifying early biomarkers of AD's EEG and understanding potential pathogenesis of AD.

While Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is commonly used to suppress these ocular artifacts, its performance under free viewing conditions has not been systematically evaluated and many published reports contain residual artifacts. Here I evaluated and optimized ICA-based correction for two tasks with unconstrained eye movements: visual search in images and sentence reading. In a first step, four parameters of the ICA pipeline were varied orthogonally: the (1) high-pass and (2) low-pass filter applied to the training data, (3) the proportion of training data containing myogenic saccadic spike potentials (SP), and (4) the threshold for eye tracker-based component rejection. In a second step, the eye-tracker was used to objectively quantify the correction quality of each ICA solution, both in terms of undercorrection (residual artifacts) and overcorrection (removal of neurogenic activity). As a benchmark, results were compared to those obtained with an alternative spatial filter, Multiple Source Eye Correction (MSEC). With commonly used settings, Infomax ICA not only left artifacts in the data, but also distorted neurogenic activity during eye movement-free intervals. However, correction results could be strongly improved by training the ICA on optimally filtered data in which SPs were massively overweighted. With optimized procedures, ICA removed virtually all artifacts, including the SP and its associated spectral broadband artifact from both viewing paradigms, with little distortion of neural activity. It also outperformed MSEC in terms of SP correction. Matlab code is provided.

How visual working memory handles distraction: cognitive mechanisms and electrophysiological correlates	VISUAL COGNITION			English	Article						Selective attention; biased competition; executive functions; neuronal networks; brain oscillations	FEATURE-BASED ATTENTION; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; EEG DYNAMICS DISSOCIATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; NEURAL MECHANISMS; TOP-DOWN; SALIENT DISTRACTORS; FLUID INTELLIGENCE	The ability to selectively encode relevant information (filtering ability) is crucial to make best use of the severely limited space thatvisual working memory (VWM)provides. This review considers why filtering ability is important, how it is measured, and it discusses how filtering might be implemented computationally at the cognitive and neuronal level. Based on theoretical considerations, we explore the possibility that filtering ability involves not only the suppression of irrelevant, but also the enhancement of relevant information - functions that might be implemented by different brain mechanisms; and we review behavioural and electrophysiological data in light of the various resulting model versions. We also highlight that filtering is better understood as coordinated brain network activity, rather than being the function of a single region. Broadcasting of control signals from prefrontal cortex appears critical in upholding information in posterior cortical areas in the absence of distractors. The very same ability might also support selective processing of relevant information in the presence of distractors.

J	Taskov, T; Dushanova, J				Taskov, Tihomir; Dushanova, Juliana			Reading-Network in Developmental Dyslexia before and after Visual Training	SYMMETRY-BASEL			English	Article						EEG; functional connectivity; developmental dyslexia; frequency oscillations; reading of single words; visual training tasks; post-training network	COMPLEX BRAIN NETWORKS; CHILDREN; CONNECTIVITY; EEG; ORGANIZATION; METAANALYSIS; SENSITIVITY; ATTENTION; DEFICITS; REGIONS	Electroencephalographic studies using graph-theoretic analysis have found aberrations in functional connectivity in dyslexics. How visual nonverbal training (VT) can change the functional connectivity of the reading network in developmental dyslexia is still unclear. We studied differences in the local and global topological properties of functional reading networks between controls and dyslexic children before and after VT. The minimum spanning tree method was used to construct the reading networks in multiple electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency bands. Compared to controls, pre-training dyslexics had a higher leaf fraction, tree hierarchy, kappa, and smaller diameter (theta-gamma-frequency bands), and therefore, they had a less segregated neural network than controls. After training, the reading-network metrics of dyslexics became similar to controls. In beta 1 and gamma-frequency bands, pre-training dyslexics exhibited a reduced degree and betweenness centrality of hubs in superior, middle, and inferior frontal areas in both brain hemispheres compared to the controls. Dyslexics relied on the left anterior temporal (beta 1, gamma 1) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (gamma 1), while in the right hemisphere, they relied on the occipitotemporal, parietal, (beta 1), motor (beta 2, gamma 1), and somatosensory cortices (gamma 1). After training, hubs appeared in both hemispheres at the middle occipital (beta), parietal (beta 1), somatosensory (gamma 1), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (gamma 2), while in the left hemisphere, they appeared at the middle temporal, motor (beta 1), intermediate (gamma 2), and inferior frontal cortices (gamma 1, beta 2). Language-related brain regions were more active after visual training. They contribute to an understanding of lexical and sublexical representation. The same role has areas important for articulatory processes of reading.

Parietal Oscillatory Dynamics Mediate Developmental Improvement in Motor Performance	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						beta; magnetoencephalography; motor control; movement; neural dynamics	MOVEMENT BETA-SYNCHRONIZATION; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; DESYNCHRONIZATION; SIGNAL; EEG; MEG; SEPARATION; FREQUENCY; REPRESENTATIONS	Numerous recent studies have sought to determine the developmental trajectories of motor-related oscillatory responses from youth to adulthood. However, most of this work has relied on simple movements, and rarely have these studies linked developmental neural changes with maturational improvements in motor performance. In this study, we recorded magnetoencephalography during a complex finger-tapping task in a large sample of 107 healthy youth aged 9-15 years old. The relationships between region-specific neural activity, age, and performance metrics were examined using structural equation modeling. We found strong developmental effects on behavior and beta oscillatory activity during movement planning, as well as associations between planning-related beta activity and activity within the same region during the movement execution period. However, when all factors were tested, we found that only right parietal cortex beta dynamics mediated the relationship between age and performance on the task. These data suggest that strong, sustained beta activity within the right parietal cortex enhances motor performance, and that these sustained oscillations develop through childhood into early adolescence. In sum, these are the first data to link developmental trajectories in beta oscillatory dynamics with distinct motor performance metrics and implicate the right parietal cortex as a crucial hub in movement execution.

Associations of Alpha and Beta Interhemispheric EEG Coherences with Indices of Attentional Control and Academic Performance	BEHAVIOURAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ARCUATE FASCICULUS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; THETA ACTIVITY; INFORMATION; CONNECTIVITY; SYNCHRONY; LOBES; TASKS	Introduction. Heretofore, research on optimizing academic performance has suffered from an inability to translate what is known about an individual's learning behaviors to how effectively they are able to use the critical nodes and hubs in their cerebral cortex for learning. A previous study from our laboratory suggests that lower theta-beta ratios (TBRs) measured by EEG may be associated with higher academic performance in a medical school curriculum. Methods. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that TBR and academic performance may be correlated with EEG coherence, a measure of brain connectivity. We analyzed the interhemispheric coherences of the subjects involved in our prior study. TBR and coherence measurements were made at 19 scalp electrode recording sites and 171 electrode combinations with eyes open and closed (EO, EC). Control data were acquired during a session of acclimation to the research protocol 3 d before an initial examination in anatomy-physiology (control exam) and were repeated five weeks later, 3 d before a second exam covering different anatomy-physiology topics (comparison exam). Results. Between the control and comparison exams, beta coherences increased significantly at the frontal pole, frontal, parietal, midtemporal, posterior temporal, and occipital recording sites under the EO condition and at the inferior frontal, central, midtemporal, and posterior temporal sites under the EC condition. Alpha coherences increased significantly at the same sites and under the same EO/EC conditions as found for the beta coherences. The beta coherences were negatively correlated with the TBR and were positively correlated with the comparison exam score at the midfrontal electrode site (F3-F4) but only under the EO condition. Beta and alpha coherences at the midfrontal, inferior frontal midtemporal, posterior temporal, and occipital sites were also negatively correlated with the average TBR under the EO condition. Conclusions. Lower TBR, an indicator of attentional control, was associated with higher alpha and beta interhemispheric coherences measured with eyes open at sites overlying the frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices. Changes in EEG coherences and TBRs might be useful as neurophysiological measures of neuroplasticity and the efficacy of strategies for preventing academic underachievement and treatments for improving academic performance.

Previous research shows that nocturnal parasympathetic activity (reflected by heart rate variability [HRV]) is diminished in individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), suggesting hypervigilant sleep. This study investigated differences in nocturnal autonomic activity across sleep stages and explored the association of parasympathetic activity with sleep quality and self-reported physical and psychological wellbeing in individuals with CFS. Methods: Twenty-four patients with medically diagnosed CFS, and 24 matched healthy control individuals participated. Electroencephalography and HRV were recorded during sleep in participants' homes using a minimally invasive ambulatory device. Questionnaires were used to measure self-reported wellbeing and sleep quality. Results: Sleep architecture in patients with CFS differed from that of control participants in slower sleep onset, more awakenings, and a larger proportion of time spent in slow-wave sleep (SWS). Linear mixed-model analyses controlling for age revealed that HRV reflecting parasympathetic activity (normalized high frequency power) was reduced in patients with CFS compared to control participants, particularly during deeper stages of sleep. Poorer self-reported wellbeing and sleep quality was associated with reduced parasympathetic signaling during deeper sleep, but not during wake before sleep, rapid eye movement sleep, or with the proportion of time spent in SWS. Conclusions: Autonomic hypervigilance during the deeper, recuperative stages of sleep is associated with poor quality sleep and self-reported wellbeing. Causal links need to be confirmed but provide potential intervention opportunities for the core symptom of unrefreshing sleep in CFS.

These states are associated with drastic changes in cognitive capacities, mostly determined by the function of the thalamo-cortical system, whose activity can be examined by means of intra-cranial electroencephalogram (iEEG). With the purpose to study in depth the basal activity of the iEEG in adult rats, we analyzed the spectral power and coherence of the iEEG during W and sleep in the paleocortex (olfactory bulb), and in neocortical areas. We also analyzed the laterality of the signals, as well as the influence of the light and dark phases. We found that the iEEG power and coherence of the whole spectrum were largely affected by behavioral states and highly dependent on the cortical areas recorded. We also determined that there are night/day differences in power and coherence during sleep, but not in W. Finally, we observed that, during REM sleep, intra-hemispheric coherence differs between right and left hemispheres. We conclude that the iEEG dynamics are highly dependent on the cortical area and behavioral states. Moreover, there are light/dark phases disparities in the iEEG during sleep, and intra-hemispheric connectivity differs between both hemispheres during REM sleep.

The available magnetoencephalographic (MEG) studies have demonstrated altered alpha-band spectral power and functional connectivity in those with SCD. However, whether the functional connectivity in other frequencies and brain networks, particularly the default mode network (DMN), exhibits abnormalities in SCD remains poorly understood. We recruited 26 healthy controls (HC) without SCD and 27 individuals with SCD to perform resting-state MEG recordings. The power of each frequency band and functional connectivity within the DMN were compared between these two groups. Posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)-based connectivity was also used to test its diagnostic accuracy as a predictor of SCD. There were no significant between-group differences of spectral power in the regional nodes. However, compared with HC, those with SCD demonstrated increased delta-band and gamma-band functional connectivity within the DMN. Moreover, node strength in the PCC exhibited a good discrimination ability at both delta and gamma frequencies.

Over-lapping symptomatology during first presentation challenges the diagnostic process. Reduced sleep spindle density (SSD) was suggested as a biomarker in adults, discerning patients with schizophrenia from patients with depression or healthy controls (HC). We aimed to compare SSD in early-onset schizophrenia (EOS), with MDD, and HC, and to analyse associations of SSD with symptomatology and neurocognitive measures. Methods: Automatic sleep spindle detection was performed on all-night high-density EEG (128 electrodes) data of 12 EOS, 19 MDD, and 57 HC (age range 9.8-19), allowing an age-and sex-matching of 1:2 (patients vs. HC). Severity of current symptoms and neurocognitive variables were assessed in all patients. Results: SSD was de fined between 13.75 and 14.50 Hz as within this frequency range SSD differed between EOS vs. HC in bin by bin analyses (12-15 Hz). In EOS, SSD was lower over 27 centro-temporal electrodes compared to HC and over 9 central electrodes compared to MDD. Reduced SSD in EOS compared to MDD and HC was accom-panied by a high variability of SSD in all adolescents. SSD did not differ between MDD and HC. In the pooled sample of patients, lower SSD was associated with more severe Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale total score, more impaired memory consolidation and processing speed. Conclusion: A high variability of SSD in all adolescents may reflect the evolving character of SSD. The association of reduced SSD with the symptom dimension of impaired cognition cuts across diagnostical entities. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Salience perception is believed to rely on an internal brain model that tracks the evolution of acoustic characteristics of a scene and flags events that do not fit this model as salient. The current study explores how the interdependency between attributes of dynamic scenes affects the neural representation of this internal model and shapes encoding of salient events. Specifically, the study examines how deviations along combinations of acoustic attributes interact to modulate brain responses, and subsequently guide perception of certain sound events as salient given their context. Human volunteers have their attention focused on a visual task and ignore acoustic melodies playing in the background while their brain activity using electroencephalography is recorded. Ambient sounds consist of musical melodies with probabilistically-varying acoustic attributes. Salient notes embedded in these scenes deviate from the melody's statistical distribution along pitch, timbre and/or intensity. Recordings of brain responses to salient notes reveal that neural power in response to the melodic rhythm as well as cross-trial phase alignment in the theta band are modulated by degree of salience of the notes, estimated across all acoustic attributes given their probabilistic context. These neural nonlinear effects across attributes strongly parallel behavioral nonlinear interactions observed in perceptual judgments of auditory salience using similar dynamic melodies; suggesting a neural underpinning of nonlinear interactions that underlie salience perception.

Identifying the electroencephalographic biomarkers in the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may help in the decision-making process of health professionals regarding the non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) protocols. Objective: To summarize quantitative electroencephalographic (qEEG) characteristics of patients with PD with motor symptoms at rest or during movement to identify potential biomarker associated with motor impairment in PD. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in the databases MEDLINE/PubMed, LILACS/BIREME, CINAHL/EBSCO, Web of Science, and CENTRAL, performed according to PRISMA-statement guidelines. Two independent authors searched for studies that reported qEEG data related to motor outcomes at rest or during movements in patients with PD and compared the data with control healthy group. The studies' methodological quality was examined using the Cochrane Handbook. Studies/sample characteristics, qEEG parameters/analyses, and the studies' results were summarized. Prospero-register: CRD42018085660. Results: Nineteen studies (18 cross-sectional/one cross-over) with 312 PD patients and 277 controls, published between 1994-2018, were included for the qualitative analysis. In comparison to healthy controls, our findings suggest a slowing down of the cortical activity in patients with PD due to an increase of slower band waves activity and a decrease of fast band waves at resting and during complex movement execution mainly in the central and frontal cortex. Conclusion: Slowing downof corticalwaves suggest excitatory NIBS for motor impairment in PD. However, qEEGbiomarker for motor symptoms of PD cannot be established yet because the studies that related qEEG with motor outcomes presented methodological poor quality.

Here, we propose a detailed neurobiologically realistic model that captures the neural mechanisms of inter-individual variability observed in cross-modal speech perception. From raw EEG signals recorded from human participants when they were presented with speech vocalizations of McGurk-incongruent and congruent audio-visual (AV) stimuli, we computed the global coherence metric to capture the neural variability of large-scale networks. We identified that participants' McGurk susceptibility was negatively correlated to their alpha band global coherence. The proposed biophysical model conceptualized the global coherence dynamics emerge from coupling between the interacting neural masses-representing the sensory-specific auditory/visual areas and modality nonspecific associative/integrative regions. Subsequently, we could predict that an extremely weak direct AV coupling results in a decrease in alpha band global coherence-mimicking the cortical dynamics of participants with higher McGurk susceptibility. Source connectivity analysis also showed decreased connectivity between sensory-specific regions in participants more susceptible to McGurk effect, thus establishing an empirical validation to the prediction. Overall, our study provides an outline to link variability in structural and functional connectivity metrics to variability of performance that can be useful for several perception and action task paradigms.

Although flicker-induced time dilation is a robust time illusion, its underlying neural mechanisms remain inconclusive. The neural entrainment account proposes that neural entrainment of the exogenous visual stimulus, marked by steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) over the visual cortex, is the cause of time dilation. By contrast, the saliency account argues that the conscious perception of flicker changes is indispensable. In the current study, we examined these two accounts separately. The first two experiments manipulated the level of saliency around the critical fusion threshold (CFF) in a duration discrimination task to probe the effect of change saliency. The amount of dilation correlated with the level of change saliency. The next two experiments investigated whether neural entrainment alone could also induce perceived dilation. To preclude change saliency, we utilized a combination of two high-frequency flickers above the CFF, whereas their beat frequency still theoretically aroused neural entrainment at a low frequency. Results revealed a moderate time dilation induced by combinative high-frequency flickers. Although behavioral results suggested neural entrainment engagement, electroencephalography showed neither larger power nor inter-trial coherence (ITC) at the beat. In summary, change saliency was the most critical factor determining the perception and strength of time dilation, whereas neural entrainment had a moderate influence. These results highlight the influence of higher-level visual processing on time perception.

That similar benefits can arise from multisensory information and within-modality expectation raises the question of whether the underlying neurophysiological processes are the same or distinct. We investigated this by comparing the influence of the following three types of auxiliary probabilistic cues on visual motion discrimination in humans: (1) acoustic motion, (2) a premotion visual symbolic cue, and (3) a postmotion symbolic cue. Using multivariate analysis of the EEG data, we show that both the multisensory and preceding visual symbolic cue enhance the encoding of visual motion direction as reflected by cerebral activity arising from occipital regions similar to 200-400 ms post-stimulus onset. This suggests a common or overlapping physiological correlate of cross-modal and intramodal auxiliary information, pointing to a neural mechanism susceptive to both multisensory and more abstract probabilistic cues. We also asked how prestimulus activity shapes the cue-stimulus combination and found a differential influence on the cross-modal and intramodal combination: while alpha power modulated the relative weight of visual motion and the acoustic cue, it did not modulate the behavioral influence of a visual symbolic cue, pointing to differences in how prestimulus activity shapes the combination of multisensory and abstract cues with task-relevant information.

J	Cheng, N; Murari, K				Cheng, Ning; Murari, Kartikeya			OSERR: an open-source standalone electrophysiology recording system for rodents	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SPATIAL REPRESENTATION; EEG; MODELS; OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; STATE; MICE	Behavioral assessment of rodents is critical for investigation of brain function in health and disease. In vivo neurophysiological recordings are powerful tools to mechanistically dissect neural pathways that underlie behavioral changes, and serve as markers for dynamics, efficacy and safety of potential therapeutic approaches. However, most in vivo recording systems require tethers or telemetry receivers, limiting their compatibility with some behavioral tests. Here, we developed an opensource standalone electrophysiology recording system for rodents (OSERR). It is a tether-free, standalone recording device with two channels, a reference and a ground, that acquires, amplifies, filters and stores data all in itself. Thus, it does not require any cable or receiver. It is also compact and light-weight, and compatible with juvenile mice, as well as multiple recording modalities and standard electrode implantation methods. In addition, we provide the complete design of hardware, and software for operation. As an example, we demonstrated that this standalone system, when configured with a bandwidth of 1-120 Hz and gain of 1000, successfully collected EEG signals during induced seizure, extended recording, anesthesia, and social interactions in mice. The design of this system is practical, economical, and freely available. Thus, this system could enable recording of brain activity during diverse behavioral assays in a variety of arenas and settings, and allow simultaneous recordings from multiple subjects to examine social behaviors. Importantly, with the open-source documentation, researchers could customize the design of the system to their specific needs.

Sustained attention in schoolchildren with type-1 diabetes.

One of the cognitive domains affected by T1D is sustained attention. The aim of this study was to analyze this process in children with T1D and compare their results to those of healthy controls. Methods: Seventeen T1D children attending regular primary school and a similar group of healthy children matched by gender, age, handedness, and educational level were evaluated while identifying happy faces in a Go-NoGo task presented visually with simultaneous electrophysiological recording. Results: Behavioral performance in the two groups was similar but, the T1D children showed greater prefrontal and frontoparietal spectral power in the theta and alpha bands, compared to controls. Distinct patterns of theta lateralization between groups were also observed, with a negative correlation between frontal power magnitudes in delta and theta and glycated hemoglobin levels. Conclusions: These results seem to reflect the early deleterious effects of T1D on neurodevelopment, which affects mainly attention allocation processes and the neurofunctional substrates that underlie them. Significance: This phenomenon emphasizes the need for studies on neural-specific targets in which T1D affects neurodevelopment. (C) 2020 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Motor processes are accompanied by prominent field potential changes in the beta-frequency band (15-29 Hz): in trial-averages, movement initiation is accompanied by beta-band desynchronization over sensorimotor areas, whereas movement cancellation is accompanied by beta -power increases over , (pre)frontal areas. However, averaging misrepresents the true nature of the beta-signal. Unaveraged beta-band activity is characterized by short-lasting, burst-like events, rather than by steady modulations. Therefore, averaging-based quantifications may miss important brain-behavior relationships. To investigate how beta-bursts relate to movement in male and female humans (N = 234), we investigated scalp-recorded beta-band activity during the stop-signal task, which operationalizes both movement initiation and cancellation. Both processes were indexed by systematic spatiotemporal changes in beta-burst rates. Before movement initiation, beta-bursting was prominent at bilateral sensorimotor sites. These burst-rates predicted reaction time (a relationship that was absent in trial-average data), suggesting that sensorimotor beta-bursting signifies an inhibited motor system, which has to be overcome to initiate movements. Indeed, during movement initiation, sensorimotor burst-rates steadily decreased, lateralizing just before movement execution. In contrast, successful movement cancellation was signified by increased phasic beta-bursting over fronto-central sites. Such beta-bursts were followed by short latency increases of bilateral sensorimotor beta-burst rates, suggesting that motor inhibition can be rapidly re-instantiated by frontal areas when movements have to be rapidly cancelled. Together, these findings suggest that beta-bursting is a fundamental signature of the motor system, used by both sensorimotor and frontal areas involved in the trial-by-trial control of behavior.

Detection of neurophysiological features in female R255X MeCP2 mutation mice	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Neurodevelopmental disorders; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Event-related potential (ERP); Rett syndrome; Neurophysiological features; Biomarkers	RETT-SYNDROME; MOUSE MODEL; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; DEFICITS; EXPRESSION; BIOMARKERS; PHENOTYPES; SYNCHRONY; RESPONSES; SEVERITY	Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) that is nearly always caused by loss of function mutations in Methyl-CpG-binding Protein 2 (MECP2) and shares many clinical features with other NDD. Genetic restoration of Mecp2 in symptomatic mice lacking MeCP2 expression can reverse symptoms, providing hope that disease modifying therapies can be identified for WIT. Effective and rapid clinical trial completion relies on well-defined clinical outcome measures and robust biomarkers of treatment responses. Studies on other NDD have found evidence of differences in neurophysiological measures that correlate with disease severity. However, currently there are no well-validated biomarkers in RTT to predict disease prognosis or treatment responses. To address this, we characterized neurophysiological features in a mouse model of WIT containing a knock-in nonsense mutation (p.R255X) in the Mecp2 locus. We found a variety of changes in heterozygous female Mecp2(R255X/X )mice including age-related changes in sleep/wake architecture, alterations in baseline EEG power, increased incidence of spontaneous epileptiform discharges, and changes in auditory evoked potentials. Furthermore, we identified association of some neurophysiological features with disease severity. These findings provide a set of potential non-invasive and translatable biomarkers that can be utilized in preclinical therapy trials in animal models of WIT and eventually within the context of clinical trials.

In a real-life scenario, differential diagnosis between these two conditions can be hard. In this study we use power spectral analysis empowered by exact Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (eLORETA) to evidence the differences between TEA and TGA. Fifteen patients affected by TEA (64.2 +/- 5.2 y.o.; 11 female/4 male; 10 left and 5 right temporal epileptic focus) and 15 patients affected by TGA (65.8 +/- 7.2 y.o.; 11 females/4 males) were retrospectively identified in our clinical records. All patients recorded EEGs after symptoms offset. EEGs were analyzed with eLORETA to evidence power spectral contrast between the two conditions. We used an inverse problem solution to localize the source of spectral differences. We found a significant increase in beta band power over the affected hemisphere of TEA patients. Significant results corresponded to the uncus and para-hippocampal gyrus, respectively Brodmann's Areas: 36, 35, 28, 34. We present original evidence of an increase in beta power in the affected hemisphere (AH) of TEA as compared to TGA. These differences involve key areas of the memory network located in the mesial temporal lobe. Spectral asymmetries could be used in the future to recognize cases of amnesia with a high risk of epilepsy.

Contrasting time and frequency domains: ERN and induced theta oscillations differentially predict post-error behavior	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ERN; Frontal midline theta; Action monitoring; Induced vs; evoked	FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; NEURAL MECHANISMS; RESPONSE ERRORS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; EEG DYNAMICS; ADJUSTMENTS; NEGATIVITY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SUPPRESSION; ACTIVATION	The present study investigated the neural dynamics of error processing in both the time and frequency domains, as well as associated behavioral phenomena, at the single-trial level. We used a technique that enabled us to separately investigate the evoked and induced aspects of the EEG signal (Cohen & Donner, 2013, Journal of Neurophysiology, 110[12], 2752-2763). We found that at the single-trial level, while the (evoked) error-related negativity (ERN) predicted only post-error slowing (PES)-and only when errors occurred on incongruent trials-induced frontal midline theta power served as a robust predictor of both PES and post-error accuracy (PEA) regardless of stimulus congruency. Mediation models of both electrophysiological indices demonstrated that although the relationship between theta and PEA was mediated by PES, there was not a relationship between the ERN and PEA. Our data suggest that although the ERN and frontal midline theta index functionally related underlying cognitive processes, they are not simply the same process manifested in different domains. In addition, our findings are consistent with the adaptive theory of post-error slowing, as PES was positively associated with post-error accuracy at the single-trial level. More generally, our study provides additional support for the inclusion of a time-frequency approach to better understand the role of medial frontal cortex in action monitoring.

However, activities in the high frequency (>100 Hz) range have not been properly studied despite their high potential for sleep scoring in rodents. In the present study, we designed a method for the identification of the sleep-wake states in rats by exclusively using high-frequency activities of the electroencephalogram. By calculating the ratio between the amplitude of the electroencephalographic signal from 110 to 200 Hz and from 110 to 300 Hz, we obtained an index that had values that were low during wakefulness, intermediate during non-REM sleep and high during REM sleep. This high-frequency index (HiFI) allowed the identification of each state without the need to study other signs such as muscle activity or eye movements. To evaluate the performance of the index, we compared it with the conventional scoring of the sleep-wake cycle based upon the study of the electromyogram and delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (6-9 Hz) and sigma (10-14 Hz) bands of the electroencephalogram. The index had an accuracy of 90.43 +/- 1.91% (Cohen's kappa value of 0.82), confirming that the study of the high-frequency activities of the electroencephalogram was sufficient to reliably identify alertness states in the rat. Compared to other sleep-scoring methods, the HiFI has several advantages. It only requires one electroencephalography electrode, thus reducing the severity of the surgical preparation of the experimental animal, and its calculation is very simple, so it can be easily implemented online to classify sleep-wake states in real time.

Here, we use invasive intracranial EEG (iEEG) from multiple cohorts to investigate the neurophysiological underpinnings of the SN and identify dynamic temporal properties that distinguish it from the default mode network (DMN) and dorsolateral frontal-parietal network (FPN), two other large-scale brain networks that play important roles in human cognition. iEEG analysis of network interactions revealed that the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex, which together anchor the SN, had stronger intranetwork interactions with each other than cross-network interactions with the DMN and FPN. Analysis of directionality of information flow between the SN, DMN, and FPN revealed causal outflow hubs in the SN consistent with its role in fast temporal switching of network interactions. Analysis of regional iEEG temporal fluctuations revealed faster temporal dynamics and higher entropy of neural activity within the SN, compared to the DMN and FPN. Critically, these results were replicated across multiple cohorts.

Quantifying frequency-band-specific neural oscillatory patterns during the use of such cognitive functions can provide insight into exercise-induced benefits in the brain. Specifically, we investigated whether a 4-month physical exercise training influenced theta and alpha power measured in visual WM and attention tasks. The delayed match-to-sample (DMS) task required mnemonic discrimination of similar visual stimuli, akin to pattern separation, while the visual-attention search (VAS) task required detecting the presence of a specific object (i.e., target) in an image. Behavioral and electroencephalographic data were acquired during a DMS visual WM task and VAS task both before and after the intervention. Forty-three sedentary young adults (19-34 years) were pseudorandomly assigned to a training group (indoor treadmill, n = 20) or to a control group (n = 23). Compared to the preintervention baseline, the exercise group showed increased frontal alpha power (9-12 Hz) during the VAS task after the intervention. In addition, alpha power changes correlated positively with fitness changes. Behaviorally, there were no exercise-related effects on reaction times or accuracy in either task. Our findings substantiate that aerobic training of sedentary young adults may influence neural dynamics underlying visual attention rather than visual WM and mnemonic discrimination.

In recent years, time-frequency analysis method and convolutional neural network (CNN) have been combined to extract more complex features and exhibit superiors performance in comparison with conventional methods. In this paper, we presented a new classification method based on Stockwell Transform of common spatial pattern and CNN. The proposed framework with two different activation functions (ReLU and ELU) was compared with CSP-SVM and CSP-CNN methods by validation on BCI competition IV dataset I calibration data to assess the performance of the proposed method. We achieved an average classification accuracy of 81.22% (ReLU) and 81.34% (ELU), which outperformed the conventional CSP-SVM (76.45%) and CSP-CNN methods (69.29%). Further interrogation showed that the higher accuracy was attributed to improved performance in the subjects with lower detection rate by CSP-SVM. In sum, our results showed that the proposed framework can be applied to MI-BCI systems with superior performance, leading new insights towards more practical MI-based BCI applications.

More concretely, we investigated event-related desynchronization/synchronization patterns during sports MI (playing tennis) compared with simple MI (squeezing a ball) and discovered high variability across participants. Thirty healthy volunteers were divided in two groups; the experimental group (EG) performed a physical exercise between two imagery sessions, and the control group (CG) watched a landscape movie without physical activity. We computed inter-individual differences by assessing the dissimilarities among subjects for each group, condition, time period, and frequency band. In the alpha band, we observe some clustering in the ranking of the subjects, therefore showing smaller distances than others. Moreover, in our statistical evaluation, we observed a consistency in ranking across time periods both for the EG and for the CG. For the latter, we also observed similar rankings across conditions. On the contrary, in the beta band, the ranking of the subjects was more similar for the EG across conditions and time periods than for the subjects of the CG. With this study, we would like to draw attention to variability measures instead of primarily focusing on the identification of common patterns across participants, which often do not reflect the whole neurophysiological reality.

The involvement of abnormal functional brain networks in the development of epilepsy and its comorbidities has been demonstrated by electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies in patients with epilepsy. This longitudinal study investigated changes in dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) and network topology during the development of epilepsy using the intraperitoneal kainic acid (IPKA) rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Resting state functional magnetic resonance images (rsfMRI) of 20 IPKA animals and 7 healthy control animals were acquired before and 1, 3, 6, 10 and 16 weeks after status epilepticus (SE) under medetomidine anaesthesia using a 7 T MRI system. Starting from 17 weeks post-SE, hippocampal EEG was recorded to determine the mean daily seizure frequency of each animal. Dynamic FC was assessed by calculating the correlation matrices between fMRI time series of predefined regions of interest within a sliding window of 50 s using a step length of 2 s. The matrices were classified into 6 FC states, each characterized by a correlation matrix, using k-means clustering. In addition, several time-variable graph theoretical network metrics were calculated from the time-varying correlation matrices and classified into 6 states of functional network topology, each characterized by a combination of network metrics. Our results showed that FC states with a lower mean functional connectivity, lower segregation and integration occurred more often in IPKA animals compared to control animals. Functional connectivity also became less variable during epileptogenesis. In addition, average daily seizure frequency was positively correlated with percentage dwell time (i.e. how often a state occurs) in states with high mean functional connectivity, high segregation and integration, and with the number of transitions between states, while negatively correlated with percentage dwell time in states with a low mean functional connectivity, low segregation and low integration. This indicates that animals that dwell in states of higher functional connectivity, higher segregation and higher integration, and that switch more often between states, have more seizures.

In existing CCA methods, training data are used for constructing templates of stimulus targets and the spatial filters are created between the template signals and a single-trial testing signal. The fact that spatial filters rely on testing data, however, results in low classification performance of CCA compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms such as task-related component analysis (TRCA). In this study, we proposed a novel CCA method in which spatial filters are estimated using training data only. This is achieved by using observed EEG training data and their SSVEP components as the two inputs of CCA and the objective function is optimized by averaging multiple training trials. In this case, we proved in theory that the two spatial filters estimated by the CCA are equivalent, and that the CCA and TRCA are also equivalent under certain hypotheses. A benchmark SSVEP data set from 35 subjects was used to compare the performance of the two algorithms according to different lengths of data, numbers of channels and numbers of training trials. In addition, the CCA was also compared with power spectral density analysis (PSDA). The experimental results suggest that the CCA is equivalent to TRCA if the signal-to-noise ratio of training data is high enough; otherwise, the CCA outperforms TRCA in terms of classification accuracy. The CCA is much faster than PSDA in detecting time of targets. The robustness of the training data-driven CCA to noise gives it greater potential in practical applications.

Accuracy and Workflow Improvements for Responsive Neurostimulation Hippocampal Depth Electrode Placement Using Robotic Stereotaxy	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						hippocampal depth electrode; robotic stereotaxy; responsive neurostimulation (RNS); RNS workflow; robotic stereotaxy accuracy; NeuroPace	EPILEPSY	Background: Robotic stereotaxy is increasingly common in epilepsy surgery for the implantation of stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes for intracranial seizure monitoring. The use of robots is also gaining popularity for permanent stereotactic lead implantation applications such as in deep brain stimulation and responsive neurostimulation (RNS) procedures. Objective: We describe the evolution of our robotic stereotactic implantation technique for placement of occipital-approach hippocampal RNS depth leads. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 10 consecutive patients who underwent robotic RNS hippocampal depth electrode implantation. Accuracy of depth lead implantation was measured by registering intraoperative post-implantation fluoroscopic CT images and post-operative CT scans with the stereotactic plan to measure implantation accuracy. Seizure data were also collected from the RNS devices and analyzed to obtain initial seizure control outcome estimates. Results: Ten patients underwent occipital-approach hippocampal RNS depth electrode placement for medically refractory epilepsy. A total of 18 depth electrodes were included in the analysis. Six patients (10 electrodes) were implanted in the supine position, with mean target radial error of 1.9 +/- 0.9 mm (mean +/- SD). Four patients (8 electrodes) were implanted in the prone position, with mean radial error of 0.8 +/- 0.3 mm. The radial error was significantly smaller when electrodes were implanted in the prone position compared to the supine position (p = 0.002). Early results (median follow-up time 7.4 months) demonstrate mean seizure frequency reduction of 26% (n = 8), with 37.5% achieving >= 50% reduction in seizure frequency as measured by RNS long episode counts. Conclusion: Prone positioning for robotic implantation of occipital-approach hippocampal RNS depth electrodes led to lower radial target error compared to supine positioning. The robotic platform offers a number of workflow advantages over traditional frame-based approaches, including parallel rather than serial operation in a bilateral case, decreased concern regarding human error in setting frame coordinates, and surgeon comfort.

We previously identified that long-lasting periods of severe postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia, not seizures per se, are associated with memory impairment after temporal lobe seizures. While this observation suggests a key pathophysiological role for insufficient energy delivery, it is unclear how the networks that underlie episodic memory respond to vascular constraints that ultimately give rise to amnesia. Here, we focused on cellular/network level analyses in the CA1 of hippocampus in vivo to determine if neural activity, network oscillations, synaptic transmission, and/or synaptic plasticity are impaired following kindled seizures. Importantly, the induction of severe postictal hypoperfusion/hypoxia was prevented in animals treated by a COX-2 inhibitor, which experimentally separated seizures from their vascular consequences. We observed complete activation of CA1 pyramidal neurons during brief seizures, followed by a short period of reduced activity and flattening of the local field potential that resolved within minutes. During the postictal state, constituting tens of minutes to hours, we observed no changes in neural activity, network oscillations, and synaptic transmission. However, long-term potentiation of the temporoammonic pathway to CA1 was impaired in the postictal period, but only when severe local hypoxia occurred. Lastly, we tested the ability of rats to perform object-context discrimination, which has been proposed to require temporoammonic input to differentiate between sensory experience and the stored representation of the expected object-context pairing. Deficits in this task following seizures were reversed by COX-2 inhibition, which prevented severe postictal hypoxia. These results support a key role for hypoperfusion/hypoxia in postictal memory impairments and identify that many aspects of hippocampal network function are resilient during severe hypoxia except for long-term synaptic plasticity.

These disparate drug effects may be elicited through the modulation of neural circuit activity. The purpose of this study was to therefore delineate dose- and time-dependent changes in ketamine-induced neural oscillatory patterns in regions of the brain implicated in depression. Wistar-Kyoto rats were used as a model system to study these aspects of TRD neuropathology whereas Wistar rats were used as a control strain. Animals received a low (10 mg/kg) or high (30 mg/kg) dose of ketamine and temporal changes in neural oscillatory activity recorded from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), cingulate cortex (Cg), and nucleus accumbens (NAc) for ninety minutes. Effects of each dose of ketamine on immobility in the forced swim test were also evaluated. High dose ketamine induced a transient increase in theta power in the PFC and Cg, as well as a dose-dependent increase in gamma power in these regions 10-min, but not 90-min, post-administration. In contrast, only low dose ketamine normalized innate deficits in fast gamma coherence between the NAc-Cg and PFC-Cg, an effect that persisted at 90-min post-injection. These low dose ketamine-induced oscillatory alterations were accompanied by a reduction in immobility time in the forced swim test. These results show that ketamine induces time-dependent effects on neural oscillations at specific frequencies. These drug-induced changes may differentially contribute to the psychomimetic and therapeutic effects of the drug. (C) 2020 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Previous studies using electrophysiology and functional MRI techniques have reported that tasks requiring visual object recognition elicited cortical activation sequentially in the aforementioned posterior visual regions and FEFs. The present study aims to provide unique evidence of direct effective connectivity outgoing from the posterior visual regions by measuring the early component (10-50 ms) of cortico-cortical spectral responses (CCSRs) elicited by weak single-pulse direct cortical electrical stimulation. We studied 22 patients who underwent extraoperative intracranial EEG recording for clinical localization of seizure foci and functionally-important brain regions. We used animations to visualize the spatiotemporal dynamics of gamma band CCSRs elicited by stimulation of three different posterior visual regions. We quantified the strength of CCSR-defined effective connectivity between the lower- and higher-order posterior visual regions as well as from the posterior visual regions to the FEFs. We found that effective connectivity within the posterior visual regions was larger in the feedforward (i.e., lower-to higher-order) direction compared to the opposite direction. Specifically, connectivity from the medial-occipital region was largest to the lateral-occipital region, whereas that from the lateral-occipital region was largest to the fusiform region. Among the posterior visual regions, connectivity to the FEF was largest from the lateral-occipital region and the mean peak latency of CCSR propagation from the lateral-occipital region to FEF was 26 ms. Our invasive study of the human brain using a stimulation-based intervention supports the model that the posterior visual regions have direct cortico-cortical connectivity pathways in which neural activity is transferred preferentially from the lower-to higher-order areas. The human brain has direct cortico-cortical connectivity allowing a rapid transfer of neural activity from the lateral-occipital region to the FEF.

Serial models of sentence reading state that this generally should not be the case, whereas parallel models predict that this should be the case. Here we focus on perhaps the simplest and the strongest Parafoveal-on-Foveal (PoF) manipulation: word n + 1 is either the same as word n or a different word. Participants read sentences for comprehension and when their eyes left word n, the repeated or unrelated word at position n + 1 was swapped for a word that provided a syntactically correct continuation of the sentence. We recorded electroencephalogram and eye-movements, and time-locked the analysis of fixation-related potentials (FRPs) to fixation of word n. We found robust PoF repetition effects on gaze durations on word n, and also on the initial landing position on word n. Most important is that we also observed significant effects in FRPs, reaching significance at 260 ms post-fixation of word n. Repetition of the target word n at position n + 1 caused a widely distributed reduced negativity in the FRPs. Given the timing of this effect, we argue that it is driven by orthographic processing of word n + 1, while readers were still looking at word n, plus the spatial integration of orthographic information extracted from these two words in parallel.

Cross-network coupling of neural oscillations in the dynamic pain connectome reflects chronic neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Chronic pain; Dynamic functional coupling; Functional connectivity; Magnetoencephalography; Oscillations	RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; DEFAULT-MODE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CLINICAL-TRIALS; BRAIN; EEG; FREQUENCY; QUESTIONNAIRE; COHERENCE; SAMPLE	Sensory perceptions are coded by complex neural dynamics of regional communication in the brain. Thus, sensory abnormalities such as chronic pain may occur when neural dynamics go awry. Previous studies of cross-network dynamic functional connectivity in chronic pain identified abnormalities but were based on functional MRI which only captures slow temporal features. Here we conducted a magnetoencephalography (MEG) study to investigate fine temporal dynamics of aberrant cross-regional and cross-network communication of the dynamic pain connectome in patients with chronic pain. We also introduced a novel measure, dynamic functional coupling, to quantify the variability of brain communication. The study was performed in 33 people who had chronic pain associated with multiple sclerosis and 30 healthy controls. We found that patients with chronic pain exhibited abnormalities in cross-network functional coupling across multiple frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta, gamma), between the salience network and 3 other networks: the ascending nociceptive pathway, descending anti-nociceptive pathway, and the default mode network. However, these cross-network abnormalities involved different frequency bands in patients with neuropathic versus non-neuropathic chronic pain. Furthermore, cross-network abnormalities were linked to pain severity and pain interference. Our findings implicate broadband cross-network abnormalities as hallmark features of chronic pain in multiple sclerosis.

This paper presents a machine learning approach using information theoretic features extracted from high-frequency subbands to detect the epileptic focus from interictal intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG). It is known that high-frequency subbands (>80Hz) include important biomarkers such as high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) for identifying epileptic focus commonly referred to as the seizure onset zone (SOZ). In this analysis, the multi-channel interictal iEEG signals were splitted into segments and each segment was decomposed into multiple high-frequency subbands. The different types of entropy were calculated for each of the subbands and the sparse linear discriminant analysis (sLDA) was applied to select the prominent entropy features. Due to the imbalance of SOZ and non-SOZ channels in iEEG data, the use of machine learning techniques is always tricky. To deal with the imbalanced learning problem, an adaptive synthetic oversampling approach (ADASYN) with radial basis function kernel-based SVM was used to detect the focal segments. Finally, the epileptic focus was identified based on detection of focal segments on SOZ and non-SOZ channels. Eight patients were examined to observe the efficiency of the automatic detector. The experimental results and statistical tests indicate that the proposed automatic detector can identify the epileptic focus accurately and efficiently.

For the motor cortex (MC) at rest, the oscillatory cycle has been shown to determine the brain's responsiveness to external stimuli. For the active MC, however, the demonstration of such a phase-specific modulation of corticospinal excitability (CSE) along the rhythm cycle is still missing. Motor evoked potentials in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the MC were used to probe the effect of cortical oscillations on CSE during several motor conditions. A brain-machine interface (BMI) with a robotic hand orthosis allowed investigating effects of cortical activity on CSE without the confounding effects of voluntary muscle activation. Only this BMI approach (and not active or passive hand opening alone) revealed a frequency- and phase-specific cortical modulation of CSE by sensorimotor beta-band activity that peaked once per oscillatory cycle and was independent of muscle activity. The active MC follows an intrinsic response modulation in accordance with the communication through coherence hypothesis. Furthermore, the BMI approach may facilitate and strengthen effective corticospinal communication in a therapeutic context, for example, when voluntary hand opening is no longer possible after stroke.

In healthy subjects, sleep spindles activity has been positively correlated to sleep stability. We aimed to compare spindles density during N3 sleep between sleepwalkers and healthy controls. Methods. - Two cohorts of 10 and 21 adult sleepwalkers respectively controlled with 10 and 18 healthy volunteers underwent one baseline and one recovery sleep recording after 38 h (cohort 1) and 25 h (cohort 2) of sleep deprivation. For the two recordings, we performed an automatic detection of spindles (11-16 Hz) from EEG signal during N3 sleep, restricted to the first sleep cycle and repeated for all cycles. For better interpretation of results, we extended the analysis to N2 sleep and we also measured the density of slow waves oscillation (SWO) (0.5-4 Hz) during the same periods. Results. - Compared to controls, sleepwalkers showed significantly lower spindle densities during N3 sleep considering the first sleep cycle (both cohorts) or all cycles (cohort 1). SWO densities did not differ (cohort 1) or were lower (cohort 2) for sleepwalkers. The effect of sleep deprivation did not interact with the effect of group on spindles and SWO densities.

As the fundamental neural response inherits the spectral properties of the gazed flickering, the paradigm has been used to chart cortical characteristics and their relation to pathologies. However, despite its widespread adoption, the underlying neural mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we show that the fundamental response is preceded by high-gamma (55-125 Hz) oscillations which are also synchronised to the gazed frequency. Using a subdural recording of the primary and associative visual cortices of one human subject, we demonstrate that the latencies of the high-gamma and fundamental components are highly correlated on a single-trial basis albeit that the latter is consistently delayed by approximately 55 ms. These results corroborate previous reports that top-down feedback projections are involved in the generation of the fundamental response, but, in addition, we show that trial-to-trial variability in fundamental latency is paralleled by a highly similar variability in high-gamma latency. Pathology- or paradigm-induced alterations in steady-state responses could thus originate either from deviating visual gamma responses or from aberrations in the neural feedback mechanism. Experiments designed to tease apart the two processes are expected to provide deeper insights into the studied paradigm.

Previous studies show competition between neural networks related to executive function/working memory vs. probabilistic learning. Theta synchronization has been associated with the former while desynchronization with the latter in correlational studies. In the present paper our aim was to test causal relationship between fronto-parietal midline theta synchronization and probabilistic learning with non-invasive transcranial alternating current (tACS) stimulation. We hypothesize that theta synchronization disrupts probabilistic learning performance by modulating the competitive relationship. Twenty-six young adults performed the Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task to assess probabilistic learning in two sessions that took place one week apart. Stimulation was applied in a double-blind cross-over within-subject design with an active theta tACS and a sham stimulation in a counter-balanced order between participants. Sinusoidal current was administered with 1 mA peak-to-peak intensity throughout the task (approximately 20 min) for the active stimulation and 30 s for the sham. We did not find an effect of fronto-parietal midline theta tACS on probabilistic learning comparing performance during active and sham stimulation. To influence probabilistic learning, we suggest applying higher current intensity and stimulation parameters more precisely aligned to endogenous brain activity for future studies.

Auditory Cortex Volume and Gamma Oscillation Abnormalities in Schizophrenia	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalogram (EEG); schizophrenia; MRI; gamma oscillation; auditory cortex	STEADY-STATE RESPONSE; PLANUM TEMPORALE; HESCHL GYRUS; PARVALBUMIN INTERNEURONS; RECEPTOR HYPOFUNCTION; SPIKING; REDUCTION; NEURONS	We investigated whether the gray matter volume of primary auditory cortex (Heschl's gyrus [HG]) was associated with abnormal patterns of auditory gamma activity in schizophrenia, namely impaired gamma synchronization in the 40-Hz auditory steady-state response (ASSR) and increased spontaneous broadband gamma power. (The gamma data were previously reported in Hirano et al, JAMA Psychiatry, 2015;72:813-821). Participants were 24 healthy controls (HC) and 23 individuals with chronic schizophrenia (SZ). The ASSR was obtained from the electroencephalogram to click train stimulation at 20, 30, and 40 Hz rates. Dipole source localization of the ASSR was used to provide a spatial filter of auditory cortex activity, from which ASSR evoked power and phase locking factor (PLF), and induced gamma power were computed. HG gray matter volume was derived from structural magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T with manually traced regions of interest. As expected, HG gray matter volume was reduced in SZ compared with HC. In SZ, left hemisphere ASSR PLF and induced gamma power during the 40-Hz stimulation condition were positively and negatively correlated with left HG gray matter volume, respectively. These results provide evidence that cortical gray matter structure, possibly resulting from reduced synaptic connectivity at the microcircuit level, is related to impaired gamma synchronization and increased spontaneous gamma activity in schizophrenia.

Amplitude of high frequency oscillations as a biomarker of the seizure onset zone	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Automated detection algorithm; Epilepsy; Machine learning; Ripple; Localization	AUTOMATIC DETECTION; EPILEPSY SURGERY; FAST RIPPLES; SCALP EEG; 80-500 HZ; RESECTION; MACROELECTRODES; TIME	Objective: Studies of high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in epilepsy have primarily tested the HFO rate as a biomarker of the seizure onset zone (SOZ), but the rate varies over time and is not robust for all individual subjects. As an alternative, we tested the performance of HFO amplitude as a potential SOZ biomarker using two automated detection algorithms. Method: HFOs were detected in intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) from 11 patients using a machine learning algorithm and a standard amplitude-based algorithm. For each detector, SOZ and non-SOZ channels were classified using the rate and amplitude of high frequency events, and performance was compared using receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: The amplitude of detected events was significantly higher in SOZ. Across subjects, amplitude more accurately classified SOZ/non-SOZ than rate (higher values of area under the ROC curve and sensitivity, and lower false positive rates). Moreover, amplitude was more consistent across segments of data, indicated by lower coefficient of variation. Conclusion: As an SOZ biomarker, HFO amplitude offers advantages over HFO rate: it exhibits higher classification accuracy, more consistency over time, and robustness to parameter changes. Significance: This biomarker has the potential to increase the generalizability of HFOs and facilitate clinical implementation as a tool for SOZ localization.

J	Ara, A; Marco-Pallares, J				Ara, Alberto; Marco-Pallares, Josep			Fronto-temporal theta phase-synchronization underlies music-evoked pleasantness	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Music-reward; Fronto-temporal connectivity; Phase synchronization; Theta oscillations	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; AUDITORY-CORTEX; EMOTIONS; BRAIN; REWARD; PERCEPTION; IMAGERY; CONNECTIVITY; ASYMMETRY; RESPONSES	Listening to pleasant music engages a complex distributed network including pivotal areas for auditory, reward, emotional and memory processing. On the other hand, frontal theta rhythms appear to be relevant in the process of giving value to music. However, it is not clear to which extent this oscillatory mechanism underlies the brain interactions that characterize music-evoked pleasantness and its related processes. The goal of the present experiment was to study brain synchronization in this oscillatory band as a function of music-evoked pleasantness. EEG was recorded from 25 healthy subjects while they were listening to music and rating the experienced degree of induced pleasantness. By using a multilevel Bayesian approach we found that phase synchronization in the theta band between right temporal and frontal signals increased with the degree of pleasure experienced by participants. These results show that slow fronto-temporal loops play a key role in music-evoked pleasantness.

Those sources were obtained by maximizing coherence between multivariate signals recorded from brain and a single channel from the muscles. To find linear phase synchrony we used unrectified electromyographic recordings, whereas to de-mix nonlinear sources, we used rectified muscular measurements. In order to obtain the brain sources, we employed a recently published method called "cacoh" that is able to maximize coherence over the complete frequency range of interest and simultaneously find patterns of sources for each them. Our results show that cortico-muscular interactions even at the same frequency range can have spatially distinct neuronal sources depending on whether interactions had linear or non-linear character.

Approaches to noninvasively impose these fields on the brain have high therapeutic potential in neurology and psychiatry. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (TACS) is hypothesized to affect spike timing and cause neural entrainment. However, the conditions under which these effects occur in vivo are unknown. Here, we recorded single-unit activity in the neocortex in awake nonhuman primates during TACS and found dose-dependent neural entrainment to the stimulation waveform. Cluster analysis of changes in interspike intervals identified two main types of neural responses to TACS-increased burstiness and phase entrainment. Our results uncover key mechanisms of TACS and show that the stimulation affects spike timing in the awake primate brain at intensities feasible in humans. Thus, novel TACS protocols tailored to ongoing brain activity may be a tool to normalize spike timing in maladaptive brain networks and neurological disease.

Now imagine the engine fueled the human mind. This is the challenge faced by cognitive neuroscientists worldwide aiming to understand the neural bases of our psychological functions. Luckily, human ingenuity comes to the rescue. Around the same time as the Society for Neuroscience was being established in the 1960s, the first tools for measuring the human brain at work were becoming available. Noninvasive human brain imaging and neurophysiology have continued developing at a relentless pace ever since. In this 50 year anniversary, we reflect on how these methods have been changing our understanding of how brain supports mind.

Participants first listened to two-part auditory sequences (Listen condition). Each part featured a single pitch presented at a fixed rate; the integer ratio formed between the two rates varied in rhythmic complexity from low (1:1) to moderate (1:2) to high (3:2). One of the two parts occurred at a constant rate across conditions. Then, participants heard the same rhythms as they synchronized their tapping at a fixed rate (Synchronize condition). Finally, they tapped at the same fixed rate (Motor condition). Auditory feedback from their taps was present in all conditions. Behavioral effects of rhythmic complexity were evidenced in all tasks; detection of missing beats (Listen) worsened in the most complex (3:2) rhythm condition, and tap durations (Synchronize) were most variable and least synchronous with stimulus onsets in the 3:2 condition. EEG power spectral density was lowest at the fixed rate during the 3:2 rhythm and greatest during the 1:1 rhythm (Listen and Synchronize). ERP amplitudes corresponding to an N1 time window were smallest for the 3:2 rhythm and greatest for the 1:1 rhythm (Listen). Finally, synchronization accuracy (Synchronize) decreased as amplitudes in the N1 time window became more positive during the high rhythmic complexity condition (3:2). Thus, measures of neural entrainment corresponded to synchronization accuracy, and rhythmic complexity modulated the behavioral and neural measures similarly.

Recently, it has been reported that the occurrence of anesthetic-induced loss of consciousness decreases the interconnection between brain regions, resulting in brain network changes. However, few studies have investigated these changes in conscious sedation using nitrous oxide. Therefore, the present study aimed to use graph theory to analyze changes in brain networks during nitrous oxide sedation. Participants were 20 healthy volunteers (10 men and 10 women, 20-40 years old) with no history of systemic disease. We acquired electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of 32 channels during baseline, nitrous oxide inhalation sedation, and recovery. EEG epochs from the baseline and the sedation state (50% nitrous oxide) were extracted and analyzed with the network connection parameters of graph theory. Analysis of 1/f dynamics, revealed a steeper slope while in the sedation state than during the baseline. Network connectivity parameters showed significant differences between the baseline and sedation state, in delta, alpha1, alpha2, and beta2 frequency bands. The most pronounced differences in functional distance during nitrous oxide sedation were observed in the alpha1 and alpha2 frequency bands. Change in 1/f dynamics indicates that changes in brain network systems occur during nitrous oxide administration. Changes in network parameters imply that nitrous oxide interferes with the efficiency of information integration in the frequency bands important for cognitive processes and attention tasks. Alteration of brain network during nitrous oxide administration may be associated to the sedative mechanism of nitrous oxide.

However, many phenomena induced by general anesthetics including paradoxical excitation are still poorly understood. Voltage-gated sodium channels (Na-V) were believed to be one of the proteins targeted during general anesthesia. Based on electrophysiological measurements before and after propofol treatments of different concentrations, we mathematically modified the Hodgkin-Huxley sodium channel formulations and constructed a thalamocortical model to investigate the potential roles of Na-V. The ion channels of individual neurons were modeled using the Hodgkin-Huxley type equations. The enhancement of propofol-induced GABAa current was simulated by increasing the maximal conductance and the time-constant of decay. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was evaluated as the post-synaptic potential from pyramidal (PY) cells. We found that a left shift in activation of Na-V was induced primarily by a low concentration of propofol (0.3-10 mu M), while a left shift in inactivation of Na-V was induced by an increasing concentration (0.3-30 mu M). Mathematical simulation indicated that a left shift of Na-V activation produced a Hopf bifurcation, leading to cell oscillations. Left shift of Na-V activation around a value of 5.5 mV in the thalamocortical models suppressed normal bursting of thalamocortical (TC) cells by triggering its chaotic oscillations. This led to irregular spiking of PY cells and an increased frequency in EEG readings. This observation suggests a mechanism leading to paradoxical excitation during general anesthesia. While a left shift in inactivation led to light hyperpolarization in individual cells, it inhibited the activity of the thalamocortical model after a certain depth of anesthesia. This finding implies that high doses of propofol inhibit the network partly by accelerating Na-V toward inactivation. Additionally, this result explains why the application of sodium channel blockers decreases the requirement for general anesthetics. Our study provides an insight into the roles that Na-V plays in the mechanism of general anesthesia. Since the activation and inactivation of Na-V are structurally independent, it should be possible to avoid side effects by state-dependent binding to the Na-V to achieve precision medicine in the future.

Sex differences in brain oscillatory activity during sleep and wakefulness in obstructive sleep apnea	JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						apnea; electroencephalographic activity; humans; power spectrum; sex differences; sleep	GENDER-DIFFERENCES; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; REM-SLEEP; EEG; POWER; SPINDLES; DENSITY; SLOW; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; COMPONENT	Epidemiological studies consistently show a male predominance in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Hormonal differences, breathing control, upper airway anatomy and fat distribution have been proposed as causes of gender differences in OSA. Clinical manifestations are accentuated in men, although white matter structural integrity is affected in women. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have explored gender differences in the electrical brain activity features of OSA. Polysomnography was performed on 43 patients with untreated OSA (21 women, 22 men), and power spectral density (1-50 Hz) was compared between groups across sleep and wakefulness at two levels of OSA severity. Severe versus moderate OSA showed decreased power for fast frequencies (25-29 Hz) during wakefulness. OSA men displayed decreased power of a large frequency range (sigma, beta and gamma) during sleep compared with women. Comparisons of men with severe versus moderate OSA presented significantly decreased sigma power during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, but significantly increased delta activity during REM sleep. Meanwhile, women with severe versus moderate OSA showed no significant power differences in any condition. These findings indicated a different evolution of brain oscillations between OSA men and women with significant impairment of brain activity related to cognitive processes. Our study emphasizes the importance of understanding the differential effects of sleep disorders on men and women in order to develop more precise diagnostic criteria according to gender, including quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis tools.

A total of 59 MCI subjects were recruited and divided-after appropriate follow-up-into cMCI or sMCI. They were further divided in MCI with linguistic domain (LD) impairment and in MCI with executive domain (ED) impairment. Small World (SW) index was measured as index of balance between integration and segregation brain processes. SW, computed restricting to nodes of DMN regions for all frequency bands, evaluated how they differ between MCI subgroups assessed through clinical and neuropsychological four-years follow-up. In addition, SW evaluated how this pattern differs between MCI with LD and MCI with ED. Results showed that SW index significantly decreased in gamma band in cMCI compared to sMCI. In cMCI with LD impairment, the SW index significantly decreased in delta band, while in cMCI with ED impairment the SW index decreased in delta and gamma bands and increased in alpha1 band. We propose that the DMN functional alterations in cognitive impairment could reflect an abnormal flow of brain information processing during resting state possibly associated to a status of pre-dementia.

In recent years, because brain signals have complex nonlinear dynamics, there has been growing interest in studying complex changes in the time series of brain signals in patients with AD. We reviewed studies of complexity analyses of single-channel time series from electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetoencephalogram (MEG), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in AD and determined future research directions. A systematic literature search for 2000-2019 was performed in the Web of Science and PubMed databases, resulting in 126 identified studies. Compared to healthy individuals, the signals from AD patients have less complexity and more predictable oscillations, which are found mainly in the left parietal, occipital, right frontal, and temporal regions. This complexity is considered a potential biomarker for accurately responding to the functional lesion in AD. The current review helps to reveal the patterns of dysfunction in the brains of patients with AD and to investigate whether signal complexity can be used as a biomarker to accurately respond to the functional lesion in AD. We proposed further studies in the signal complexities of AD patients, including investigating the reliability of complexity algorithms and the spatial patterns of signal complexity. In conclusion, the current review helps to better understand the complexity of abnormalities in the AD brain and provide useful information for AD diagnosis.

Decreased Alertness Reconfigures Cognitive Control Networks	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alertness; conflict adaptation; conflict effect; information sharing; reconfiguration; theta oscillations	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; SLEEP-DEPRIVATION; CONFLICT AWARENESS; NEURAL SIGNATURES; FRONTAL-CORTEX; REACTION-TIME; EEG DYNAMICS; THETA; MECHANISMS; STROOP	Humans' remarkable capacity to flexibly adapt their behavior based on rapid situational changes is termed cognitive control. Intuitively, cognitive control is thought to be affected by the state of alertness; for example, when drowsy, we feel less capable of adequately implementing effortful cognitive tasks. Although scientific investigations have focused on the effects of sleep deprivation and circadian time, little is known about how natural daily fluctuations in alertness in the regular awake state affect cognitive control. Here we combined a conflict task in the auditory domain with EEG neurodynamics to test how neural and behavioral markers of conflict processing are affected by fluctuations in alertness. Using a novel computational method, we segregated alert and drowsy trials from two testing sessions and observed that, although participants (both sexes) were generally sluggish, the typical conflict effect reflected in slower responses to conflicting information compared with nonconflicting information, as well as the moderating effect of previous conflict (conflict adaptation), were still intact. However, the typical neural markers of cognitive control-local midfrontal theta-band power changes-that participants show during full alertness were no longer noticeable when alertness decreased. Instead, when drowsy, we found an increase in long-range information sharing (connectivity) between brain regions in the same frequency band. These results show the resilience of the human cognitive control system when affected by internal fluctuations of alertness and suggest that there are neural compensatory mechanisms at play in response to physiological pressure during diminished alertness.

Mimicking Short-Term Memory in Shape-Reconstruction Task Using an EEG-Induced Type-2 Fuzzy Deep Brain Learning Network	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TOPICS IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Short-term memory; iconic memory; Hebbian learning; type-2 fuzzy set; shape reconstruction; memory failure and N400	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; LOGIC SYSTEMS; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; CLASSIFICATION; HIPPOCAMPAL; INHIBITION; MECHANISMS; ANATOMY	The paper attempts to model short-term memory (STM) for shape-reconstruction tasks by employing a 4-stage deep brain leaning network (DBLN), where the first two stages are built with Hebbian learning and the last two stages with Type-2 Fuzzy logic. The model is trained stage-wise independently with visual stimulus of the object-geometry as the input of the first stage, EEG acquired from different cortical regions as input and output of respective intermediate stages, and recalled object-geometry as the output of the last stage. Two error feedback loops are employed to train the proposed DBLN. The inner loop adapts the weights of the STM based on a measure of error in model-predicted response with respect to the object-shape recalled by the subject. The outer loop adapts the weights of the iconic (visual) memory based on a measure of error of the model predicted response with respect to the desired object-shape. In the test phase, the DBLN model reproduces the recalled object shape from the given input object geometry. The motivation of the paper is to test the consistency in STM encoding (in terms of similarity in network weights) for repeated visual stimulation with the same geometric object. Experiments undertaken on healthy subjects, yield high similarity in network weights, whereas patients with pre-frontal lobe Amnesia yield significant discrepancy in the trained weights for any two trials with the same training object. This justifies the importance of the proposed DBLN model in automated diagnosis of patients with learning difficulty. The novelty of the paper lies in the overall design of the DBLN model with special emphasis to the last two stages of the network, built with vertical slice based type-2 fuzzy logic, to handle uncertainty in function approximation (with noisy EEG data). The proposed technique outperforms the state-of-the-art functional mapping algorithms with respect to the (pre-defined outer loop) error metric, computational complexity and runtime.

The aim of this study was to gain qualitative feedback on the acceptability and usability of a novel BWE smartphone application, to ensure it meets the needs and wishes of end users. Methods: Fifteen participants with chronic pain used the application at home for 4 weeks. Semi-structured telephone interviews were then carried out. A template analysis approach was used to interpret the findings, with an initial coding template structured around the constructs of a theoretical framework for assessing acceptability of healthcare interventions. Structured data analysis generated a final modified coding structure, capturing themes generated across participants' accounts. Results: The four main themes were 'approach to trying out the app: affective attitude and ethicality', 'perceived effectiveness', 'opportunity costs and burden' and 'intervention coherence and self-efficacy'. All participants were willing to engage with the technology and welcomed it as an alternative approach to medications. Participants appreciated the simplicity of design and the ability to choose between visual or auditory stimulation. All the participants felt confident in using the application. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate preliminary support for the acceptability and usability of the BWE application. This is the first qualitative study of BWE to systematically assess these issues.

However, to date learning a new musical style and subsequent musical creativity have largely been studied in isolation. We introduced a novel experimental paradigm combining behavioural, electrophysiological, and computational methods, to examine the neural correlates of unfamiliar music learning, and to investigate how neural and computational measures can predict human creativity. We investigated music learning by training non-musicians (N = 40) on an artificial music grammar. Participants' knowledge of the grammar was tested before and after three training sessions on separate days by assessing explicit recognition of the notes of the grammar, while additionally recording their EEG. After each training session, participants created their own musical compositions, which were later evaluated by human experts. A computational model of auditory expectation was used to quantify the statistical properties of both the grammar and the compositions. Results showed that participants successfully learned the new grammar. This was also reflected in the N100, P200, and P3a components, which were higher in response to incorrect than correct notes. The delta band (2.5-4.5 Hz) power in response to grammatical notes during first exposure to the grammar positively correlated with learning, suggesting a potential neural mechanism of encoding. On the other hand, better learning was associated with lower alpha and higher beta band power after training, potentially reflecting neural mechanisms of retrieval. Importantly, learning was a significant predictor of creativity, as judged by experts. There was also an inverted U-shaped relationship between percentage of correct intervals and creativity, as compositions with an intermediate proportion of correct intervals were associated with the highest creativity. Finally, the P200 in response to incorrect notes was predictive of creativity, suggesting a link between the neural correlates of learning, and creativity. Overall, our findings shed light on the neural mechanisms of learning an unfamiliar music grammar, and offer novel contributions to the associations between learning measures and creative compositions based on learned materials.

Bayesian inference of a directional brain network model for intracranial EEG data	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Ordinary differential equation; Bayesian methods; Dynamic system; Time series; Brain networks	DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATION MODELS; TIME-VARYING COEFFICIENTS; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; SEIZURE ONSET; EVOKED-RESPONSES; DYNAMIC-MODELS; SYNCHRONIZATION; COMMUNICATION; ODES	The human brain is a network system in which brain regions, as network nodes, constantly interact with each other. The directional effect exerted by one brain component on another is referred to as directional connectivity. Since the brain is also a continuous time dynamic system, it is natural to use ordinary differential equations (ODES) to model directional connections among brain regions. The authors propose a high-dimensional ODE model to explore directional connectivity among many small brain regions recorded by intracranial EEG (iEEG). The new ODE model, motivated by the physical mechanism of the damped harmonic oscillator, is effective for approximating neural oscillation, a rhythmic or repetitive neural activity involved in many important brain functions. To produce scientifically meaningful network results, a cluster structure is assumed for the ODE model parameters that quantify directional connectivity among regions. The cluster structure is in line with the functional specialization of the human brain: the brain areas specialized in the same function tend to be in the same cluster. Two Bayesian methods are developed to estimate the model parameters of the proposed ODE model and to identify clusters of strongly connected brain regions. The proposed ODE model and Bayesian method are applied to iEEG data collected from a patient with medically intractable epilepsy and used to examine the patient's brain networks before the seizure onset.

Predicting or anticipating upcoming words in a text, based on the context in which they are read, is an important aspect of efficient language processing. In sentence reading, words with congruent preceding context have been shown to be processed faster than words read in neutral or incongruous contexts. The onset of contextual facilitation effects is found very early in the first-pass-reading eye-movement and electroencephalogram (EEG) measures of skilled adult readers. However, the effect of contextual facilitation on children's eye movements during reading remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we tracked children's and adults' eye movements while reading stories with embedded words that were either strongly or weakly related to a clear narrative theme. Our central finding is that children showed late contextual facilitation effects during text reading as opposed to both early and late facilitation effects found in skilled adult readers. Contextual constraint had a similar effect on children's and adults' initiation of regressive saccades, whereas children invested more time in rereading relative to adults after encountering weakly contextually constrained words. Quantile regression analyses revealed that contextual facilitation effects had an early onset in adults' first-pass reading, whereas they only had a late onset in children's gaze durations.

J	Shahshahani, SMR; Mahdiani, HR				Shahshahani, Seyed Mohamad Reza; Mahdiani, Hamid Reza			A High-Performance Scalable Shared-Memory SVD Processor Architecture Based on Jacobi Algorithm and Batcher's Sorting Network	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS			English	Article						Jacobian matrices; Computer architecture; Signal processing algorithms; Principal component analysis; Symmetric matrices; Parallel processing; Scalability; ASIC; Batcher's sorting network; brain-computer interface; independent component analysis; Jacobi EVD; SVD; motor imagery; multi-stage interconnection network; scalability; shared-memory architecture	SINGULAR-VALUE DECOMPOSITION; EEG DATA; ICA; IMPACT; ARRAY; VARIABILITY	Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are two crucial transformations in many signal processing applications. The main drawback of these algorithms is their computationally intensive nature which prevents them to be efficiently exploited in high-performance, real-time and mobile applications. By extracting the inherent parallelism of the Jacobi SVD, a new parallel data distribution and access pattern for this algorithm is proposed first. Based on the proposed parallel data distribution, a novel shared-memory architecture is then proposed to support EVD/SVD computation in a high-performance and scalable manner. A new Multistage Interconnection Network based on Batcher's odd-even merge sorting network is developed and exploited in the architecture to preserve its performance and scalability by simultaneously connecting different numbers of processing elements to the system memory hierarchy in a parallel conflict-free manner. The proposed architecture can be configured to compute EVD/SVD of matrices of arbitrary size, with different numbers of processing elements achieving a linear speed-up. The synthesis results in a 90 nm technology show that the system with one, two, and four processing elements achieves a throughput of 1.81, 3.63, and 7.26 million EVD/SVD's per second, respectively with a frequency of 813 MHz for an 8x8 matrix.

Development and sex modulate visuospatial oscillatory dynamics in typically-developing children and adolescents	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Puberty; MEG; Magnetoencephalography; Attention; Brain; Vision; Alpha	VISUAL GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; ATTENTION; MEG; NETWORKS; ALPHA; EEG; FREQUENCY; SPAN; LIFE	Visuospatial processing is a cognitive function that is critical to navigating one's surroundings and begins to develop during infancy. Extensive research has examined visuospatial processing in adults, but far less work has investigated how visuospatial processing and the underlying neurophysiology changes from childhood to early adolescence, which is a critical period of human development that is marked by the onset of puberty. In the current study, we examined behavioral performance and the oscillatory dynamics serving visuospatial processing using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a cohort of 70 children and young adolescents aged 8-15 years. All participants performed a visuospatial processing task during MEG, and the resulting oscillatory responses were imaged using a beamformer and probed for developmental and sex-related differences. Our findings indicated that reaction time on the task was negatively correlated with age, and that the amplitude of theta oscillations in the medial occipital cortices increased with age. Significant sex-by-age interactions were also detected, with female participants exhibiting increased theta oscillatory activity in the right prefrontal cortex with increasing age, while male participants exhibited theta increases in the left parietal lobe/left precuneus and left supplementary motor area with increasing age. These data indicate that different nodes of the visuospatial processing network develop earlier in males compared to females (and vice versa) in this age range, which may have major implications for the developmental trajectory of behavioral performance and executive function more generally during the transition through puberty.

Mode-locking dynamics of corticothalamic system responses to periodic external stimuli	PHYSICA D-NONLINEAR PHENOMENA			English	Article						Corticothalamic system; Periodic stimuli; Mode locking dynmics; Harmonic entrainments; Synchronization tongue; Photosensitive seizures	VISUAL-CORTEX; BRAIN; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; ENTRAINMENT; FLICKER	A physiologically based continuum model of the corticothalamic system is applied to explore mode-locking dynamics of ongoing cortical activity subject to periodic drive. The ongoing cortical activity is poised near a Hopf bifurcation. Time-dependent center manifold reduction shows that the nonlinear dynamics of driven corticothalamic system with delays can be described by an inhomogeneous low-dimensional equation near the critical point of the Hopf bifurcation. This driven normal form captures the main features of experimentally observed nonlinear interactions between brain activity and periodic stimuli. The effects of underlying physiological parameters on the type of Hopf bifurcation and onset dynamics are then studied, which allows the determination of phase-locked structures for various regions in the parameter space of the drive. It is shown that the system can adjust its oscillation regime to the frequency content of stimuli. The key features of entrainment of the alpha rhythm to periodic stimuli, including harmonic and subharmonic generation, are also explored. The theoretical predictions of these nonlinear responses are confirmed by numerical simulations. Further, photosensitive seizures are predicted for physiologically based model parameters arising from mode locking to the frequency of periodic stimulus, and their harmonics due to higher order synchronization states. These results indicate that the approach used here provides a powerful framework for the study of nonlinear interactions between brain activity and flicker by incorporating periodic driving into the corticothalamic system.

The supplementary motor cortex (SMC) plays a central role in its pathophysiology. We aimed at investigating SMC activation, connectivity and plasticity with regard to motor initiation in FOG. Methods: Twelve patients with FOG and eleven without FOG underwent a multimodal electrophysiological evaluation of SMC functioning including the Bereitschaftspotential and movement-related desynchronisation of cortical beta oscillations. SMC plasticity was modulated by intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) and its impact on gait initiation was assessed by a three-dimensional gait analysis. Results: Prior to volitional movements the Bereitschaftspotential was smaller and beta power was less strongly attenuated over the SMC in patients with FOG compared to those without. Pre-motor coherence between the SMC and the primary motor cortex in the beta frequency range was also stronger in patients with FOG. iTBS resulted in a relative deterioration of gait initiation. Conclusions: Reduced activation of the SMC along with increased SMC connectivity in the beta frequency range hinder a flexible shift of the motor set as it is required for gait initiation. Significance: Altered SMC functioning plays an important role for motor initiation failure in PD-related FOG. (C) 2020 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Optogenetic manipulation of an ascending arousal system tunes cortical broadband gamma power and reveals functional deficits relevant to schizophrenia	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							OBJECT RECOGNITION TEST; STEADY-STATE RESPONSE; BASAL FOREBRAIN; PARVALBUMIN NEURONS; EXCITATION/INHIBITION BALANCE; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS BASALIS	Increases in broadband cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) power in the gamma band (30-80 Hz) range have been observed in schizophrenia patients and in mouse models of schizophrenia. They are also seen in humans and animals treated with the psychotomimetic agent ketamine. However, the mechanisms which can result in increased broadband gamma power and the pathophysiological implications for cognition and behavior are poorly understood. Here we report that tonic optogenetic manipulation of an ascending arousal system bidirectionally tunes cortical broadband gamma power, allowing on-demand tests of the effect on cortical processing and behavior. Constant, low wattage optogenetic stimulation of basal forebrain (BF) neurons containing the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) increased broadband gamma frequency power, increased locomotor activity, and impaired novel object recognition. Concomitantly, task-associated gamma band oscillations induced by trains of auditory stimuli, or exposure to novel objects, were impaired, reminiscent of findings in schizophrenia patients. Conversely, tonic optogenetic inhibition of BF-PV neurons partially rescued the elevated broadband gamma power elicited by subanesthetic doses of ketamine. These results support the idea that increased cortical broadband gamma activity leads to impairments in cognition and behavior, and identify BF-PV activity as a modulator of this activity. As such, BF-PV neurons may represent a novel target for pharmacotherapy in disorders such as schizophrenia which involve aberrant increases in cortical broadband gamma activity.

To elucidate these issues, we analyzed simultaneous SEEG recordings in HH and cortex systematically. Methods We retrospectively investigated data from 15 consecutive patients with SEEG electrodes into the HH for the treatment purpose of radiofrequency thermocoagulation treatment. Additional SEEG electrodes were placed into the cortex in 11 patients to assess extra-HH involvement. Interictal discharges within the HH and anatomo-electroclinical correlations during seizures of each patient were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Results Overall, 77 electrodes with 719 contacts were implanted, and 33 spontaneous seizures were recorded during long-term SEEG monitoring. Interictally, distinct electrophysiological patterns, including isolated intermittent spikes/sharp waves, burst spike and wave trains, paroxysmal fast discharges, periodic discharges, and high-frequency oscillations, were identified within the HH. Notably, synchronized or independent interictal discharges in the cortex were observed. Regarding the ictal discharges, the electrical onset pattern within the HH always started with abrupt giant shifts superimposed on low-voltage fast activity across patients. The gelastic seizure network mainly involved the HH, orbitofrontal areas, and cingulate gyrus. Seizures with automatisms and impaired awareness primarily propagated to mesial temporal lobes. Moreover, independent ictal discharges arising from the mesial temporal lobe were detected in three out of nine patients. Interpretation This study comprehensively reveals intrinsic electrophysiological patterns and epileptogenic networks in vivo, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying cortical and subcortical epileptogenesis.

Methods: We studied MEG data from 22 insular epilepsy patients and 20 normal subjects. Alterations in spatial pattern and connection properties of the patients with insular epilepsy were investigated in the entire brain network and insula-based network. Results: Analyses of the parameters of graph theory revealed the over-connectivity and small-world configuration of the global connectivity patterns observed in the patients. In the insula-based network, the insular cortex ipsilateral to the seizure onset displayed increased efferent and afferent EC. Left insular epilepsy featured strong connectivity with the bilateral hemispheres, whereas right insular epilepsy featured increased connectivity with only the ipsilateral hemisphere. Conclusions: Patients with insular epilepsy display alterations in the EC network in terms of both whole-brain connectivity and the insula-based network during interictal HFOs. Significance: Alterations of interictal HFO-based networks provide evidence that epilepsy networks, instead of epileptic foci, play a key role in the complex pathophysiological mechanisms of insular epilepsy. The dysfunction of HFO networks may prove to be a novel promising biomarker and the cause of interictal brain dysfunctions in insular epilepsy.

Much of the information regarding neuronal correlates of visual processing has been derived from functional imaging studies, which have identified a variety of brain areas contributing to visual analysis, recognition, and processing of objects and scenes. However, only two of these areas, namely the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and the lateral occipital complex (LOC), were verified and further characterized by intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG). iEEG is a unique measurement technique that samples a local neuronal population with high temporal and anatomical resolution. In the present study, we aimed to expand on previous reports and examine brain activity for selectivity of scenes and objects in the broadband high-gamma frequency range (50-150 Hz). We collected iEEG data from 27 epileptic patients while they watched a series of images, containing objects and scenes, and we identified 375 bipolar channels responding to at least one of these two categories. Using K-means clustering, we delineated their brain localization. In addition to the two areas described previously, we detected significant responses in two other scene-selective areas, not yet reported by any electrophysiological studies; namely the occipital place area (OPA) and the retrosplenial complex. Moreover, using iEEG we revealed a much broader network underlying visual processing than that described to date, using specialized functional imaging experimental designs. Here, we report the selective brain areas for scene processing include the posterior collateral sulcus and the anterior temporal region, which were already shown to be related to scene novelty and landmark naming. The object-selective responses appeared in the parietal, frontal, and temporal regions connected with tool use and object recognition. The temporal analyses specified the time course of the category selectivity through the dorsal and ventral visual streams. The receiver operating characteristic analyses identified the PPA and the fusiform portion of the LOC as being the most selective for scenes and objects, respectively. Our findings represent a valuable overview of visual processing selectivity for scenes and objects based on iEEG analyses and thus, contribute to a better understanding of visual processing in the human brain.

The current study sought to determine changes in hippocampal oscillatory activity that may underlie the cognitive impairment observed following distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) without causing hippocampal structural damage. Local field potentials were recorded from the dorsal hippocampus and cortex in urethane-anesthetized rats with multichannel silicon probes during dMCAO and reperfusion, or mild ischemia induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (CCAO). Bilateral change of brain state was evidenced by reduced theta/delta amplitude ratio and shortened high theta duration following acute dMCAO but not CCAO. An aberrant increase in the occurrence of sharp-wave-associated ripples (150-250 Hz), crucial for memory consolidation, was only detected after dMCAO reperfusion, coinciding with an increased occurrence of high-frequency discharges (250-450 Hz). dMCAO also significantly affected the modulation of gamma amplitude in the cortex coupled to hippocampal theta phase, although both hippocampal theta and gamma power were temporarily decreased during dMCAO. Our results suggest that MCAO may disrupt the balance between excitatory and inhibitory circuits in the hippocampus and alter the function of cortico-hippocampal network, providing a novel insight in how cortical stroke affects function in remote brain regions.

Further, we also introduce filtering in both the intrinsic and extrinsic variables of the mean-field diffusive coupling to investigate the counter-intuitive effect of both filterings. We find that large values of the mean-field intensity near unity favor the oscillatory nature of the ensemble, whereas low values favor the onset of the aging transition and heterogeneous dynamical states such as cluster oscillation death and chimera death states even at low values of the symmetry breaking coupling strength. Heterogeneous dynamical states predominates at large values of the coupling strength in all available parameter spaces. We also uncover that even a weak intrinsic filtering favors the aging transition and heterogeneous dynamical states, while a feeble extrinsic filtering favors the oscillatory state. Chimera death state is observed among the active oscillators for the first time in the aging literature. Our results can lead to engineering the dynamical states as desired by an appropriate choice of the control parameters. Further, the transition from the oscillatory to the aging state occurs via an inverse Hopf bifurcation, while the transition from the aging state to the cluster oscillation death states emerges through a supercritical pitch-fork bifurcation. The deduced analytical bifurcation curves are in good agreement with the numerical boundaries of the observed dynamical states.

However, its clinical efficacy is fundamentally limited due to the current shunting effect of the scalp and safety issues. A newer electrical stimulation technique called subcutaneous electrical stimulation (SES) promises to overcome the limitations of TES by applying currents directly at the site of the disorder through the skull. While SES seems promising, the electrophysiological effect of SES compared to TES is still unknown, thus limiting its broader application. Here we comprehensively analyze the SES and TES to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of SES. Beagles were bilaterally implanted with subdural strips for intracranial electroencephalography and electric field recording. For the intracerebral electric field prediction, we designed a 3D electromagnetic simulation framework and simulated TES and SES. In the beagle model, SES induces three to four-fold larger cerebral electric fields compared to TES, and significant changes in power ratio of brainwaves were observed only in SES. Our prediction framework suggests that the field penetration of SES would be several-fold larger than TES in human brains. These results demonstrate that the SES would significantly enhance the neuromodulatory effects compared to conventional TES and overcome the TES limitations.

J	Feng, ZQ; He, QH; Wang, L; Qiu, MG				Feng, Zhengquan; He, Qinghua; Wang, Li; Qiu, Mingguo			EEG oscillatory patterns in the different processing phase during motor imagery	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Motor imagery; Brain electricity; Source location analysis; Brain functional connectivity	BRAIN; DISCRIMINATION	Motor imagery refers to the psychological realization of movements without movement or muscle activity; it is a research hotspot in neurophysiology, neuroimaging, neurology, and psychology; and it is used as a neurological rehabilitation of brain-computer interface technology. The foundation is widely studied. The EEG signal has a millisecond time resolution, which can facilitate the acquisition of neural signal changes in the body movement process. This article has selected the finger and thumb index finger movements as the task of motion imaging. Under the guidance of image and video, the characteristics of the brain electrical shock patterns during the finger-to-finger movement, thumb and forefinger pairing and unfolding were studied. The brain electrical signals of 15 healthy subjects were collected during the experiment, and the signals were analyzed for source location and information flow network. The result of source location analysis indicated that the activation of brain regions was mainly in the contra lateral SMA region, PMC region, and M1 region. However, the subjects were right-handed, so the characteristics of contra lateral activation were not obvious in the right-handed motor imaging process. Imagine that the opposite side of the pinching process is more powerful than the imaginary finger and the activation range is wider. The results of dynamic information flow of EEG signals at different stages of motor imaging show obvious contra lateral activation characteristics. The DTF analysis of the left-hand motion imaging finger pair pinching and unfolding shows that the information flow mainly flows from the right side of the brain to the left in the imagination process, while the right-hand motion imaging process is opposite, and the information flow mainly flows from the left side of the brain to the right side. The left hand imagines that the finger-to-pinch process is simpler and the number of connections is smaller than the information flow of the imagined finger deployment process. The right hand imagines that the finger-to-kneading process looks more complex than the imagined finger-expanding process, and the number of connections is more. However, its more connections appear mainly in the occipital region of the visual stimulus, the information flow in the frontal and parietal lobes is simple, and the number of connections is reduced. This article explores the relationship among the different movement phases of hand motion imaging and the change of EEG signals. The results show that the brain oscillation modes are similar and different, and the finger deployment process is used as a follow-up of the finger-to-kneading process. The process of knowing should be relatively simple.

Specifically, most neuronal oscillatory activity is measured in different rhythm based on the electrophysiological signal at single channel level. Although, the neuronal oscillatory coupling between neuronal assembles is associated with the information flow and exchange between brain regions, few studies focus on this type of neuronal oscillatory activity in face processing. In this study, the neuronal oscillatory coupling was investigated based on electroencephalographic (EEG) data of 20 participants, which were recorded when the participants were in a face/non-face perceptual task. The phase lag index (PLI) was used to assess the neuronal oscillatory coupling between brain regions in typical frequency bands. Enhanced short-range coupling was observed in theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) band over the frontal region, in gammal (30-49 Hz) band over the left posterior and occipito-temporal regions, and in gamma2 (51-75 Hz) over the right temporal region during face perception compared with non-face perception. Long-range coupling was increased in theta and gamma band over the right hemisphere during face perception. Moreover, increased long-range coupling was observed in alpha band over the left and right hemisphere respectively during face perception. The results suggested that frequency-specific neuronal oscillatory coupling within and between regions of frontal cortex and the ventral visual pathway played an important role in face perception, which might reflect underlying neural mechanism of face perception.

Striatal Beta Oscillation and Neuronal Activity in the Primate Caudate Nucleus Differentially Represent Valence and Arousal Under Approach-Avoidance Conflict	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						caudate nucleus; beta oscillation; valence; arousal; approach-avoidance conflict; cognitive engagement; decision-making; primate	SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; BAND OSCILLATIONS; DECISION-MAKING; MOTIVATION; MICROSTIMULATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; EMOTION; EEG; DYNAMICS; ORIGIN	An approach-avoidance (Ap-Av) conflict arises when an individual has to decide whether to accept or reject a compound offer that has features indicating both reward and punishment. During value judgments of likes and dislikes, arousal responses simultaneously emerge and influence reaction times and the frequency of behavioral errors. In Ap-Av decision-making, reward and punishment differentially influence valence and arousal, allowing us to dissociate their neural processing. The primate caudate nucleus (CN) has been implicated in affective judgment, but it is still unclear how neural responses in the CN represent decision-related variables underlying choice. To address this issue, we recorded spikes and local field potentials (LFPs) from the CN while macaque monkeys performed an Ap-Av decision-making task. We analyzed 450 neuronal units and 667 beta oscillatory activities recorded during the performance of the task. To examine how these activities represented valence, we focused on beta-band responses and unit activities that encoded the chosen value (ChV) of the compound offer as derived from an econometric model. Unit activities exhibited either positive (65.0% = 26/40) or negative (35.0% = 14/40) correlations with the ChV, whereas beta responses exhibited almost exclusively positive correlations with the ChV (98.4% = 62/63). We examined arousal representation by focusing on beta responses and unit activities that encoded the frequency of omission errors (FOE), which were negatively correlated with arousal. The unit activities were either positively (65.3% = 17/26) or negatively (34.6% = 9/26) correlated with the FOE, whereas the beta responses were almost entirely positively correlated with the FOE (95.8% = 23/24). We found that the temporal onset of the beta-band responses occurred sequentially across conditions: first, the negative-value, then low-arousal, and finally, high-value conditions. These findings suggest the distinctive roles of CN beta oscillations that were sequentially activated for the valence and arousal conditions. By identifying dissociable groups of CN beta-band activity responding in relation to valence and arousal, we demonstrate that the beta responses mainly exhibited selective activation for the high-valence and low-arousal conditions, whereas the unit activities simultaneously recorded in the same experiments responded to chosen value and other features of decision-making under approach-avoidance conflict.

The effects of ammonia stimulation on kainate-induced status epilepticus and anterior piriform cortex electrophysiology	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Piriform cortex; Olfactory stimulation; Ammonia; Kainic acid; Status epilepticus	LOW-FREQUENCY STIMULATION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; SEIZURES; RESPONSES; AMYGDALA; MODEL; ACID; EPILEPSY; TOLUENE	Objective: Strong olfactory stimulation (OS) with such substances as toluene or ammonia has been reported to suppress seizures. We aimed to investigate the role of ammonia stimulation on acute kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures. We also investigated any possible effects of ammonia stimulation on the electrophysiology of the anterior piriform cortex (APC). Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with bilateral hippocampal electrodes and an electrode in the left APC. Animals were exposed to either distilled water (control) or ammonia stimulation for 20 s every 5 min during KA induction of status epilepticus (SE). The electroencephalogram (EEG) was analyzed for seizure frequency, duration, severity, and total KA doses given prior to reaching SE. Seizure-free EEG epochs that coincided with OS were chosen and analyzed via wavelet analysis for any spectral changes. Results: We found no significant differences in seizure frequency, duration, severity, or administered KA doses before SE between the groups. In the experimental group, a wavelet analysis of variance (WANOVA) revealed a significant stimulation-induced increase of power in the delta and alpha bands prior to the first KA injection and higher power in the delta and theta bands after KA injection. Conclusions: Whereas the spectral analysis of the APC revealed specific OS-induced changes, our findings suggest that OS with ammonia does not result in altering the threshold of attaining KA-induced SE. This does not rule out a potential role for OS in reducing recurrent seizures in the KA or other epilepsy models. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

While the behavioral effects of self-talk are clear, research on the mechanisms underpinning the effects of different modes of self-talk is sparse. To address this issue, we propose and test a psychophysiological model of the effects of self-talk on motor performance. Forty golf novices practiced a golf putting task while using either instructional or motivational self-talk preceding each putt. We measured performance (radial error), technique (club kinematics and muscle activity), cardiac activity (heart-rate and event-related heart-rate change), as well as electroencephalographic alpha power and connectivity in a randomized (group: instructional self-talk, motivational self-talk) experimental design. Instructional self-talk promoted superior technique and was associated with greater parietal alpha power and weaker connectivity between frontal and parietal electrodes and all other scalp sites, possibly indicative of increased top-down control of action. These findings provide initial evidence for an information-processing mechanism underlying the benefits of instructional self-talk. They also cast doubt on the validity of left-frontotemporal connectivity as a measure of verbal-analytic processing during motor tasks. Motivational self-talk led to increased heart-rate and reduced event-related heart rate variability, suggesting an effort-based mechanism to explain the benefits of motivational self-talk. Our study represents the most complete multi-measure investigation of self-talk to date. We hope that our psychophysiological model of self-talk will encourage researchers to move beyond the exclusive reliance on behavioral and self-report measures to discover the mechanisms underlying the benefits of self-talk for performance.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a widely used form of noninvasive stimulation and may have therapeutic potential for ASD. So far, despite the widespread use of this technique in the neuroscience field, its effects on network-level neural activity and the underlying mechanisms of any effects are still unclear. In the present study, we used electmencephalography (EEG) to investigate tDCS induced brain network changes in children with ASD before and after active and sham stimulation. We recorded 5 min of resting state EEG before and after a single session of tDCS (of approximately 20 min) over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Two network-based methods were applied to investigate tDCS modulation on brain networks: 1) temporal network dynamics were analyzed by comparing "flexibility" changes before vs after stimulation, and 2) frequency specific network changes were identified using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). We found 1) an increase in network flexibility following tDCS (rapid network configuration of dynamic network communities), 2) specific increase in interhemispheric connectivity within the alpha frequency band following tDCS. Together, these results demonstrate that tDCS could help modify both local and global brain network dynamics, and highlight stimulation-induced differences in the manifestation of network reconfiguration. Meanwhile, frequency-specific subnetworks, as a way to index local and global information processing, highlight the core modulatory effects of tDCS on the modular architecture of the functional connectivity patterns within higher frequency bands.

Identifying seizure risk factors: A comparison of sleep, weather, and temporal features using a Bayesian forecast	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						circadian; forecasting; seizure; sleep; weather	SYNCHRONIZATION CHANGES; LONG-TERM; PREDICTION; EPILEPSY; FREQUENCY; IMPACT; FACILITATION; DURATION; PATIENT	Objective Most seizure forecasting algorithms have relied on features specific to electroencephalographic recordings. Environmental and physiological factors, such as weather and sleep, have long been suspected to affect brain activity and seizure occurrence but have not been fully explored as prior information for seizure forecasts in a patient-specific analysis. The study aimed to quantify whether sleep, weather, and temporal factors (time of day, day of week, and lunar phase) can provide predictive prior probabilities that may be used to improve seizure forecasts. Methods This study performed post hoc analysis on data from eight patients with a total of 12.2 years of continuous intracranial electroencephalographic recordings (average = 1.5 years, range = 1.0-2.1 years), originally collected in a prospective trial. Patients also had sleep scoring and location-specific weather data. Histograms of future seizure likelihood were generated for each feature. The predictive utility of individual features was measured using a Bayesian approach to combine different features into an overall forecast of seizure likelihood. Performance of different feature combinations was compared using the area under the receiver operating curve. Performance evaluation was pseudoprospective. Results For the eight patients studied, seizures could be predicted above chance accuracy using sleep (five patients), weather (two patients), and temporal features (six patients). Forecasts using combined features performed significantly better than chance in six patients. For four of these patients, combined forecasts outperformed any individual feature. Significance Environmental and physiological data, including sleep, weather, and temporal features, provide significant predictive information on upcoming seizures. Although forecasts did not perform as well as algorithms that use invasive intracranial electroencephalography, the results were significantly above chance. Complementary signal features derived from an individual's historic seizure records may provide useful prior information to augment traditional seizure detection or forecasting algorithms. Importantly, many predictive features used in this study can be measured noninvasively.

A role of fronto - parietal network (FPN) connectivity breakdown has been postulated for tic pathogenesis, given that the FPN entertain connections with limbic, paralimbic, and CSTC networks. Our study was aimed at characterizing the FPN functional connectivity in cTD and GTS in order to assess the role of its deterioration in tic severity and the degree of comorbids. We recorded scalp EEG during resting state in patients with cTD and GTS. The eLORETA current source densities were analyzed, and the lagged phase synchronization (LPS) was calculated to estimate nonlinear functional connectivity between cortical areas. We found that the FPN functional connectivity in delta band was more detrimental in more severe GTS patients. Also, the sensorimotor functional connectivity in beta2 band was stronger in more severe cTD and GTS patients. FPN functional connectivity deterioration correlated with comorbids presence and severity in patients with GTS. Our data suggest that a FPN disconnection may contribute to the motoric symptomatology and comorbid severity in GTS, whereas sensorimotor disconnection may contribute to tic severity in cTD and GTS. Although preliminary, our study points out a differently disturbed brain connectivity between patients with cTD and GTS. This may serve as diagnostic marker and potentially interesting base to develop pharmacological and non-invasive neuromodulation trials aimed at reducing tic symptomatology.

J	Radtke, EL; Schone, B; Martens, U; Gruber, T				Radtke, Elise L.; Schoene, Benjamin; Martens, Ulla; Gruber, Thomas			Electrophysiological correlates of gist perception: a steady-state visually evoked potentials study	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Steady-state visually evoked potentials; Intermodulation frequency; Multi-stimulus displays; Gist perception	TOP-DOWN FACILITATION; NEURAL SIGNATURE; RESPONSES; CORTEX; INTEGRATION; ATTENTION; CONTEXT; OBJECTS; MEMORY	Gist perception refers to perceiving the substance or general meaning of a scene. To investigate its neuronal mechanisms, we used the steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) method-an evoked oscillatory cortical response at the same frequency as a visual stimulus flickered at this frequency. Two neighboring stimuli were flickered at different frequencies f(1) and f(2), for example, a drawing of a sun on the left side of the screen flickering at 8.6 Hz and the drawing of a parasol on the right side of the screen flickering at 12 Hz. SSVEPs enabled us to separate the responses to the two distinct stimuli by extracting oscillatory brain responses at f(1) and f(2). Additionally, it allowed to investigate intermodulation frequencies, that is, the brain's response at a linear combination of f(1) and f(2) (here at f(1) + f(2) = 20.6 Hz) as an indicator of processing shared aspects of the input, that is, gist perception (here: a beach scene). We recorded high-density EEG of 18 participants. Results revealed clear and separable neuronal oscillations at f(1) and f(2). Additionally, occipital electrodes showed increased amplitudes at the intermodulation frequency in related as compared to unrelated pairs. The increase in intermodulation frequency was associated with bilateral temporal and parietal lobe activation, probably reflecting the interaction of local object representations as a basis for activating the gist network. The study demonstrates that SSVEPs are an excellent method to unravel mechanisms underlying the processing within multi-stimulus displays in the context of gist perception.

Methods We detected FRs automatically from an overnight recording edited for artifacts and visually from a 5-minute period of slow-wave sleep. We examined primarily the accuracy of removing >= 50% of total FR events or of channels with FRs to predict postsurgical seizure outcome (Engel class I = good, classes II-IV = poor) according to the whole-night and 5-minute analysis approaches. Secondarily, we examined the association of low overall FR rates or absence or incomplete resection of 1 dominant FR area with poor outcome. Results The accuracy of outcome prediction was highest (81%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 67%-92%) with the use of the FR event resection ratio and whole-night recording (vs 72%, 95% CI 56%-85%, for the visual 5-minute approach). Absence of channels with FR rates >6/min (p = 0.001) and absence or incomplete resection of 1 dominant FR area (p < 0.001) were associated with poor outcome. Conclusions FRs are accurate in predicting epilepsy surgery outcome at the individual level when overnight recordings are used. Absence of channels with high FR rates or absence of 1 dominant FR area is a poor prognostic factor that may reflect suboptimal spatial sampling of the epileptogenic zone or multifocality, rather than an inherently low sensitivity of FRs. Classification of evidence This study provides Class II evidence that FRs are accurate in predicting epilepsy surgery outcome.

Clinical, neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and rsEEG data in 32 noADMCI and 30 normal elderly (Nold) subjects were available in a national archive. Age, gender, and education were carefully matched among them. No subject had received a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. Individual alpha frequency peak (IAF) was used to determine the delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands of rsEEG rhythms. Fixed beta and gamma bands were also considered. Regional rsEEG cortical sources were estimated by eLORETA freeware. Area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves indexed the accuracy of eLORETA solutions in the classification between noADMCI-EEA and noADMCI-noEEA individuals. As novel findings, EEA was observed in 41% of noADMCI patients. Furthermore, these noADMCI-EEA patients showed higher temporal delta source activities as compared to noADMCI-no EEA patients and Nold subjects. Those activities discriminated individuals of the two NoADMCI groups with an accuracy of about 70%. The significant percentage of noADMCI-EEA patients showing EEA and marked abnormalities in temporal rsEEG rhythms at delta frequencies suggest a substantial role of underlying neural hypersynchronization mechanisms in their brain dysfunctions.

Nevertheless, the impact of the CBM procedure could be improved by the memory retrieval-extinction process (REP). Different studies have demonstrated that the retrieval of drug memories before extinction training later reduced the reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior. The main aim of this work was to study the effect of the CBM procedure itself, as well as in combination with the activation of alcohol-related memories, on the brain oscillatory activity of abstinent patients with alcohol-use disorder. The study sample comprised 33 patients divided into three groups: A-CBM (alcohol-related memory activation + CBM), N-CBM (neutral memory activation + CBM) and N-INT (no-intervention) groups. A resting-state EEG was obtained before and after each protocol, along with the assessment of the automatic action tendencies. A-CBM group showed a general alpha synchronization increase after the protocol, while the other groups did not show any significant change. Besides, A-CBM group showed significant intra and inter-group differences in the automatic action tendencies after the protocol, reflected in higher avoidance bias toward appetitive, aversive and without context alcohol-related stimuli. The alpha phase synchronization increase could be the neural manifestation of the conditioning produced between the alcohol-related stimuli and the automatic avoidance response. Moreover, the activation of the alcohol-related memories favors this conditioning with those alcohol-related stimuli associated with the activated memories, because it increases their threat level for the abstinence maintenance.

Beta-Corticomuscular coherence (CMC) quantifies coupling between oscillatory electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) activity and is modulated by sensory stimuli. We test the hypothesis that sensory modulation of CMC and intermuscular coherence (IMC) is abnormal in Idiopathic/Genetic and Acquired dystonias. Methods: Participants: 11 children with Acquired dystonia, 5 with Idiopathic/Genetic dystonia, 13 controls (12-18 years). CMC and IMC were recorded during a grasp task, with mechanical perturbations provided by an electromechanical tapper. Coherence patterns pre- and post-stimulus were compared across groups. Results: Beta-CMC increased post-stimulus in Controls and Acquired dystonia (p = 0.001 and p = 0.010, respectively), but not in Idiopathic/Genetic dystonia (p = 0.799). The modulation differed between groups, being larger in both Controls and Acquired dystonia compared with Idiopathic/Genetic dystonia (p = 0.003 and p = 0.022). Beta-IMC increased significantly post-stimulus in Controls (p = 0.004), but not in dystonia. Prominent 4-12 Hz IMC was seen in all dystonia patients and correlated with severity (rho = 0.618). Conclusion: Idiopathic/Genetic and Acquired dystonia share an abnormal low-frequency IMC. In contrast, sensory modulation of beta-CMC differed between the two groups. Significance: The findings suggest that sensorimotor processing is abnormal in Acquired as well as Idiopathic/Genetic dystonia, but that the nature of the abnormality differs.

Oscillatory biomarkers of early auditory information processing predict cognitive gains following targeted cognitive training in schizophrenia patients	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Targeted cognitive training; Theta oscillations; Early auditory information processing	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; FREQUENCY DEVIANTS; REMEDIATION; DEFICITS; METAANALYSIS; INDIVIDUALS; OUTCOMES; MEMORY	Auditory-based targeted cognitive training (TCT) is an effective and well-validated intervention for the treatment of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia patients. Improvements in higher-order cognition, reductions in symptom severity, and increases in psychosocial functioning secondary to TCT are thought to be driven by "bottom-up" enhancement of early auditory information processing (EAIP). Despite strong evidence of efficacy at the group level, there is significant variability in response to TCT, with few well-delineated biomarkers for predicting individual benefit. EEG biomarkers of EAIP are indicators of early-treatment sensitivity that predict full-course TCT outcome; however, further characterization is necessary for biomarker-guided clinical trials. The current study examined baseline and early-treatment sensitivity (i.e., change from baseline after 1 h) in theta band oscillatory activity to deviant stimuli as moderators of full course (30 h) TOCT response in treatment-refractory schizophrenia patients randomly assigned to receive either treatment-as-usual (TAU; n = 22) or TAU augmented with TCT (n = 30). Theta evoked power and phase locking at baseline predicted patient improvements in global cognitive function after 30 h of TCT. Decrease in theta activity to deviant stimuli after 1 h of TCT predicted improvements in verbal learning after 30 h. Exploratory analyses using EEG composite scores had high levels of sensitivity and specificity for identifying patients most likely to benefit from TCT. The integrity of baseline neurophysiologic activity associated with EAIP, as well as the sensitivity of the underlying circuity to change, likely reflects an intermediate therapeutic process underlying the effectiveness of TCT that can be used to predict patient response to treatment.

Proactive Control of Emotional Distraction: Evidence From EEG Alpha Suppression	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha suppression; attention; emotion; cognitive control; EEG	REACTIVE COGNITIVE CONTROL; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; NEURAL MECHANISMS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; GRADED ALLOCATION; TARGET; POWER; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION; PERFORMANCE	Biased attention towards emotional stimuli is adaptive, as it facilitates responses to important threats and rewards. An unfortunate consequence is that emotional stimuli can become potent distractors when they are irrelevant to current goals. How can this distraction be overcome despite the bias to attend to emotional stimuli? Recent studies show that distraction by irrelevant flankers is reduced when distractor frequency is high, even if they are emotional. A parsimonious explanation is that the expectation of frequent distractors promotes the use of proactive control, whereby attentional control settings can be altered to minimize distraction before it occurs. It is difficult, however, to infer proactive control on the basis of behavioral data alone. We therefore measured neural indices of proactive control while participants performed a target-detection task in which irrelevant peripheral distractors (either emotional or neutral) could appear either frequently (on 75% of trials) or rarely (on 25% of trials). We measured alpha power during the pre-stimulus period to assess proactive control and during the post-stimulus period to determine the consequences of control for subsequent processing. Pre-stimulus alpha power was tonically suppressed in the high, compared to low, distractor frequency condition, regardless of expected distractor valence, indicating sustained use of proactive control. In contrast, post-stimulus alpha suppression was reduced in the high-frequency condition, suggesting that proactive control reduced the need for post-stimulus adjustments. Our findings indicate that a sustained proactive control strategy accounts for the reduction in both emotional and non-emotional distraction when distractors are expected to appear frequently.

Normally, the amount of the calibration data for learning is proportional to the number of classes (or visual stimuli), which could be huge and consequently lead to a time-consuming calibration. This study presents a transfer learning scheme to substantially reduce the calibration effort. Methods: Inspired by the parameter-based and instance-based transfer learning techniques, we propose a subject transfer based canonical correlation analysis (stCCA) method which utilizes the knowledge within subject and between subjects, thus requiring few calibration data from a new subject. Results: The evaluation study on two SSVEP datasets (from Tsinghua and UCSD) shows that the stCCA method performs well with only a small amount of calibration data, providing an ITR at 198.18 +/- 59.12 (bits/min) with 9 calibration trials in the Tsinghua dataset and 111.04 +/- 57.24 (bits/min) with 3 trials in the UCSD dataset. Such performances are comparable to those from using the multi-stimulus CCA (msCCA) and the ensemble task-related component analysis (eTRCA) methods with the minimally required calibration data (i.e., at least 40 trials in the Tsinghua dataset and at least 12 trials in the UCSD dataset), respectively. Conclusion: Inter- and intra-subject transfer helps the recognition method achieve high ITR with extremely little calibration effort. Significance: The proposed approach saves much calibration effort without sacrificing the ITR, which would be significant for practical SSVEP-based BCIs.

The cognitive processes underlying dual tasking have been investigated extensively using EEG. Due to technological restrictions, however, this was not possible for dual-task scenarios including locomotion. With new technological opportunities, this became possible and cognitive-motor interference can be studied, even in outside-the-lab environments. In the present study, participants carried out a cognitive-motor interference task as they responded to cued, auditory task-switch stimuli while performing locomotive tasks with increasing complexity (standing, walking, traversing an obstacle course). We observed increased subjective workload ratings as well as decreased behavioural performance for increased movement complexity and cognitive task difficulty. A higher movement load went along with a decrease of parietal P2, N2 and P3 amplitudes and frontal Theta power. A higher cognitive load, on the other hand, was reflected by decreased frontal CNV amplitudes. Additionally, a connectivity analysis using inter-site phase coherence revealed that higher movement as well as cognitive task difficulty had an impairing effect on fronto-parietal connectivity. In conclusion, subjective ratings, behavioural performance and electrophysiological results indicate that less cognitive resources were available to be deployed towards the execution of the cognitive task when in locomotion compared to standing still. Connectivity results also show a scarcity of attentional resources when switching a task during the highest movement complexity condition. Summarized, all findings indicate a central role of attentional control regarding cognitive-motor dual tasking and an inherent limitation of cognitive resources.

In many fields, the effectiveness of these closed-loop protocols has proven to be better than that of the simple open-loop paradigms. Recently, sleep studies have attracted much attention as one possible application of closed-loop paradigms. To date, several studies that used closed-loop paradigms have been reported in the sleep-related literature and recommend a closed-loop feedback system to enhance specific brain activity during sleep, which leads to improvements in sleep's effects, such as memory consolidation. However, to the best of our knowledge, no report has reviewed and discussed the detailed technical issues that arise in designing sleep closed-loop paradigms. In this paper, we reviewed the most recent reports on sleep closed-loop paradigms and offered an in-depth discussion of some of their technical issues. We found 148 journal articles strongly related with 'sleep and stimulation' and reviewed 20 articles on closed-loop feedback sleep studies. We focused on human sleep studies conducting any modality of feedback stimulation. Then we introduced the main component of the closed-loop system and summarized several open-source libraries, which are widely used in closed-loop systems, with step-by-step guidelines for closed-loop system implementation for sleep. Further, we proposed future directions for sleep research with closed-loop feedback systems, which provide some insight into closed-loop feedback systems.

Musical (jazz) improvisation is an ecologically valid test-case to distinguish between these views because relatively slow, deliberate, executive-control processes should not dominate during high-quality, real-time improvisation. In the present study, jazz guitarists (n = 32) improvised to novel chord sequences while 64-channel EEGs were recorded. Jazz experts rated each improvisation for creativity, technical proficiency and aesthetic appeal. Surface-Laplacian-transformed EEGs recorded during the performances were analyzed in the scalp-frequency domain using SPM12. Significant clusters of high-frequency (beta-band and gamma-band) activity were observed when higher-quality versus lower-quality improvisations were compared. Higher-quality improvisations were associated with predominantly posterior left-hemisphere activity; lower-quality improvisations were associated with right temporo-parietal and fron-to-polar activity. However, after statistically controlling for experience (defined as the number of public performances previously given), performance quality was a function of right-hemisphere, largely right-frontal, activity. These results support the notion that superior creative production is associated with hypofrontality and right-hemisphere activity thereby supporting a dual-process model of creativity in which experience influences the balance between executive and associative processes. This study also highlights the idea that the functional neuroanatomy of creative production depends on whether creativity is defined in terms of the quality of products or the type of cognitive processes involved.

Actually, about 40% of patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and the minimally conscious state (MCS) are misdiagnosed. Indeed, only advanced paraclinical approaches, including advanced EEG analyses, can allow achieving a more reliable diagnosis, that is, discovering residual traces of awareness in patients with UWS (namely, functional Locked-In Syndrome (fLIS)). These approaches aim at capturing the residual brain network models, at rest or that may be activated in response to relevant stimuli, which may be appropriate for awareness to emerge (despite their insufficiency to generate purposeful motor behaviors). For this, different brain network models have been studied in patients with DoC by using sensory stimuli (i.e., passive tasks), probing response to commands (i.e., active tasks), and during resting-state. Since it can be difficult for patients with DoC to perform even simple active tasks, this scoping review aims at summarizing the current, innovative neurophysiological examination methods in resting state/passive modality to differentiate and prognosticate patients with DoC. We conclude that the electrophysiologically-based diagnostic procedures represent an important resource for diagnosis, prognosis, and, therefore, management of patients with DoC, using advance passive and resting state paradigm analyses for the patients who lie in the "greyzones" between MCS, UWS, and fLIS.

However, the idea that conflict resolution facilitates positive stimuli processing has not reached a consistent conclusion. We suggested that conflict resolution was integrated with positive emotions. The present study used ERPs, took the flanker task as primes, set different durations (i.e., 600 ms and 1200 ms) between the resolution of conflicts and the presentation of targets, and chose affective words as targets to investigate the affective effect of cognitive conflict during the resolution stage. Participants' task was to react to the flanker task and then evaluate the valence of the target words. The findings of experiment1 (600 ms) and experiment2 (1200 ms) were consistent. Behavioral results showed that the conflict effect was significant, and the positive signal effect of conflict resolution was found. In ERPs results, the enhanced N2 amplitudes for incongruent primes showed a significant conflict effect. The enhanced conflict SP amplitudes for incongruent primes reflected conflict resolution. As expected, the enhanced N400 amplitudes for positive targets after incongruent primes indicated that conflict resolution facilitated positive stimuli processing. Time-frequency analyses showed that incongruent primes elicited larger theta (4-8 Hz) power than congruent primes over the frontal areas. More importantly, we found that theta (4-8 Hz) power for positive targets after incongruent primes was lower than those after congruent primes over the central areas. These findings suggested that conflict resolution facilitated positive stimulus processing, and this positive effect was a carry-over effect, which indicated that conflict resolution was integrated with positive emotions.

Using neuromagnetic brain signals recorded from healthy participants during somatosensory stimuli, we compared the performance of four phase synchronization measures, imaginary part of phase-locking value, imaginary part of coherency (ImCoh), phase lag index and weighted phase lag index (wPLI), for detecting stimulus-induced FCs between the contralateral primary and ipsilateral secondary somatosensory cortices. The analyses revealed that ImCoh exhibited the best performance for detecting stimulus-induced FCs, followed by the wPLI. We found that amplitude weighting, which is related to computing both ImCoh and wPLI, effectively attenuated the influence of noise contamination.

Two groups of unbalanced bilinguals were enrolled in pre- and post-tests using the picture naming task, but only the experimental group participated in an eight-day dual-language training session. Event-related potentials (ERPs) showed that, in the experimental group, the N2 mean magnitude was comparable between two languages in the pre-test, but it was larger in the native language (L1) than the second language (L2) in the post-test. In addition, the delta band power was similar between L1 and L2 in the pre-test, but L2 was associated with stronger power than L1 after training. In contrast, the control group showed no significant changes. These findings suggest that increased experience of language use in the dual-language context induces stronger proactive inhibitory control on L1, resulting in its lower activation.

Since the NAc is connected with the motor system, we tested whether phase and amplitude -based NAc-cortical connectivity and power modulation likewise underlie flexibility in motor action control. We combined concurrently recorded intracranial and extracranial electroencephalograms from seven psychiatric patients implanted with deep brain stimulation electrodes who performed a stop signal task. Inhibition success as opposed to failure was associated with greater pre-stimulus information flow from right NAc to medial frontal cortex through phase coupling of theta oscillations. Inhibition failure evoked theta power increases in the left NAc and medial frontal cortex, whereas parieto-occipital cortex showed an alpha power decrease. We conclude that NAc-to-frontal theta connectivity, possibly facilitating processing of task-relevant information, and alpha and theta power modulations, possibly reflecting post-error engagement of cognitive control, contribute to adaptive behavior pertaining motor control.

Beauty in mind: Aesthetic appreciation correlates with perceptual facilitation and attentional amplification	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Neuroaesthetics; Attention; EEG; Aesthetic appreciation	ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; BAYESIAN SURPRISE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; ART; STRIATE; INFORMATION; MODULATION; ACTIVATION; COMPONENT	Neuroaesthetic research suggests that aesthetic appreciation results from the interaction between the object perceptual features and the perceiver's sensory processing dynamics. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between aesthetic appreciation and attentional modulation at a behavioural and psychophysiological level. In a first experiment, fifty-eight healthy participants performed a visual search task with abstract stimuli containing more or less natural spatial frequencies and subsequently were asked to give an aesthetic evaluation of the images. The results evidenced that response times were faster for more appreciated stimuli. In a second experiment, we recorded visual evoked potentials (VEPs) during exposure to the same stimuli. The results showed, only for more appreciated images, an enhancement in C1 and N1, P3 and N4 VEP components. Moreover, we found increased attention-related occipital alpha desynchronization for more appreciated images. We interpret these data as indicative of the existence of a correlation between aesthetic appreciation and perceptual processing enhancement, both at a behavioural and at a neumphysiological level.

Current rehabilitation capacities are overwhelmed by the age-related increase of motor dysfunctions seen, for example, in stroke, extrapyramidal or neuromuscular diseases. As the patient to rehabilitation personnel ration increases, robotic solutions might establish the possibility to rapidly satisfy the increasing demand for rehabilitation. This paper presents an inaugural exploratory study which investigates the interchangeability of a novel experimental robotic rehabilitation device system with classical physical therapy, using a multimodal neurophysiological assessment of the motor system-quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG), motor conduction times and turn/amplitude analysis. Preliminary results show no significant difference between the two methods; however, a significant effect of the therapy was found on different pathologies (beneficial for vascular and extrapyramidal, or limited, and only on preventing reduction of joint movements in neuromuscular).

However, misleading non-epileptic findings of electrocorticography (ECoG) have not yet been examined in detail. The aim of the present study was to identify non-epileptic epileptiform ECoG findings. We retrospectively reviewed the intracranial recordings of 21 patients with intractable focal epilepsy who became seizure-free after a presurgical evaluation with subdural electrodes following resective surgeries at Sapporo Medical University between January 2014 and December 2018. Morphological epileptiform findings outside epileptogenic areas were judged as non-epileptic and analyzed. Seventeen areas in nine patients exhibited non-epileptic epileptiform activities. These areas were identified in the lateral temporal cortices, basal temporal areas, rolandic areas, and frontal lobe. Morphological patterns were classified into three types: 1) spiky oscillations, 2) isolated spiky activity, and 3) isolated fast activity. The normal cortex may exhibit non-epileptic epileptiform activities. These activities need to be carefully differentiated from real epileptic abnormalities to prevent the mislocalization of epileptogenic areas. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We measured the time-reversal symmetry of spontaneous electroencephalographic brain activity recorded from three groups of patients and their respective control group under two experimental conditions (eyes open and closed). We evaluated differences in time irreversibility in terms of possible underlying physical generating mechanisms. The results showed that resting brain activity is generically time-irreversible at sufficiently long time scales, and that brain pathology is generally associated with a reduction in time-asymmetry, albeit with pathology-specific patterns. The significance of these results and their possible dynamical etiology are discussed. Some implications of the differential modulation of time asymmetry by pathology and experimental condition are examined.

This study examined whether SSVEP reflects different states during object recognition. In one trial, a binary image (BI), which is difficult to recognize, was followed by a grayscale image (GI) of the same object as the answer. Both BI and GI were presented in a flickering manner at a frequency of 7.5 Hz. Participants were first asked to answer whether they could recognize BI. Then, after GI was shown, participants were requested to answer whether they recognized it. We analyzed the evoked and induced component of SSVEPs from the two recognition conditions. As a result, the SSVEPs to BI were significantly larger than that to GI. In addition, induced component to GI after the BI was unrecognized was smaller than after the BI was recognized. The present data provide evidence that SSVEPs reflect a transition of cognitive state to ambiguous figures is reflected.

These, typically brief, high-frequency and heterogeneous signal anomalies remain poorly understood, particularly at long time scales, and their morphology and variability have not been systematically characterized. In continuous neural recordings, their inherent sparsity, short duration and low amplitude makes their detection and classification difficult. In turn, this limits their evaluation as potential biomarkers of abnormal neurodynamic processes (e.g., ictogenesis) and predictors of impending adverse events. A novel algorithm is presented that leverages the inherent sparsity of high-frequency abnormalities in neural signals recorded at the scalp and uses spectral clustering to classify them in very high-dimensional signals spanning several days. It is shown that estimated clusters vary dynamically with time and their distribution changes substantially both as a function of time and space.

Gamma ASSR deficits have been reported in schizophrenia patients and individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for developing psychosis. We hypothesized that, in CHR patients, gamma ASSR would correlate with real-world functioning, consistent with a role for gamma synchrony deficits in functional impairment. Methods A total of 35 CHR patients rated on Global Functioning: Social and Role scales had EEG recorded while listening to 1-ms, 93-dB clicks presented at 40 Hz in 500-ms trains, in response to which 40-Hz evoked power and intertrial phase-locking factor (PLF) were measured. Results In CHR patients, lower 40-Hz PLF correlated with lower social functioning. Conclusions Gamma synchrony deficits may be a biomarker of real-world impairment at early stages of the schizophrenia disease trajectory.

Phenotypic profiling of mGlu(7) knockout mice reveals new implications for neurodevelopmental disorders	GENES BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						ADHD; ASD; autism; EEG; epilepsy; GRM7; mGlu(7); Rett syndrome; seizures	METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR; NEGATIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR; SUBTYPE 7; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; MOUSE MODEL; GRM7 GENE; OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY; CHILDREN; DEFICITS	Neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by deficits in communication, cognition, attention, social behavior and/or motor control. Previous studies have pointed to the involvement of genes that regulate synaptic structure and function in the pathogenesis of these disorders. One such gene, GRM7, encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGlu(7)), a G protein-coupled receptor that regulates presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Mutations and polymorphisms in GRM7 have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in clinical populations; however, limited preclinical studies have evaluated mGlu(7) in the context of this specific disease class. Here, we show that the absence of mGlu(7) in mice is sufficient to alter phenotypes within the domains of social behavior, associative learning, motor function, epilepsy and sleep. Moreover, Grm7 knockout mice exhibit an attenuated response to amphetamine. These findings provide rationale for further investigation of mGlu(7) as a potential therapeutic target for neurodevelopmental disorders such as idiopathic autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Rett syndrome.

Only a handful of metrics have been applied to CCEP data to infer connectivity, and no comparison as to which is best has been performed. New method: We implement a novel method which involved superimposing synthetic cortical responses onto stereoelectroencephalographic (SEEG) data, and use this to compare several metric's ability to detect the simulated patterns. In this we compare two commonly employed metrics currently used in CCEP analysis against eight time series similarity metrics (TSSMs), which have been widely used in machine learning and pattern matching applications. Results: Root Mean Square (RMS), a metric commonly employed in CCEP analysis, was sensitive to a wide variety of response patterns, but insensitive to simulated epileptiform patterns. Autoregressive (AR) coefficients calculated by Burg's method were also sensitive to a wide range of patterns, but were extremely sensitive to epileptiform patterns. Other metrics which employed elastic warping techniques were less sensitive to the simulated response patterns. Comparison with existing methods: Our study is the first to compare CCEP connectivity metrics against one-another. Our results found that RMS, which has been used in many CCEP studies previously, was the most sensitive metric across a wide range of patterns. Conclusions: Our novel method showed that RMS is a robust and sensitive measure, validating much of the findings of the SEEG-CCEP literature to date. Autoregressive coefficients may also be a useful metric to investigate epileptic networks.

Raw signals were gathered from 64-channel scalp electroencephalograms of 11 healthy participants. Firstly, the cortical source model was defined with 62 regions of interest over the sensorimotor cortex (nine Brodmann areas). Secondly, functional connectivity was calculated by phase lock value for alpha and beta rhythm networks. Thirdly, network-based statistics were applied to identify whether there existed stable and significant subnetworks that formed between the two types of motor imagery tasks. Meanwhile, ten graph theory indices were investigated for each network by t-test to determine statistical significance between tasks. Finally, sparse multinomial logistic regression (SMLR)-support vector machine (SVM), as a feature selection and classification model, was used to analyze the graph theory features. The specific time-frequency (alpha event-related desynchronization and beta event-related synchronization) difference network between the two tasks was congregated at the midline and demonstrated significant connections in the premotor areas and primary somatosensory cortex. A few of statistically significant differences in the network properties were observed between tasks in the alpha and beta rhythm. The SMLR-SVM classification model achieved fair discrimination accuracy between imaginary movements of the two feet (maximum 75% accuracy rate in single-trial analyses). This study reveals the network mechanism of the discrimination of the left and right foot motor imagery. (C) 2020 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, it is unclear whether different sleep states fulfill common functions and are driven by shared mechanisms in these different animal species. Mammals and birds exhibit two obviously distinct states of sleep, i.e., non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but it is unknown why sleep should be so segregated. Studying sleep in other animal models might give us clues that help solve this puzzle. Recent studies suggest that REM sleep, or ancestral forms of REM sleep might be found in non-mammalian or -avian species such as reptiles. These observations suggest that REM sleep and NREM sleep evolved earlier than previously thought. In this review, we discuss the evolutionary origin of the distinct REM/NREM sleep states to gain insight into the mechanistic and functional reason for these two different types of sleep.

Furthermore, it has been suggested that coefficient of variation mapping of fast functional MRI signal may provide a powerful tool for the identification of intrinsic brain pulsations in neurological diseases such as dementia, stroke and epilepsy. In this study, we used fast functional MRI sequence (magnetic resonance encephalography) to acquire ten whole-brain images per second. We used the functional MRI data to compare physiological brain pulsations between healthy controls (n = 102) and patients with epilepsy (n = 33) and furthermore to drug-naive seizure patients (n = 9). Analyses were performed by calculating coefficient of variation and spectral power in full band and filtered sub-bands. Brain pulsations in the respiratory-related frequency sub-band (0.11-0.51Hz) were significantly (P < 0.05) increased in patients with epilepsy, with an increase in both signal variance and power. At the individual level, over 80% of medicated and drug-naive seizure patients exhibited areas of abnormal brain signal power that correlated well with the known clinical diagnosis, while none of the controls showed signs of abnormality with the same threshold. The differences were most apparent in the basal brain structures, respiratory centres of brain stem, midbrain and temporal lobes. Notably, full-band, very low frequency (0.01-0.1Hz) and cardiovascular (0.8-1.76Hz) brain pulses showed no differences between groups. This study extends and confirms our previous results of abnormal fast functional MRI signal variance in epilepsy patients. Only respiratory-related brain pulsations were clearly increased with no changes in either physiological cardiorespiratory rates or head motion between the subjects. The regional alterations in brain pulsations suggest that mechanisms driving the cerebrospinal fluid homeostasis may be altered in epilepsy. Magnetic resonance encephalography has both increased sensitivity and high specificity for detecting the increased brain pulsations, particularly in times when other tools for locating epileptogenic areas remain inconclusive.

Our purpose is to distinguish subtypes of developmental dyslexia by the level of speech-EEG frequency entrainment (delta: 1-4; beta: 12.5-22.5; gamma 1: 25-35; and gamma 2: 35-80 Hz) in word/pseudoword auditory discrimination. Depending on the type of disabilities, dyslexics can divide into two subtypes-with less pronounced phonological deficits (NoPhoDys-visual dyslexia) and with more pronounced ones (PhoDys-phonological dyslexia). For correctly recognized stimuli, the delta-entrainment is significantly worse in dyslexic children compared to controls at a level of speech prosody and syllabic analysis. Controls and NoPhoDys show a stronger delta-entrainment in the left-hemispheric auditory cortex (AC), anterior temporal lobe (ATL), frontal, and motor cortices than PhoDys. Dyslexic subgroups concerning normolexics have a deficit of delta-entrainment in the left ATL, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and the right AC. PhoDys has higher delta-entrainment in the posterior part of adjacent STS regions than NoPhoDys. Insufficient low-frequency beta changes over the IFG, the inferior parietal lobe of PhoDys compared to NoPhoDys correspond to their worse phonological short-term memory. Left-dominant 30 Hz-entrainment for normolexics to phonemic frequencies characterizes the right AC, adjacent regions to superior temporal sulcus of dyslexics. The pronounced 40 Hz-entrainment in PhoDys than the other groups suggest a hearing "reassembly" and a poor phonological working memory. Shifting up to higher-frequency gamma-entrainment in the AC of NoPhoDys can lead to verbal memory deficits. Different patterns of cortical reorganization based on the left or right hemisphere lead to differential dyslexic profiles.

Eye Closure Increases Attentional Alpha-Power Modulation but Not Listening Performance	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Oscillatory Mechanisms Underlying Human Perception and Attention at the 25th Annual Meeting of Cognitive-Neuroscience-Society (CNS)	MAR 24-27, 2018	Boston, MA	Cognit Neurosci Soc			OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; MEMORY; PERCEPTION; WITNESSES; PROTECT; IMPACT	In challenging listening conditions, closing the eyes is a strategy with intuitive appeal to improve auditory attention and perception. On the neural level, closing the eyes increases the power of alpha oscillations (similar to 10 Hz), which are a prime signature of auditory attention. Here, we test whether eye closure benefits neural and behavioral signatures of auditory attention and perception. Participants (n = 22) attended to one of two alternating streams of spoken numbers with open or closed eyes in a darkened chamber. After each trial, participants indicated whether probes had been among the to-be-attended or to-be-ignored numbers. In the EEG, states of relative high versus low alpha power accompanied the presentation of attended versus ignored numbers. Importantly, eye closure did not only increase the overall level of absolute alpha power but also the attentional modulation thereof. Behaviorally, however, neither perceptual sensitivity nor response criterion was affected by eye closure. To further examine whether this behavioral null result would conceptually replicate in a simple auditory detection task, a follow-up experiment was conducted that required participants (n = 19) to detect a near-threshold target tone in noise. As in the main experiment, our results provide evidence for the absence of any difference in perceptual sensitivity and criterion for open versus closed eyes. In summary, we demonstrate here that the modulation of the human alpha rhythm by auditory attention is increased when participants close their eyes. However, our results speak against the widely held belief that eye closure per se improves listening behavior.

Due to the limitations of traditional interview-based depression detection, it has become an urgent problem to realize objective, convenient and fast detection. This study is to explore ubiquitous methods of depression detection based on combination learning and functional networks, using sleep physiological data. Sleep physiological data were collected using a portable physiological data instrument, and then preprocess and extract several related features. We applied combination learning to discover the best sleep stage, the optimal features subset, and the most effective classifier, which are hidden behind physiological features, to detect depression. Physiological features in the optimal feature subset based on Euclidean distance are mapped to nodes to construct the functional network. The optimal feature subset was combined with the functional network attributes as the input of the most effective classifier to get the ultimate performance of depression detection. Controlled trials based on ubiquitous sleep physiological data were conducted on different genders. Experiments show that the best results for male and female were derived from slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM), with performances of 92.21%; and 94.56%, AUC of 0.944 and 0.971, respectively. Thus, our study may provide an effective and ubiquitous method for detect depression.

A rebound in beta synchronization is observed after the end of voluntary movements as well as after somatosensory stimulation and is believed to describe the return to baseline of sensorimotor networks. However, the contribution of efferent and afferent signals to the beta rebound remains poorly understood. Here, we applied electrical median nerve stimulation (MNS) to the right side followed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the left primary motor cortex after either 15 or 25 ms. Because the afferent volley reaches the somatosensory cortex after about 20 ms, TMS on the motor cortex was either anticipating or following the cortical arrival of the peripheral stimulus. We show modulations in different beta sub-bands and in both hemispheres, following a pattern of greater resynchronization when motor signals are paired with a peripheral one. The beta rebound in the left hemisphere (stimulated) is modulated in its lower frequency range when TMS precedes the cortical arrival of the afferent volley. In the right hemisphere (unstimulated), instead, the increase is limited to higher beta frequencies when TMS is delivered after the arrival of the afferent signal. In general, we demonstrate that the temporal integration of afferent and efferent signals plays a key role in the genesis of the beta rebound and that these signals may be carried in parallel by different beta sub-bands.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to compare neural correlates of inhibition, post-error adaptation, and reaction time variability in ASD and neuro-typical control (NTC) participants by investigating possible differences in error-related changes of oscillatory MEG activity. Twelve male NTC (mean age 20.3 +/- 3.7) and fourteen male patients with ASD (mean age 17.8 +/- 2.9) were included in the analysis. Subjects with ASD showed increased error-related reaction time variability. MEG analysis revealed decreased beta power in the ASD group in comparison to the NTC group over the centro-parietal channels in both, the pre-stimulus and post-response interval. In the ASD group, mean centro-parietal beta power negatively correlated with dimensional autism symptoms. In both groups, false alarms were followed by an early increase in temporo-frontal theta to alpha power; and by a later decrease in alpha to beta power at central and posterior sensors. Single trial correlations were additionally studied in the ASD group, who showed a positive correlation of pre-stimulus beta power with post-response theta, alpha, and beta power, particularly after hit trials. On a broader scale, the results deliver important insights into top-down control deficits that may relate to core symptoms observed in ASD.

J	Mostame, P; Sadaghiani, S				Mostame, Parham; Sadaghiani, Sepideh			Phase- and amplitude-coupling are tied by an intrinsic spatial organization but show divergent stimulus-related changes	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Functional connectivity; Phase coupling; Amplitude coupling; Electrocorticography (ECoG); Synchrony; Networks	RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; CORTICAL DYNAMICS; TIME-LAG; SYNCHRONIZATION; MEG; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHY	Functional connectivity (FC), thought to provide a window into neural communication, has become a core focus in the study of brain function and cognition. However, there is no consensus on how to conceptualize large-scale FC in electrophysiology. Phase coupling (PhC), defined as coupling between the phases of two signals, reflects the synchronization of rhythmic oscillation cycles. Conversely, amplitude coupling (AmpC), defined as coupling between the envelopes of two signals, reflects correlation of activation amplitude. Despite quantifying different electrophysiological properties, the relationship between PhC and AmpC remains largely unknown. We assessed spatial and temporal correspondence between PhC and AmpC over 5 canonical frequency bands during a cue-based motor task using electrocorticography (ECoG) in 18 patients (8 females) undergoing presurgical monitoring. Significant correspondence between the spatial pattern of PhC and AmpC was detected during stimulus processing across all subjects and frequency bands (R approximate to 0.50 for theta, decreasing with increasing frequency). The cross-measure spatial correlation vanished almost entirely when accounting for the portion of FC equally present during pre- and post-stimulus intervals, suggesting that the spatial correlations reflect intrinsic FC independent of stimulus processing. Stimulus-related processing modulated both PhC and AmpC, however in a spatially independent manner. Examining the linear temporal correlation, we found no evidence for linear dependence between PhC and AmpC. Supporting the robustness of our findings, results extended to a verb generation task in a second ECoG dataset of 6 subjects. We conclude that PhC and AmpC reflect intrinsic FC similarly across space, but exhibit divergent stimulus-related FC changes over space and time.

A multimodal magnetoencephalography 7 T fMRI and 7 T proton MR spectroscopy study in first episode psychosis	NPJ SCHIZOPHRENIA			English	Article							STEADY-STATE; GAMMA FREQUENCY; UNMEDICATED PATIENTS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; FUNCTIONAL MRI; EEG COHERENCE; RESTING GABA; SCHIZOPHRENIA; OSCILLATIONS	We combined magnetoencephalography (MEG), 7 T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and 7 T fMRI during performance of a task in a group of 23 first episode psychosis (FEP) patients and 26 matched healthy controls (HC). We recorded both the auditory evoked response to 40 Hz tone clicks and the resting state in MEG. Neurometabolite levels were obtained from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The fMRI BOLD response was obtained during the Stroop inhibitory control task. FEP showed a significant increase in resting state low frequency theta activity (p < 0.05; Cohend= 0.69), but no significant difference in the 40 Hz auditory evoked response compared to HC. An across-groups whole brain analysis of the fMRI BOLD response identified eight regions that were significantly activated during task performance (p < 0.01, FDR-corrected); the mean signal extracted from those regions was significantly different between the groups (p = 0.0006;d = 1.19). In the combined FEP and HC group, there was a significant correlation between the BOLD signal during task performance and MEG resting state low frequency activity (p < 0.05). In FEP, we report significant alteration in resting state low frequency MEG activity, but no alterations in auditory evoked gamma band response, suggesting that the former is a more robust biomarker of early psychosis. There were no correlations between gamma oscillations and GABA levels in either HC or FEP. Finally, in this study, each of the three imaging modalities differentiated FEP from HC; fMRI with good and MEG and MRS with moderate effect size.

Slow Waves Promote Sleep-Dependent Plasticity and Functional Recovery after Stroke	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ischemic stroke; neuroplasticity; optogenetics; slow wave sleep	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; MOTOR RECOVERY; SPINAL-CORD; LOCAL SLEEP; EEG CHANGES; NREM SLEEP; UPPER-LIMB; MOVEMENT	Functional recovery after stroke is associated with a remapping of neural circuits. This reorganization is often associated with low-frequency, high-amplitude oscillations in the peri-infarct zone in both rodents and humans. These oscillations are reminiscent of sleep slow waves (SW) and suggestive of a role for sleep in brain plasticity that occur during stroke recovery; however, direct evidence is missing. Using a stroke model in male mice, we showed that stroke was followed by a transient increase in NREM sleep accompanied by reduced amplitude and slope of ipsilateral NREM sleep SW. We next used 5ms optical activation of Channelrhodopsin 2-expressing pyramidal neurons, or 200 ms silencing of Archeorhodopsin T-expressing pyramidal neurons, to generate local cortical UP, or DOWN, states, respectively, both sharing similarities with spontaneous NREM SW in freely moving mice. Importantly, we found that single optogenetically evoked SW (SWopto) in the peri-infarct zone, randomly distributed during sleep, significantly improved fine motor movements of the limb corresponding to the sensorimotor stroke lesion site compared with spontaneous recovery and control conditions, while motor strength remained unchanged. In contrast, SWopto during wakefulness had no effect. Furthermore, chronic SWopto during sleep were associated with local axonal sprouting as revealed by the increase of anatomic presynaptic and postsynaptic markers in the peri-infarct zone and corresponding contralesional areas to cortical circuit reorganization during stroke recovery. These results support a role for sleep SW in cortical circuit plasticity and sensorimotor recovery after stroke and provide a clinically relevant framework for rehabilitation strategies using neuromodulation during sleep.

The Impact of COVID-19 on Epilepsy Care: A Survey of the American Epilepsy Society Membership	EPILEPSY CURRENTS			English	Article						COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; survey; epilepsy care; seizures; people with epilepsy (PWE); EEG; telehealth	STROKE CARE; TELEMEDICINE; TELEHEALTH	The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the delivery of care to people with epilepsy (PWE) in multiple ways including limitations on in-person contact and restrictions on neurophysiological procedures. To better study the effect of the pandemic on PWE, members of the American Epilepsy Society were surveyed between April 30 and June 14, 2020. There were 366 initial responses (9% response rate) and 337 respondents remained for analysis after screening out noncompleters and those not directly involved with clinical care; the majority were physicians from the United States. About a third (30%) of respondents stated that they had patients with COVID-19 and reported no significant change in seizure frequency. Conversely, one-third of respondents reported new onset seizures in patients with COVID-19 who had no prior history of seizures. The majority of respondents felt that there were at least some barriers for PWE in receiving appropriate clinical care, neurophysiologic procedures, and elective surgery. Medication shortages were noted by approximately 30% of respondents, with no clear pattern in types of medication involved. Telehealth was overwhelmingly found to have value. Among the limitation of the survey was that it was administered at a single point in time in a rapidly changing pandemic. The survey showed that almost all respondents were affected by the pandemic in a variety of ways.	[Albert, Dara V.

Methods: Participants will include up to 343 Veterans with chronic pain due to a broad range of etiologies, randomly assigned to one of three 8-week manualized in-person group treatments: (1) Hypnosis (HYP), (2) Mindfulness Meditation (MM), or (3) Education Control (EDU). Projected outcomes: The primary aim of the study is to compare the effectiveness of HYP and MM to EDU on average pain intensity measured pre- and post-treatment. Additional study aims will explore the effectiveness of HYP and MM compared to EDU on secondary outcomes (i.e., pain interference, sleep, depression, anxiety and PTSD), and the maintenance of effects at 3- and 6-months post-treatment. Participants will have electroencephalogram (EEG) assessments at pre- and post-treatment to determine if the power of specific brain oscillations moderate the effectiveness of HYP and MM (Study Aim 2) and examine brain oscillations as possible mediators of treatment effects (exploratory aim). Additional planned exploratory analyses will be performed to identify possible treatment mediators (i.e., pain acceptance, catastrophizing, mindfulness) and moderators (e.g., hypnotizability, treatment expectations, pain type, cognitive function). Setting: The study treatments will be administered at a large Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the northwest United States. The treatments will be integrated within clinical infrastructure and delivered by licensed and credentialed health care professionals.

The major goal of this study was to investigate the effects of medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC) stimulation on sustained attention task performance measured by Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVIP) task and the brain networks assumed to be critical to sustained attention. mPFC has been shown to be involved in sustained attention performance and as a main hub in default mode network (DMN). mPFC activity modulation via theta tACS was implemented in this study. This was a single blind study with 21 participants receiving active and sham stimulation with the electrodes on FPz and the Inion. tACS was able to impact different RVIP measures (total hits, A' (sensitivity to target), total correct rejection, etc.). Relative power spectrum density (PSD) analysis yielded significant increases in theta frequency mostly in the fronto-central regions after active tACS and current source density (CSD) analysis yielded significant power modulations in theta frequency band in post-central gyrus. Furthermore, phase locking value (PLV) analysis showed that there were significant changes in cortical connections in the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN) in alpha frequency band. This study showed that theta frequency tACS over mPFC, was able to produce significant modulations in an RVIP task and its associated brain networks in healthy participants.

The objective of the present study is to characterize the anatomical, neurochemical and electrophysiological properties of the SuML-DG projection neurons and to determine how they control DG oscillations and neuronal activation during PS and other vigilance states. For this purpose, we combine structural connectivity techniques using neurotropic viral vectors (rabies virus, AAV), neurochemical anatomy (immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization) and imaging (light, electron and confocal microscopy) with in vitro (patch clamp) and in vivo (LFP, EEG) optogenetic and electrophysiological recordings performed in transgenic VGLUT2-cre male mice. At the cellular level, we show that the SuML-DG neurons co-release GABA and glutamate on dentate granule cells and increase the activity of a subset of DG granule cells. At the network level, we show that activation of the SuML-DG pathway increases theta power and frequency during PS as well as gamma power during PS and waking in the DG. At the behavioral level, we show that the activation of this pathway does not change animal behavior during PS, induces awakening during slow wave sleep and increases motor activity during waking. These results suggest that the SuML-DG pathway is capable of supporting the increase of theta and gamma power in the DG observed during PS and plays an important modulatory role of DG network activity during this state.

Theta and gamma connectivity is linked with affective and cognitive symptoms in Parkinson's disease	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Brain connectivity; Parkinson's disease; Affective and cognitive symptoms; Cortical oscillations	STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RATING-SCALE; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; ANXIETY; NETWORK; IMPAIRMENT; SYMPTOMATOLOGY; OSCILLATIONS; DEPRESSION; PATTERNS	Background: The progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) can often exacerbate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and/or cognitive impairment. In this study, we explore the possibility that multiple brain network responses are associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment in PD. This association is likely to provide insights into a single multivariate relationship, where common affective symptoms occurring in PD cohorts are related with alterations to electrophysiological response. Methods: 70 PD patients and 21 healthy age-matched controls (HC) participated in a high-density electro-encephalography (EEG) study. Functional connectivity differences between PD and HC groups of oscillatory activity at rest and during completion of an emotion-cognition task were examined to identify key brain oscillatory activities. A canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was applied to identify a putative multivariate relationship between connectivity patterns and affective symptoms in PD groups. Results: A CCA analysis identified a single mode of co-variation linking theta and gamma connectivity with affective symptoms in PD groups. Increases in frontotemporal gamma, frontal and parietal theta connectivity were related with increased anxiety and cognitive impairment. Decreases in temporal region theta and frontoparietal gamma connectivity were associated with higher depression ratings and PD patient age. Limitations: This study only reports on optimal dosage of dopaminergic treatment ('on' state) in PD and did not investigate at "off" medication". Conclusions: Theta and gamma connectivity during rest and task-states are linked to affective and cognitive symptoms within fronto-temporo-parietal networks, suggesting a potential assessment avenue for understanding brain-behaviour associations in PD with electrophysiological task paradigms.

Motor effects of deep brain stimulation correlate with increased functional connectivity in Parkinson's disease: An MEG study	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Magnetoencephalography; Deep brain stimulation; Motor symptoms; Resting-state	SIGNAL-SPACE SEPARATION; RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; MODULATION; ARTIFACTS; MOVEMENT; TRIAL; EEG; MRI	Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established symptomatic treatment in Parkinson's disease, yet its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Locally in the STN, stimulation lowers beta band power, in parallel with symptom relief. Therefore, beta band oscillations are sometimes referred to as "anti-kinetic". However, in recent studies functional interactions have been observed beyond the STN, which we hypothesized to reflect clinical effects of DBS. Resting-state, whole-brain magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings and assessments on motor function were obtained in 18 Parkinson's disease patients with bilateral STN-DBS, on and off stimulation. For each brain region, we estimated source-space spectral power and functional connectivity with the rest of the brain. Stimulation led to an increase in average peak frequency and a suppression of absolute band power (delta to low-beta band) in the sensorimotor cortices. Significant changes (decreases and increases) in low-beta band functional connectivity were observed upon stimulation. Improvement in bradykinesia/rigidity was significantly related to increases in alpha2 and low-beta band functional connectivity (of sensorimotor regions, the cortex as a whole, and subcortical regions). By contrast, tremor improvement did not correlate with changes in functional connectivity. Our results highlight the distributed effects of DBS on the resting-state brain and suggest that DBS-related improvements in rigidity and bradykinesia, but not tremor, may be mediated by an increase in alpha2 and low-beta functional connectivity. Beyond the local effects of DBS in and around the STN, functional connectivity changes in these frequency bands might therefore be considered as "pro-kinetic".

Sleeping with Hippocampal Damage	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							HERPES-SIMPLEX ENCEPHALITIS; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL SEQUELAE; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; SPINDLES; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; REACTIVATION; PLASTICITY; CORTICES	The hippocampus plays a critical role in sleep-related memory processes [1-3], but it is unclear which specific sleep features are dependent upon this brain structure. The examination of sleep physiology in patients with focal bilateral hippocampal damage and amnesia could supply important evidence regarding these links. However, there is a dearth of such studies, despite these patients providing compelling insights into awake cognition [4, 5]. Here, we sought to identify the contribution of the hippocampus to the sleep phenotype by characterizing sleep via comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analyses in memoryimpaired patients with selective bilateral hippocampal damage and matched control participants using inhome polysomnography on 4 nights. We found that, compared to control participants, patients had significantly reduced slow-wave sleep-likely due to decreased density of slow waves-as well as slow-wave activity. In contrast, slow and fast spindles were indistinguishable from those of control participants. Moreover, patients expressed slow oscillations (SOs), and SO-fast spindle coupling was observed. However, on closer scrutiny, we noted that the timing of spindles within the SO cycle was delayed in the patients. The shift of patients' spindles into the later phase of the up-state within the SO cycle may indicate a mismatch in timing across the SO-spindle-ripple events that are associated with memory consolidation [6, 7]. The substantial effect of selective bilateral hip-pocam pal damage on large-scale oscillatory activity in the cortex suggests that, as with awake cognition, the hippocampus plays a significant role in sleep physiology, which may, in turn, be necessary for efficacious episodic memory.

The synchronization of neural activity in the intracortical network is crucial for the regulation of movements. In certain motor diseases, such as dystonia, this synchrony can be altered in any node of the cerebello-cortical network. Questions remain about how the cerebellum influences the motor cortex and interhemispheric communication. This research aims to study the interhemispheric cortical communication between the motor cortices during dystonia, a neurological movement syndrome consisting of sustained or repetitive involuntary muscle contractions. We pharmacologically induced lateralized dystonia to adult male albino mice by administering low doses of kainic acid on the left cerebellar hemisphere. Using electrocorticography and electromyography, we investigated the power spectral densities, cortico-muscular, and interhemispheric coherence between the right and left motor cortices, before and during dystonia, for five consecutive days. Mice displayed lateralized abnormal motor signs, a reduced general locomotor activity, and a high score of dystonia. The results showed a progressive interhemispheric coherence decrease in low-frequency bands (delta, theta, beta) during the first 3 days. The cortico-muscular coherence of the affected side had a significant increase in gamma bands on days 3 and 4. In conclusion, lateralized cerebellar dysfunction during dystonia was associated with a loss of connectivity in the motor cortices, suggesting a possible cortical compensation to the initial disturbances induced by cerebellar left hemisphere kainate activation by blocking the propagation of abnormal oscillations to the healthy hemisphere. However, the cerebellum is part of several overly complex circuits, therefore other mechanisms can still be involved in this phenomenon.

Brain Activations and Functional Connectivity Patterns Associated with Insight-Based and Analytical Anagram Solving	BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES			English	Article						insight; Aha!-moment; fMRI; resting-state fMRI; functional connectivity; anagrams; creativity	CREATIVITY; PERFORMANCE; CLAUSTRUM; CORTEX; ORIGINS; PEOPLE; EEG; AHA	Insight is one of the most mysterious problem-solving phenomena involving the sudden emergence of a solution, often preceded by long unproductive attempts to find it. This seemingly unexplainable generation of the answer, together with the role attributed to insight in the advancement of science, technology and culture, stimulate active research interest in discovering its neuronal underpinnings. The present study employs functional Magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to probe and compare the brain activations occurring in the course of solving anagrams by insight or analytically, as judged by the subjects. A number of regions were activated in both strategies, including the left premotor cortex, left claustrum, and bilateral clusters in the precuneus and middle temporal gyrus. The activated areas span the majority of the clusters reported in a recent meta-analysis of insight-related fMRI studies. At the same time, the activation patterns were very similar between the insight and analytical solutions, with the only difference in the right sensorimotor region probably explainable by subject motion related to the study design. Additionally, we applied resting-state fMRI to study functional connectivity patterns correlated with the individual frequency of insight anagram solutions. Significant correlations were found for the seed-based connectivity of areas in the left premotor cortex, left claustrum, and left frontal eye field. The results stress the need for optimizing insight paradigms with respect to the accuracy and reliability of the subjective insight/analytical solution classification. Furthermore, the short-lived nature of the insight phenomenon makes it difficult to capture the associated neural events with the current experimental techniques and motivates complementing such studies by the investigation of the structural and functional brain features related to the individual differences in the frequency of insight-based decisions.

Long-term use of computers, mobile phones, and tablets can cause eye soreness and fatigue, but can also cause more serious conditions including myopia, cataracts, and glaucoma. This study assesses changes in brain wave activity detected by eight electrodes targeting different brain regions to identify and assess the brain wave patterns in the regions associated with visual fatigue under various visual presentation methods. Furthermore, linear discriminant analysis and Min-Max scaling techniques are applied to develop a visual fatigue assessment model to quantify visual fatigue. Finally, experiments are run to assess the impact of screen size (smartphone, tablet, computer) and visual presentation mode (2D, 3D, AR, VR) on visual fatigue. This study finds that (1) the brain wave features which influence the reaction to 2D and 3D imaging are the delta and theta waves at the prefrontal Fp1 and Fp2 poles. When viewing AR images, the alpha bands at the O1 and O2 poles of the occipital lobe show a relatively clear impact, while the delta and theta waves at the C3 pole in the left center area are associated with VR images; (2) larger screens cause greater visual fatigue, indicating that excessive visual stimulation will increase visual loading and thus produce greater visual fatigue; (3) the results show that VR can cause quite severe visual fatigue, along with motion sickness passed on sensory mismatch. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid viewing experiences that are inconsistent with the brain's physiological experience, such as walking while viewing a mobile phone, or reading in a moving car. The proposed visual fatigue assessment model provides easy and objective quantification of visual fatigue indicators, contributing to the reduction of risk for eye injury and disease.

Our goal was to provide an overview of a series of determining neurophysiological findings including neural source reconstruction data on distinct executive control processes and sub-processes involved in the Stroop task. Consistently, a fronto-central N2 component is found to reflect conflict monitoring processes, with its main neural generator being the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Then, for cognitive control tasks that involve a linguistic component like the Stroop task, the N2 is followed by a centro-posterior N400 and subsequently a late sustained potential (LSP). The N400 is mainly generated by the ACC and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and is thought to reflect interference suppression, whereas the LSP plausibly reflects conflict resolution processes. The present overview shows that ERP constitute a reliable methodological tool for tracing with precision the time course of different executive processes and sub-processes involved in experimental tasks involving a cognitive conflict. Future research should shed light on the fine-grained mechanisms of control respectively involved in linguistic and non-linguistic tasks.

A recently proposed theory that attempts to account for these symptoms, states that autistic individuals have a decreased ability to anticipate upcoming sensory stimulation due to overly precise internal prediction models. Here, we tested this hypothesis by comparing the electrophysiological markers of prediction errors in auditory prediction by vision between a group of autistic individuals and a group of age-matched individuals with typical development. Between-group differences in prediction error signaling were assessed by comparing event-related potentials evoked by unexpected auditory omissions in a sequence of audiovisual recordings of a handclap in which the visual motion reliably predicted the onset and content of the sound. Unexpected auditory omissions induced anincreasedearly negative omission response in the autism spectrum disorder group, indicating that violations of the prediction model produced larger prediction errors in the autism spectrum disorder group compared to the typical development group. The current results show that autistic individuals have alterations in visual-auditory predictive coding, and support the notion of impaired predictive coding as a core deficit underlying atypical sensory perception in autism spectrum disorder. Lay abstract Many autistic individuals experience difficulties in processing sensory information (e.g. increased sensitivity to sound). Here we show that these difficulties may be related to an inability to process unexpected sensory stimulation. In this study, 29 older adolescents and young adults with autism and 29 age-matched individuals with typical development participated in an electroencephalography study. The electroencephalography study measured the participants' brain activity during unexpected silences in a sequence of videos of a handclap. The results showed that the brain activity of autistic individuals during these silences was increased compared to individuals with typical development. This increased activity indicates that autistic individuals may have difficulties in processing unexpected incoming sensory information, and might explain why autistic individuals are often overwhelmed by sensory stimulation. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the different sensory perception experienced by autistic individuals.

Differentiation of epileptic regions from voluntary high-gamma activation via interictal cross-frequency windowed power-power correlation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						epilepsy; interictal; resection; high-frequency oscillation; cross-frequency; spike detection	FAST RIPPLES; TEMPORAL-LOBE; OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; EEG; SYNCHRONY; PATTERNS; AREAS; PHASE; HZ	OBJECTIVE Electrocorticography is an indispensable tool in identifying the epileptogenic zone in the presurgical evaluation of many epilepsy patients. Traditional electrocorticographic features (spikes, ictal onset changes, and recently high-frequency oscillations [ HFOs]) rely on the presence of transient features that occur within or near epileptogenic cortex. Here the authors report on a novel corticography feature of epileptogenic cortex-covariation of high-gamma and beta frequency band power profiles. Band-limited power was measured from each recording site based on native physiological signal differences without relying on clinical ictal or interictal epileptogenic features. In this preliminary analysis, frequency windowed power correlation appears to be a specific marker of the epileptogenic zone. The authors' overall aim was to validate this observation with the location of the eventual resection and outcome. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of 13 adult patients who had undergone electrocorticography for surgical planning at their center. They quantified the correlation of high-gamma (70-200 Hz) and beta (12-18 Hz) band frequency power per electrode site during a cognitive task. They used a sliding window method to correlate the power of smoothed, Hilbert-transformed high-gamma and beta bands. They then compared positive and negative correlations between power in the high-gamma and beta bands in the setting of a hand versus a tongue motor task as well as within the resting state. Significant positive correlations were compared to surgically resected areas and outcomes based on reviewed records. RESULTS Positive high-gamma and beta correlations appeared to predict the area of eventual resection and, preliminarily, surgical outcome independent of spike detection. In general, patients with the best outcomes had well-localized positive correlations (high-gamma and beta activities) to areas of eventual resection, while those with poorer outcomes displayed more diffuse patterns. CONCLUSIONS Data in this study suggest that positive high-gamma and beta correlations independent of any behavioral metric may have clinical applicability in surgical decision-making. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical potential of this methodology. Additional work is also needed to relate these results to other methods, such as HFO detection or connectivity with other cortical areas.

J	Ersoz, EK; Modolo, J; Bartolomei, F; Wendling, F				Koksal Ersoz, Elif; Modolo, Julien; Bartolomei, Fabrice; Wendling, Fabrice			Neural mass modeling of slow-fast dynamics of seizure initiation and abortion	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							SINGULAR PERTURBATION-THEORY; HIGH-FREQUENCY STIMULATION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; BRAIN-STIMULATION; ONSET PATTERNS; IN-VITRO; EPILEPSY; OSCILLATIONS; TRANSITION; DEPRESSION	Epilepsy is a dynamic and complex neurological disease affecting about 1% of the worldwide population, among which 30% of the patients are drug-resistant. Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent episodes of paroxysmal neural discharges (the so-called seizures), which manifest themselves through a large-amplitude rhythmic activity observed in depth-EEG recordings, in particular in local field potentials (LFPs). The signature characterizing the transition to seizures involves complex oscillatory patterns, which could serve as a marker to prevent seizure initiation by triggering appropriate therapeutic neurostimulation methods. To investigate such protocols, neurophysiological lumped-parameter models at the mesoscopic scale, namely neural mass models, are powerful tools that not only mimic the LFP signals but also give insights on the neural mechanisms related to different stages of seizures. Here, we analyze the multiple time-scale dynamics of a neural mass model and explain the underlying structure of the complex oscillations observed before seizure initiation. We investigate population-specific effects of the stimulation and the dependence of stimulation parameters on synaptic timescales. In particular, we show that intermediate stimulation frequencies (>20 Hz) can abort seizures if the timescale difference is pronounced. Those results have the potential in the design of therapeutic brain stimulation protocols based on the neurophysiological properties of tissue. Author summary Epilepsy is a complex disease affecting 1% of the worldwide population of which 30% of the patients are drug-resistant and seeking for alternative therapeutic methods, such as neurostimulation. Epileptic seizures can be hallmarked by preceding pre-ictal phases which are a possible window of opportunity to trigger electrical stimulation with the objective to prevent seizure initiation. Biophysiological models are an appropriate framework to understand underlying dynamics and transitions between different epileptogenic phases. In this study, we consider a typical pre-ictal regime with complex bursting-type oscillations, which can be accurately reproduced by a neural mass model. By analyzing the multiple time-scaled structure of the model, we identify the key role of the subpopulations of GABAergic interneurons. We show that appropriate brain stimulation targeting GABAergic interneurons is able to abort pre-ictal bursting, thus preventing seizures to develop.

Although concurrent changes in activity in visual regions suggest that zoom lens adjustments influence perceptual stages of processing, extant work has not distinguished between changes in the spatial selectivity of attention-driven neural activity and baseline shift of activity that can increase mean levels of activity without changes in selectivity. Here, we distinguished between these alternatives by measuring EEG activity in humans to track preparatory changes in alpha activity that indexed the precise topography of attention across the possible target positions. We observed increased spatial selectivity in alpha activity when observers voluntarily directed attention toward a narrower region of space, a pattern that was mirrored in target discrimination accuracy. Thus, alpha activity tracks both the centroid and spatial extent of covert spatial attention before the onset of the target display, lending support to the hypothesis that narrowing the zoom lens of attention shapes the initial encoding of sensory information.

A framework to quantify controlled directed interactions in network physiology applied to cognitive function assessment	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							GRANGER CAUSALITY; CROSS-CORRELATION; BRAIN-HEART; EEG; ATTENTION; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; ALERTNESS; VIGILANCE	The complex nature of physiological systems where multiple organs interact to form a network is complicated by direct and indirect interactions, with varying strength and direction of influence. This study proposes a novel framework which quantifies directional and pairwise couplings, while controlling for the effect of indirect interactions. Simulation results confirm the superiority of this framework in uncovering directional primary links compared to previous published methods. In a practical application of cognitive attention and alertness tasks, the method was used to assess controlled directed interactions between the cardiac, respiratory and brain activities (prefrontal cortex). It revealed increased interactions during the alertness task between brain wave activity on the left side of the brain with heart rate and respiration compared to resting phases. During the attention task, an increased number of right brain wave interactions involving respiration was also observed compared to rest, in addition to left brain wave activity with heart rate. The proposed framework potentially assesses directional interactions in complex network physiology and may detect cognitive dysfunctions associated with altered network physiology.

Recent studies have shown that a variety of inflammatory mediators play a key role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Ibuprofen (IBP) is a well-known anti-inflammatory agent that reduces the neuroinflammatory response and neuronal damage. In this study, we examined the effect of IBP in a rat model of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced chronic epilepsy. PTZ injection was given a total of 15 times on alternate days (over a period of 29 days) to induce epilepsy. The effects of IBP were evaluated by behavioral observation, EEG recording, Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and electrophysiological recording. The results showed that IBP alone affected the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and neuronal excitability but did not cause epilepsy. IBP reduced seizure scores in the PTZ-treated rats, and it minimized the loss of hippocampal neurons. In addition, IBP decreased the secretion of COX-2, inhibited the activation of the NOD-like receptor 3 inflammasome, and reduced the secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-18. Furthermore, the results of whole-cell patch-clamp revealed that IBP affected action potential properties, including frequency, latency and duration in epileptic rats, suggesting that it may impact neuronal excitability. These effects of IBP may underlie its antiepileptic and neuroprotective actions.

However, the temporal features of RS in human VTC are not well understood. To fill this gap in knowledge, we utilized the precise spatial localization and high temporal resolution of electrocorticography (ECoG) from nine human subjects implanted with intracranial electrodes in the VTC. The subjects viewed nonrepeated and repeated images of faces with long-lagged intervals and many intervening stimuli between repeats. We report three main findings: 1) robust RS occurs in VTC for activity in high-frequency broadband (HFB), but not lower-frequency bands; 2) RS of the HFB signal is associated with lower peak magnitude (PM), lower total responses, and earlier peak responses; and 3) RS effects occur early within initial stages of stimulus processing and persist for the entire stimulus duration. We discuss these findings in the context of early and late components of visual perception, as well as theoretical models of repetition suppression.

It is critical to study the neural signatures of timing prediction. Comparing to numerous studies focusing on the local brain area, less is known about how the timing prediction influences the functional and effective connectivity of the whole brain network. This study designed a double-tap task, in which the period before the first tap had no timing prediction (NTP), while that of the second tap was influenced by timing prediction (TP). Twelve subjects participated in this study. The functional connectivity was measured by an undirected network constructed by phase-lag index (PLI), while the effective connectivity was measured by a directed network constructed by partial directed coherence (PDC). By comparing the connection strength and modes between NTP and TP, it's found that in alpha-band, timing prediction could improve the global efficiency and transitivity of PLI networks, and shift the in-degree center of PDC networks from frontal area to parieto-occipital area. These results could provide neural evidence for the modeling of timing prediction.

Current analysis on cross-frequency coupling (CFC) feature is mostly based on extracting the strength of coupling but not coupling patterns in frequency-frequency domain. In this paper, we proposed a method for identifying epileptogenic tissue using convolutional neural networks (CNN) based on CFC pattern. Stereo-electroencephalograph (SEEG) from six patients with intractable epilepsy were used in this analysis. First, modulation indexes (MIs) were calculated using a moving window for each channel across seizures. Then those MIs were marked as inside epileptogenic zone (EZ) or outside EZ based on the surgical resection area. CNN was trained by those two-dimensional coupling patterns and tested by leave-one-out method. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was further generated. The results showed that average area-under-curve (AUC) performance reached 0.88. The sensitivity was 0.81, and the specificity was 0.79. Those results suggest that the CFC pattern can be used to identify SEEG channels in the epileptogenic region using the CNN.

During speech perception, formal and temporal predictions may be made for phonotactic probability and syllable stress patterns, respectively, contributing to the efficient processing of speech input. The current experiment employed a passive EEG oddball paradigm to probe the neurophysiological processes underlying temporal and formal predictions simultaneously. The component of interest, the mismatch negativity (MMN), is considered a marker for experience-dependent change detection, where its timing and amplitude are indicative of the perceptual system's sensitivity to presented stimuli. We hypothesized that more predictable stimuli (i.e. high phonotactic probability and first syllable stress) would facilitate change detection, indexed by shorter peak latencies or greater peak amplitudes of the MMN. This hypothesis was confirmed for phonotactic probability: high phonotactic probability deviants elicited an earlier MMN than low phonotactic probability deviants. We do not observe a significant modulation of the MMN to variations in syllable stress. Our findings confirm that speech perception is shaped by formal and temporal predictability. This paradigm may be useful to investigate the contribution of implicit processing of statistical regularities during (a)typical language development.

One perspective is that distractor inhibition is under similar voluntary control as attentional facilitation of target processing. However, a rapidly growing body of research shows that distractor inhibition often relies on prior experience with the distracting information or other mechanisms that need not rely on active representation in working memory. Yet, how and when these different forms of inhibition are neurally implemented remains largely unclear. Here, we review findings from recent behavioral and neuroimaging studies to address this outstanding question. We specifically explore how experience with distracting information may change the processing of that information in the context of current predictive processing views of perception: by modulating a distractor's representation already in anticipation of the distractor, or after integration of top-down and bottom-up sensory signals. We also outline directions for future research necessary to enhance our understanding of how the brain filters out distracting information.

The present exploratory study used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate electrophysiological intrinsic connectivity differences between healthy volunteers and unmedicated participants with treatment-resistant MDD. The study examined canonical frequency bands from delta through gamma. In addition to group comparisons, correlational studies were conducted to determine whether connectivity was related to five symptom factors: depressed mood, tension, negative cognition, suicidal thoughts, and amotivation. The MDD and healthy volunteer groups did not differ significantly at baseline when corrected across all frequencies and clusters, although evidence of generalized slowing in MDD was observed. Notably, however, electrophysiological connectivity was strongly related to suicidal thoughts, particularly as coupling of low frequency power fluctuations (delta and theta) with alpha and beta power. This analysis revealed hub areas underlying this symptom cluster, including left hippocampus, left anterior insula, and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. No other symptom cluster demonstrated a relationship with neurophysiological connectivity, suggesting a specificity to these results as markers of suicidal ideation.

Prevailing theories of tDCS focus on modulation of excitation-inhibition balance at the local stimulation location. However, network level effects are reported as well, and appear to depend upon differential underlying mechanisms. Here, we evaluated potential network-level effects of tDCS during the Serial Reaction Time Task (SRTT) using convergent EEG- and fMRI-based connectivity approaches. Motor learning manifested as a significant (p<.0001) shift from slow to fast responses and corresponded to a significant increase in beta-coherence (p<.0001) and fMRI connectivity (p<.01) particularly within the visual-motor pathway. Differential patterns of tDCS effect were observed within different parametric task versions, consistent with network models. Overall, these findings demonstrate objective physiological effects of tDCS at the network level that result in effective behavioral modulation when tDCS parameters are matched to network-level requirements of the underlying task.

However, our understanding of delta-beta coupling has been limited to group-level comparisons, which provide limited information about an individual's neural dynamics. Methods The present study used multilevel modeling to map second-by-second coupling patterns between delta and beta power. Specifically, we examined how inter- and intraindividual delta-beta coupling patterns changed as a function of social anxiety symptoms and temperamental behavioral inhibition (BI). Results We found that stronger inter- and intraindividual delta-beta coupling were both associated with social anxiety. In contrast, the high-BI group showed weaker coupling relative to the non-BI group, a pattern that did not emerge when analyzing continuous scores of BI. Conclusions In characterizing inter- and intraindividual coupling across the sample, we illustrate the utility of examining neural processes across levels of analysis in relation to psychopathology to create multilevel assessments of functioning and risk.

Overall arousal level can determine the amount of processing capacity required for attention allocation. Music evokes strong emotions and regulates arousability. Music has been used to modulate P300, especially in normals. This exploratory study examined the effect of music listening on the amplitude and latency of P300 in SZ patients. EEG/ERP was recorded (32-channels) while SZ patients (n = 20; 18-45 years) performed an auditory oddball P300 task after the eyes-dosed rest condition (Condition-A) and ten-minute music listening condition (Condition-B) as per the complete counterbalancing design (AB-BA). Patients listened to the researcher chosen, instru-mental presentation of raag-Bhoopali in the North-Indian-Classical-Music, for ten-minutes. All patients rated the music excerpt as a relaxing and positively valenced. A significant increase in accuracy score and reaction time during the oddball task after music listening was noted. There was an increase in amplitude at TP7. A trend of increased amplitude was noted across all electrodes in the music condition compared to the rest condition. Mean amplitude in an apriori defined time window of interest (250 to 750 ms) showed significant changes in the frontal and central electrode sites. Power spectral analysis indicated a slight increase in frontal and central alpha and theta activity during music listening. However, this was not statistically significant. Findings add further impetus to examine the effect of music in chronic psychiatric conditions. Need for systematic studies on a larger cohort is underscored. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the physiology of ketamine is complex due to its rich pharmacology with multiple potential sites at clinically relevant doses. In this review of the neurophysiology of ketamine, we focus on the acute effects of ketamine in the resting brain. We ascend through spatial scales starting with a complete review of the pharmacology of ketamine and then cover its effects on in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology. We then summarise and critically evaluate studies using EEG/MEG and neuroimaging measures (MRI and PET), integrating across scales where possible. While a complicated and, at times, confusing picture of ketamine's effects are revealed, we stress that much of this might be caused by use of different species, doses, and analytical methodologies and suggest strategies that future work could use to answer these problems.

However, the functional brain network underlying recurrent epileptic seizures is still left unveiled. This study is aimed at exploring the differences in a related brain activity before and after chronic repetitive seizures by investigating the power spectral density (PSD), fuzzy entropy, and functional connectivity in epileptic patients. The PSD analysis revealed differences between the two states at local area, showing postseizure energy accumulation. Besides, the fuzzy entropies of preseizure in the frontal, central, and temporal regions are higher than that of postseizure. Additionally, attenuated long-range connectivity and enhanced local connectivity were also found. Moreover, significant correlations were found between network metrics (i.e., characteristic path length and clustering coefficient) and individual seizure number. The PSD, fuzzy entropy, and network analysis may indicate that the brain is gradually impaired along with the occurrence of epilepsy, and the accumulated effect of brain impairment is observed in individuals with consecutive epileptic bursts. The findings of this study may provide helpful insights into understanding the network mechanism underlying chronic recurrent epilepsy.

Importantly, slow waves behave as traveling waves, and their propagation is assumed to occur through cortico-cortical white matter connections. In this light, the corpus callosum (CC) may represent the main responsible for cross-hemispheric slow-wave propagation. To verify this hypothesis, we performed overnight high-density (hd)-EEG recordings in five patients who underwent total callosotomy due to drug-resistant epilepsy (CPs; two females), in three noncallosotomized neurologic patients (NPs; two females), and in a sample of 24 healthy adult subjects (HSs; 13 females). In all CPs slow waves displayed a significantly reduced probability of cross-hemispheric propagation and a stronger interhemispheric asymmetry. In both CPs and HSs, the incidence of large slow waves within individual NREM epochs tended to differ across hemispheres, with a relative overall predominance of the right over the left hemisphere. The absolute magnitude of this asymmetry was greater in CPs relative to HSs. However, the CC resection had no significant effects on the distribution of slow-wave origin probability across hemispheres. The present results indicate that CC integrity is essential for the cross-hemispheric traveling of slow waves in human sleep, which is in line with the assumption of a direct relationship between white matter integrity and slow-wave propagation. Our findings also revealed a residual cross-hemispheric slow-wave propagation that may rely on alternative pathways, including cortico-subcortico-cortical loops. Finally, these data indicate that the lack of the CC does not lead to differences in slow-wave generation across brain hemispheres.

Regardless of the astounding progression as of late, conventional neural modulating system is still incapable to achieve the desired chronic in vivo implantation. The real constraint emerges from mechanical and physical differences between implants and brain tissue that initiates an inflammatory reaction and glial scar formation that reduces the recording and stimulation quality. Furthermore, traditional strategies consisting of rigid and tethered neural devices cause substantial tissue damage and impede the natural behavior of an animal, thus hindering chronic in vivo measurements. Therefore, enabling fully implantable neural devices requires biocompatibility, wireless power/data capability, biointegration using thin and flexible electronics, and chronic recording properties. This article reviews biocompatibility and design approaches for developing biointegrated and wirelessly powered implantable neural devices in animals aimed at long-term neural interfacing and outlines current challenges toward developing the next generation of implantable neural devices.

However, concerns remain whether synchronizability is a stable state in the brain networks. If so, which index can best reveal the synchronizability in brain networks? To answer these questions, we tested the application of the spectral graph theory and the Shannon entropy as alternative approaches in neuroimaging. We specifically tested the alpha rhythm in the resting-state eye closed (rsEC) and the resting-state eye open (rsEO) conditions, a well-studied classical example of synchrony in neuroimaging EEG. Since the synchronizability of alpha rhythm is more stable during the rsEC than the rsEO, we hypothesized that our suggested spectral graph theory indices (as reliable measures to interpret the synchronizability of brain signals) should exhibit higher values in the rsEC than the rsEO condition. We performed two separate analyses of two different datasets (as elementary and confirmatory studies). Based on the results of both studies and in agreement with our hypothesis, the spectral graph indices revealed higher stability of synchronizability in the rsEC condition. The k-mean analysis indicated that the spectral graph indices can distinguish the rsEC and rsEO conditions by considering the synchronizability of brain networks. We also computed correlations among the spectral indices, the Shannon entropy, and the topological indices of brain networks, as well as random networks. Correlation analysis indicated that although the spectral and the topological properties of random networks are completely independent, these features are significantly correlated with each other in brain networks. Furthermore, we found that complexity in the investigated brain networks is inversely related to the stability of synchronizability. In conclusion, we revealed that the spectral graph theory approach can be reliably applied to study the stability of synchronizability of state-related brain networks.

The higher the theta/beta ratio, the lower the level of central nervous system (CNS) cortical arousal. However, there is seldom evidence between electroencephalograms (EEGs) and the patient's intentionality to regulate the cortical activity of executive attention tasks. We investigated whether children with ADHD intended to improve their performance in executive attention tasks and whether that increased their brain activity. Fifty-one children with ADHD (ADHD) and 51 typical developing (TD) children were investigated using focused attention (FA) and search attention (SA) tasks and a simultaneous EEG. The children were then regrouped as faster (ADHD-F, TD-F) and slower (ADHD-S, TD-S) depending on reaction time (RT). Quantitative EEGs of frontal lobe theta and beta activity at frontal F3, F4, and Fz were used. Twenty-eight (54.9%) ADHD children were regrouped as ADHD-S and 14 (27.5%) as TD-S. The ADHD-S group, however, had poorer FA and SA performance than the other 3 groups did: fewer correct answers, more frequent impulsive and missing errors, and higher RT variations. There were no significant differences in theta activity, but the TD-S group had higher beta activity than the ADHD-S group did. We conclude that the ADHD-F and ADHD-S groups had different attention processes. beta activity did not increase in the ADHD-S group, and their executive attention performance in the FA and SA tests was poor. It seems ADHD-S had poor meta-intention function. The frontal beta activity might be a feasible training target of neurofeedback in ADHD-S patients.

Homeostatic regulation of synaptic strength is essential for the maintenance of brain functions and involves both cell-autonomous and system-level processes such as sleep. We examined the contribution of Fxr1 to cell-autonomous homeostatic synaptic scaling and neuronal responses to sleep loss, using a combination of gene overexpression and Crispr/Cas9-mediated somatic knockouts to modulate gene expression. Our findings indicate that Fxr1 is downregulated during both scaling and sleep deprivation via a glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta)-dependent mechanism. In both conditions, downregulation of Fxr1 is essential for the homeostatic modulation of surface AMPA receptors and synaptic strength. Preventing the downregulation of Fxr1 during sleep deprivation results in altered EEG signatures. Furthermore, sequencing of neuronal translatomes revealed the contribution of Fxr1 to changes induced by sleep deprivation. These findings uncover a role of Fxr1 as a shared signaling hub between cell-autonomous homeostatic plasticity and system-level responses to sleep loss, with potential implications for neuropsychiatric illnesses and treatments.

We hypothesized that these images would reveal responses akin to cognitive conflict resulting from incongruent trials in typical laboratory tasks (i.e., Stroop Task). Indeed, in many surrealistic images, common visual elements are juxtaposed to create un-ordinary associations with semantically conflicting representations. We expected that these images engage the conflict processing network that has been described in cognitive neuroscience theories. We addressed this hypothesis by measuring the power of mid-frontal Theta oscillations using EEG while participants watched images through a social media-like interface. Incongruent images, compared to controls, produced a significant Theta power increase, as predicted from the cognitive conflict theory. We also found increased memory for incongruent images one week after exposure, compared to the controls. These findings provide evidence for the incongruent images to effectively engage the viewer's cognitive control and boost memorability. The results of this study provide validation of cognitive theories in real-life scenarios (i.e., surrealistic ads or art) and offer insights regarding the use of neural correlates as effectiveness metrics in advertising.

Less study has focused on exploring the neural correlates of the memory retrieval of scientific concepts when presented in word and picture modalities. Fewer studies have investigated the differences in the involved brain regions and how the brain dynamics in these regions would associate with the accuracy of the memory retrieval process. Therefore, this study specifically focused on investigating the human brain dynamics of participants when they retrieve physics concepts in word vs. pictorial modalities, and whether electroencephalogram (EEG) activities can predict the correctness of the retrieval of physics concepts. The results indicated that word modality induced a significant stronger right frontal theta augmentation than pictorial modality during the physics concepts retrieval process, whereas the picture modality induced a significantly greater right parietal alpha suppression than the word modality throughout the retrieval process spurred by the physics concept presentations. In addition, greater frontal midline theta augmentation was observed for incorrect responses than the correct responses during retrieve physics concepts. Moreover, the frontal midline theta power has greater negative predictive power for predicting the accuracy of physics concepts retrieval. In summary, the participants were more likely to retrieve physics concepts correctly if a lower amount of theta were allocated during the maintaining period from 2,000 ms through 3,500 ms before making responses. It provides insight for our future application of brain computer interface (BCI) in real-time science learning. This study implies that the lower frontal midline theta power is associated with a lower degree of cognitive control and active maintenance of representations as participants approach a correct answer.

Several MEG analysis toolboxes include an implementation of a linearly constrained minimum-variance (LCMV) beamformer. However, differences in implementations and in their results complicate the selection and application of beamformers and may hinder their wider adoption in research and clinical use. Additionally, combinations of different MEG sensor types (such as magnetometers and planar gradiometers) and application of preprocessing methods for interference suppression, such as signal space separation (SSS), can affect the results in different ways for different implementations. So far, a systematic evaluation of the different implementations has not been performed. Here, we compared the localization performance of the LCMV beamformer pipelines in four widely used open-source toolboxes (MNE-Python, FieldTrip, DAiSS (SPM12), and Brainstorm) using datasets both with and without SSS interference suppression. We analyzed MEG data that were i) simulated, ii) recorded from a static and moving phantom, and iii) recorded from a healthy volunteer receiving auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimulation. We also investigated the effects of SSS and the combination of the magnetometer and gradiometer signals. We quantified how localization error and point-spread volume vary with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in all four toolboxes. When applied carefully to MEG data with a typical SNR (3-15 dB), all four toolboxes localized the sources reliably; however, they differed in their sensitivity to preprocessing parameters. As expected, localizations were highly unreliable at very low SNR, but we found high localization error also at very high SNRs for the first three toolboxes while Brainstorm showed greater robustness but with lower spatial resolution. We also found that the SNR improvement offered by SSS led to more accurate localization.

Recent evidence has shown that feedforward volleys carrying incoming visual information induce high-frequency (gamma) oscillations in the visual cortex, while feedback volleys arriving from higher order brain areas induce oscillatory activity at lower frequencies (theta/alpha/low beta). We investigated visually induced high (feedforward) and low (feedback) frequency activations in healthy subjects and various migraine patients. Visual evoked potentials from 20 healthy controls and 70 migraine patients (30 interictal and 20 ictal episodic migraineurs, 20 chronic migraineurs) were analyzed in the frequency domain. We compared power in the theta-alpha-low beta and gamma range between groups, and searched for correlations between the low-to-high frequency activity ratio and number of monthly headache and migraine days. Compared to healthy controls, interictal migraine patients had increased visually induced low frequency (feedback) activity. Conversely, ictal and chronic migraine patients showed an augmented gamma band (feedforward) power. The low-frequency-to-gamma (feed back/feedforward) activity ratio correlated negatively with monthly headache days and tended to do so with migraine days. Our findings show that visual processing is differentially altered depending on migraine cycle and type. Feedback control from higher order cortical areas predominates interictally in episodic migraine while migraine attacks and chronic migraine are associated with enhanced incoming afferent activity, confirming their similar electrophysiological profile. The presence of headache is associated with proportionally higher gamma (feedforward) activities. Perspective: This study provides an insight into the pathophysiology of migraine headache from the perspective of cortical sensory processing dynamics. Patients with migraine present alterations in feedback and feedforward visual signaling that differ with the presence of headache. (C) 2020 U.S. Association for the Study of Pain.

However, previous studies on tactile stimulation mainly focused on the effects of superficial tactile stimulation on the motor cortex, but the role of deep tactile feedback stimulation in motor tasks is not clear. Corticomuscular coherence (CMC) is an effective method for studying dynamic motion tasks. Recent evidence suggests that CMC is enhanced by tactile stimulation in the beta-band. But, the mechanism of tactile stimulation in dynamic motor tasks is still undetermined. In order to explore the role of tactile stimulation in dynamic motion tasks, we examined the correlation between EEG/EMG in a motor task with tactile stimulus input, including the corticomuscular coherence and the causal connections (convergent cross mapping, CCM). In this study, seventeen subjects were recruited to complete stimuli and non-stimuli motor tasks. After the experiment, the time-frequency analysis of CMC showed that the somatosensory association cortex was clearly involved in the dynamic motor tasks. During the contraction of hand muscles, the activity of CMC was concentrated in gamma band, while in the maintenance process, it was concentrated in beta-band. After eliminating the distractors of attention, we did not find a similar result as previous studies had found-tactile stimuli lead to increased CMC activity in gamma band. On the contrary, CCM causality analysis showed that tactile stimulation could significantly enhance the connection between the cerebral cortex and a muscle. We speculate that tactile stimulation can enhance the corticomuscular causal relationship, and that the effect of tactile stimulation on corticomuscular coherence may have more complex mechanisms. This study provides new insights into neural mechanism of tactile feedback and provides more information about the causality of brain networks in tactile feedback task.

Pathophysiology of functional connectivity can be measured through network activity of alpha oscillations, reflecting long-range communication between distal brain regions. METHODS: Resting magnetoencephalographic activity was collected from 31 individuals with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum psychosis and 22 healthy control individuals. Activity was projected to the realistic cortical surface, based on structural magnetic resonance imaging. The first principal component of activity in 40 Brodmann areas per hemisphere was Hilbert transformed within the alpha range. Non-negative matrix factorization was applied to single-trial alpha phase-locking values from all subjects to determine alpha networks. Within networks, energy and entropy were compared. RESULTS: Four cortical alpha networks were pathological in individuals with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum psychosis. The networks involved the bilateral anterior and posterior cingulate; left auditory, medial temporal, and cingulate cortex; right inferior frontal gyrus and widespread areas; and right posterior parietal cortex and widespread areas. Energy and entropy were associated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total and thought disorder factors for the first three networks. In addition, the left posterior temporal network was associated with positive and negative factors, and the right inferior frontal network was associated with the positive factor. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning network analysis of resting alpha-band neural activity identified several aberrant networks in individuals with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum psychosis, including the left temporal, right inferior frontal, right posterior parietal, and bilateral cingulate cortices. Abnormal long-range alpha communication is evident at the first presentation for psychosis and may provide clues about mechanisms of dysconnectivity in psychosis and novel targets for noninvasive brain stimulation.

Three complementary data sets are used: obstructive sleep apnea (20), healthy subjects (11), and high loop gain sleep apnea (50). We use polysomnography (PSG) with beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring, and electrocardiogram (ECG)-derived cardiopulmonary coupling (CPC) analysis to demonstrate a bimodal, rather than graded, characteristic of NREM sleep. Stable NREM (NREMS) is characterized by high probability of occurrence of the <1 Hz slow oscillation, high delta power, stable breathing, blood pressure dipping, strong sinus arrhythmia and vagal dominance, and high frequency CPC. Conversely, unstable NREM (NREMUS) has the opposite features: a fragmented and discontinuous <1 Hz slow oscillation, non-dipping of blood pressure, unstable respiration, cyclic variation in heart rate, and low frequency CPC. The dimension of NREM stability raises the possibility of a comprehensive integrated multicomponent network model of NREM sleep which captures sleep onset (e.g., ventrolateral preoptic area-based sleep switch) processes, synaptic homeostatic delta power kinetics, and the interaction of global and local sleep processes as reflected in the spatiotemporal evolution of cortical "UP" and "DOWN" states, while incorporating the complex dynamics of autonomic-respiratory-hemodynamic systems during sleep. Bimodality of REM sleep is harder to discern in health. However, individuals with combined obstructive and central sleep apnea allows ready recognition of REMS and REMUS (stable and unstable REM sleep, respectively), especially when there is a discordance of respiratory patterns in relation to conventional stage of sleep.

It is yet unclear to what extent JME leads to abnormal network activation patterns. Here, we characterized statistical regularities in magnetoencephalograph (MEG) resting-state networks and their differences between JME patients and controls by combining a pairwise maximum entropy model (pMEM) and novel energy landscape analyses for MEG. First, we fitted the pMEM to the MEG oscillatory power in the front-oparietal network (FPN) and other resting-state networks, which provided a good estimation of the occurrence probability of network states. Then, we used energy values derived from the pMEM to depict an energy landscape, with a higher energy state corresponding to a lower occurrence probability. JME patients showed fewer local energy minima than controls and had elevated energy values for the FPN within the theta, beta, and gamma bands. Furthermore, simulations of the fitted pMEM showed that the proportion of time the FPN was occupied within the basins of energy minima was shortened in JME patients. These network alterations were highlighted by significant classification of individual participants employing energy values as multivariate features. Our findings suggested that JME patients had altered multistability in selective functional networks and frequency bands in the fronto-parietal cortices. Author SummaryWe proposed an energy landscape method to quantify the occurrence probability of network states in magneto eucephalogram (MEG) oscillatory power during rest, which was derived from a pairwise maximum entropy model (pMEM). We compared the energy landscapes measures of three resting-state networks between patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) and healthy controls. The pMEM provided a good fit to the binarized MEG oscillatory power in both patients and controls. Patients with JME exhibited fewer local minima of the energy and elevated energy values than controls, predominately in the fronto-parietal network across multiple frequency bands. Furthermore, multivariate features constructed from energy landscapes allowed significant single-patient classification. Our results further highlighted the pMEM as a descriptive, generative, and predictive model for characterizing atypical functional network properties in brain disorders.

Polysomnography (PSG) is used to detect SA. This paper conducts feature selection from PSG signals and uses a support vector machine (SVM) to detect SA. To analyze SA, the Physionet Apnea Database was used to obtain various features. Electrocardiography (ECG), oxygen saturation (SaO(2)), airflow, abdominal, and thoracic signals were used to provide various frequency-, time-domain and non-linear features (n = 87). To analyse the significance of these features, firstly, two evaluation measures, the rank-sum method and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to evaluate the significance of the features. These features were then classified according to their significance. Finally, different class feature sets were presented as inputs for an SVM classifier to detect the onset of SA. The hill-climbing feature selection algorithm and the k-fold cross-validation method were applied to evaluate each classification performance. Through the experiments, we discovered that the best feature set (including the top-five significant features) obtained the best classification performance. Furthermore, we plotted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to examine the performance of the SVM, and the results showed the SVM with Linear kernel (regularization parameter = 1) outperformed other classifiers (area under curve = 95.23%, sensitivity = 94.29%, specificity = 96.17%). The results confirm that feature subsets based on multiple bio-signals have the potential to identify patients with SA. The use of a smaller subset avoids dimensionality problems and reduces the computational load.

Postural changes imposed by balance perturbations elicit a robust negative potential (N1) and a brisk increase of theta activity in the electroencephalogram recorded over midfrontal scalp areas. Because action monitoring is a cognitive function proposed to detect errors and initiate corrective adjustments, we hypothesized that the possible cortical markers of action monitoring during balance control (N1 potential and theta rhythm) scale with perturbation intensity and the eventual execution of reactive stepping responses (as opposed to feet-in-place responses). We recorded high-density electroencephalogram from eleven young individuals, who participated in an experimental balance assessment. The participants were asked to recover balance following anteroposterior translations of the support surface at various intensities, while attempting to maintain both feet in place. We estimated source-resolved cortical activity using independent component analysis. Combining time-frequency decomposition and group-level general linear modeling of single-trial responses, we found a significant relation of the interaction between perturbation intensity and stepping responses with multiple cortical features from the midfrontal cortex, including the N1 potential, and theta, alpha, and beta rhythms. Our findings suggest that the cortical responses to balance perturbations index the magnitude of a deviation from a stable postural state to predict the need for reactive stepping responses. We propose that the cortical control of balance may involve cognitive control mechanisms (i.e., action monitoring) that facilitate postural adjustments to maintain postural stability.

The early-filter theory proposes that these loops allow top-down filtering of early and middle latency auditory responses. Furthermore, the adaptive filtering model suggests that the filtering of irrelevant auditory stimuli should start lower in the pathway during more demanding tasks. If so, the 40-Hz auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) to irrelevant sounds should be affected by top-down crossmodal attention to a visual task, and effects should vary with the load of the visual task. Because few studies have examined this possibility, we conducted two preregistered studies that manipulated visual load (Study 1:N = 43, Study 2:N = 45). Study 1 used two levels (low and high), and Study 2 used four levels (no, low, high, and very high). Subjects were asked to ignore a 500-Hz task-irrelevant tone that was amplitude-modulated to evoke 40-Hz ASSRs. Results from Bayesian analyses provided moderate to extreme support for no effect of load (or of a task) on ASSRs. Results also supported no interaction with time (i.e., over blocks, over minutes, or with changes in ASSRs that were synchronized with the onset of the visual stimuli). Further, results provided moderate support for no correlation between the effects of load and working memory capacity. Because the present findings support the robustness of ASSRs against manipulations of crossmodal attention, they are not consistent with the adaptive filtering model.

Based on human and experimental data we propose that a sleep-related epileptic transformation of normal neurological networks underlies epileptogenesis. Major childhood epilepsies as medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), absence epilepsy (AE) and human perisylvian network (PN) epilepsies - made us good models to study. These conditions come from an epileptic transformation of the affected functional systems. This approach allows a system-based taxonomy instead of the outworn generalized-focal classification. MTLE links to the memory-system, where epileptic transformation results in a switch of normal sharp wave-ripples to epileptic spikes and pathological high frequency oscillations, compromising sleep-related memory consolidation. Absence epilepsy (AE) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) belong to the corticothalamic system. The burst-firing mode of NREM sleep normally producing sleep-spindles turns to an epileptic working mode ejecting bilateral synchronous spike-waves. There seems to be a progressive transition from AE to JME. Shared absences and similar bilateral synchronous discharges show the belonging of the two conditions, while the continuous age windows - AE affecting schoolchildren, JME the adolescents - and the increased excitability in JME compared to AE supports the notion of progression. In perisylvian network epilepsies - idiopathic focal childhood epilepsies and electrical status epilepticus in sleep including Landau-Kleffner syndrome - centrotemporal spikes turn epileptic, with the potential to cause cognitive impairment. Postinjury epilepsies modeled by the isolated cortex model highlight the shared way of epileptogenesis suggesting the derailment of NREM sleep-related homeostatic plasticity as a common step. NREM sleep provides templates for plasticity derailing to epileptic variants under proper conditions. This sleep-origin explains epileptiform discharges' link and similarity with NREM sleep slow oscillations, spindles and ripples. Normal synaptic plasticity erroneously overgrowing homeostatic processes may derail toward an epileptic working-mode manifesting the involved system's features. The impact of NREM sleep is unclear in epileptogenesis occurring in adolescence and adulthood, when plasticity is lower. The epileptic process interferes with homeostatic synaptic plasticity and may cause cognitive impairment. Its type and degree depends on the affected network's function. We hypothesize a vicious circle between sleep end epilepsy. The epileptic derailment of normal plasticity interferes with sleep cognitive functions. Sleep and epilepsy interconnect by the pathology of plasticity.

Individual alpha frequency modulates sleep-related emotional memory consolidation	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Individual alpha frequency; Sleep; Memory consolidation; Neuronal oscillations; Emotional memory		Alpha-band oscillatory activity is involved in modulating memory and attention. However, few studies have investigated individual differences in oscillatory activity during the encoding of emotional memory, particularly in sleep paradigms where sleep is thought to play an active role in memory consolidation. The current study aimed to address the question of whether individual alpha frequency (IAF) modulates the consolidation of declarative memory across periods of sleep and wake. 22 participants aged 18-41 years (mean age = 25.77) viewed 120 emotionally valenced images (positive, negative, neutral) and completed a baseline memory task before a 2hr afternoon sleep opportunity and an equivalent period of wake. Following the sleep and wake conditions, participants were required to distinguish between 120 learned (target) images and 120 new (distractor) images. This method allowed us to delineate the role of different oscillatory components of sleep and wake states in the emotional modulation of memory. Linear mixed-effects models revealed interactions between IAF, rapid eye movement sleep theta power, and slow-wave sleep slow oscillatory density on memory outcomes. These results highlight the importance of individual factors in the EEG in modulating oscillatory-related memory consolidation and subsequent behavioural outcomes and test predictions proposed by models of sleep-based memory consolidation.

Previous studies on sentence comprehension have found neural correlates of the predictability of a word given its context, as well as of the precision of such a prediction. However, they have focused on single sentences and on particular words in those sentences. Moreover, they compared neural responses to words with low and high predictability, as well as with low and high precision. However, in speech comprehension, a listener hears many successive words whose predictability and precision vary over a large range. Here, we show that cortical activity in different frequency bands tracks word surprisal in continuous natural speech and that this tracking is modulated by precision. We obtain these results through quantifying surprisal and precision from naturalistic speech using a deep neural network and through relating these speech features to EEG responses of human volunteers acquired during auditory story comprehension. We find significant cortical tracking of surprisal at low frequencies, including the delta band as well as in the higher frequency beta and gamma bands, and observe that the tracking is modulated by the precision. Our results pave the way to further investigate the neurobiology of natural speech comprehension.

Cerebellar Theta and Beta Noninvasive Stimulation Rhythms Differentially Influence Episodic Memory versus Semantic Prediction	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						beta frequency; EEG; episodic memory; language processing; theta frequency; transcranial magnetic stimulation	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; RECOGNITION MEMORY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BURST STIMULATION; NEURAL BASIS; LANGUAGE; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; NETWORKS	The human cerebellum is thought to interact with distributed brain networks to support cognitive abilities such as episodic memory and semantic prediction. Hippocampal and fronto-temporo-parietal networks that respectively support episodic memory versus semantic prediction have been associated with distinct endogenous oscillatory activity frequency bands: theta (similar to 3-8 Hz) versus beta (similar to 13-30Hz) respectively. We sought to test whether it is possible to toggle cerebellar participation in episodic memory versus semantic prediction by noninvasively stimulating with theta versus beta rhythmic transcranial magnetic stimulation. In human subjects of both sexes, cerebellar theta stimulation improved episodic memory encoding but did not influence neural signals of semantic prediction, whereas beta stimulation of the same cerebellar location increased neural signals of semantic prediction but did not influence episodic memory encoding. This constitutes evidence for double dissociation of cerebellar contributions to semantic prediction versus episodic memory based on stimulation rhythm, supporting the hypothesis that the cerebellum can be biased to support these distinct cognitive abilities at the command of network-specific rhythmic activity.

Onset of hippocampal network aberration and memory deficits in P301S tau mice are associated with an early gene signature	BRAIN			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; frontotemporal dementia; memory; tau; neurodegeneration	AMYLOID-BETA TOXICITY; FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA; MOUSE MODEL; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; TRANSGENIC MICE; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; AXONAL-TRANSPORT; EPISODIC MEMORY; SYNAPSE LOSS; PARKINSONISM	Hyperphosphorylation and deposition of tau in the brain characterizes frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Diseaseassociated mutations in the tau-encoding MAPT gene have enabled the generation of transgenic mouse models that recapitulate aspects of human neurodegenerative diseases, including tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle formation. Here, we characterized the effects of transgenic P301S mutant human tau expression on neuronal network function in the murine hippocampus. Onset of progressive spatial learning deficits in P301S tau transgenic TAU58/2 mice were paralleled by long-term potentiation deficits and neuronal network aberrations during electrophysiological and EEG recordings. Gene-expression profiling just prior to onset of apparent deficits in TAU58/2 mice revealed a signature of immediate early genes that is consistent with neuronal network hypersynchronicity. We found that the increased immediate early gene activity was confined to neurons harbouring tau pathology, providing a cellular link between aberrant tau and network dysfunction. Taken together, our data suggest that tau pathology drives neuronal network dysfunction through hyperexcitation of individual, pathology-harbouring neurons, thereby contributing to memory deficits.

While ballistic trajectories can be readily extrapolated, many natural and artificial systems are governed by more general nonlinear dynamics and, therefore, can produce highly irregular motion. Yet, relatively little is known regarding the behavioral and physiological underpinnings of prediction and tracking in the presence of chaos. Here, we investigated in lab settings whether participants could manually follow the orbit of a paradigmatic chaotic system, the Rossler equations, on the (x,y) plane under different settings of a control parameter, which determined the prominence of transients in the target position. Tracking accuracy was negatively related to the level of unpredictability and folding. Nevertheless, while participants initially reacted to the transients, they gradually learned to anticipate it. This was accompanied by a decrease in muscular co-contraction, alongside enhanced activity in the theta and beta EEG bands for the highest levels of chaoticity. Furthermore, greater phase synchronization of breathing was observed. Taken together, these findings point to the possible ability of the nervous system to implicitly learn topological regularities even in the context of highly irregular motion, reflecting in multiple observables at the physiological level.

The mechanism of action of this effect of zolpidem is of great research interest. In this case study, we use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate a fully conscious, ex-coma patient who suffered from neurological difficulties for a few years due to traumatic brain injury. For a few years after injury, the patient was under medication with zolpidem that drastically improved his symptoms. MEG recordings taken before and after zolpidem showed a reduction in power in the theta-alpha (4-12 Hz) and lower beta (15-20 Hz) frequency bands. An increase in power after zolpidem intake was found in the higher beta/lower gamma (20-43 Hz) frequency band. Source level functional connectivity measured using weighted-phase lag index showed changes after zolpidem intake. Stronger connectivity between left frontal and temporal brain regions was observed. We report that zolpidem induces a change in MEG resting power and functional connectivity in the patient. MEG is an informative and sensitive tool to detect changes in brain activity for TBI.

Yet, it is unknown how probability of rhythm violations affects the overall rhythm predictability. Another unresolved question is whether predictive processes are independent of attention processes. In this study, EEG was recorded while subjects listened to rhythmic sequences. Predictability was manipulated by changing the stimulus-onset-asynchrony (SOA deviants) for given tones in the rhythm. When SOA deviants were inserted rarely, predictability remained high, whereas predictability was lower with more frequent SOA deviants. Dichotic tone-presentation allowed for independent manipulation of attention, as specific tones of the rhythm were presented to separate ears. Attention was manipulated by instructing subjects to attend to tones in one ear only, while keeping the rhythmic structure of tones constant. The analyses of event-related potentials revealed an attenuated N1 for tones when rhythm predictability was high, while the N1 was enhanced by attention to tones. Bayesian statistics revealed no interaction between predictability and attention. A right-lateralization of attention effects, but not predictability effects, suggested potentially different cortical processes. This is the first study to show that probability of rhythm violation influences rhythm predictability, independent of attention.

J	Romao, M; Tierra-Criollo, CJ				Romao, Matheus; Tierra-Criollo, Carlos Julio			A bayesian approach to the spectral F-Test: Application to auditory steady-state responses	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Bayesian detection; Spectral F-test; Objective Response Detection; Auditory Steady-state Responses; Evoked Potentials	EVOKED-POTENTIALS; STIMULATION; COHERENCE; EEG	Background and Objective: Auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) represent an objective method used in clinical practice to assess hearing thresholds. The steady-state nature of these signals allows response detection by means of statistical techniques in the frequency domain as spectral F-test. This objective response detection (ORD) compares the power of the response bin against the power of the neighboring frequency noise bins. Most ORD algorithms are based on the Neyman-Pearson approach to the hypothesis test provided that the likelihood ratio test is the most powerful test for a given significance level alpha (also called Type I error). On the other hand, the Bayesian approach allows the inclusion of prior information in the model and enables the updating of this information with posterior knowledge. This approach, however, has not been explored with respect to ORD techniques, thus enabling the exploration of new paradigms, which may contribute to this field of study, especially in terms of the time required for response detection. The aim of this study is to use the Bayesian approach in the implementation of the spectral F-test for application to ASSRs. Methods: Monte Carlo simulations were performed to evaluate Neyman-Pearson and Bayesian detectors' performances with the spectral F-test as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio. Then, the two detectors were applied to ASSR recordings of nine normal-hearing individuals subjected to amplitude-modulated tones of various intensities. Results: Both simulation and ASSR data analyses showed that among the scenarios analyzed, the most promising case was that in which the lowest possible values for the a priori probability were selected for the null hypothesis (H0), allowing detection at low signal-to-noise ratios. The worst performance occurred when the a priori probabilities for both hypotheses were equal. The ASSR data also showed that higher stimulus intensity led to better performance and faster detection due to improvements in the signal-tonoise ratio. Conclusions: The a priori probabilities can affect the Bayesian detector's performance, directly impacting the time needed to identify responses. The parallel behaviors observed between the performances of both approaches showed that the Bayesian detector can achieve its ideal performance at lower signal-to-noise ratios compared to the optimal performance of the Neyman-Pearson detector, reflecting the promising applicability of the Bayesian approach to evoked potentials.

J	Galinsky, VL; Frank, LR				Galinsky, Vitaly L.; Frank, Lawrence R.			Universal theory of brain waves: From linear loops to nonlinear synchronized spiking and collective brain rhythms	PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH			English	Article							HIPPOCAMPAL THETA-RHYTHM; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; BIOLOGICAL TISSUES; DIFFUSION; OSCILLATIONS; TRANSMISSION; PROPAGATION; ANISOTROPY; IMPEDANCE; SPECTRUM	An inhomogeneous anisotropic physical model of the brain cortex is presented that predicts the emergence of nonevanescent (weakly damped) wavelike modes propagating in the thin cortex layers transverse to both the mean neural fiber direction and the cortex spatial gradient. Although the amplitude of these modes stays below the typically observed axon spiking potential, the lifetime of these modes may significantly exceed the spiking potential inverse decay constant. Full brain numerical simulations based on parameters extracted from diffusion and structural MRI confirm the existence and extended duration of these wave modes. Contrary to the standard paradigm that the neural fibers determine the pathways for signal propagation in the brain, the signal propagation due to the cortex wave modes in highly folded areas will exhibit no apparent correlation with the fiber directions. The results are consistent with numerous recent experimental animal and human brain studies demonstrating the existence of electrostatic field activity in the form of traveling waves (including studies where neuronal connections were severed) and with wave-loop-induced peaks observed in EEG spectra. In addition, we demonstrate that the resonant and nonresonant terms of the nonlinear coupling between multiple modes produce both synchronous spiking-like high-frequency wave activity as well as low-frequency wave rhythms as a result of their unique dispersion properties. Numerical simulation of forced multiple mode dynamics shows that as forcing increases there is a transition from a damped to an oscillatory regime that subsequently decays away as over-excitation is reached. The resonant nonlinear coupling results in the emergence of low-frequency rhythms with frequencies that are several orders of magnitude below the linear frequencies of modes taking part in the coupling. The localization and persistence of these cortical wave modes, and this mechanism of their collective input to the generation of synchronized spiking and low-frequency rhythms, have significant implications in particular for neuroimaging methods that detect electromagnetic physiological activity, such as EEG and MEG, and in general for the understanding of brain activity, including mechanisms of memory.

Abnormal cortical oscillatory activity may be a promising biomarker, encouraging non-invasive neurostimulation techniques as a treatment. We aimed to modulate abnormal slow cortical oscillations by delivering transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and physiotherapy to reduce pain and cognitive symptoms. This was a double-blinded, randomized, crossover trial conducted between February and September 2018 at the Rehabilitation Unit of a teaching Hospital (NCT03221413). Participants were randomly assigned to tACS or random noise stimulation (RNS), 5 days/week for 2 weeks followed by ad hoc physiotherapy. Clinical and cognitive assessments were performed at T-0 (baseline), T-1 (after stimulation), T-2 (1 month after stimulation). Electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral topographies recorded from 15 participants confirmed slow-rhythm prevalence and provided tACS tailored stimulation parameters and electrode sites. Following tACS, EEG alpha1 ([8-10] Hz) activity increased at T-1 (p = 0.024) compared to RNS, pain symptoms assessed by Visual Analog Scale decreased at T-1 (T-1 vs T(0)p = 0.010), self-reported cognitive skills and neuropsychological scores improved both at T-1 and T-2 (Patient-Reported Outcomes in Cognitive Impairment, T-0-T-2, p = 0.024; Everyday memory questionnaire, T-1 compared to RNS, p = 0.012; Montreal Cognitive Assessment, T-0 vs T-1, p = 0.048 and T-0 vs T-2, p = 0.009; Trail Making Test B T-0-T-2, p = 0.034). Psychopathological scales and other neuropsychological scores (Trail Making Test-A; Total Phonemic Fluency; Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised; Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure) improved both after tACS and RNS but earlier improvements (T-1) were registered only after tACS. These results support tACS coupled with physiotherapy in treating FMS cognitive symptoms, pain and subclinical psychopathology.

KC frequency and morphology may also be reflective of sleep quality, aging, and a range of sleep and sensory processing deficits. However, manual scoring of K-complexes is impractical, time-consuming, and thus costly and currently not well-standardized. Although automated KC detection methods have been developed, performance and uptake remain limited. Methods: The proposed algorithm is based on a deep neural network and Gaussian process, which gives the input waveform a probability of being a KC ranging from 0% to 100%. The algorithm was trained on half a million synthetic KCs derived from manually scored sleep stage 2 KCs from the Montreal Archive of Sleep Study containing 19 healthy young participants. Algorithm performance was subsequently assessed on 700 independent recordings from the Cleveland Family Study using sleep stages 2 and 3 data. Results: The developed algorithm showed an F1 score (a measure of binary classification accuracy) of 0.78 and thus outperforms currently available KC scoring algorithms with F1 = 0.2-0.6. The probabilistic approach also captured expected variability in KC shape and amplitude within individuals and across age groups. Conclusions: An automated probabilistic KC classification is well suited and effective for systematic KC detection for a more in-depth exploration of potential relationships between KCs during sleep and clinical outcomes such as health impacts and daytime symptomatology.

CLoSES: A platform for closed-loop intracranial stimulation in humans	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Closed-loop; Direct electrical stimulation; Neuromodulation; intracranial EEG	BRAIN-STIMULATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; SYSTEM; NEUROSTIMULATION; TETRAPLEGIA	Targeted interrogation of brain networks through invasive brain stimulation has become an increasingly important research tool as well as therapeutic modally. The majority of work with this emerging capability has been focused on open-loop approaches. Closed-loop techniques, however, could improve neuromodulatory therapies and research investigations by optimizing stimulation approaches using neurally informed, personalized targets. Implementing closed-loop systems is challenging particularly with regard to applying consistent strategies considering inter-individual variability. In particular, during intracranial epilepsy monitoring, where much of this research is currently progressing, electrodes are implanted exclusively for clinical reasons. Thus, detection and stimulation sites must be participant- and task-specific. The system must run in parallel with clinical systems, integrate seamlessly with existing setups, and ensure safety features are in place. In other words, a robust, yet flexible platform is required to perform different tests with a single participant and to comply with clinical requirements. In order to investigate closed-loop stimulation for research and therapeutic use, we developed a Closed-Loop System for Electrical Stimulation (CLoSES) that computes neural features which are then used in a decision algorithm to trigger stimulation in near real-time. To summarize CLoSES, intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) signals are acquired, band-pass filtered, and local and network features are continuously computed. If target features are detected (e.g. above a preset threshold for a certain duration), stimulation is triggered. Not only could the system trigger stimulation while detecting real-time neural features, but we incorporated a pipeline wherein we used an encoder/decoder model to estimate a hidden cognitive state from the neural features. CLoSES provides a flexible platform to implement a variety of closed-loop experimental paradigms in humans. CLoSES has been successfully used with twelve patients implanted with depth electrodes in the epilepsy monitoring unit. During cognitive tasks (N=5), stimulation in closed loop modified a cognitive hidden state on a trial by trial basis. Sleep spindle oscillations (N=6) and sharp transient epileptic activity (N=9) were detected in near real-time, and stimulation was applied during the event or at specified delays (N=3). In addition, we measured the capabilities of the CLoSES system. Total latency was related to the characteristics of the event being detected, with tens of milliseconds for epileptic activity and hundreds of milliseconds for spindle detection. Stepwise latency, the actual duration of each continuous step, was within the specified fixed-step duration and increased linearly with the number of channels and features. We anticipate that probing neural dynamics and interaction between brain states and stimulation responses with CLoSES will lead to novel insights into the mechanism of normal and pathological brain activity, the discovery and evaluation of potential electrographic biomarkers of neurological and psychiatric disorders, and the development and testing of patient-specific stimulation targets and control signals before implanting a therapeutic device.

Here we show that local spindles are indeed present in the human posterior thalamus. Thalamic local spindles had lower spectral power than non-local ones. While non-local thalamic spindles had equal local and non-local cortical counterparts, local thalamic spindles had significantly more local cortical counterparts (i.e. occurring in a single cortical site). The preferential association of local thalamic and cortical spindles supports the notion of thalamocortical loops functioning in a modular way. Sleep spindles are believed to subserve many sleep-related functions, from memory consolidation to cortical development. Recent data using intracerebral recordings in humans have shown that they occur across multiple neocortical regions but may also be spatially restricted to specific brain areas (local spindles). The aim of this study was to characterize spindles at the level of the human posterior thalamus, with the hypothesis that, besides the global thalamic spindling activity usually observed, local spindles could also be present in the thalamus. Using intracranial, time-frequency EEG recordings in 17 epileptic patients, we assessed the distribution of thalamic spindles during natural sleep stages N2 and N3 in six thalamic nuclei. Local spindles (i.e. spindles present in a single pair of recording contacts) were observed in all the thalamic regions explored, and compared with non-local spindles in terms of intrinsic properties and cortical counterparts. Thalamic local and non-local spindles did not differ in density, frequency or duration, but local spindles had lower spectral power than non-local ones. Each thalamic spindle had a cortical counterpart. While non-local thalamic spindles had equal cortical local and non-local counterparts, local thalamic spindles had significantly more local cortical counterparts (i.e. occurring in a single cortical site). The preferential association of local thalamic and cortical spindles supports the notion of thalamocortical loops functioning in a modular way.

In recent years, the methods able to reveal trustworthy PAC has gained considerable interest. However, the intrinsic features of some signals can lead to the identification of spurious or waveform-dependent coupling. This prompted us to develop an easily accessible tool that could be used to differentiate spurious from authentic PAC. Here, we propose a new tool for more reliable detection of PAC named the Extended Modulation Index (eMI) based on the classical Modulation Index measure of coupling. eMI is suitable both for continuous and epoched data and allows estimation of the statistical significance of each pair of frequencies for phase and for amplitude in the whole comodulogram in the framework of extreme value statistics. We compared eMI with the reference PAC measures-direct PAC estimator (a modification of Mean Vector Length) and standard Modulation Index. All three methods were tested using computer-simulated data and actual local field potential recordings from freely moving rats. All methods exhibited similar properties in terms of sensitivity and specificity of PAC detection. eMI proved to be more selective in the dimension of frequency for phase. One of the novelty's offered by eMI is a heuristic algorithm for classification of PAC asReliableorAmbiguous. It relies on analysis of the relation between the spectral properties of the signal and the detected coupling. Moreover, eMI generates visualizations that support further evaluation of the coupling properties. It also introduces the concept of the polar phase-histogram to study phase relations of coupled slow and fast oscillations. We discuss the extent to which eMI addresses the known problems of interpreting PAC. The Matlab(R)toolbox implementing eMI framework, and the two reference PAC estimators is freely available as EEGLAB plugin at https://github.com/GabrielaJurkiewicz/ePAC.

A computational paradigm for real-time MEG neurofeedback for dynamic allocation of spatial attention	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; Neurofeedback; Spatial attention; Decoding; Brain state	THETA-OSCILLATIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ALPHA; EEG; FMRI; SYNCHRONIZATION; MODULATION; MEMORY	Background Neurofeedback aids volitional control of one's own brain activity using non-invasive recordings of brain activity. The applications of neurofeedback include improvement of cognitive performance and treatment of various psychiatric and neurological disorders. During real-time magnetoencephalography (rt-MEG), sensor-level or source-localized brain activity is measured and transformed into a visual feedback cue to the subject. Recent real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback studies have used pattern recognition techniques to decode and train a brain state to link brain activities and cognitive behaviors. Here, we utilize the real-time decoding technique similar to ones employed in rt-fMRI to analyze time-varying rt-MEG signals. Results We developed a novel rt-MEG method, state-based neurofeedback (sb-NFB), to decode a time-varying brain state, a state signal, from which timings are extracted for neurofeedback training. The approach is entirely data-driven: it uses sensor-level oscillatory activity to find relevant features that best separate the targeted brain states. In a psychophysical task of spatial attention switching, we trained five young, healthy subjects using the sb-NFB method to decrease the time necessary for switch spatial attention from one visual hemifield to the other (referred to as switch time). Training resulted in a decrease in switch time with training. We saw that the activity targeted by the training involved proportional changes in alpha and beta-band oscillations, in sensors at the occipital and parietal regions. We also found that the state signal that encodes whether subjects attend to the left or right visual field effectively switches consistently with the task. Conclusion We demonstrated the use of the sb-NFB method when the subject learns to increase the speed of shifting covert spatial attention from one visual field to the other. The sb-NFB method can target timing features that would otherwise also include extraneous features such as visual detection and motor response in a simple reaction time task.

Methods: Twenty-five patients with CAE were studied using magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG data were digitized at 6,000 Hz during the interictal and ictal GSWDs. GSWDs were analyzed at both neural magnetic source levels and functional connectivity (FC) in multifrequency bands: delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30 Hz), gamma (30-80 Hz), ripple (80-250 Hz), and fast ripple (250-500 Hz). Brain FC was studied with the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/pC) as the seed region. Results: The magnetic source of interictal GSWDs mainly locates in the PCC/pC region at 4-8 and 8-12 Hz, while that of ictal GSWDs mainly locates in the medial frontal cortex (MFC) at 80-250 Hz. There were statistically significant differences between interictal and ictal GSWDs (p < 0.05). The FC network involving the PCC/pC showed strong connections in the anterior-posterior pathways (mainly with the frontal cortex) at 80-250 Hz during ictal GSWDs, while the interictal GSWDs FC were mostly limited to the posterior cortex region. There was no significant difference in the magnetic source strength among interictal and ictal GSWDs at all bandwidths. Conclusions: There are significant disparities in the source localization and FC between interictal and ictal GSWDs. Low-frequency activation in the PCC/pC during inhibition of seizures possibly relates to the maintenance of consciousness during interictal GSWDs. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) of the MFC during CAE may associate with the inducing or occurrence of GSWDs. Weakened network connections may be in favor of preventing overexcitability and relates to the termination of GSWDs.

The aim of this study is to elucidate the effects of A beta(1-42) at increasing concentrations on auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) and to determine possible changes relevant to the accumulation of A beta(1-42). Materials and methods: In this study, rats were randomized to following groups (n = 10 per group): sham (0.9% NaCl), A beta-1 (1 mu g/mu l), A beta-2 (2 mu g/mu l), A beta-3 (3 mu g/mu l), A beta-4 (4 mu g/mu l), A beta-5 (6 mu g/mu l), A beta-6 (8 mu g/mu l) and A beta-7 (10 mu g/mu l) groups obtained by injection of 5 mu l per ventricle. Then, AEPs were recorded in freely-moving rats. Latencies and amplitudes of AEPs, evoked power, inter-trial phase synchronization, and auditory evoked gamma responses were obtained in response to auditory stimulus. Furthermore, A beta(1-42) levels were determined in the temporal cortex. Results: A beta(1-42) levels were significantly higher in the temporal cortex in A beta groups compared to the sham. In frontal and parietal regions, P1N1 amplitudes were significantly decreased in A beta-3, 4, 5 and 6 groups, and N1P2 amplitudes were significantly decreased in all A beta groups, whereas in temporal regions, P1N1 and N1P2 amplitudes were decreased in A beta-2,3,4,5,6 and 7 compared to the sham. In the evoked gamma power and phase synchronization of gamma responses, we detected significant decrease after A beta-4 group, whereas a significant decrease in the filtered gamma responses was observed in A beta groups compared to the sham. Conclusions: AEPs might be used as a biomarker to determine the A beta(1-42) related neuronal degeneration in the auditory networks.

High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation dissociates fronto-visual theta lateralization during visual selective attention	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article						flanker task; functional connectivity; magnetoencephalography; theta oscillations	RIGHT-HEMISPHERE DOMINANCE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; OSCILLATORY DYNAMICS; FUNCTIONAL BRAIN; TARGET DETECTION; ELECTRIC-FIELDS; PHASE SYNCHRONY; MOTOR CORTEX; TDCS; EEG	Key points Visual attention involves discrete multispectral oscillatory responses in visual and 'higher-order' prefrontal cortices. Prefrontal cortex laterality effects during visual selective attention are poorly characterized. High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation dynamically modulated right-lateralized fronto-visual theta oscillations compared to those observed in left fronto-visual pathways. Increased connectivity in right fronto-visual networks after stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex resulted in faster task performance in the context of distractors. Our findings show clear laterality effects in theta oscillatory activity along prefrontal-visual cortical pathways during visual selective attention. Studies of visual attention have implicated oscillatory activity in the recognition, protection and temporal organization of attended representations in visual cortices. These studies have also shown that higher-order regions such as the prefrontal cortex are critical to attentional processing, but far less is understood regarding prefrontal laterality differences in attention processing. To examine this, we selectively applied high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) to the left or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We predicted that HD-tDCS of the left versus right prefrontal cortex would differentially modulate performance on a visual selective attention task, and alter the underlying oscillatory network dynamics. Our randomized crossover design included 27 healthy adults that underwent three separate sessions of HD-tDCS (sham, left DLPFC and right DLPFC) for 20 min. Following stimulation, participants completed an attention protocol during magnetoencephalography. The resulting oscillatory dynamics were imaged using beamforming, and peak task-related neural activity was subjected to dynamic functional connectivity analyses to evaluate the impact of stimulation site (i.e. left and right DLPFC) on neural interactions. Our results indicated that HD-tDCS over the left DLPFC differentially modulated right fronto-visual functional connectivity within the theta band compared to HD-tDCS of the right DLPFC and further, specifically modulated the oscillatory response for detecting targets among an array of distractors. Importantly, these findings provide network-specific insight into the complex oscillatory mechanisms serving visual selective attention.

However, it remains unclear to what extent the increase of FM theta power during response inhibition tasks is influenced by other non-inhibitory cognitive processes that are usually required for the tasks. In this study, we examined attention-related effects on FM theta during response inhibition by revisiting the EEG data from healthy young adults (N = 30) while performing a spatial cueing Go/NoGo task (Hong et al., 2017). Such an experimental design enabled us to manipulate selective attention that was voluntarily deployed to the stimuli triggering response inhibition. Although commission error rates were low for the NoGo trials, response preparation and prepotent motor activities were qualified by observing significant contingent negative variation (CNV) and lateralized readiness potential (LRP) in both the Go and the NoGo trials. We observed an increase of FM theta power in both attended and ignored conditions of the NoGo trials compared with the Go trials, while FM theta power was significantly smaller in the ignored condition than in the attended condition. Furthermore, source localization analysis suggested cingulate cortex as the main origin for FM theta in the NoGo trials, and FM theta power differences between the attended and ignored conditions were localized in cingulate gyrus. We further provided evidence for attention-dependent FM theta generation by correlating theta source density with ERP signatures of attention (N1), response preparation (CNV), and motor activity (LRP). Overall, our findings suggest that during the Go/NoGo task, the increase of FM theta power was not purely driven by response inhibition, and part of FM theta generators in cingulate gyrus was significantly modulated by attention-related processing (possibly conflict monitoring).

While toxicity is rare, these drugs can cause potentially lethal seizures. Objective In the present study, we investigated the electrocorticographic (ECoG) and electromyographic patterns of seizures induced by acute lidocaine (LA) toxicity and treated with anticonvulsant drugs. The study used adult male Wistar rats to describe of the seizure-related behavior of LA and investigated the treatment with anticonvulsant drugs. Results The use of LA resulted in clear changes in the ECoG pattern, which presented characteristics of Status epilepticus, with increased intensity in all brainwaves. The decomposition of the cerebral waves showed an increase in the beta and gamma waves that may be related to tonic-clonic seizure. Although the treatment with anticonvulsants drugs reduces the power of brainwaves at frequencies between 1 and 40 Hz compared to the LA group, but only diazepam (DZP) was able to decrease the intensity of oscillations. The muscle contraction power also indicated a difference in the effectiveness of the three treatments. Conclusion The sum of the evidence indicates that LA causes status epilepticus and that DZP is the most effective treatment for the control of these seizures, by restoring the systemic values to levels close to those recorded in the control group.

J	Paul, BT; Uzelac, M; Chan, E; Dimitrijevic, A				Paul, Brandon T.; Uzelac, Mila; Chan, Emmanuel; Dimitrijevic, Andrew			Poor early cortical differentiation of speech predicts perceptual difficulties of severely hearing-impaired listeners in multi-talker environments	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; COCHLEAR-IMPLANT; COCKTAIL-PARTY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; TRACKING; ARTIFACT; REPRESENTATIONS; INTELLIGIBILITY; LATERALIZATION; RECOGNITION	Hearing impairment disrupts processes of selective attention that help listeners attend to one sound source over competing sounds in the environment. Hearing prostheses (hearing aids and cochlear implants, CIs), do not fully remedy these issues. In normal hearing, mechanisms of selective attention arise through the facilitation and suppression of neural activity that represents sound sources. However, it is unclear how hearing impairment affects these neural processes, which is key to understanding why listening difficulty remains. Here, severely-impaired listeners treated with a CI, and age-matched normal-hearing controls, attended to one of two identical but spatially separated talkers while multichannel EEG was recorded. Whereas neural representations of attended and ignored speech were differentiated at early (similar to 150ms) cortical processing stages in controls, differentiation of talker representations only occurred later (similar to 250ms) in CI users. CI users, but not controls, also showed evidence for spatial suppression of the ignored talker through lateralized alpha (7-14Hz) oscillations. However, CI users' perceptual performance was only predicted by early-stage talker differentiation. We conclude that multi-talker listening difficulty remains for impaired listeners due to deficits in early-stage separation of cortical speech representations, despite neural evidence that they use spatial information to guide selective attention.

Although neither of these responses constitute a direct correlate of pain perception, previous findings suggest that insular GBOs may be strongly related to the activation of the spinothalamic system and/or to the processing of thermal information. To disentangle these different features of the stimulation, we compared the insular responses to brief painful thermonociceptive stimuli, non-painful cool stimuli, mechano-nociceptive stimuli, and innocuous vibrotactile stimuli, recorded using intracerebral electroencephalograpic activity in 7 epileptic patients (9 depth electrodes, 58 insular contacts). All four types of stimuli elicited consistent low-frequency phase-locked LFPs throughout the insula, possibly reflecting supramodal activity. The latencies of thermo-nociceptive and cool low-frequency phase-locked LFPs were shorter in the posterior insula compared to the anterior insula, suggesting a similar processing of thermal input initiating in the posterior insula, regardless of whether the input produces pain and regardless of thermal modality. In contrast, only thermo-nociceptive stimuli elicited an enhancement of insular GBOs, suggesting that these activities are not simply related to the activation of the spinothalamic system or to the conveyance of thermal information.

Comparing the prioritization of items and feature-dimensions in visual working memory	JOURNAL OF VISION			English	Article						working memory; attention; feature selection; EEG; retro-cue	ATTENTION; OBJECTS; SELECTION; MAINTENANCE; CAPACITY; BENEFITS; STORAGE; STATES	Selective attention can be directed not only to external sensory inputs, but also to internal sensory representations held within visual working memory (VWM). To date, this phenomenon has been studied predominantly following retrospective cues directing attention to particular items, or their locations in memory. In addition to item-level attentional prioritization, recent studies have shown that selectively attending to feature dimensions in VWM can also improve memory recall performance. However, no study to date has directly compared item-based and dimension-based attention in VWM, nor their neural bases. Here, we compared the benefits of retrospective cues (retro-cues) that were directed either at a multifeature item or at a feature dimension that was shared between two spatially segregated items. Behavioral results revealed qualitatively similar attentional benefits in both recall accuracy and response time, but also showed that cueing benefits were larger after item cues. Concurrent electroencephalogram measurements further revealed a similar attenuation of posterior alpha oscillations following both item and dimension retro-cues when compared with noninformative, neutral retro-cues. We argue that attention can act flexibly to prioritize the most relevant information-at either the item or the dimension level-to optimize ensuing memory-based task performance, and we discuss the implications of the observed commonalities and differences between item-level and dimension-level prioritization in VWM.

Previous studies have shown that ketamine had the potential to inhibit abnormally amplified affective responses of single neurons by suppressing hyperactivity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, the mechanism of this enduring effect has yet to be understood at the network level. In this study, we recorded local field potentials from the ACC of freely moving rats. Animals were injected with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) to induce persistent inflammatory pain. Mechanical stimulations were administered to the hind paw before and after CFA administration. We found a significant increase in the high-gamma band (60-100 Hz) power in response to evoked pain after CFA treatment. Ketamine, however, reduced the high-gamma band power in response to evoked pain in CFA-treated rats. In addition, ketamine had a sustained effect on the high-gamma band power lasting up to five days after a single dose administration. These results demonstrate that ketamine has the potential to alter maladaptive neural responses in the ACC induced by chronic pain.

Dissociable Neural Information Dynamics of Perceptual Integration and Differentiation during Bistable Perception	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						auditory streaming; bistable perception; information differentiation; information integration; phenomenal consciousness	PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; CONSCIOUSNESS; OSCILLATIONS; OBJECTS; INDEX; EEG	At any given moment, we experience a perceptual scene as a single whole and yet we may distinguish a variety of objects within it. This phenomenon instantiates two properties of conscious perception: integration and differentiation. Integration is the property of experiencing a collection of objects as a unitary percept and differentiation is the property of experiencing these objects as distinct from each other. Here, we evaluated the neural information dynamics underlying integration and differentiation of perceptual contents during bistable perception. Participants listened to a sequence of tones (auditory bistable stimuli) experienced either as a single stream (perceptual integration) or as two parallel streams (perceptual differentiation) of sounds. We computed neurophysiological indices of information integration and information differentiation with electroencephalographic and intracranial recordings. When perceptual alternations were endogenously driven, the integrated percept was associated with an increase in neural information integration and a decrease in neural differentiation across frontoparietal regions, whereas the opposite pattern was observed for the differentiated percept. However, when perception was exogenously driven by a change in the sound stream (no bistability), neural oscillatory power distinguished between percepts but information measures did not. We demonstrate that perceptual integration and differentiation can be mapped to theoretically motivated neural information signatures, suggesting a direct relationship between phenomenology and neurophysiology.

This study aims to introduce the statistical features of high-frequency components (HFCs) in interictal intracranial electroencephalograms (iEEGs) to identify the possible seizure onset zone (SOZ) channels. It is known that the activity of HFCs in interictal iEEGs, including ripple and fast ripple bands, is associated with epileptic seizures. This paper proposes to decompose multi-channel interictal iEEG signals into a number of subbands. For every 20 s segment, twelve features are computed from each subband. A mutual information (MI)-based method with grid search was applied to select the most prominent bands and features. A gradient-boosting decision tree-based algorithm called LightGBM was used to score each segment of the channels and these were averaged together to achieve a final score for each channel. The possible SOZ channels were localized based on the higher value channels. The experimental results with eleven epilepsy patients were tested to observe the efficiency of the proposed design compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

After short remainder of the results there obtained we briefly describe six interrelated problems of consciousness that do not yet have a satisfactory solution. It is shown that four of them can be solved using the theory of attention of O.S. Vinogradova, principle of dominant by A.A. Ukhtomsky and a small modification of the previously published model "Neurolocator". A large amount of new data is presented that agrees with this model or confirms it. Under the new model, the so-called "hard problem" has no solution, however, our model helps to understand why this problem is difficult to solve, also what additional properties of memory should be taken into account to explain subjective experience, and why A.A. Ukhtomsky's dominant on the self and others gives a solution to the so-called "hard problem" of consciousness. The article is dedicated to the memory of O.S. Vinogradova, the results and ideas of which were decisive for this article.

To optimize implemented interventions for MCI, it is essential to clarify the underlying neural mechanisms. However, knowledge regarding the brain regions responsible for MCI is still limited. Here, we implemented the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test, a screening tool for MCI, in 20 healthy elderly participants (mean age, 67.5 years), and then recorded magnetoencephalograms (MEG) while they performed a visual sequential memory task. In the task, each participant memorized the four possible directions of seven sequentially presented arrow images. Recall accuracy for beginning items of the memory sequence was significantly positively related with MoCA score. Meanwhile, MEG revealed stronger alpha-band (8-13 Hz) rhythm desynchronization bilaterally in the precuneus (PCu) for higher MoCA (normal) participants. Most importantly, this PCu desynchronization response weakened in correspondence with lower MoCA score during the beginning of sequential memory encoding, a time period that should rely on working memory and be affected by declined cognitive function. Our results suggest that deactivation of the PCu is associated with early MCI, and corroborate pathophysiological findings based on post-mortem tissue which have implicated hypoperfusion of the PCu in early stages of Alzheimer disease. Our results indicate the possibility that cognitive decline can be detected early and non-invasively by monitoring PCu activity with electrophysiological methods.

Previous literature suggests that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is related to creativity. However, none of previous studies have compared the effect of transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) over bilateral PPC on both verbal and visual divergent thinking (DT) and Remote Associates Test (RAT) in the same experimental design. Forty healthy participants were randomly assigned to tRNS (100-500 Hz) over bilateral PPC or sham group, for 15 min and current was set at 1.5 mA. Participants' creativity skills were assessed before and after brain stimulation with the Unusual Uses and the Picture Completion subtests from the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking and the RAT. ANCOVA (baseline scores as covariate) results indicated that tRNS group had significantly higher scores at post-test in RAT and visual originality compared to sham group. Unusual Uses, on the other hand, was not significant. Improvement in RAT suggests the involvement of PPC during via insight solution which may reflect internally directed attention that helps the recombination of remotely associated information. The improvement in visual originality dimension from DT may be due to a higher internally directed attention while reducing externally oriented attention.

Reduced gamma rhythm (20-50 Hz) and theta rhythm (4-10 Hz) has been observed in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it is not clear whether it is related to cognition in AD. Here, we investigated behaviorally driven gamma rhythm and theta rhythm in APP/PS1 mice, and optogenetically stimulated GABAergic neurons in the brain to better understand the relationship between the changes of LFP, cognition, and cellular pathologies. Optogenetically driving GABAergic neurons rescued memory formation in a water maze task and normalized theta and gamma rhythm in the EEG. Furthermore, the optogenetic stimulation alleviated neuroinflammation and levels of amyloid-beta (A beta)1-42 fragments, and induced autophagy. GABA blockers also reversed the normalization of theta and gamma rhythms in the brain by optogenetic stimulation. The results demonstrate that stimulation of GABAergic interneurons not only rescues LFP rhythms and memory formation, but furthermore activates autophagy and reduces neuroinflammation, which have beneficial additional effects such as clearing amyloid. This is a proof of concept for a novel therapeutic approach to AD treatment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Neural oscillatory dynamics serving abstract reasoning reveal robust sex differences in typically-developing children and adolescents	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Fluid intelligence; MEG; Oscillations; Theta; Sex effects; Dev-CoG	CURRENT STIMULATION TACS; FLUID INTELLIGENCE; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; BRAIN; EEG; AGE; ATTENTION; NETWORKS; MEG; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM	Fluid intelligence, the ability to problem-solve in novel situations, is linked to higher-order cognitive abilities, and to academic achievement in youth. Previous research has demonstrated that fluid intelligence and the underlying neural circuitry continues to develop throughout adolescence. Neuroimaging studies have predominantly focused on identifying the spatial distribution of brain regions associated with fluid intelligence, with only a few studies examining the temporally-sensitive cortical oscillatory dynamics underlying reasoning abilities. The present study collected magnetoencephalography (MEG) during an abstract reasoning task to examine these spatiotemporal dynamics in a sample of 10-to-16 year-old youth. We found increased cortical activity across a distributed frontoparietal network. Specifically, our key results showed: (1) age was associated with increased theta activity in occipital and cerebellar regions, (2) robust sex differences were distributed across frontoparietal regions, and (3) that specific frontoparietal regions differentially predicted abstract reasoning performance among males versus females despite similar mean performance. Among males, increased theta activity mediated the relationship between age and faster reaction times; conversely, among females, decreased theta mediated the relationship between age and improved accuracy. These findings may suggest that males and females engage in distinct neurocognitive strategies across development to achieve similar behavioral outcomes during fluid reasoning tasks.

Spindles are hypothesized to stabilize sleep, gate sensory processing and consolidate memory. However, the contribution of non-sensory thalamic nuclei in spindle generation and the role of spindles in sleep-state regulation remain unclear. Using multisite thalamic and cortical LFP/unit recordings in freely behaving mice, we show that spike-field coupling within centromedial and anterodorsal (AD) thalamic nuclei is as strong as for TRN during detected spindles. We found that spindle rate significantly increases before the onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but not wakefulness. The latter observation is consistent with our finding that enhancing spontaneous activity of TRN cells or TRN-AD projections using optogenetics increase spindle rate and transitions to REM sleep. Together, our results extend the classical TRN-TC-CT spindle pathway to include non-sensory thalamic nuclei and implicate spindles in the onset of REM sleep. During NREM sleep, spindles emerge from thalamocortical interactions. Here the authors carry out multisite thalamic and cortical recordings in freely behaving mice, to investigate the role of other non-classical thalamic sites in sleep spindle generation.

Site-Specific Effects of Online rTMS during a Working Memory Task in Healthy Older Adults	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; working memory; aging; fMRI; electric field modeling	BRAIN-STIMULATION; MOTOR CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; ORIENTATION; ENTRAINMENT; REMEDIATION; EEG/MEG; MIND	The process of manipulating information within working memory is central to many cognitive functions, but also declines rapidly in old age. Improving this process could markedly enhance the health-span in older adults. The current pre-registered, randomized and placebo-controlled study tested the potential of online repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied at 5 Hz over the left lateral parietal cortex to enhance working memory manipulation in healthy elderly adults. rTMS was applied, while participants performed a delayed-response alphabetization task with two individually titrated levels of difficulty. Coil placement and stimulation amplitude were calculated from fMRI activation maps combined with electric field modeling on an individual-subject basis in order to standardize dosing at the targeted cortical location. Contrary to the a priori hypothesis, active rTMS significantly decreased accuracy relative to sham, and only in the hardest difficulty level. When compared to the results from our previous study, in which rTMS was applied over the left prefrontal cortex, we found equivalent effect sizes but opposite directionality suggesting a site-specific effect of rTMS. These results demonstrate engagement of cortical working memory processing using a novel TMS targeting approach, while also providing prescriptions for future studies seeking to enhance memory through rTMS.

Memory failure predicted by attention lapsing and media multitasking	NATURE			English	Article							INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; WORKING-MEMORY; RETRIEVAL; OSCILLATIONS; COGNITION; AROUSAL; MIND; ERP	With the explosion of digital media and technologies, scholars, educators and the public have become increasingly vocal about the role that an 'attention economy' has in our lives(1). The rise of the current digital culture coincides with longstanding scientific questions about why humans sometimes remember and sometimes forget, and why some individuals remember better than others(2-6). Here we examine whether spontaneous attention lapses-in the moment(7-12), across individuals(13-15) and as a function of everyday media multitasking(16-19)-negatively correlate with remembering. Electroencephalography and pupillometry measures of attention(20,21) were recorded as eighty young adults (mean age, 21.7 years) performed a goal-directed episodic encoding and retrieval task(22). Trait-level sustained attention was further quantified using task-based(23) and questionnaire measures(24,25). Using trial-to-trial retrieval data, we show that tonic lapses in attention in the moment before remembering, assayed by posterior alpha power and pupil diameter, were correlated with reductions in neural signals of goal coding and memory, along with behavioural forgetting. Independent measures of trait-level attention lapsing mediated the relationship between neural assays of lapsing and memory performance, and between media multitasking and memory. Attention lapses partially account for why we remember or forget in the moment, and why some individuals remember better than others. Heavier media multitasking is associated with a propensity to have attention lapses and forget. Lapses in attention before remembering partially account for why we remember or forget in the moment, why some individuals remember better than others, and why heavier media multitasking is related to worse memory.

As a potential ADHD risk gene, KCNJ6, therefore, may contribute to the endophenotypic variation of the disorder. The impact of two SNPs, rs7275707 and rs6517442, both located in the transcriptional control region of KCNJ6, on reporter gene expression was explored in cultured cells. The KCNJ6 variants were then tested for association with ADHD and personality traits in a family-based sample (165 affected children) and an adult case-control sample (450 patients, 426 controls). Furthermore, the genotypic influence on performance in an n-back task and a cued continuous performance test (cCPT) was investigated by electroencephalography recordings. Finally, rs6517442 function was assessed by a reward anticipation paradigm using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Different haplotypes of rs7275707 and rs6517442 significantly influenced KCNJ6 gene expression proving their functional relevance on the molecular level. In the family-based children sample rs7275707 was associated with ADHD (p = .038). Moreover, rs7275707 showed association with the personality trait of Reward Dependence (p = .031). In the ADHD group, both rs7275707 and rs6517442 influenced the Go-centroid location in the cCPT and the N200 amplitude in the n-back task. Furthermore, ventral striatal activation was impacted by rs6517442 during reward anticipation. Our data indicate that functional variants of KCNJ6 influence brain activity during reward-related and executive processes supporting the view of a differential, age-dependent modulatory impact of dopamine-related brain processes in ADHD risk.

However, measuring trust remains a challenge for researchers exploring psychophysiological signals. Therefore, this article aims to systematically map the approaches used in studies assessing trust with psychophysiological signals. In particular, we examine the numbers and frequency of combined psychophysiological signals, the primary outcomes of previous studies, and the types and most commonly used data analysis techniques for analyzing psychophysiological data to infer a trust state. For this purpose, we employ a systematic mapping review method, through which we analyze 51 carefully selected articles (studies focused on trust using psychophysiology). Two significant findings are as follows: (1) Psychophysiological signals from EEG(electroencephalogram) and ECG(electrocardiogram) for monitoring peripheral and central nervous systems are the most frequently used to measure trust, while audio and EOG(electro-oculography) psychophysiological signals are the least commonly used. Moreover, the maximum number of psychophysiological signals ever combined so far is three (2). Most of which are peripheral nervous system monitoring psychophysiological signals that are low in spatial resolution. (3) Regarding outcomes: there is only one tool proposed for assessing trust in an interpersonal context, excluding trust in a technology context. Moreover, there are no stable and accurate ensemble models that have been developed to assess trust; all prior attempts led to unstable but fairly accurate models or did not satisfy the conditions for combining several algorithms (ensemble). In conclusion, the extent to which trust can be assessed using psychophysiological measures during user interactions (real-time) remains unknown, as there several issues, such as the lack of a stable and accurate ensemble trust classifier model, among others, that require urgent research attention. Although this topic is relatively new, much work has been done. However, more remains to be done to provide clarity on this topic.

Moreover, it has become a fascinating tool to provide illustrative insights into the functioning of brain networks. New anatomical and pathophysiological models of DBS action have accelerated our understanding of neurological and psychiatric disorders and brain functioning. The description of the brain networks arose through the unique ability to illustrate long-range interactions between interconnected brain regions as derived from state-of-the-art neuroimaging (structural, diffusion, and functional MRI) and the opportunity to record local and large-scale brain activity at millisecond temporal resolution (microelectrode recordings, local field potential, electroencephalography, and magnetoencephalography). In the first part of this review, we describe how neuroimaging techniques have led to current understanding of DBS effects, by identifying and refining the DBS targets and illustrate the actual view on the relationships between electrode locations and clinical effects. One step further, we discuss how neuroimaging has shifted the view of localized DBS effects to a modulation of specific brain circuits, which has been possible from the combination of electrode location reconstructions with recently introduced network imaging methods. We highlight how these findings relate to clinical effects, thus postulating neuroimaging as a key factor to understand the mechanisms of DBS action on behavior and clinical effects. In the second part, we show how invasive electrophysiology techniques have been efficiently integrated into the DBS set-up to precisely localize the neuroanatomical targets of DBS based on distinct region-specific patterns of neural activity. Next, we show how multi-site electrophysiological recordings have granted a real-time window into the aberrant brain circuits within and beyond DBS targets to quantify and map the dynamic properties of rhythmic oscillations. We also discuss how DBS alters the transient synchrony states of oscillatory networks in temporal and spatial domains during resting, task-based and motion conditions, and how this modulation of brain states ultimately shapes the functional response. Finally, we show how a successful decoding and management of electrophysiological proxies (beta bursts, phase-amplitude coupling) of aberrant brain circuits was translated into adaptive DBS stimulation paradigms for a targeted and state-dependent invasive electrical neuromodulation.

The current management for DRE includes epileptogenic lesion resection, disconnection, and neuromodulation. Neuromodulation is achieved through invasive electrical stimulus including deep brain stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, or responsive neurostimulation (RNS). As an alternative therapy, transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) can transcranially and non-invasively modulate neuron activity. Objective: This study seeks to verify the use of FUS pulsations to suppress spikes in an acute epileptic small-animal model, and to investigate possible biological mechanisms by which FUS pulsations interfere with epileptic neuronal activity. Methods: The study used a total of 76 Sprague-Dawley rats. For the epilepsy model, rats were administered pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) to induce acute epileptic-like abnormal neuron discharges, followed by FUS exposure. Various ultrasound parameters were set to test the epilepsy-suppressing effect, while concurrently monitoring and analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Animal behavior was monitored and histological examinations were conducted to evaluate the hazard posed by ultrasound exposure and the expression of neuronal activity markers. Western blotting was used to evaluate the correlation between FUS-induced epileptic suppression and the PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway. Results: We observed that FUS pulsations effectively suppressed epileptic activity and observed EEG spectrum oscillations; the spike-suppressing effect depended on the selection of ultrasound parameters and highly correlated with FUS exposure level. Expression level changes of c-Fos and GAD65 were confirmed in the cortex and hippocampus, indicating that FUS pulsations deactivated excitatory cells and activated GABAergic terminals. No tissue damage, inflammatory response, or behavioral abnormalities were observed in rats treated with FUS under these exposure parameters. We also found that the FUS pulsations down-regulated the S6 phosphorylation and decreased pAKT expression. Conclusion: Our results suggest that pulsed FUS exposure effectively suppresses epileptic spikes in an acute epilepsy animal model, and finds that ultrasound pulsation interferes with neuronal activity and affects the PTZ-induced PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, which might help explain the mechanism underlying ultrasound-related epileptic spike control.

Local Sleep and Alzheimer's Disease Pathophysiology	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						Alzheimer's disease; sleep; slow waves; sleep spindle; REM sleep; beta-amyloid protein; tau and phospho-tau protein; neurodegeneration	AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; EYE-MOVEMENT SLEEP; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; AMYLOID-BETA; REM-SLEEP; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; QUANTITATIVE EEG; A-BETA; MOUSE MODEL	Even prior to the onset of the prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a constellation of sleep disturbances are apparent. A series of epidemiological studies indicate that multiple forms of these sleep disturbances are associated with increased risk for developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, even triggering disease onset at an earlier age. Through the combination of causal manipulation studies in humans and rodents, as well as targeted examination of sleep disturbance with respect to AD biomarkers, mechanisms linking sleep disturbance to AD are beginning to emerge. In this review, we explore recent evidence linking local deficits in brain oscillatory function during sleep with local AD pathological burden and circuit-level dysfunction and degeneration. In short, three deficits in the local expression of sleep oscillations have been identified in relation to AD pathophysiology: (1) frequency-specific frontal deficits in slow wave expression during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, (2) deficits in parietal sleep spindle expression, and (3) deficits in the quality of electroencephalographic (EEG) desynchrony characteristic of REM sleep. These deficits are noteworthy since they differ from that seen in normal aging, indicating the potential presence of an abnormal aging process. How each of these are associated with beta-amyloid (A beta) and tau pathology, as well as neurodegeneration of circuits sensitive to AD pathophysiology, are examined in the present review, with a focus on the role of dysfunction within fronto-hippocampal and subcortical sleep-wake circuits. It is hypothesized that each of these local sleep deficits arise from distinct network-specific dysfunctions driven by regionally-specific accumulation of AD pathologies, as well as their associated neurodegeneration. Overall, the evolution of these local sleep deficits offer unique windows into the circuit-specific progression of distinct AD pathophysiological processes prior to AD onset, as well as their impact on brain function. This includes the potential erosion of sleep-dependent memory mechanisms, which may contribute to memory decline in AD. This review closes with a discussion of the remaining critical knowledge gaps and implications of this work for future mechanistic studies and studies implementing sleep-based treatment interventions.

The method has previously been verified in its ability to recover causal interactions in simulated spiking networks in Halliday et al. (2015). Methods: This work presents a validation of NPD in continuous neural recordings (e.g. local field potentials). Specifically, we use autoregressive models to simulate time delayed correlations between neural signals. We then test for the accurate recovery of networks in the face of several confounds typically encountered in empirical data. We examine the effects of NPD under varying: a) signal-to-noise ratios, b) asymmetries in signal strength, c) instantaneous mixing, d) common drive, e) data length, and f) parallel/convergent signal routing. We also apply NPD to data from a patient who underwent simultaneous magnetoencephalography and deep brain recording. Results: We demonstrate that NPD can accurately recover directed functional connectivity from simulations with known patterns of connectivity. The performance of the NPD measure is compared with non-parametric estimators of Granger causality (NPG), a well-established methodology for model-free estimation of dFC. A series of simulations investigating synthetically imposed confounds demonstrate that NPD provides estimates of connectivity that are equivalent to NPG, albeit with an increased sensitivity to data length. However, we provide evidence that: i) NPD is less sensitive than NPG to degradation by noise; ii) NPD is more robust to the generation of false positive identification of connectivity resulting from SNR asymmetries; iii) NPD is more robust to corruption via moderate amounts of instantaneous signal mixing. Conclusions: The results in this paper highlight that to be practically applied to neural data, connectivity metrics should not only be accurate in their recovery of causal networks but also resistant to the confounding effects often encountered in experimental recordings of multimodal data. Taken together, these findings position NPD at the state-of-the-art with respect to the estimation of directed functional connectivity in neuroimaging.

A neurophysiological model of speech production deficits in fragile X syndrome	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						fragile X syndrome; EEG; event-related potential; speech production; neurophysiology	DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; COROLLARY DISCHARGE; EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE; MOUSE MODEL; SAMPLING CONTEXT; AUDITORY-CORTEX; NETWORK; PROTEIN; DYNAMICS; TRANSLATION	Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited intellectual disability and monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder. Expressive language deficits, especially in speech production, are nearly ubiquitous among individuals with fragile X, but understanding of the neurological bases for these deficits remains limited. Speech production depends on feedforward control and the synchronization of neural oscillations between speech-related areas of frontal cortex and auditory areas of temporal cortex. Interaction in this circuitry allows the corollary discharge of intended speech generated from an efference copy of speech commands to be compared against actual speech sounds, which is critical for making adaptive adjustments to optimize future speech. We aimed to determine whether alterations in coherence between frontal and temporal cortices prior to speech production are present in individuals with fragile X and whether they relate to expressive language dysfunction. Twenty-one participants with full-mutation fragile X syndrome (aged 7-55 years, eight females) and 20 healthy controls (matched on age and sex) completed a talk/listen paradigm during high-density EEG recordings. During the talk task, participants repeated pronounced short vocalizations of 'Ah' every 1-2s for a total of 180s. During the listen task, participants passively listened to their recordings from the talk task. We compared pre-speech event-related potential activity, N1 suppression to speech sounds, single trial gamma power and fronto-temporal coherence between groups during these tasks and examined their relation to performance during a naturalistic language task. Prior to speech production, fragile X participants showed reduced pre-speech negativity, reduced fronto-temporal connectivity and greater frontal gamma power compared to controls. N1 suppression during self-generated speech did not differ between groups. Reduced pre-speech activity and increased frontal gamma power prior to speech production were related to less intelligible speech as well as broader social communication deficits in fragile X syndrome. Our findings indicate that coordinated pre-speech activity between frontal and temporal cortices is disrupted in individuals with fragile X in a clinically relevant way and represents a mechanism contributing to prominent speech production problems in the disorder.

To address this issue, we need to explore the hierarchical interconnections between the investigated fields trying to develop an inter-field theory. Considerable research has realized that event-related fluctuations in rhythmic, oscillatory EEG/MEG activity may provide a new window on the dynamics of functional neuronal networks involved in cognitive processing. Accordingly, this paper aims to outline a formal proposal on neuronal computation and representation of syntactic structures within the oscillatory neuronal dynamics. I briefly present the nature of event-related oscillations and how they work on the base of synchronization and de-synchronization processes. Then, I discuss some theoretical premises assuming that reentrant (hierarchical) properties of synchronized oscillatory rhythms constitute the biological endowment that allow the development of language in humans when exposed to appropriate inputs. The main rhythms involved in language and speech processing are examined: i.e. theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands. A possible formal representation of the syntactic structures on the base of these oscillatory rhythms is discussed: in this model, the theta-gamma rhythms are crossfrequency coupled into the alpha-gamma-beta and into the gamma-beta-theta rhythms to generate the sentence along reentrant cortico-thalamic pathways through Merge, Label and Move operations. Finally, I present few conclusive remarks within an evolutionary perspective.

Neural activity produced within localized brain networks has been associated with the process that integrates both sensory bottom-up and cognitive top-down information processing. Yet, how specifically the different types and components of neural responses reflect the local networks' selectivity for categorical information processing is still unknown. In this work we train Random Forest classification models to decode eight perceptual categories from broad spectrum of human intracranial signals (4-150Hz, 100 subjects) obtained during a visual perception task. We then analyze which of the spectral features the algorithm deemed relevant to the perceptual decoding and gain the insights into which parts of the recorded activity are actually characteristic of the visual categorization process in the human brain. We show that network selectivity for a single or multiple categories in sensory and non-sensory cortices is related to specific patterns of power increases and decreases in both low (4-50Hz) and high (50-150Hz) frequency bands. By focusing on task-relevant neural activity and separating it into dissociated anatomical and spectrotemporal groups we uncover spectral signatures that characterize neural mechanisms of visual category perception in human brain that have not yet been reported in the literature.

PAC phenomena have received increasing interest in neuroscience given the growing evidence of their apparent role in both normal and pathological brain processes. This interest has resulted in publication of a wave of methods for PAC estimation, each with its own advantages and drawbacks relative to others. Motivated by the widespread study of this phenomenon, most academic open source software environments for analyzing electrophysiological signals (e.g., Fieldtrip, Brainstorm, MNE) have implemented at least one method of PAC estimation. Here we describe an EEGLAB plug-in release, PACTools for MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc.), that computes PAC in either continuous or event-related data using any of five methods for PAC estimation: Mean Vector Length Modulation Index, Kullback-Leibler Modulation Index, Phase-Locking Value, General Linear Model Modulation Index and Mutual Information PAC (MIPAC). PACTools uses parallelized code for efficient performance and offers built-in direct access to online high-performance computing resources made freely available for nonprofit research by the Neurosciences Gateway (nsgportal.org). PACTools features intuitive graphic user interfaces and equivalent command line calls that make its use straightforward and seamless in the EEGLAB environment. We discuss toolbox implementation, architecture, dependencies, and the implemented methods of PAC computation and visualization.

Dissociating Cognitive Processes During Ambiguous Information Processing in Perceptual Decision-Making	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						perceptual decision-making; ambiguous stimuli; sensory processing; decision-making; top-down control; disambiguation process	EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION; FRONTAL-CORTEX; TOP-DOWN; INTEGRATION; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; SCALES; GAMMA; FLOW	Decision-making requires the accumulation of sensory evidence. However, in everyday life, sensory information is often ambiguous and contains decision-irrelevant features. This means that the brain must disambiguate sensory input and extract decision-relevant features. Sensory information processing and decision-making represent two subsequent stages of the perceptual decision-making process. While sensory processing relies on occipito-parietal neuronal activity during the earlier time window, decision-making lasts for a prolonged time, involving parietal and frontal areas. Although perceptual decision-making is being actively studied, its neuronal mechanisms under ambiguous sensory evidence lack detailed consideration. Here, we analyzed the brain activity of subjects accomplishing a perceptual decision-making task involving the classification of ambiguous stimuli. We demonstrated that ambiguity induced high frontal theta-band power for 0.15 s post-stimulus onset, indicating increased reliance on top-down processes, such as expectations and memory. Ambiguous processing also caused high occipito-parietal beta-band power for 0.2 s and high fronto-parietal beta-power for 0.35-0.42 s post-stimulus onset. We supposed that the former component reflected the disambiguation process while the latter reflected the decision-making phase. Our findings complemented existing knowledge about ambiguous perception by providing additional information regarding the temporal discrepancy between the different cognitive processes during perceptual decision-making.

Medium- and long-term functional behavior evaluations in an experimental focal ischemic stroke mouse model	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Locomotor activity; Motor deficit; Sensory deficit; Neuroscience; Stroke	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; MIDDLE CEREBRAL-ARTERY; POSTSTROKE DEPRESSION; ANIMAL-MODELS; RESTING EEG; OCCLUSION; DISEASE; OSCILLATIONS; IMPAIRMENT; PREVALENCE	Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, as well as a major financial burden for health care systems. CVA rodent models provide experimental support to determine possible in vivo therapies to reduce brain injury and consequent sequelae. This study analyzed nociceptive, motor, cognitive and mood functions in mice submitted to distal middle cerebral artery (DMCA) occlusion. Male C57BL mice (n = 8) were randomly allocated to control or DMCA groups. Motor function was evaluated with the tests: grip force, rotarod and open field; and nociceptive threshold with von Frey and hot plate assessments. Cognitive function was evaluated with the inhibitory avoidance test, and mood with the tail suspension test. Evaluations were conducted on the seventh- and twenty-eighth-day post DMCA occlusion to assess medium- and long-term effects of the injury, respectively. DMCA occlusion significantly decreases muscle strength and spontaneous locomotion (p < 0.05) both medium- and long term; as well as increases immobility in the tail-suspension test (p < 0.05), suggesting a depressive-type behavior. However, DMCA occlusion did not affect nociceptive threshold nor cognitive functions (p > 0.05). These results suggest that, medium- and long-term effects of DMCA occlusion include motor function impairments, but no sensory dysfunction. Additionally, the injury affected mood but did not hinder cognitive function.

Several non-competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathophysiology and mechanism behind FoG. Yet, due to the complexity of FoG and the lack of a complete understanding of its mechanism, no clear consensus has been reached on the best treatment options. Moreover, most studies that aim to explore neural biomarkers of FoG have been limited to semi-static or imagined paradigms. One of the biggest unmet needs in the field is the identification of reliable biomarkers that can be construed from real walking scenarios to guide better treatments and validate medical and therapeutic interventions. Advances in neural electrophysiology exploration, including EEG and DBS, will allow for pathophysiology research on more real-to-life scenarios for better FoG biomarker identification and validation. The major aim of this review is to highlight the most up-to-date studies that explain the mechanisms underlying FoG through electrophysiology explorations. The latest methodological approaches used in the neurophysiological study of FoG are summarized, and potential future research directions are discussed.	[Marquez, J. Sebastian; Hasan, S. M.

Impaired executive function can lead to difficulties in disengaging from rumination, thus exacerbating depression. In this study, we inspect an electroencephalograph neurofeedback protocol that enhance the target peak alpha frequency (PAF) activation in the prefrontal region. We examine the protocol's effects on depression and rumination. Methods: We randomly assigned 30 dysphoric participants into either the neurofeedback training group or the control group. We then evaluated their depression, rumination, and executive function at pre- and posttraining so as to examine the effects of the neurofeedback. Results: The results show that this neurofeedback protocol can specifically enhance participants' target PAF. The participants' executive function performances significantly improved after undergoing 20 neurofeedback sessions. Compared with those in the control group, those in the neurofeedback group had significantly fewer depressive symptoms and significantly reduced rumination. Moreover, as target PAF and executive function improved, depression and rumination both declined. Conclusion: Our data are in line with those of previous studies that indicated a relationship between upper-band alpha activity and executive function. This PAF neurofeedback can effectively enhance participants' executive function, which can reduce rumination and ameliorate depression. This neurofeedback training is based on basic cognitive neuroscience, so it sheds light on depression's pathological factors and etiology.

However, debate continues regarding the state of asymmetry induced by unilateral contractions. We have previously found a bilateral enhancement of alpha amplitude that occurs after contractions, reflecting cortical downregulation instead of changes in asymmetric activity. To corroborate our observations, we examined the effects of 45 s of unilateral dynamic handgrip contractions on subsequent resting alpha activity. Twenty-two right-handed participants were recruited (M = 25 years, 17 female). The study used a within-subjects design consisting of a pre and post-test (2 min resting; eyes open) for the intervention (dynamic handgrip; at a self-determined pace of approximately twice a second for 45 s for each hand). Following the handgrip task, an increase in alpha amplitude above the baseline was observed over the entire cortex, which was greater after left-hand squeezing. This observation confirms our previous findings and we have extended them by adding more electrodes to gain further insights into the handgrip exercise as an external brain stimulator. Moreover, we grouped electrodes according to scalp regions to facilitate the visualization of the effects on the frequency spectrum. Our findings can be used to develop targeted interventions aimed at modifying behavioral outcomes affected by alpha activity.

Decreased heart rate variability (HRV) is one clinical marker of SUDEP in adults with epilepsy. The objective of this study was to analyze the characteristics of HRV associated with generalized convulsive seizures (GCS) +/- PGES in children. Methods: Nine hundred and seventy-seven consecutive children who underwent prolonged scalp video-EEG (vEEG) and 1-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada were reviewed retrospectively from 2009 to 2011. Thirty-five children had GCS captured during their vEEG with or without PGES and met inclusion criteria. Children were subdivided into three age groups and compared with age-matched controls: 3-6 years; 7-12 years; and 13-18 years. Interictal HRV was measured at 5 min during N2 sleep. Preictal HRV was measured at 1 h prior to GCS onset, and postictal HRV was measured at 3 min post-GCS cessation. Low frequency (LF: ms(2),0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequency (HF: ms(2), 0.15-0.4 Hz) bands of heart rate oscillations were analyzed during the interictal and preictal periods. The root mean square of successive differences (RMSSDs) was analyzed during the following time points: interictal; preictal; and postictal. Results: Thirty-five children had GCS: 18 children with PGES [3-6 years (n = 2); 7-12 years (n = 6); 13-18 years (n = 10)] and 17 children without PGES [3-6 years (n = 6); 7-12 years (n = 5); 13-18 years (n = 6)]. Seven- teen additional age-matched controls were identified [3-6 years (n = 3); 7-12 years (n = 5); 13-18 years (n = 9)]. Seventy-four GCS were captured consisting of 36 GCS + PGES and 38 GCS - PGES. There was no difference of interictal HRV among children with GCS +/- PGES and controls. The preictal LF and HF in 36 GCS + PGES were significantly higher compared with 38 GCS - PGES (p < 0.01). The postictal RMSSD in 36 GCS + PGES was significantly higher compared with 38 GCS - PGES (p < 0.01). The pre- to postictal RMSSD change was significantly lower in children with GCS + PGES than in those with GCS - PGES (p = 0.035). Conclusions: In summary, the preictal HRV in GCS + PGES was significantly higher than in children with GCS - PGES. The higher remaining postictal RMSSD in children with GCS + PGES is a potential indicator of autonomic dysregulation. In certain children with epilepsy, autonomic dysregulation may contribute to poor recovery from a GCS with subsequent PGES, thereby contributing to SUDEP. Heart rate variability and autonomic regulation in children with epilepsy should be further studied prospectively in order to better understand the mechanism by which PGES may lead to SUDEP.

Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients brought to hospital by the emergency service between December 2016 and January 2018 with a stroke code as possible candidates for intravenous thrombolysis and who had already have a previous stroke. Among them, patients admitted for negative symptoms and finally discharged with a diagnosis of SE mimicking stroke were selected and their clinical characteristics collected. All patients underwent routine blood sample analysis, head computed tomography (CT) scan and, when indicated, CT angiography and CT-perfusion imaging of the head. After admission in our stroke unit, an Electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed within 3 h in patients suspected with SE, then classified according to International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification (2015). Outcome measures were SE duration, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) administered, mortality at 12 months, Engel scale, and modified Rankin scale (m-RS) at 6 months. A second cohort included those consecutive patients discharged with a true stroke relapse in the same considered time span. Clinical characteristics of these two cohorts were compared using Mann-Whitney test or Student-test (Confidence Interval (C.I.) 95%, p < 0.05) for continuous variable and Fisher exact test or Pearson-Chi test for dichotomic variables (p < 0.05). Survival rates were calculated, and a Log-Rank test was performed to evaluate differences in survival distribution. Only in the group with SE, m-RS at 6 months and recurrence of SE were also evaluated. Results: Eleven patients were discharged with a diagnosis of SE mimicking stroke and 65 patients with stroke relapse. Temporal lobe localization was significantly more represented in group with SE (p = 0.036) while there was no difference regarding age, sex, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). The m-RS was significantly higher in patients with hemorrhage relapse, mainly due to the high incidence of amyloid angiopathy in this subgroup. Status epilepticus recurred in 36.4% of patients, presenting with the same clinical features, and most patients (62.5%) achieved a good seizure control at 6 months (Engel scale = 1). A difference in mortality at 12 months (all cause considered) appeared only when distinguishing strokes between ischemic and hemorrhagic (Chi-Square: 10.711, p < 0.005). Discussion and conclusion: Status epilepticus is not infrequent in patients with previous stroke and may present with negative neurological symptoms, thus mimicking a stroke recurrence. EEG should be considered as a potential diagnostic tool in the acute stroke setting, at least in patients with previous stroke.

A fundamental challenge, however, has been the fact that physiological HFOs associated with normal brain function overlap in frequency with pathological HFOs. We investigated the impact of a cognitive task on HFOs with the aim of improving differentiation between epileptic and non-epileptic hippocampi in humans. Hippocampal activity was recorded with depth electrodes in 15 patients with focal epilepsy during a resting period and subsequently during a cognitive task. HFOs in ripple and fast ripple frequency ranges were evaluated in both conditions, and their rate, spectral entropy, relative amplitude and duration were compared in epileptic and non-epileptic hippocampi. The similarity of HFOs properties recorded at rest in epileptic and non-epileptic hippocampi suggests that they cannot be used alone to distinguish between hippocampi. However, both ripples and fast ripples were observed with higher rates, higher relative amplitudes and longer durations at rest as well as during a cognitive task in epileptic compared with non-epileptic hippocampi. Moreover, during a cognitive task, significant reductions of HFOs rates were found in epileptic hippocampi. These reductions were not observed in non-epileptic hippocampi. Our results indicate that although both hippocampi generate HFOs with similar features that probably reflect non-pathological phenomena, it is possible to differentiate between epileptic and non-epileptic hippocampi using a simple odd-ball task.

At the same time, progress in the study of experimental models of epilepsy has provided a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the condition and has enabled the identification of therapies that target specific aetiologies. We are now witnessing the impact of these advances in our daily clinical practice. Thus, now is the time for a paradigm shift in epilepsy treatment from a reactive attitude, treating patients after the onset of epilepsy and the initiation of seizures, to a proactive attitude that is more broadly integrated into a 'P4 medicine' approach. This P4 approach, which is personalized, predictive, preventive and participatory, puts patients at the centre of their own care and, ultimately, aims to prevent the onset of epilepsy. This aim will be achieved by adapting epilepsy treatments not only to a given syndrome but also to a given patient and moving from the usual anti-seizure treatments to personalized treatments designed to target specific aetiologies. In this Review, we present the current state of this ongoing revolution, emphasizing the impact on clinical practice. The anti-seizure medications used to treat patients with epilepsy can improve symptoms but do not address the underlying cause of the condition. In this Review, the authors discuss the ongoing shift towards personalized treatments for specific epilepsy aetiologies.

Characterisation of Haemodynamic Activity in Resting State Networks by Fractal Analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Group ICA Of fMRI Toolbox (GIFT); independent component analysis (ICA); resting state networks (RSNs); functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); fractal dimension (FD); fractal analysis (FA)	FUNCTIONAL MRI DATA; BRAIN ACTIVITY; MOTOR CORTEX; CONNECTIVITY; DYNAMICS; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; DIAGNOSIS; DIMENSION; AMPLITUDE	Intrinsic brain activity is organized into large-scale networks displaying specific structural-functional architecture, known as resting-state networks (RSNs). RSNs reflect complex neurophysiological processes and interactions, and have a central role in distinct sensory and cognitive functions, making it crucial to understand and quantify their anatomical and functional properties. Fractal dimension (FD) provides a parsimonious way of summarizing self-similarity over different spatial and temporal scales but despite its suitability for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal analysis its ability to characterize and investigate RSNs is poorly understood. We used FD in a large sample of healthy participants to differentiate fMRI RSNs and examine how the FD property of RSNs is linked with their functional roles. We identified two clusters of RSNs, one mainly consisting of sensory networks (C1, including auditory, sensorimotor and visual networks) and the other more related to higher cognitive (HCN) functions (C2, including dorsal default mode network and fronto-parietal networks). These clusters were defined in a completely data-driven manner using hierarchical clustering, suggesting that quantification of Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal complexity with FD is able to characterize meaningful physiological and functional variability. Understanding the mechanisms underlying functional RSNs, and developing tools to study their signal properties, is essential for assessing specific brain alterations and FD could potentially be used for the early detection and treatment of neurological disorders.

Beat-based and Memory-based Temporal Expectations in Rhythm: Similar Perceptual Effects, Different Underlying Mechanisms	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; METRICAL ACCENTS; TASK-RELEVANCE; BRAIN EVIDENCE; ATTENTION; PREDICTION; RESPONSES; ERP; PREDICTABILITY; ENTRAINMENT	Predicting the timing of incoming information allows the brain to optimize information processing in dynamic environments. Behaviorally, temporal expectations have been shown to facilitate processing of events at expected time points, such as sounds that coincide with the beat in musical rhythm. Yet, temporal expectations can develop based on different forms of structure in the environment, not just the regularity afforded by a musical beat. Little is still known about how different types of temporal expectations are neurally implemented and affect performance. Here, we orthogonally manipulated the periodicity and predictability of rhythmic sequences to examine the mechanisms underlying beat-based and memory-based temporal expectations, respectively. Behaviorally and using EEG, we looked at the effects of beat-based and memory-based expectations on auditory processing when rhythms were task-relevant or task-irrelevant. At expected time points, both beat-based and memory-based expectations facilitated target detection and led to attenuation of P1 and N1 responses, even when expectations were task-irrelevant (unattended). For beat-based expectations, we additionally found reduced target detection and enhanced N1 responses for events at unexpected time points (e.g., off-beat), regardless of the presence of memory-based expectations or task relevance. This latter finding supports the notion that periodicity selectively induces rhythmic fluctuations in neural excitability and furthermore indicates that, although beat-based and memory-based expectations may similarly affect auditory processing of expected events, their underlying neural mechanisms may be different.

Music-induced structural and functional brain changes have been demonstrated in the healthy adult. In the present study, adults with left-behind experience (ALB) were divided into two groups. The experimental group (ALB-E) took part in the music therapy experiment with three stages, including before listening to music (pre-stage), initially listening to music (mid-stage) and after listening to music (post-stage). The control group (ALB-C) did not participate in music therapy. Scalp resting-state EEGs of ALB were recorded during the three stages. We found no significant frequency change in the ALB-C group. In the ALB-E group, only the theta power spectrum was significantly different at all stages. The topographical distributions of the theta power spectrum represented change in trends from the frontal regions to the occipital regions. The result of Granger causal analysis (GCA), based on theta frequency, showed a stronger information flow from the middle frontal gyrus to the middle temporal gyrus (MFG -> MTG) in the left hemisphere at the pre-stage compared to the post-stage. Additionally, the experimental group showed a weaker information flow from inferior gyrus to superior temporal gyrus (IFG -> STG) in the right hemisphere at post-test stage compared to the ALB-C group. Our results demonstrate that listening to music can play a positive role on improving negative feelings for individuals with left behind experience.

Perspective on the Multiple Pathways to Changing Brain States	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						pyramidal neuron; brain state; cortico-thalamocortical; neuromodulation; active behavior; respiration	MEMBRANE-POTENTIAL DYNAMICS; SPONTANEOUS FIRING PATTERNS; LESS-THAN-1 HZ OSCILLATION; HYPOCRETIN-OREXIN; IN-VIVO; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; SOMATOSENSORY THALAMUS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; OPTOGENETIC CONTROL; RHYTHM GENERATION	In this review article, we highlight several disparate ideas that are linked to changes in brain state (i.e., sleep to arousal, Down to Up, synchronized to de-synchronized). In any discussion of the brain state, we propose that the cortical pyramidal neuron has a central position. EEG recordings, which typically assess brain state, predominantly reflect the activity of cortical pyramidal neurons. This means that the dominant rhythmic activity that characterizes a particular brain state ultimately has to manifest globally across the pyramidal neuron population. During state transitions, it is the long-range connectivity of these neurons that broadcast the resultant changes in activity to many subcortical targets. Structures like the thalamus, brainstem/hypothalamic neuromodulatory systems, and respiratory systems can also strongly influence brain state, and for many decades we have been uncovering bidirectional pathways that link these structures to state changes in the cerebral cortex. More recently, movement and active behaviors have emerged as powerful drivers of state changes. Each of these systems involve different circuits distributed across the brain. Yet, for a system-wide change in brain state, there must be a collaboration between these circuits that reflects and perhaps triggers the transition between brain states. As we expand our understanding of how brain state changes, our current challenge is to understand how these diverse sets of circuits and pathways interact to produce the changes observed in cortical pyramidal neurons.

Alternating current stimulation (ACS), for example, has been shown to alter brain rhythm activities and modify neuronal functioning in the visual system. Daily application of transorbital ACS to patients with optic nerve damage induces functional connectivity reorganization, and partially restores vision. While ACS is thought to mainly modify neuronal mechanisms, e.g. changes in brain oscillations that can be detected by EEG, it is still an open question, whether and how it may alter BOLD activity. Objective: We evaluated whether transorbital ACS modulates BOLD activity in early visual cortex using high-resolution 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: In this feasibility study transorbital ACS in the alpha range and sham ACS was applied in a random block design in five healthy subjects for 20 min at 1 mA. Brain activation in the visual areas V1, V2 and V3 were measured using 7 Tesla fMRI-based retinotopic mapping at the time points before (baseline) and after stimulation. In addition, we collected data from one hemianopic stroke patient with visual cortex damage after ten daily sessions with 25-50 min stimulation duration. Results: In healthy subjects transorbital ACS increased the activated cortical surface area, decreased the fMRI response amplitude and increased coherence in the visual cortex, which was most prominent in the full field task. In the patient, stimulation improved contrast sensitivity in the central visual field. BOLD amplitudes and coherence values were increased in most early visual areas in both hemispheres, with the most pronounced activation detected during eccentricity testing in retinotopic mapping. Conclusions: This feasibility study showed that transorbital ACS modifies BOLD activity to visual stimulation, which outlasts the duration of the AC stimulation. This is in line with earlier neurophysiological findings of increased power in EEG recordings and functional connectivity reorganization in patients with impaired vision. Accordingly, the larger BOLD response area after stimulation can be explained by more coherent activation and lower variability in the activation. Alternatively, increased neuronal activity can also be taken into account. Controlled trials are needed to systematically evaluate the potential of repetitive transorbital ACS to improve visual function after visual pathway stroke and to determine the cause-effect relationship between neural and BOLD activity changes.

Music Form but Not Music Experience Modulates Motor Cortical Activity in Response to Novel Music	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						motor cortical excitability; music listening; music training; musicians and non-musicians; music experience	CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; REPETITIVE MOVEMENT; CORTEX EXCITABILITY; DOPAMINE; OSCILLATIONS; VARIABILITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; STIMULATION; PLASTICITY; FEEDBACK	External cues, such as music, improve movement performance in persons with Parkinson's disease. However, research examining the motor cortical mechanisms by which this occurs is lacking. Research using electroencephalography in healthy young adults has revealed that moving to music can modulate motor cortical activity. Moreover, motor cortical activity is further influenced by music experience. It remains unknown whether these effects extend to corticomotor excitability. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to determine the effects of novel music on corticomotor excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a pilot study of healthy young adults. A secondary aim of this study was to determine the influence of music experience on corticomotor excitability. We hypothesized that corticomotor excitability will change during music conditions, and that it will differ in those with formal music training. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous using single-pulse TMS in three conditions: (1) No Music, (2) Music Condition I, and (3) Music Condition II. Both pieces were set to novel MIDI piano instrumentation and part-writing conventions typical of early nineteenth-century Western classical practices. Results revealed Music Condition II (i.e., more relaxing music) compared to rest increased MEP amplitude (i.e., corticomotor excitability). Music Condition II as compared to Music Condition I (i.e., more activating music) reduced MEP variability (i.e., corticomotor variability). Finally, years of formal music training did not significantly influence corticomotor excitability while listening to music. Overall, results revealed that unfamiliar music modulates motor cortical excitability but is dependent upon the form of music and possibly music preference. These results will be used to inform planned studies in healthy older adults and people with Parkinson's disease.

This time is necessary to know in order to construct forecasting models for coupling estimation and seizure prediction and detection. Methods. Mutual information function calculated between a signal with itself shifted in time is used. The shift varies from 0 to one half of characteristic oscillation period. Mann-Whitney test is used for comparative statistical analysis of distributions of the lag obtained for different animals and recordings. Results. Two records of local field potentials for each of five WAG/Rij rats (genetic models of absence seizures) were analyzed. Four channels were taken into account: frontal, parietal and occipital cotexes and hippocampus. There were 28 investigated seizures for each recording. Six time intervals of length 2 s were considered, starting from baseline, then preictal, begin of seizure, middle of seizure, immediately before the termination and after it. Distributions of lag for different records were compared statistically. Conclusion. The lag distribution unification for different animals was detected at the seizure beginning, with distributions from records of the same animal being usually closer than for different ones. This unification is expressed in the parietal cortex least of all. In the frontal cortex and hippocampus the unification ends with the seizure, while in the occipital cortex it remains even after seizure termination.	[Grishchenko, A.

Attention for Speaking: Prestimulus Motor-cortical Alpha Power Predicts Picture Naming Latencies	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; INHIBITION; RETRIEVAL; INCREASES; RHYTHMS; BIAS	There is a range of variability in the speed with which a single speaker will produce the same word from one instance to another. Individual differences studies have shown that the speed of production and the ability to maintain attention are related. This study investigated whether fluctuations in production latencies can be explained by spontaneous fluctuations in speakers' attention just prior to initiating speech planning. A relationship between individuals' incidental attentional state and response performance is well attested in visual perception, with lower prestimulus alpha power associated with faster manual responses. Alpha is thought to have an inhibitory function: Low alpha power suggests less inhibition of a specific brain region, whereas high alpha power suggests more inhibition. Does the same relationship hold for cognitively demanding tasks such as word production? In this study, participants named pictures while EEG was recorded, with alpha power taken to index an individual's momentary attentional state. Participants' level of alpha power just prior to picture presentation and just prior to speech onset predicted subsequent naming latencies. Specifically, higher alpha power in the motor system resulted in faster speech initiation. Our results suggest that one index of a lapse of attention during speaking is reduced inhibition of motor-cortical regions: Decreased motor-cortical alpha power indicates reduced inhibition of this area while early stages of production planning unfold, which leads to increased interference from motor-cortical signals and longer naming latencies. This study shows that the language production system is not impermeable to the influence of attention.

If the mere fact of closing the eyes favors access to unconscious materials, it should also favor primary process mentation. Primary process is an associative mode of thought based on superficial similarities including phonology, while secondary process mentation in language is primarily concerned with meaning. Fifty-two participants were given French Word Lists with phonological choices (P) corresponding to primary processes, while semantic choices (S) represent secondary processes when they are in mutual competition (PS). For example, participants were given a first word, such as, e.g. cale (to hold), and then had to choose between lac (P; lake) and fixe (S; fix), which alternative was most similar to the first word, cale. Two control lists, SN and PN, where the other choice is unrelated (N for nothing), verify that the subjects are equally capable of recognizing the phonological and semantics similarity. Results show an (near 10% increase in P choices in PS when participants close their eyes, while results on PN and SN were unchanged. The mere fact of closing the eyes induces a modest increase in primary process mentation. Based on the literature, the eyes closed (EC) condition is linked to increased alpha synchronization, which is thought to induce an inward mental shift. This research contributes to validating the psychoanalytic technique consisting on inviting patients to lie down on a couch and invite them to close their eyes.

Methods: This study was approved by the ethics committee. The sample consisted of 60 patients aged 18 to 50 years with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of I scheduled for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). All patients received propofol mediated sedation. Ramsay sedation score (RSS) was used as a clinical sedation score to assess the depth of sedation. Participants were attached to a BIS monitor. Perioperative hemodynamics, BIS values, the mean dose of propofol, procedure duration, apnea, frequency of oxygen desaturation and airway-related interventions, as well as demographic parameters, were recorded. BIS scores were blinded to RSS data. Results: The study sample consisted of 60 patients (36 females) aged 18 to 50 years (mean: 36.10 +/- 8.02). The mean procedure time and the dose of propofol were 32.70 +/- 1.79 min and 287.17 +/- 59.66 mg, respectively. The cut-off values for respiratory depression were as follows. At the 15th min of measurement, the BIS score of 60 had 96.2% sensitivity and 42.9% specificity. At the 20th min of measurement, the BIS score of 59.50 had 98.2% sensitivity and 100.0% specificity. At the 25th min of measurement, the BIS score of 59.00 had 98.3% sensitivity and 50.0% specificity. Regression analysis showed that the mean BIS score (p=0.000, 95%CI-0.110-0.043) increased by 0.076 with a unit increase in the RSS. Conclusion: BIS was highly correlated with RSS, and therefore, can be used to avoid respiratory depression during sedation.

The theory posits the hypothesis that the higher nervous activity (cognitive, intellectual, mnestic) of the humans and their mind are material and have microwave electromagnetic nature. The theory perceives the human mind as a result of dynamic extracortical information-commutation relations of the super-positions of the electromagnetic waves of ultra high frequency emitted by different areas of the human brain in the inter-membrane cerebrospinal fluid space of the human head at a certain period of time. The inter-membrane cerebrospinal fluid space of the human head (the space between the dura, arachnoid and pia mater filled with the cerebrospinal fluid) of about 10mm size, has all morphological attributes to realize the holography. It is a universal natural bioprocessor for processing, analysis and synthesis of the input data and their record or reproduction on the pia as on the biological holographic membrane. The theory suggested that the processes of the mind can be recorded and digitalized with the last generation contemporary microwave receptors of the UHF band. Goal: The goal is to experimentally test the theory of the information-commutation organization of the human brain, particularly, the postulate that the human mind has material, and, namely, electromagnetic nature represented by the microwave bioelectric activity; it must be detected, recorded and statistically processed, i.e. its existence must be confirmed. Methods: On their own initiative, the team of mathematicians, radioengineers and neurologists performed the non-invasive research of the electromagnetic radiation of human brain in the broad frequency range varying from 850MHz to 26.5GHz with the last generation specialized measuring equipment with high sensitivity and recording speed, specialized measuring antennas and low noise amplifying equipment in the anechoic chamber of the 1st class of protection according to the Russian system of certification GOST R 50414-92. Results: The previously unknown microwave electromagnetic radiation of the EHF/UHF range (from 1.5GHz to 4.5GHz) with signal strength of -130dBm .. -100dBm (1e(-15) .. 1e(-13) W) are discovered. The detected electromagnetic waves have zonal variations in the different areas of the human head and are absent in other areas of the human body. The method of recording of the microwave electromagnetic activity of the human brain is patented in the Russian Federation. The microwave electromagnetic activity of the brain is billion-fold different from the bioelectric activity recorded by the encephalography. Conclusion: Discovery of the phenomenon of the microwave radiation of the human brain provides evidence to the idea that thinking and mind are material. This phenomenon has the potential to become a new informational channel of the diagnostics of the functional and pathological state of the higher nervous activity of the human brain. It can provide the basis for the development of the equipment for real-time analysis of the microwave bioelectric activity of the brain in norm and pathology, for objective early diagnostics of the functional and emotional conditions as well as of the psychiatric disorders at the preclinical stage, for the biocontrol of the human brain and the artificial simulators of the human brain. It also can provide the foundation for new systems of the artificial intellect, brain-computer interface and systems of the closed-loop biomanagement of the damaged brain.

The presented approach proposes that high-level cognitive processes involving consciousness employ a universal mechanism by means of which they access and modulate an omnipresent background field that is identified with the zero-point field (ZPF) specified by stochastic electrodynamics (SED), a branch of physics that deals with the universal principles underlying quantum systems. In addition to its known physical properties and memory capacities, the ZPF is hypothesized to be an immanently sentient medium. It is propounded that linking up to a particular field mode of the ZPF activates a particular phenomenal nuance, implying that the phase-locked coupling of a set of field modes, i.e., the formation of a so-called ZPF information state, constitutes an appropriate mechanism for the amalgamation of elementary shades of consciousness into a complex state of consciousness. Since quantum systems rest exactly on this mechanism, conscious memory processes in the brain are expected to differ from unconscious processes by the presence of the typical features of many-body quantum systems, particularly long-range coherence and attractor formation, which is supported by a huge body of empirical evidence. On this basis, the conceptual framework set out in this article paves the way for a new understanding of the brain as a write-read head interacting with the ZPF, leading to self-consistent interpretations of the neural correlates of memory formation and memory retrieval and explaining why these memory processes are closely intertwined with phenomenal awareness. In particular, the neural correlates suggest that the brain produces consciously perceived memory traces by writing sequences of information states into the ZPF and retrieves consciously experienced memory traces by reading sequences of information states from the ZPF. Using these theoretical foundations, altered states of consciousness and memory disorders can be traced back to impairments of the ZPF write-read mechanism. The mechanism should reveal itself through characteristic photon emissions, resulting in testable predictions.

J	Sawchuk, T; Buchhalter, J; Senft, B				Sawchuk, Tyson; Buchhalter, Jeffrey; Senft, Birgit			Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures in children-Prospective validation of a clinical care pathway & risk factors for treatment outcome	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						PNES; Nonepileptic event; Care pathway; Treatment; Epilepsy; Outcomes	ADOLESCENTS; THERAPY; MANAGEMENT; PNES	Purpose: The purpose of this study was to prospectively validate a care pathway for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) in a pediatric setting. The pathway was developed based on a previous study of patients at our center, which demonstrated positive treatment outcomes of 80% full or partial remission. Sequentially referred patients with PNES in the validation cohort received care prospectively according to the pathway algorithm. It was hypothesized that the validation cohort would achieve outcomes similar to that of the development cohort as a result of standardized care. Method: We performed a retrospective chart review of 43 children sequentially referred, assessed, and treated within a specialized neurology psychology service for suspected PNES over a 5-year period. The majority of patients (n = 41, 95%) met diagnostic criteria for probable, dinically established, or documented PNES, according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) criteria. Results: Ages ranged from 6 to 18 years of age at time of diagnosis, with the majority of patients being female (n = 29, 67%) and adolescent (n = 31, 72%). There was a high level of adherence to the care algorithm (n = 34, 84%). The development and validation cohorts were similar across demographic, clinical, and psychological characteristics. Standardized care resulted in high rates of full ( n = 27, 63%) and partial (n = 12, 28%) remission, as self-reported at discharge. A 96% decrease in mean monthly frequency of total PNES events was also observed at discharge, as was a significant reduction in healthcare utilization related to PNES (74% fewer ambulance calls and 85% fewer emergency department (ED) visits). Post hoc analyses demonstrated that duration of PNES illness longer than 12 months (at diagnosis) increased odds of not achieving full remission by discharge (odds ratio = 5.94, p = 0.02). Developmental period of onset (child versus adolescent), having abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) result, previous concussion, chronic versus acute stressor, more than one PNES event type, or additional functional neurological symptoms did not significantly impact treatment response. Conclusions: This study demonstrates, for the first time prospectively in a pediatric setting, that standardized care for PNES leads to improved clinical outcomes and reduced healthcare utilization. Delayed diagnosis and treatment of PNES longer than 12 months also appears to be associated with less favorable outcomes in children. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Chang, PS; Fabrizi, L; Fitzgerald, M				Chang, Pishan; Fabrizi, Lorenzo; Fitzgerald, Maria			Distinct Age-Dependent C Fiber-Driven Oscillatory Activity in the Rat Somatosensory Cortex	ENEURO			English	Article						brain development; brain oscillations; C fibers; EEG; pain; somatosensory cortex	SPINAL DORSAL-HORN; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; FIELD POTENTIALS; INPUT; STIMULATION; CORD; SI; SYNCHRONIZATION; REORGANIZATION; ORGANIZATION	When skin afferents are activated, the sensory signals are transmitted to the spinal cord and eventually reach the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), initiating the encoding of the sensory percept in the brain. While subsets of primary afferents mediate specific somatosensory information from an early age, the subcortical pathways that transmit this information undergo striking changes over the first weeks of life, reflected in the gradual emergence of specific sensory behaviors. We therefore hypothesized that this period is associated with differential changes in the encoding of incoming afferent volleys in S1. To test this, we compared S1 responses to A fiber skin afferent stimulation and A+C skin afferent fiber stimulation in lightly anaesthetized male rats at postnatal day (P)7, P14, P21, and P30. Differences in S1 activity following A and A+C fiber stimulation changed dramatically over this period. At P30, A+C fiber stimulation evoked significantly larger gamma, beta, and a energy increases compared with A fiber stimulation alone. At younger ages, the changes in S1 oscillatory activity evoked by the two afferent volleys were not significantly different. Silencing TRPV1 + C fibers with QX-314 significantly reduced the gamma and beta S1 oscillatory energy increases evoked by A+C fibers, at P30 and P21, but not at younger ages. Thus, C fibers differentially modulate S1 oscillatory activity only from the third postnatal week, well after the functional maturation of the somatosensory cortex. This age-related change in afferent evoked S1 oscillatory activity may underpin the maturation of sensory discrimination in the developing brain.

Methods: This is a secondary analysis of data from a study of 41 healthy participants randomized to receive placebo or gaboxadol 15 mg during sleep restriction. Participants underwent in-laboratory sleep studies on two baseline, four sleep restriction (5-h), and two recovery nights. Relation between delta or ORP and sleep depth was operationally defined as the degree of association of each metric to the probability of arousal or awakening occurring during the next 30 s (arousability). Results: ORP values in wake, N1, N2, N3, and REM were significantly different. Delta differed between both N2 and N3 and other sleep stages but not between wake and N1 or N1 and REM. Epoch-by-epoch and individual correlations between ORP and delta power were modest or insignificant. The relation between ORP and arousability was linear across the entire ORP range. Delta also changed with arousability but only when delta values were less than 300 mu V-2. Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis found the ability to predict imminent arousal to be significantly greater with ORP than with log delta power for all experimental conditions. Changes in ORP, but not log delta, across the night correlated with next-day physiologic sleep tendency. Conclusions: Compared to delta power, ORP is more discriminating among sleep stages, more sensitive to sleep restriction, and more closely associated with arousability. This evidence supports ORP as a measure of sleep depth/intensity.

The structure of network formed by the interactive cortical regions reflects the state of working on a current task and changes continuously with the task processing. In addition, the neural oscillatory responses in various frequency bands are associated with different cognitive functions. Thus, studying topological characteristics of time-varying networks across multiple frequency bands helps to elucidate the mechanism of multisensory integration. Here, we designed an event-related experiment using auditory, visual, and audiovisual stimuli to record electroencephalographic data in both attended and unattended conditions and constructed delta-, theta-, alpha-, and beta-band networks at eight time points post-stimulus. We used graph theory to calculate global properties, nodal out-degree, and their correlation with behavioral performance. The increasing clustering coefficient and global efficiency and decreasing characteristic path length indicated that the brain had optimized the configuration across multiple frequency bands over time to efficiently process audiovisual integration. The differences in global properties and hub distributions showed that each frequency band-specificity system in the brain had a different topological structure, indicating that the networks on each frequency band contributed to various cognitive functions and involved in different stages of audiovisual integration. Our results suggest that differences in cognitive function are, at least partly, due to the different network structures across frequency bands and that the frequency band-specificity systems with different distribution are involved in various stages of audiovisual integration and attention modulation.

Item recognition and lure discrimination in younger and older adults are supported by alpha/beta desynchronization	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Aging; Alpha/beta oscillations; EEG; Episodic memory; Lure discrimination		Our episodic memories vary in their specificity, ranging from a mere sense of familiarity to detailed recollection of the initial experience. Recent work suggests that alpha/beta desynchronization promotes information flow through the cortex, tracking the richness in detail of recovered memory representations. At the same time, as we age, memories become less vivid and detailed, which may be reflected in age-related reductions in alpha/beta desynchronization during retrieval. To understand age differences in the specificity of episodic memories, we investigated differences in alpha/beta desynchronization between younger (18-26 years, n = 31) and older (65-76 years, n = 27) adults during item recognition and lure discrimination. Alpha/beta desynchronization increased linearly with the demand for memory specificity, i.e., the requirement to retrieve details for an accurate response, across retrieval situations (correct rejections < item recognition < lure discrimination). Stronger alpha/beta desynchronization was related to memory success, as indicated by reliable activation differences between correct and incorrect memory responses. In line with the assumption of a loss of mnemonic detail in older age, older adults had more difficulties than younger adults to discriminate lures from targets. Importantly, they also showed a reduced modulation of alpha/beta desynchronization across retrieval demands. Together, these results extend previous findings by demonstrating that alpha/beta desynchronization dissociates between item recognition and the retrieval of highly detailed memories as required in lure discrimination, and that age-related impairments in episodic retrieval are accompanied by attenuated modulations in the alpha/beta band. Thus, we provide novel findings suggesting that alpha/beta desynchronization tracks mnemonic specificity and that changes in these oscillatory mechanisms may underlie age-related declines in episodic memory.

An open question is whether orienting to expected vs. unexpected auditory events are governed by anatomically distinct attention pathways, respectively, or by differing communication patterns within a common system. To address this question, we applied a recently developed PeSCAR analysis method to evaluate spectrotemporal functional connectivity patterns across subregions of broader cortical regions of interest (ROIs) to analyze magnetoencephalography data obtained during a cued auditory attention task. Subjects were instructed to detect a predictable harmonic target sound embedded among standard tones in one ear and to ignore the standard tones and occasional unpredictable novel sounds presented in the opposite ear. Phase coherence of estimated source activity was calculated between subregions of superior temporal, frontal, inferior parietal, and superior parietal cortex ROIs. Functional connectivity was stronger in response to target than novel stimuli between left superior temporal and left parietal ROIs and between left frontal and right parietal ROIs, with the largest effects observed in the beta band (15-35 Hz). In contrast, functional connectivity was stronger in response to novel than target stimuli in inter-hemispheric connections between left and right frontal ROIs, observed in early time windows in the alpha band (8-12 Hz). Our findings suggest that auditory processing of expected target vs. unexpected novel sounds involves different spatially, temporally, and spectrally distributed oscillatory connectivity patterns across temporal, parietal, and frontal areas.

These symptoms as well as the effect of dopamine may be explained by distinct alterations in whole-brain architecture. We used functional connectivity (FC) and in particular resting state network (RSN) analysis to identify such whole-brain alterations in a frequency-specific manner. In addition, we hypothesized that standard dopaminergic medication would have a normalizing effect on these whole brain alterations. We recorded resting-state EEGs of 19 PD patients in the medical OFF and ON states, and of 12 healthy age-matched controls. The PD patients were either of akinetic-rigid or mixed subtype. We extracted RSNs with independent component analysis in the source space for five frequency bands. Within the sensorimotor network (SMN) the supplementary motor area (SMA) showed decreased FC in the OFF state compared to healthy controls. This finding was reversed after dopamine administration. Furthermore, in the OFF state no stable SMN beta component could be identified. The default mode network showed alterations due to PD independent of the medication state. The visual network was altered in the OFF state, and reinstated to a pattern similar to healthy controls by medication. In conclusion, PD causes distinct RSN alterations, which are partly reversed after levodopa administration. The changes within the SMN are of particular interest, because they broaden the pathophysiological understanding of PD. Our results identify the SMA as a central network hub affected in PD and a crucial effector of dopamine therapy.

Only about 30% of patients respond to a first-line antidepressant treatment, and around 30% of patients are classified as "treatment-resistant" after failing to respond to multiple adequate trials. While most antidepressants target monoaminergic targets, ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist that has shown rapid antidepressant effects when delivered intravenously or intranasally. While there is evidence that ketamine exerts its effectsviaenhanced alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) throughput, its mechanism for relieving depressive symptoms is largely unknown. This study acquired resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings after both ketamine and placebo infusions and investigated functional connectivity using a multilayer amplitude-amplitude correlation technique spanning the canonical frequency bands. Twenty-four healthy volunteers (HVs) and 27 unmedicated participants with MDD took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 0.5 mg/kg IV ketamine. Order of infusion was randomized, and participants crossed over to receive the second infusion after two weeks. The results indicated widespread ketamine-induced reductions in connectivity in the alpha and beta bands that did not correlate with magnitude of antidepressant response. In contrast, the magnitude of ketamine's antidepressant effects in MDD participants was associated with cross-frequency connectivity for delta-alpha and delta-gamma bands, with HVs and ketamine non-responders showing connectivity decreases post-ketamine and ketamine responders demonstrating small increases in connectivity. These results may indicate functional subtypes of MDD and also suggest that neural responses to ketamine are fundamentally different between responders and non-responders.

Using a diffusion model framework, we investigated to what extent well-established correlates of spatial attention in the electroencephalogram contribute to behavioral performance in an auditory free-field sound localization task. Younger and older participants were instructed to indicate the horizontal position of a predefined target among three simultaneously presented distractors. The central question of interest was whether posterior alpha lateralization and amplitudes of the anterior contralateral N2 subcomponent (N2ac) predict sound localization performance (accuracy, mean RT) and/or diffusion model parameters (drift rate, boundary separation, non-decision time). Two age groups were compared to explore whether, in older adults (who struggle with multispeaker environments), the brain-behavior relationship would differ from younger adults. Regression analyses revealed that N2ac amplitudes predicted drift rate and accuracy, whereas alpha lateralization was not related to behavioral or diffusion modeling parameters. This was true irrespective of age. The results indicate that a more efficient attentional filtering and selection of information within an auditory scene, reflected by increased N2ac amplitudes, was associated with a higher speed of information uptake (drift rate) and better localization performance (accuracy), while the underlying response criteria (threshold separation), mean RTs, and non-decisional processes remained unaffected. The lack of a behavioral correlate of poststimulus alpha power lateralization constrasts with the well-established notion that prestimulus alpha power reflects a functionally relevant attentional mechanism. This highlights the importance of distinguishing anticipatory from poststimulus alpha power modulations.

Stress Impairs Intentional Memory Control through Altered Theta Oscillations in Lateral Parietal Cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cortisol; memory; memory suppression; stress; theta	WORKING-MEMORY; EPISODIC MEMORY; FUTURE FEARS; EEG-DATA; SUPPRESSION; RETRIEVAL; MECHANISMS; METAANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; SIGNATURES	Accumulating evidence suggests that forgetting is not necessarily a passive process but that we can, to some extent, actively control what we remember and what we forget. Although this intentional control of memory has potentially far-reaching implications, the factors that influence our capacity to intentionally control our memory are largely unknown. Here, we tested whether acute stress may disrupt the intentional control of memory and, if so, through which neural mechanism. We exposed healthy men and women to a stress (n = 27) or control (n = 26) procedure before they aimed repeatedly to retrieve some previously learned cue-target pairs and to actively suppress others. While control participants showed reduced memory for suppressed compared with baseline pairs in a subsequent memory test, this suppression-induced forgetting was completely abolished after stress. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we show that the reduced ability to suppress memories after stress is associated with altered theta activity in the inferior temporal cortex when the control process (retrieval or suppression) is triggered and in the lateral parietal cortex when control is exerted, with the latter being directly correlated with the stress hormone cortisol. Moreover, the suppression-induced forgetting was linked to altered connectivity between the hippocampus and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), which in turn was negatively correlated to stress-induced cortisol increases. These findings provide novel insights into conditions under which our capacity to actively control our memory breaks down and may have considerable implications for stress-related psychopathologies, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), that are characterized by unwanted memories of distressing events.

Lacking Effects of Envelope Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation Indicate the Need to Revise Envelope Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation Methods	NEUROSCIENCE INSIGHTS			English	Article						Cortical entrainment; speech perception; speech envelope; transcranial electric stimulation	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; CORTICAL ENTRAINMENT; NEURAL ENTRAINMENT; PHASE ENTRAINMENT; EEG OSCILLATIONS; OLDER-ADULTS; SPEECH; RESPONSES; COMPREHENSION; ATTENTION	In recent years, several studies have reported beneficial effects of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in experiments regarding sound and speech perception. A new development in this field is envelope-tACS: The goal of this method is to improve cortical entrainment to the speech signal by stimulating with a waveform based on the speech envelope. One challenge of this stimulation method is timing; the electrical stimulation needs to be phase-aligned with the naturally occurring cortical entrainment to the auditory stimuli. Due to individual differences in anatomy and processing speed, the optimal time-lag between presentation of sound and applying envelope-tACS varies between participants. To better investigate the effects of envelope-tACS, we performed a speech comprehension task with a larger amount of time-lags than previous experiments, as well as an equal amount of sham conditions. No significant difference between optimal stimulation time-lag condition and best sham condition was found. Further investigation of the data revealed a significant difference between the positive and negative half-cycles of the stimulation conditions but not for sham. However, we also found a significant learning effect over the course of the experiment which was of comparable size to the effects of envelope-tACS found in previous auditory tACS studies. In this article, we discuss possible explanations for why our findings did not match up with those of previous studies and the issues that come with researching and developing envelope-tACS.

Deep phenotyping of attention impairments and the 'Inattention Biotype' in Major Depressive Disorder	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Attention; behavioral testing; depression; EEG; functional MRI	ALPHA-BAND; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; NETWORKS; MOOD	Background Attention impairment is an under-investigated feature and diagnostic criterion of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) that is associated with poorer outcomes. Despite increasing knowledge regarding mechanisms of attention in healthy adults, we lack a detailed characterization of attention impairments and their neural signatures in MDD. Methods Here, we focus on selective attention and advance a deep multi-modal characterization of these impairments in MDD, using data acquired fromn= 1008 patients andn= 336 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Selective attention impairments were operationalized and anchored in a behavioral performance measure, assessed within a battery of cognitive tests. We sought to establish the accompanying neural signature using independent measures of functional magnetic resonance imaging (15% of the sample) and electroencephalographic recordings of oscillatory neural activity. Results Greater impairment on the behavioral measure of selective attention was associated with intrinsic hypo-connectivity of the fronto-parietal attention network. Not only was this relationship specific to the fronto-parietal network unlike other large-scale networks; this hypo-connectivity was also specific to selective attention performance unlike other measures of cognition. Selective attention impairment was also associated with lower posterior alpha (8-13 Hz) power at rest and was related to more severe negative bias (frequent misidentifications of neutral faces as sad and lingering attention on sad faces), relevant to clinical features of negative attributions and brooding. Selective attention impairments were independent of overall depression severity and of worrying or sleep problems. Conclusions These results provide a foundation for the clinical translational development of objective markers and targeted therapeutics for attention impairment in MDD.

How local-global implicit temporal expectancy shapes proactive motor control: An hdEEG study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Dynamic temporal prediction task; Proactive response adjustment; Anticipatory ERP activity; Probabilistic context	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EEG DELTA OSCILLATIONS; ORIENTING ATTENTION; REACTION-TIME; INTRAPARIETAL SULCUS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; SPHERICAL SPLINES; NEURAL SYSTEMS; BAND ACTIVITY	In this study, we investigated the effect of global temporal prediction on the brain capability to implicitly adjust proactive motor control. We used the Dynamic Temporal Prediction (DTP), in which local and global predictions of an imperative stimulus were manipulated by using different stimulus-onset asynchronies (SOAs), presented with several distribution probabilities. At a behavioural level, the results show a performance adjustment (reaction time decrease) depending on the implicit use of global prediction. At a neurophysiological level, three separate computational steps underlying motor control were investigated. First, the expectancy implementation was associated with global probability-dependent contingent negative variation (CNV) modulation supported by the recruitment of a frontoparietal network involving the anterior cingulate, the left intraparietal sulcus, the occipital, and the premotor areas. Second, the response implementation was modulated by the global prediction fostering stimulus processing (P3 increase) at the motor response level, as suggested by both oscillatory (beta desynchronization), as well as source analysis (frontal cortical network). Third, the expectancy violation lead to a negativity increase (omission-detection potential) time locked to the global rule violation and additionally, to delta and theta power increase interpreted as inhibitory control and rule violation detection, respectively. The expectancy violation further engaged a left lateralized network including the temporal parietal junction (TPJ) and the motor cortex, suggesting involvement of attentional reorienting and a motor adjustment. Finally, these findings provide new insights on the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying proactive motor control, suggesting an overlapping between implicit and explicit processes.	[Duma, G.

Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily known as a movement disorder, recent research has redefined it as a multisystem disorder affecting cognition, in particular inhibitory control and attentional resource allocation. Analysing the neural mechanisms underlying this cognitive deficit provides a better understanding of brain changes observed in patients affected by PD. Therefore, this study aimed to identify resource allocation to relevant and irrelevant stimuli in patients affected by PD. Besides neuropsychological tests, we employed electroencephalographic recordings during an auditory oddball paradigm in 13 patients suffering from idiopathic PD and 11 healthy controls (HC). Participants were instructed to ignore the standard stimulus and to respond as fast as possible to the rarely presented target tone. Event-related potentials (ERP) and time-frequency representations (TFR) were analyzed. Patients affected by PD showed faster response latencies to the task-irrelevant standard tones, but slower response latencies to target tones compared to HC. This observation was prominent at frontal sites during later P3-like processing stages. Reaction time, however, was prolonged in patients with PD, suggesting inefficient resource allocation. Additionally, TFR revealed reduced parietal alpha activity, which is associated with distractor suppression and functional inhibition in patients with PD compared to healthy controls. Thus, our results point towards inefficient resource allocation in patients with PD possibly driven by less functional inhibition through parietal alpha activity.

Too little, too late, and in the wrong place: Alpha band activity does not reflect an active mechanism of selective attention	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Selective spatial attention; Alpha oscillations; SSVEP; Distractor suppression; EEG	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; STEADY-STATE; TIME-COURSE; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; CUED SHIFTS; SUPPRESSION; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION; MODULATION	Selective attention focuses visual processing on relevant stimuli in order to allow for adaptive behaviour despite an abundance of distracting information. It has been proposed that increases in alpha band (8-12 Hz) amplitude reflect an active mechanism for distractor suppression. If this were the case, increases in alpha band amplitude should be succeeded by a decrease in distractor processing. Surprisingly, this connection has not been tested directly; specifically, studies that have investigated changes in alpha band after attention-directing cues have not directly assessed the neuronal processing of distractors. We concurrently recorded alpha activity and steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) to assess the processing of target and distractor stimuli. In two experiments, participants covertly shifted attention to one of two letter streams (left or right) to detect infrequent target letters 'X' while ignoring the other stream. In line with previous findings, alpha band amplitudes contralateral to the unattended location increased compared to a pre-cue baseline. However, there was no suppression of SSVEP amplitudes elicited by unattended stimuli, while there was a pronounced enhancement of SSVEPs elicited by attended stimuli. Furthermore, and crucially, changes in alpha band amplitude during attention shifts did not precede those in SSVEPs and hit rates in both experiments, indicating that changes in alpha band amplitudes are likely to be a consequence of attention shifts rather than the other way around. We conclude that these findings contradict the notion that alpha band activity reflects mechanisms that have a causal role in the allocation of selective attention.

These systems seek online adaptation of stimulation parameters in closed-loop as a function of neural markers, aiming at improving treatment's efficacy and reducing side effects. Typically, the identification of PD neural markers is based on group-level studies. Due to the heterogeneity of symptoms across patients, however, such group-level neural markers, like the beta band power of the subthalamic nucleus, are not present in every patient or not informative about every patient's motor state. Instead, individual neural markers may be preferable for providing a personalized solution for the adaptation of stimulation parameters. Fortunately, data-driven bottom-up approaches based on machine learning may be utilized. These approaches have been developed and applied successfully in the field of brain-computer interfaces with the goal of providing individuals with means of communication and control. In our contribution, we present results obtained with a novel supervised data-driven identification of neural markers of hand motor performance based on a supervised machine learning model. Data of 16 experimental sessions obtained from seven PD patients undergoing DBS therapy show that the supervised patient-specific neural markers provide improved decoding accuracy of hand motor performance, compared to group-level neural markers reported in the literature. We observed that the individual markers are sensitive to DBS therapy and thus, may represent controllable variables in an adaptive DBS system.

However, previous studies focus on changes in brain activity related to motor execution. How changes in motor preparation may facilitate these changes at motor execution is still unclear. To address this question, 8 individuals with severe chronic hemiparetic stroke participated in a device-assisted intervention for seven weeks. We then quantified changes in both coupling between regions during motor preparation and changes in topographical cortical activity at motor execution for both hand opening in isolation and together with the shoulder using high-density EEG. We hypothesized that intervention-induced changes in cortico-cortico interactions during motor preparation would lead to changes in activity at motor execution specifically towards an increased reliance on the ipsilesional hemisphere. In agreement with this hypothesis, we found that, following the intervention, individuals displayed a reduction in coupling from ipsilesional M1 to contralesional M1 within gamma frequencies during motor preparation for hand opening. This was followed by a reduction in activity in the contralesional primary sensorimotor cortex during motor execution. Similarly, during lifting and opening, a shift to negative coupling within ipsilesional M1 from gamma to beta frequencies was accompanied by an increase in ipsilesional primary sensorimotor cortex activity following the intervention. Together, these results show that intervention-induced changes in coupling within or between motor regions during motor preparation may affect cortical activity at execution.

Another line of studies has shown that sleep following training also plays a role in facilitating VPL, an effect known as the offline performance gain of VPL. However, whether the effects of reward and sleep interact on VPL remains unclear. Here, we show that reward interacts with sleep to facilitate offline performance gains of VPL. First, we demonstrated a significantly larger offline performance gain over a 12-h interval including sleep in a reward group than that in a no-reward group. However, the offline performance gains over the 12-h interval without sleep were not significantly different with or without reward during training, indicating a crucial interaction between reward and sleep in VPL. Next, we tested whether neural activations during posttraining sleep were modulated after reward was provided during training. Reward provided during training enhanced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time, increased oscillatory activities for reward processing in the prefrontal region during REM sleep, and inhibited neural activation in the untrained region in early visual areas in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep. The offline performance gains were significantly correlated with oscillatory activities of visual processing during NREM sleep and reward processing during REM sleep in the reward group but not in the no-reward group. These results suggest that reward provided during training becomes effective during sleep, with excited reward processing sending inhibitory signals to suppress noise in visual processing, resulting in larger offline performance gains over sleep.

J	Li, YZ; Luo, H; Tian, X				Li, Yanzhu; Luo, Huan; Tian, Xing			Mental operations in rhythm: Motor-to-sensory transformation mediates imagined singing	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; MUSICAL IMAGERY; INNER SPEECH; COMPUTATIONAL PRINCIPLES; NEURONAL ENTRAINMENT; CORTEX ACTIVATION; MEG; MECHANISMS; OSCILLATIONS; EEG	What enables the mental activities of thinking verbally or humming in our mind? We hypothesized that the interaction between motor and sensory systems induces speech and melodic mental representations, and this motor-to-sensory transformation forms the neural basis that enables our verbal thinking and covert singing. Analogous with the neural entrainment to auditory stimuli, participants imagined singing lyrics of well-known songs rhythmically while their neural electromagnetic signals were recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We found that when participants imagined singing the same song in similar durations across trials, the delta frequency band (1-3 Hz, similar to the rhythm of the songs) showed more consistent phase coherence across trials. This neural phase tracking of imagined singing was observed in a frontal-parietal-temporal network: the proposed motor-to-sensory transformation pathway, including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), insula (INS), premotor area, intra-parietal sulcus (IPS), temporal-parietal junction (TPJ), primary auditory cortex (Heschl's gyrus [HG]), and superior temporal gyrus (STG) and sulcus (STS). These results suggest that neural responses can entrain the rhythm of mental activity. Moreover, the theta-band (4-8 Hz) phase coherence was localized in the auditory cortices. The mu (9-12 Hz) and beta (17-20 Hz) bands were observed in the right-lateralized sensorimotor systems that were consistent with the singing context.

Yet, it remains unknown whether the RT gains attributable to temporal and spatial anticipation are subtended by similar preparatory dynamics. Here, this issue is addressed in humans by investigating EEG beta-band activity during reach preparation. Participants performed a reach RT task in which they initiated a movement as fast as possible toward visual targets following their appearance. Temporal anticipation was manipulated by having the target appear after a constant or variable delay period, whereas spatial anticipation was manipulated by precueing participants about the upcoming target location in advance or not. Results revealed that temporal and spatial anticipation both reduced reach RTs, with no interaction. Interestingly, temporal and spatial anticipation were associated with fundamentally different patterns of beta-band modulations. Temporal anticipation was associated with beta-band desynchronization over contralateral sensorimotor regions specifically around the expected moment of target onset, the magnitude of which was correlated with RT modulations across participants. In contrast, spatial anticipation did not influence sensorimotor activity but rather led to increased beta-band power over bilateral parieto-occipital regions during the entire delay period. These results argue for distinct states of preparation incurred by temporal and spatial anticipation. In particular, sensorimotor beta-band desynchronization may reflect the timely disinhibition of movement-related neuronal ensembles at the expected time of movement initiation, without reflecting its spatial parameters per se.

Listening to the radio (RADIO) has been proven to be a relatively effective "in-car" countermeasure. However, the connectivity analysis, which can be used to investigate its alerting effect, is subject to the issue of signal mixing. In this study, we propose a novel framework based on clustering and entropy to improve the performance of the connectivity analysis to reveal the effect of RADIO to maintain driver alertness. Regardless of reducing signal mixing, we introduce clustering algorithm to classify the functional connections with their nodes into different categories to mine the effective information of the alerting effect. Differential entropy (DE) is employed to measure the information content in different brain regions after clustering. Compared with the Louvain-based community detection method, the proposed method shows more superior ability to present RADIO effectin confused functional connection matrices. Our experimental results reveal that the active connection clusters distinguished by the proposed method gradually move from frontal region to parieto-occipital regionwith the progress of fatigue, consistent with the alpha energy changes in these two brain areas. The active class of the clusters in parieto-occipital region significantly decreases and the most active clusters remain in the frontal region when RADIO is taken. The estimation results of DE confirm the significant change (p< 0.05) of information content due to the cluster movements. Hence, preventing the movement of the active clusters from frontal region to parieto-occipital region may correlate with maintaining driver alertness. The revelation of alerting effect is helpful for the targeted upgrade of fatigue countermeasures.

However, neurophysiologic mechanisms that support the efficiency of creative thinking remain largely unknown. This study was aimed to investigate age-related difference in localized induced electroencephalogram (EEG) changes during creative idea evaluation stage of divergent problem-solving (Alternate Uses Task), using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography. Younger (45 women, 44 men, M-age = 22.1 years, age range: 18-30 years) and older adults (46 women, 43 men, M-age = 64.9 years, age range: 55-75 years) participated in the study. Higher synchronization in individually adjusted theta frequency band [from (individual alpha peak frequency -6 Hz) to (individual alpha peak frequency -4 Hz)] in anterior areas with the maximum values in anterior cingulate gyrus was revealed in older as compared with younger participants by group contrast. Higher desynchronization in wide beta range [from (individual alpha peak frequency +2 Hz) to 30 Hz] was localized in posterior brain regions with the highest values in posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and parietal lobule in older adults. Induced beta 2 synchronization was positively correlated with originality (as measured by the mean frequency of ideas) in younger and years of education in older subjects. Based on the data, it was supposed that controlling the decision-making processes is more important for older adults while maintenance of the internal image of elements' recombination may play essential role for younger subjects.

Multi-channel whole-head OPM-MEG: Helmet design and a comparison with a conventional system	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Optically pumped magnetometer; OPM; Magnetoencephalography; MEG; Beta; Gamma	ATOMIC MAGNETOMETRY; CO-REGISTRATION; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; CONNECTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; FREQUENCY	Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a powerful technique for functional neuroimaging, offering a non-invasive window on brain electrophysiology. MEG systems have traditionally been based on cryogenic sensors which detect the small extracranial magnetic fields generated by synchronised current in neuronal assemblies, however, such systems have fundamental limitations. In recent years, non-cryogenic quantum-enabled sensors, called optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs), in combination with novel techniques for accurate background magnetic field control, have promised to lift those restrictions offering an adaptable, motion-robust MEG system, with improved data quality, at reduced cost. However, OPM-MEG remains a nascent technology, and whilst viable systems exist, most employ small numbers of sensors sited above targeted brain regions. Here, building on previous work, we construct a wearable OPM-MEG system with 'whole-head' coverage based upon commercially available OPMs, and test its capabilities to measure alpha, beta and gamma oscillations. We design two methods for OPM mounting; a flexible (EEG-like) cap and rigid (additively-manufactured) helmet. Whilst both designs allow for high quality data to be collected, we argue that the rigid helmet offers a more robust option with significant advantages for reconstruction of field data into 3D images of changes in neuronal current. Using repeat measurements in two participants, we show signal detection for our device to be highly robust. Moreover, via application of source-space modelling, we show that, despite having 5 times fewer sensors, our system exhibits comparable performance to an established cryogenic MEG device. While significant challenges still remain, these developments provide further evidence that OPM-MEG is likely to facilitate a step change for functional neuroimaging.

We investigated the effects of rhythm-based temporal expectation on auditory responses measured with EEG recorded from the frontocentral sites implicated in auditory processing. By manipulating temporal expectation and the interonset interval (IOI) of tones, we examined how neural responses adapted to auditory rhythm and reacted to stimuli that violated the rhythm. Participants passively listened to the tones while watching a silent nature video. In Experiment 1 (n= 22), in the long-IOI block, tones were frequently presented (80%) with 1.7-sec IOI and infrequently presented (20%) with 1.2-sec IOI, generating unexpectedly early tones that violated temporal expectation. Conversely, in the short-IOI block, tones were frequently presented with 1.2-sec IOI and infrequently presented with 1.7-sec IOI, generating late tones. We analyzed the tone-evoked N1-P2 amplitude of ERPs and intertrial phase clustering in the theta-alpha band. The results provided evidence of strong delay-dependent adaptation effects (short-term, sensitive to IOI), weak cumulative adaptation effects (long-term, driven by tone repetition over time), and robust temporal-expectation violation effects over and above the adaptation effects. Experiment 2 (n= 22) repeated Experiment 1 with shorter IOIs of 1.2 and 0.7 sec. Overall, we found evidence of strong delay-dependent adaptation effects, weak cumulative adaptation effects (which may most efficiently accumulate at the tone presentation rate of similar to 1 Hz), and robust temporal-expectation violation effects that substantially boost auditory responses to the extent of overriding the delay-dependent adaptation effects likely through mechanisms involved in exogenous attention.

Transfer Function Models for the Localization of Seizure Onset Zone From Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potentials	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						epilepsy; CCEPs; stimulation; SPES; seizure	PULSE ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; IDENTIFY EPILEPTOGENIC CORTEX; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN TEMPORAL-LOBE; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; CONNECTIVITY; RESPONSES; SURGERY; SYSTEM; SPREAD	Surgical resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) could potentially lead to seizure-freedom in medically refractory epilepsy patients. However, localizing the SOZ can be a time consuming and tedious process involving visual inspection of intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) recordings captured during passive patient monitoring. Cortical stimulation is currently performed on patients undergoing invasive EEG monitoring for the main purpose of mapping functional brain networks such as language and motor networks. We hypothesized that evoked responses from single pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) can also be used to localize the SOZ as they may express the natural frequencies and connectivity of the iEEG network. To test our hypothesis, we constructed patient specific transfer function models from the evoked responses recorded from 22 epilepsy patients that underwent SPES evaluation and iEEG monitoring. We then computed the frequency and connectivity dependent "peak gain" of the system as measured by the H infinity norm from systems theory. We found that in cases for which clinicians had high confidence in localizing the SOZ, the highest peak gain transfer functions with the smallest "floor gain" (gain at which the dipped H infinity 3dB below DC gain) corresponded to when the clinically annotated SOZ and early spread regions were stimulated. In more complex cases, there was a large spread of the peak-to-floor (PF) ratios when the clinically annotated SOZ was stimulated. Interestingly for patients who had successful surgeries, our ratio of gains, agreed with clinical localization, no matter the complexity of the case. For patients with failed surgeries, the PF ratio did not match clinical annotations. Our findings suggest that transfer function gains and their corresponding frequency responses computed from SPES evoked responses may improve SOZ localization and thus surgical outcomes.

Automatic classification of internal mental states in bistable perception	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Internal mental states; Bistable perception; MEG; Single-trial classification; Source reconstruction; SVM; ANN	NECKER CUBE REVERSALS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; ENHANCEMENT; RECOGNITION; PREDICTS; NETWORK; LEVEL; AREAS; EEG	The human brain goes through numerous cognitive states, most of these being hidden or implicit while performing a task, and understanding them is of great practical importance. However, identifying internal mental states is quite challenging as these states are difficult to label, usually short-lived, and generally, overlap with other tasks. One such problem pertains to bistable perception, which we consider to consist of two internal mental states, namely, transition and maintenance. The transition state is short-lived and represents a change in perception while the maintenance state is comparatively longer and represents a stable perception. In this study, we proposed a novel approach for characterizing the duration of transition and maintenance states and classified them from the neuromagnetic brain responses. Participants were presented with various types of ambiguous visual stimuli on which they indicated the moments of perceptual switches, while their magnetoencephalogram (MEG) data were recorded. We extracted different spatio-temporal features based on wavelet transform, and classified transition and maintenance states on a trial-by-trial basis. We obtained a classification accuracy of 79.58% and 78.40% using SVM and ANN classifiers, respectively. Next, we investigated the temporal fluctuations of these internal mental representations as captured by our classifier model and found that the accuracy showed a decreasing trend as the maintenance state was moved towards the next transition state. Further, to identify the neural sources corresponding to these internal mental states, we performed source analysis on MEG signals. We observed the involvement of sources from the parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and cerebellum in distinguishing transition and maintenance states. Cross-conditional classification analysis established generalization potential of wavelet features. Altogether, this study presents an automatic classification of endogenous mental states involved in bistable perception by establishing brain-behavior relationships at the single-trial level.

To explore the possible differences in the influence of motivation on behavioral performance and neural activity in high and low vigilance levels, we conducted a prolonged 2 h 20 min flanker task and provided monetary rewards during the 20- to 40- and 100- to 120-min intervals of task performance. Both the behavioral and electrophysiological measures were modulated by prolonged task engagement. Moreover, the effect of reward was different in high vs. low vigilance states. The monetary reward increased accuracy and decreased the reaction time (RT) and number of omitted responses in the low but not in the high vigilance state. The fatigue-related decrease in P300 amplitude recovered to its level in the high vigilance state by manipulating motivation, whereas the fatigue-related increase in P300 latency was not modulated by reward. Additionally, the fatigue-related increase in event-related spectral power at 1-4 Hz was sensitive to vigilance decrement and reward. However, the spectral power at 4-8 Hz was only affected by the decrease in vigilance. These electrophysiological measures were not influenced by motivation in the state of high vigilance. Our results suggest that neural processing capacity, but not the timing of processing, is sensitive to motivation. These findings also imply that the fatigue-related impairments in behavioral performance and neural activity underlying selective visual attention only partly recover after manipulating motivation. Furthermore, our results provide evidence for the dissociable neural mechanisms underlying the fatigue-related decrease vs. reward-related increase in attentional resources.

J	Galinsky, VL; Frank, LR				Galinsky, Vitaly L.; Frank, Lawrence R.			Brain Waves: Emergence of Localized, Persistent, Weakly Evanescent Cortical Loops	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HIPPOCAMPAL THETA-RHYTHM; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; NEOCORTICAL DYNAMICS; BIOLOGICAL TISSUES; STANDING WAVES; OSCILLATIONS; DIFFUSION; SPECTRUM; PROPAGATION; IMPEDANCE	An inhomogeneous anisotropic physical model of the brain cortex is presented that predicts the emergence of nonevanescent (weakly damped) wave-like modes propagating in the thin cortex layers transverse to both the mean neural fiber direction and the cortex spatial gradient. Although the amplitude of these modes stays below the typically observed axon spiking potential, the lifetime of these modes may significantly exceed the spiking potential inverse decay constant. Full-brain numerical simulations based on parameters extracted from diffusion and structural MRI confirm the existence and extended duration of these wave modes. Contrary to the commonly agreed paradigm that the neural fibers determine the pathways for signal propagation in the brain, the signal propagation because of the cortex wave modes in the highly folded areas will exhibit no apparent correlation with the fiber directions. Nonlinear coupling of those linear weakly evanescent wave modes then provides a universal mechanism for the emergence of synchronized brain wave field activity. The resonant and nonresonant terms of nonlinear coupling between multiple modes produce both synchronous spiking-like high-frequency wave activity as well as low-frequency wave rhythms. Numerical simulation of forced multiple-mode dynamics shows that, as forcing increases, there is a transition from damped to oscillatory regime that can then transition quickly to a nonoscillatory state when a critical excitation threshold is reached. The resonant nonlinear coupling results in the emergence of low-frequency rhythms with frequencies that are several orders of magnitude below the linear frequencies of modes taking part in the coupling. The localization and persistence of these weakly evanescent cortical wave modes have significant implications in particular for neuroimaging methods that detect electromagnetic physiological activity, such as EEG and magnetoencephalography, and for the understanding of brain activity in general, including mechanisms of memory.

Abnormal alpha band power in the dynamic pain connectome is a marker of chronic pain with a neuropathic component	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Chronic pain; Neuropathic pain; Magnetoencephalography; Default mode network; Salience network; Somatosensory cortex	ANKYLOSING-SPONDYLITIS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPAL; BRAIN; EEG; SIGNAL; THETA; PREVALENCE; COHERENCE	We previously identified alpha frequency slowing and beta attenuation in the dynamic pain connectome related to pain severity and interference in patients with multiple sclerosis-related neuropathic pain (NP). Here, we determined whether these abnormalities, are markers of aberrant temporal dynamics in non-neuropathic inflammatory pain (non-NP) or when NP is also suspected. We measured resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) spectral density in 45 people (17 females, 28 males) with chronic back pain due to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and 38 age/sex matched healthy controls. We used painDETECT scores to divide the chronic pain group into those with only non-NP (NNP) and those who likely also had a component of NP in addition to their inflammatory pain. We also assessed pain severity, pain interference, and disease activity with the Brief Pain Inventory and Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI). We examined spectral power in the dynamic pain connectome, including nodes of the ascending nociceptive pathway (ANP), default mode (DMN), and salience networks (SN). Compared to the healthy controls, the AS patients exhibited increased theta power in the DMN and decreased low-gamma power in the DMN and ANP, but did not exhibit beta-band attenuation or peak-alpha slowing. The NNP patients were not different from HCs. Compared to both healthy controls and NNP, NP patients had increased alpha power in the ANP. Increased alpha power within the ANP was associated with reduced BASDAI in the NNP group, and increased pain in the mixed-NP group within the DMN, SN, and ANP. Thus, high theta and low gamma activity may be markers of chronic pain but high alpha-band activity may relate to particular features of neuropathic chronic pain.

GABA(A) receptor beta 3 subunit mutation D120N causes Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in knock-in mice	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						genetic epilepsies; GABRB3; Lennox-Gastaut syndrome; early-onset epileptic encephalopathy; seizures	TREATMENT-RESISTANT EPILEPSY; DE-NOVO MUTATIONS; ABSENCE SEIZURES; INTERNEURON DYSFUNCTION; TONIC SEIZURES; MESSENGER-RNA; MODULATION; AUTISM; EXPRESSION; MANAGEMENT	The Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a devastating early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, associated with severe behavioural abnormalities. Its pathophysiology, however, is largely unknown. A de novo mutation (c.G358A, p.D120N) in the human GABA type-A receptor beta 3 subunit gene (GABRB3) has been identified in a patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. To determine whether the mutation causes Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in vivo in mice and to elucidate its mechanistic effects, we generated the heterozygous Gabrb3(+/D120N) knock-in mouse and found that it had frequent spontaneous atypical absence seizures, as well as less frequent tonic, myoclonic, atonic and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Each of these seizure types had a unique and characteristic ictal EEG. In addition, knock-in mice displayed abnormal behaviours seen in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome including impaired learning and memory, hyperactivity, impaired social interactions and increased anxiety. This Gabrb3 mutation did not alter GABA type-A receptor trafficking or expression in knock-in mice. However, cortical neurons in thalamocortical slices from knock-in mice had reduced miniature inhibitory post-synaptic current amplitude and prolonged spontaneous thalamocortical oscillations. Thus, the Gabrb3(+/D120N) knock-in mouse recapitulated human Lennox-Gastaut syndrome seizure types and behavioural abnormalities and was caused by impaired inhibitory GABAergic signalling in the thalamocortical loop. In addition, treatment with antiepileptic drugs and cannabinoids ameliorated atypical absence seizures in knock-in mice. This congenic knock-in mouse demonstrates that a single-point mutation in a single gene can cause development of multiple types of seizures and multiple behavioural abnormalities. The knock-in mouse will be useful for further investigation of the mechanisms of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome development and for the development of new antiepileptic drugs and treatments.

Both sleep and anesthesia comprise states of varying levels of arousal and consciousness, including states of largely maintained conscious experience (sleep: N1, REM; anesthesia: sedated but responsive) as well as states of substantially reduced conscious experience (sleep: N2/N3; anesthesia: unresponsive). Here, we tested the hypotheses that (1) cortical connectivity will exhibit clear changes when transitioning into states of reduced consciousness, and (2) these changes will be similar for arousal states of comparable levels of consciousness during sleep and anesthesia. Using intracranial recordings from five adult neurosurgical patients, we compared resting state cortical functional connectivity (as measured by weighted phase lag index, wPLI) in the same subjects across arousal states during natural sleep [wake (WS), N1, N2, N3, REM] and propofol anesthesia [pre-drug wake (WA), sedated/responsive (S), and unresponsive (U)]. Analysis of alpha-band connectivity indicated a transition boundary distinguishing states of maintained and reduced conscious experience in both sleep and anesthesia. In wake states WS and WA, alphaband wPLI within the temporal lobe was dominant. This pattern was largely unchanged in N1, REM, and S. Transitions into states of reduced consciousness N2, N3, and U were characterized by dramatic changes in connectivity, with dominant connections shifting to prefrontal cortex. Secondary analyses indicated similarities in reorganization of cortical connectivity in sleep and anesthesia. Shifts from temporal to frontal cortical connectivity may reflect impaired sensory processing in states of reduced consciousness. The data indicate that functional connectivity can serve as a biomarker of arousal state and suggest common mechanisms of LOC in sleep and anesthesia.

J	Edgar, JC				Edgar, J. Christopher			Identifying electrophysiological markers of autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia against a backdrop of normal brain development	PSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCES			English	Review						alpha; auditory steady-state response; autism spectrum disorders; maturation; schizophrenia	AUDITORY-EVOKED RESPONSE; STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; EEG-ALPHA; CORTICAL DEVELOPMENT; BAND OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; NORMAL-CHILDREN; GAMMA; AGE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM	An examination of electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic studies demonstrates how age-related changes in brain neural function temporally constrain their use as diagnostic markers. A first example shows that, given maturational changes in the resting-state peak alpha frequency in typically developing children but not in children who have autism spectrum disorder (ASD), group differences in alpha-band activity characterize only a subset of children who have ASD. A second example, auditory encoding processes in schizophrenia, shows that the complication of normal age-related brain changes on detecting and interpreting group differences in neural activity is not specific to children. MRI studies reporting group differences in the rate of brain maturation demonstrate that a group difference in brain maturation may be a concern for all diagnostic brain markers. Attention to brain maturation is needed whether one takes a DSM-5 or a Research Domain Criteria approach to research. For example, although there is interest in cross-diagnostic studies comparing brain measures in ASD and schizophrenia, such studies are difficult given that measures are obtained in one group well after and in the other much closer to the onset of symptoms. In addition, given differences in brain activity among infants, toddlers, children, adolescents, and younger and older adults, creating tasks and research designs that produce interpretable findings across the life span and yet allow for development is difficult at best. To conclude, brain imaging findings show an effect of brain maturation on diagnostic markers separate from (and potentially difficult to distinguish from) effects of disease processes.

Reduced parietal alpha power and psychotic symptoms: Test-retest reliability of resting-state magnetoencephalography in schizophrenia and healthy controls	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; MEG; Test-retest reliability; Resting-state; Spectral power; Symptoms	GAMMA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NETWORK CONNECTIVITY; CLINICAL SYMPTOMS; FIRST-EPISODE; MEG; EEG; SENSOR; FMRI	Background: Despite increased reporting of resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG), reliability of those measures remains scarce and predominately reported in healthy controls (HC). As such, there is limited knowledge on MEG resting-state reliability in schizophrenia (SZ). Methods: To address test-retest reliability in psychosis, a reproducibility study of 26 participants (13-SZ, 13-HC) was performed. We collected eyes open and eyes closed resting-state data during 4 separate instances (2 Visits, 2 runs per visit) to estimate spectral power reliability (power, normalized power, alpha reactivity) across one hour and one week. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated. For source modeling, we applied an anatomically constrained linear estimation inverse model known as dynamic statistical parametric mapping (MNE dSPM) and source-based connectivity using the weighted phase lag index. Results: Across one week there was excellent test-retest reliability in global spectral measures in theta-gamma bands (HC ICCAvg = 0.87, SZ ICCAvg = 0.87), regional spectral measures in all bands (HC ICCAvg = 0.86, SZ ICCAvg = 0.80), and parietal alpha measures (HC ICCAvg = 0.90, SZ ICCAvg = 0.84). Conversely, functional connectivity had poor reliability, as did source spectral power across one hour for SZ. Relative to HC, SZ also had reduced parietal alpha normalized power during eyes closed only, reduced alpha reactivity, and an association between higher PANSS positive scores and lower parietal alpha power. Conclusions: There was excellent to good test-retest reliability in most MEG spectral measures with a few exceptions in the schizophrenia patient group. Overall, these findings encourage the use of resting-state MEG while emphasizing the importance of determining reliability in clinical populations. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Transitions between neocortical seizure and non-seizure-like states and their association with presynaptic glutamate release	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Seizure; Electrophysiology; Classification; Prediction; Neocortex; Seizure-like events; Presynaptic; Epilepsy; Glutamate; Adenosine	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; ADENOSINE RECEPTORS; IN-VIVO; NETWORK; EPILEPSY; NEURONS; BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; CANNABINOIDS	The transition between seizure and non-seizure states in neocortical epileptic networks is governed by distinct underlying dynamical processes. Based on the gamma distribution of seizure and inter-seizure durations, over time, seizures are highly likely to self-terminate; whereas, inter-seizure durations have a low chance of transitioning back into a seizure state. Yet, the chance of a state transition could be formed by multiple overlapping, unknown synaptic mechanisms. To identify the relationship between the underlying synaptic mechanisms and the chance of seizure-state transitions, we analyzed the skewed histograms of seizure durations in human intracranial EEG and seizure-like events (SLEs) in local field potential activity from mouse neocortical slices, using an objective method for seizure state classification. While seizures and SLE durations were demonstrated to have a unimodal distribution (gamma distribution shape parameter 1), suggesting a high likelihood of terminating, inter-SLE intervals were shown to have an asymptotic exponential distribution (gamma distribution shape parameter < 1), suggesting lower probability of cessation. Then, to test cellular mechanisms for these distributions, we studied the modulation of synaptic neurotransmission during, and between, the in vitro SLEs. Using simultaneous local field potential and whole-cell voltage clamp recordings, we found a suppression of presynaptic glutamate release at SLE termination, as demonstrated by electricallyand optogenetically-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), and focal hypertonic sucrose application. Adenosine A1 receptor blockade interfered with the suppression of this release, changing the inter-SLE shape parameter from asymptotic exponential to unimodal, altering the chance of state transition occurrence with time. These findings reveal a critical role for presynaptic glutamate release in determining the chance of neocortical seizure state transitions.

J	Li, ZH; Dong, ZX; Bai, XC; Liu, MX				Li, Zhaohui; Dong, Zengxin; Bai, Xiaochen; Liu, Mingxin			Characterizing the orientation selectivity in V1 and V4 of macaques by quadratic phase coupling	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						orientation selectivity; local field potential; wavelet bicoherence; quadratic phase coupling	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; WAVELET BICOHERENCE; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; TIME-VARIANT; NEURAL BASIS; CORTEX; EEG; CONSCIOUSNESS; COMMUNICATION	Objective. Orientation selectivity is one of the significant characteristics of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1). Some neurons in extrastriate visual cortical areas also exhibit certain orientation selectivity. But it is still not well understood that how the orientation selectivity generates. Most previous studies about the orientation selectivity are based on the spike firing rate. However, the spikes are prone to be biased by the detection and sorting algorithms. Then, in this paper, the local field potential (LFP) is adopted to investigate the mechanism of orientation selectivity.Approach.We used the quadratic phase coupling (QPC), which was calculated by wavelet bicoherence, to describe the characteristics of orientation selectivity available in V1 and V4. The raw wideband neural signals were recorded by two chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays, which were placed in V1 and V4 respectively in two macaques performing a selective visual attention task.Main results.There is a strong correlation between the total bicoherence (TotalBic), which is a quantization for the overall QPC of frequency pairs in gamma band, and the grating orientation. Furthermore, the QPC distribution at the non-preferred orientation is mainly concentrated in the low frequencies (30-40 Hz) of gamma; while the QPC distribution at the preferred orientation concentrates in both the low frequencies and high frequencies (60-80 Hz) of gamma. In addition, theTotalBicof the gamma-band LFP between V1 and V4 varies with the grating orientations, indicating that the QPC is available in the feedforward link and the gamma-band LFP in V1 modulates the QPC in V4.Significance.The QPC reflects the orientations of the sinusoidal grating and describes the interaction of gamma-band LFP between different brain regions. Our results suggest that the QPC is an alternative avenue to explore the mechanism for generating orientation selectivity of visual neurons effectively.

At present, the mechanism of SSVEP subharmonic is ambiguous. The induced factors and power variation of the SSVEP subharmonics were studied by a visual cortex network model in this paper. Further, the SSVEP of 20 subjects' head surface was tested to verify the simulation results. The simulation and experimental results show that the stimulus frequency, stimulus intensity and noise intensity are three important parameters that affect the 1/2 subharmonic induction and power change of SSVEP. Subharmonic is induced by the synergistic action of three parameters: a. when the stimulus frequency and noise intensity are same, the curve of 1/2 subharmonic power with stimulus intensity is similar to sigma function, and there are non-induction region, linear growth region and saturation region: in non-induction region, 1/2 subharmonic power is approximately 0; in linear growth region, 1/2 subharmonic power is proportional to stimulus intensity; in saturation region, 1/2 subharmonic power tends to be constant; b. when the noise intensity is same, the stimulus parameters area that can induce the 1/2 subharmonic obviously is similar with arnold tongue in nonlinear synchronization, that is, the effective stimulus frequency range widen with the increase of stimulus intensity; c. when the stimulus parameter is same, the noise intensity determines the 1/2 subharmonic energy; the higher the noise intensity is, the stronger restraining effect of inducing 1/2 subharmonic and power is. The experiment and simulation results in this paper are basically consistent, which shows the feasibility of model simulation. The research results provide theoretical and experimental basis for understanding the generation mechanism and effective application of SSVEP subharmonics.

J	Zimmermann, J; Ross, B; Moscovitch, M; Alain, C				Zimmermann, Jacqueline; Ross, Bernhard; Moscovitch, Morris; Alain, Claude			Neural dynamics supporting auditory long-term memory effects on target detection	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Attention; Memory; Memory-guided attention; EEG; Auditory; Contextual cueing	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; HEARING SUBJECTS; BAND ACTIVITY; IMPLICIT; SLEEP; FAMILIARITY; PERCEPTION	Auditory long-term memory has been shown to facilitate signal detection. However, the nature and timing of the cognitive processes supporting such benefits remain equivocal. We measured neuroelectric brain activity while young adults were presented with a contextual memory cue designed to assist with the detection of a faint pure tone target embedded in an audio clip of an everyday environmental scene (e.g., the soundtrack of a restaurant). During an initial familiarization task, participants heard such audio clips, half of which included a target sound (memory cue trials) at a specific time and location (left or right ear), as well as audio clips without a target (neutral trials). Following a 1-h or 24-h retention interval, the same audio clips were presented, but now all included a target. Participants were asked to press a button as soon as they heard the pure tone target. Overall, participants were faster and more accurate during memory than neutral cue trials. The auditory contextual memory effects on performance coincided with three temporally and spatially distinct neural modulations, which encompassed changes in the amplitude of event-related potential as well as changes in theta, alpha, beta and gamma power. Brain electrical source analyses revealed greater source activity in memory than neutral cue trials in the right superior temporal gyrus and left parietal cortex. Conversely, neutral trials were associated with greater source activity than memory cue trials in the left posterior medial temporal lobe. Target detection was associated with increased negativity (N2), and a late positive (P3b) wave at frontal and parietal sites, respectively. The effect of auditory contextual memory on brain activity preceding target onset showed little lateralization. Together, these results are consistent with contextual memory facilitating retrieval of target-context associations and deployment and management of auditory attentional resources to when the target occurred. The results also suggest that the auditory cortices, parietal cortex, and medial temporal lobe may be parts of a neural network enabling memory-guided attention during auditory scene analysis.

This pathway has great promise in treatment of depression and suicidality. The KP modulator AV-101 (4-chlorokynurenine, 4-Cl-KYN), an oral prodrug of 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7-Cl-KYNA), an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) glycine site antagonist, and of 4-chloro-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (4-Cl-3-HAA), a suppressor of NMDAR agonist quinolinic acid (QUIN), is a promising potential antidepressant that targets glutamate functioning via the KP. However, a recent placebo-controlled clinical trial of AV-101 in depression found negative results. This raises the question of whether AV-101 can penetrate the brain and engage the NMDAR and KP effectively. To address this problem, ten healthy US military veterans (mean age = 32.6 years +/- 6.11; 1 female) completed a phase-1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to examine dose-related effects of AV-101 (720 and 1440 mg) on NMDAR engagement measured by gamma-frequency band auditory steady-state response (40 Hz ASSR) and resting EEG. Linear mixed models revealed that 1440 mg AV-101, but not 720 mg, increased 40 Hz ASSR and 40 Hz ASSR gamma-inter-trial phase coherence relative to placebo. AV-101 also increased 4-Cl-KYN, 7-Cl-KYNA, 4-Cl-3-HAA, 3-HAA, and KYNA in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting KYN and QUIN. AV-101 was safe and well tolerated. These results corroborate brain target engagement of 1440 mg AV-101 in humans, consistent with blockade of interneuronal NMDAR blockade. Future studies should test higher doses of AV-101 in depression. Suicidal behavior, which has been associated with high QUIN and low KYNA, is also a potential target for AV-101.

This opens an avenue for bidirectional translational strategies to address fundamental questions ranging from neurological disorders to the nature of consciousness. The key challenges of murine fMRI are: (1) to generate and maintain functional brain states that approximate those of calm and relaxed human volunteers, while (2) preserving neurovascular coupling and physiological baseline conditions. Low-dose anesthetic protocols are commonly applied in murine functional brain studies to prevent stress and facilitate a calm and relaxed condition among animals. Yet, current mono-anesthesia has been shown to impair neural transmission and hemodynamic integrity. By linking the current state of murine electrophysiology, Ca2+ imaging and fMRI of anesthetic effects to findings from human studies, this systematic review proposes general principles to design, apply and monitor anesthetic protocols in a more sophisticated way. The further development of balanced multimodal anesthesia, combining two or more drugs with complementary modes of action helps to shape and maintain specific brain states and relevant aspects of murine physiology. Functional connectivity and its dynamic repertoire as assessed by fMRI can be used to make inferences about cortical states and provide additional information about whole-brain functional dynamics. Based on this, a simple and comprehensive functional neurosignature pattern can be determined for use in defining brain states and anesthetic depth in rest and in response to stimuli. Such a signature can be evaluated and shared between labs to indicate the brain state of a mouse during experiments, an important step toward translating findings across species.

Assessment of a Non Invasive Brain Oximeter in Volunteers Undergoing Acute Hypoxia	MEDICAL DEVICES-EVIDENCE AND RESEARCH			English	Article						oximetry; brain injury; brain; volunteer; hypoxia; monitor	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; ARTERIAL CARBON-DIOXIDE; TISSUE OXYGEN; EXTRACRANIAL CONTAMINATION; ALTITUDE; INJURY; EEG; ULTRASOUND; PERFUSION	Introduction: Research in traumatic brain injury suggests better patient outcomes when invasive oxygen monitoring is used to detect and correct episodes of brain hypoxia. Invasive brain oxygen monitoring is, however, not routinely used due to the risks, costs and technical challengers. We are developing a non-invasive brain oximeter to address these limitations. The monitor uses the principles of pulse oximetry to record a brain photoplethysmographic waveform and oxygen saturations. We undertook a study in volunteers to assess the new monitor. Patients and Methods: We compared the temporal changes in the brain and skin oxygen saturations in six volunteers undergoing progressive hypoxia to reach arterial saturations of 70%. This approach provides a method to discriminate potential contamination of the brain signal by skin oxygen levels, as the responses in brain and skin oxygen saturations are distinct due to the auto-regulation of cerebral blood flow to compensate for hypoxia. Conventional pulse oximetry was used to assess skin oxygen levels. Blood was also collected from the internal jugular vein and correlated with the brain oximeter oxygen levels. Results: At baseline, a photoplethysmographic waveform consistent with that expected from the brain was obtained in five subjects. The signal was adequate to assess oxygen saturations in three subjects. During hypoxia, the brain's oximeter oxygen saturation fell to 74%, while skin saturation fell to 50% (P<0.0001). The brain photoplethysmographic waveform developed a high-frequency oscillation of similar to 7 Hz, which was not present in the skin during hypoxia. A weak correlation between the brain oximeter and proximal internal jugular vein oxygen levels was demonstrated, R-2 =0.24, P=0.01. Conclusion: Brain oximeter oxygen saturations were relatively well preserved compared to the skin during hypoxia. These findings are consistent with the expected physiological responses and suggest skin oxygen levels did not markedly contaminate the brain oximeter signal.

J	Kesserwani, H				Kesserwani, Hassan			The Clinical, Philosophical, Evolutionary and Mathematical Machinery of Consciousness: An Analytic Dissection of the Field Theories and a Consilience of Ideas	CUREUS			English	Review						brain anatomy; philosophy; disorders of consciousness; anatomy & physiology	CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MULTIPLE; PATTERNS; EEG	The Cartesian model of mind-body dualism concurs with religious traditions. However, science has supplanted this idea with an energy-matter theory of consciousness, where matter is equivalent to the body and energy replaces the mind or soul. This equivalency is analogous to the concept of the interchange of mass and energy as expressed by Einstein's famous equation E = mc(2). Immanuel Kant, in his Critique of Pure Reason, provided the intellectual and theoretical framework for a theory of mind or consciousness. Any theory of consciousness must include the fact that a conscious entity, as far as is known, is a wet biological medium (the brain), of stupendously high entropy. This organ or entity generates a field that must account for the "binding problem", which we will define. This proposed field, the conscious electro-magnetic information (CEMI) field, also has physical properties, which we will outline. We will also demonstrate the seamless transition of the Kantian philosophy of the a priori conception of space and time, the organs of perception and conception, into the CEMI field of consciousness. We will explore the concept of the CEMI field and its neurophysiological correlates, and in particular, synchronous and coherent gamma oscillations of various neuronal ensembles, as in William J Freeman's experiments in the early 1970s with olfactory perception in rabbits. The expansion of the temporo-parietal-occipital (TPO) cortex in hominid evolution epitomizes metaphorical and abstract thinking. This area of the cortex, with synchronous thalamo-cortical oscillations has the best fit for a minimal neural correlate of consciousness. Our field theory shifts consciousness from an abstract idea to a tangible energy with defined properties and a mathematical framework. Even further, it is not a coincidence that the cerebral cortex is very thin with respect to the diameter of the brain. This is in keeping with its fantastically high entropy, as we see in the event horizon of a black hole and the conformal field theory/anti-de Sitter (CFT/ADS) holographic model of the universe. We adumbrate the uniqueness of consciousness of an advanced biological system such as the human brain and draw insight from Avicenna's gendanken, floating man thought experiment. The multi-system high volume afferentation of a biological wet system honed after millions of years of evolution, its high entropy, and the CEMI field variation inducing currents in motor output pathways are proposed to spark the seeds of consciousness. We will also review Karl Friston's free energy principle, the concept of belief-update in a Bayesian inference framework, the minimization of the divergence of prior and posterior probability distributions, and the entropy of the brain. We will streamline these highly technical papers, which view consciousness as a minimization principle akin to Hilbert's action in deriving Einstein's field equation or Feynman's sum of histories in quantum mechanics. Consciousness here is interpreted as flow of probability densities on a Riemmanian manifold, where the gradient of ascent on this manifold across contour lines determines the magnitude of perception or the degree of update of the belief-system in a Bayesian inference model. Finally, the science of consciousness has transcended metaphysics and its study is now rooted in the latest advances of neurophysiology, neuro-radiology under the aegis of mathematics.

Numerous cellular studies in animals and brain slices have demonstrated that long-term potentiation (LTP) enhances synaptic transmission, which can be evoked by high-frequency intermittent stimulation. In humans, plasticity processes underlying perceptual learning can be reliably induced by repetitive, LTP-like sensory stimulation. These protocols lead to improvement of perceptual abilities parallel to widespread remodeling of cortical processing. However, whether maintained rhythmic cortical activation induced by the LTP-like stimulation is also present during human perceptual learning experiments, remains elusive. To address this question, we here applied a 20 Hz intermittent stimulation protocol for 40 min to the index-, middle- and ring-fingers of the right hand, while continuously recording EEG over the hand representation in primary somatosensory cortex in young adult participants. We find that each train of stimulation initiates a transient series of sensory-evoked potentials which accumulate after about 500 ms into a 20 Hz steady-state response persisting over the entire period of the 2-s-train. During the inter-train interval, no consistent evoked activity can be detected. This response behavior is maintained over the whole 40 min of stimulation without any indication of habituation. However, the early stimulation evoked potentials (SEPs) and the event-related desynchronization (ERD) during the steady-state response change over the 40 min of stimulation. In a second experiment, we demonstrate in a separate cohort of participants that the here-applied pneumatic type of stimulation results in improvement of tactile acuity as typically observed for electrically applied 20 Hz intermittent stimulation. Our data demonstrate that repetitive stimulation using a 20 Hz protocol drives rhythmic activation in the hand representation of somatosensory cortex, which is sustained during the entire stimulation period. At the same time, cortical excitability increases as indicated by altered ERD and SEP amplitudes. Our results, together with previous data underlining the dependence of repetitive sensory stimulation effects on NMDA-receptor activation, support the view that repetitive sensory stimulation elicits LTP-like processes in the cortex, thereby facilitating perceptual learning processes.

Altered Resting-State Neural Oscillations and Spectral Power in Children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder	ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder(1); MEG(2); Resting&#8208; State(3); Fetal Alcohol Syndrome(4); Alcohol&#8208; Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder(5)	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY ABNORMALITIES; WORKING-MEMORY; EEG; MEG; PREVALENCE; EXPOSURE; ATTENTION; INFANTS; CONSEQUENCES; ADOLESCENTS	Background Consumption of alcohol during pregnancy impacts fetal development and may lead to a variety of physical, cognitive, and behavioral abnormalities in childhood collectively known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The FASD spectrum includes children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS), and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND). Children with a FASD or prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) have impaired white matter, reduced structural volumes, impaired resting-state functional connectivity when measured with fMRI, and spectral hypersynchrony as infants. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) provides high temporal resolution and good spatial precision for examining spectral power and connectivity patterns unique from fMRI. The impact of PAE on MEG resting-state spectral power in children remains unknown. Methods We collected 2 minutes of eyes-open and eyes-closed resting-state data in 51 children (8 to 12 years of age) with 3 subgroups included: 10 ARND/PAE, 15 FAS/pFAS, and 26 controls (TDC). MEG data were collected on the Elekta Neuromag system. The following spectral metrics were compared between subgroups: power, normalized power, half power, 95% power, and Shannon spectral entropy (SSE). MEG spectral data were correlated with behavioral measures. Results Our results indicate children with FAS/pFAS had reduced spectral power and normalized power, particularly within the alpha frequency band in sensor parietal and source superior parietal and lateral occipital regions, along with elevated half power, 95% power, and SSE. We also found select hemisphere specific effects further indicating reduced corpus callosum connectivity in children with a FASD. Interestingly, while the ARND/PAE subgroup had significant differences from the FAS/pFAS subgroup, in many cases spectral data were not significantly different from TDC. Conclusions Our results were consistent with previous studies and provide new insight into resting-state oscillatory differences both between children with FAS and TDC, and within FASD subgroups. Further understanding of these resting-state variations and their impact on cognitive function may help provide early targets for intervention and enhance outcomes for individuals with a FASD.

Methods: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was performed in 33 children with BECTS and 18 healthy children. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, fourth edition (WISC-IV) was used to divide children with BECTS into two groups. Normal cognitive function was defined as a full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) of >80, while decreased cognitive function was defined as a FSIQ of <80. Accumulated source imaging was used to evaluate the neuromagnetic source activity in multifrequency bands. Results: Of the 33 patients with early untreated BECTS, a total of 17 had a FSIQ of <80 and 16 had FSIQ of >80. The course of epilepsy and number of seizures in the FSIQ <80 group were higher than that in the FSIQ>80 group. Our MEG results showed that in the 4-8 Hz frequency band, both patient groups had inactivation of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) region compared with the healthy control group. In the 30-80 Hz frequency band, the FSIQ <80 group showed inactivation of the PCC region compared with both the healthy control group and the FSIQ >80 group. In the 80-250 Hz frequency band, the FSIQ <80 group had inactivated of the medial frontal cortex (MFC) region compared with the healthy control group. In the 30-80 Hz frequency band, the strength of neuromagnetic source in patients with BECTS with FSIQ <80 was higher than that in the FSIQ >80 group and the healthy control group. Conclusions: The magnetic source inactivation of the MEC and PCC regions during the interictal time may be the reason for cognitive decline in early untreated children with SECTS. Children with BECTS with cognitive decline had a longer course of epilepsy and more seizures. The magnetic source localization in the 4-8 Hz frequency band may be a new imaging marker for the diagnosis of new BECTS. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

J	Arthaud, S; Libourel, PA; Luppi, PH; Peyron, C				Arthaud, Sebastien; Libourel, Paul-Antoine; Luppi, Pierre-Herve; Peyron, Christelle			Insights into paradoxical (REM) sleep homeostatic regulation in mice using an innovative automated sleep deprivation method	SLEEP			English	Article						sleep; stress; oscillation; EEG; polysomnography; homeostasis; REM sleep; deprivation method	MELANIN-CONCENTRATING HORMONE; NEURONS; RAT; ACTIVATION	Identifying the precise neuronal networks activated during paradoxical sleep (PS, also called REM sleep) has been a challenge since its discovery. Similarly, our understanding of the homeostatic mechanisms regulating PS, whether through external modulation by circadian and ultradian drives or via intrinsic homeostatic regulation, is still limited, largely due to interfering factors rendering the investigation difficult. Indeed, none of the studies published so far were able to manipulate PS without significantly altering slowwave sleep and/or stress level, thus introducing a potential bias in the analyses. With the aim of achieving a better understanding of PS homeostasis, we developed a new method based on automated scoring of vigilance states-using electroencephalogram and electromyogram features-and which involves closed-loop PS deprivation through the induction of cage floor movements when PS is detected. Vigilance states were analyzed during 6 and 48 h of PS deprivation as well as their following recovery periods. Using this new automated methodology, we were able to deprive mice of PS with high efficiency and specificity, for short or longer periods of time, observing no sign of stress (as evaluated by plasma corticosterone level and sleep latency) and requiring no human intervention or environmental changes. We show here that PS can be homeostatically modulated and regulated while no significant changes are induced on slow-wave sleep and wakefulness, with a PS rebound duration depending on the amount of prior PS deficit. We also show that PS interval duration is not correlated with prior PS episode duration in the context of recovery from PS deprivation. Statement of Significance A large body of controversial literature has been produced trying to reveal the nature of paradoxical sleep (REM sleep) homeostatic regulation. In these studies, paradoxical sleep was challenged by different means, using total sleep deprivation, more or less specific PS deprivation, and most of the time inducing a fair amount of stress. Here we report using an innovative method allowing to highly specifically deprive mice of paradoxical sleep without significantly modifying other vigilance states, that paradoxical sleep homeostatic regulation depends only on the prior amount of paradoxical sleep deficit. Gaining a better understating on how paradoxical sleep is regulated is crucial in helping to treat its comorbid dysregulation in diseases such as anxiety disorders.

FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						alcohol dependence; electroencephalogram; endophenotypes; incentive salience; negative emotionality; executive dimension; event-related potential	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION; ATTENTIONAL BIAS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CUE REACTIVITY; DRUG-ADDICTION; BRAIN ACTIVITY; ABSTINENT ALCOHOLICS; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; EMOTION REGULATION	Addiction management is complex, and it requires a bio-psycho-social perspective, that ought to consider the multiple etiological and developmental factors. Because of this, a large amount of resources has been allocated to assess the vulnerability to dependence, i.e., to identify the processes underlying the transition from substance use to dependence, as well as its course, in order to determine the key points in its prevention, treatment, and recovery. Consequently, knowledge \from neuroscience must be taken into account, which is why different initiatives have emerged with this objective, such as the "Research Domain Criteria" (RDoC), and the "Addiction Neuroclinical Assessment" (ANA). Particularly, neuropsychophysiological measures could be used as markers of cognitive and behavioral attributes or traits in alcohol dependence, and even trace clinical change. In this way, the aim of this narrative review is to provide an overview following ANA clinical framework, to the most robust findings in neuropsychophysiological changes in alcohol dependence, that underlie the main cognitive domains implicated in addiction: incentive salience, negative emotionality, and executive functioning. The most consistent results have been found in event-related potential (ERP) analysis, especially in the P3 component, that could show a wide clinical utility, mainly for the executive functions. The review also shows the usefulness of other components, implicated in affective and substance-related processing (P1, N1, or the late positive potential LPP), as well as event-related oscillations, such as theta power, with a possible use as vulnerability or clinical marker in alcohol dependence. Finally, new tools emerging from psychophysiology research, based on functional connectivity or brain graph analysis could help toward a better understanding of altered circuits in alcohol dependence, as well as communication efficiency and effort during mental operations. This review concludes with an examination of these tools as possible markers in the clinical field and discusses methodological differences, the need for more replicability studies and incipient lines of work. It also uses consistent findings in psychophysiology to draw possible treatment targets and cognitive profiles in alcohol dependence.

In dynamic auditory scenes, changes in talker settings require rapid shifts of attention, which is especially relevant when the position of a target talker switches from one location to another. Here, we explored electrophysiological correlates of shifts in spatial auditory attention, using a free-field speech perception task, in which sequences of short words (a company name, followed by a numeric value, e.g., "Bosch-6") were presented in the participants' left and right horizontal plane. Younger and older participants responded to the value of a pre-defined target company, while ignoring three simultaneously presented pairs of concurrent company names and values from different locations. All four stimulus pairs were spoken by different talkers, alternating from trial-to-trial. The location of the target company was within either the left or right hemisphere for a variable number of consecutive trials (between 3 and 42 trials) and then changed, switching from the left to the right hemispace or vice versa. Thus, when a switch occurred, the participants had to search for the new position of the target company among the concurrent streams of auditory information and re-focus their attention on the relevant location. As correlates of lateralized spatial auditory attention, the anterior contralateral N2 subcomponent (N2ac) and the posterior alpha power lateralization were analyzed in trials immediately before and after switches of the target location. Both measures were increased after switches, while only the increase in N2ac was related to better speech perception performance (i.e., a reduced post-switch decline in accuracy). While both age groups showed a similar pattern of switch-related attentional modulations, N2ac and alpha lateralization to the task-relevant stimulus (the target company's value) was overall greater in the younger, than older, group. The results suggest that N2ac and alpha lateralization reflect different attentional processes in multi-talker speech perception, the first being primarily associated with auditory search and the focusing of attention, and the second with the in-depth attentional processing of taskrelevant information. Especially the second process appears to be prone to age-related cognitive decline. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

When the hand is paralyzed following a stroke for example, a robotic orthosis, functional electrical stimulation (FES) or their combination may provide movement assistance; i.e., the corresponding sensory and proprioceptive neurofeedback is given contingent to the movement intention or imagination, thereby closing the sensorimotor loop. Controlling these devices may be challenging or even frustrating. Direct comparisons between these two feedback modalities (robotics vs. FES) with regard to the workload they pose for the user are, however, missing. Twenty healthy subjects controlled a BMI by kinesthetic motor imagery of finger extension. Motor imagery-related sensorimotor desynchronization in the EEG beta frequency-band (17-21 Hz) was turned into passive opening of the contralateral hand by a robotic orthosis or FES in a randomized, cross-over block design. Mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration level were captured with the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) questionnaire by comparing these workload components to each other (weights), evaluating them individually (ratings), and estimating the respective combinations (adjusted workload ratings). The findings were compared to the task-related aspects of active hand movement with EMG feedback. Furthermore, both feedback modalities were compared with regard to their BMI performance. Robotic and FES feedback had similar workloads when weighting and rating the different components. For both robotics and FES, mental demand was the most relevant component, and higher than during active movement with EMG feedback. The FES task led to significantly more physical (p= 0.0368) and less temporal demand (p= 0.0403) than the robotic task in the adjusted workload ratings. Notably, the FES task showed a physical demand 2.67 times closer to the EMG task, but a mental demand 6.79 times closer to the robotic task. On average, significantly more onsets were reached during the robotic as compared to the FES task (17.22 onsets, SD = 3.02 vs. 16.46, SD = 2.94 out of 20 opportunities;p= 0.016), even though there were no significant differences between the BMI classification accuracies of the conditions (p= 0.806; CI = -0.027 to -0.034). These findings may inform the design of neurorehabilitation interfaces toward human-centered hardware for a more natural bidirectional interaction and acceptance by the user.

Currently, electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely used by the clinicians to diagnose MI patients due to its inexpensiveness and non-invasive nature. Pathological alterations provoked by MI cause slow conduction by increasing axial resistance on coupling between cells. This issue may cause abnormal patterns in the dynamics of the tip of the cardiac vector in the ECG signals. However, manual interpretation of the pathological alternations induced by MI is a time-consuming, tedious and subjective task. To overcome such disadvantages, computer-aided diagnosis techniques including signal processing and artificial intelligence tools have been developed. In this study we propose a novel technique for automatic detection of MI based on hybrid feature extraction and artificial intelligence tools. Tunable quality factor (Q-factor) wavelet transform (TQWT), variational mode decomposition (VMD) and phase space reconstruction (PSR) are utilized to extract representative features to form cardiac vectors with synthesis of the standard 12-lead and Frank XYZ leads. They are combined with neural networks to model, identify and detect abnormal patterns in the dynamics of cardiac system caused by MI. First, 12-lead ECG signals are reduced to 3-dimensional VCG signals, which are synthesized with Frank XYZ leads to build a hybrid 4-dimensional cardiac vector. Second, this vector is decomposed into a set of frequency subbands with a number of decomposition levels by using the TQWT method. Third, VMD is employed to decompose the subband of the 4-dimensional cardiac vector into different intrinsic modes, in which the first intrinsic mode contains the majority of the cardiac vector's energy and is considered to be the predominant intrinsic mode. It is selected to construct the reference variable for analysis. Fourth, phase space of the reference variable is reconstructed, in which the properties associated with the nonlinear cardiac system dynamics are preserved. Three-dimensional (3D) PSR together with Euclidean distance (ED) has been utilized to derive features, which demonstrate significant difference in cardiac system dynamics between normal (healthy) and MI cardiac vector signals. Fifth, cardiac system dynamics can be modeled and identified using neural networks, which employ the ED of 3D PSR of the reference variable as the input features. The difference of cardiac system dynamics between healthy control and MI cardiac vector is computed and used for the detection of MI based on a bank of estimators. Finally, data sets, which include conventional 12-lead and Frank XYZ leads ECG signal fragments from 148 patients with MI and 52 healthy controls from PTB diagnostic ECG database, are used for evaluation. By using the 10-fold cross-validation style, the achieved average classification accuracy is reported to be 97.98%. Currently, ST segment evaluation is one of the major and traditional ways for the MI detection. However, there exist weak or even undetectable ST segments in many ECG signals. Since the proposed method does not rely on the information of ST waves, it can serve as a complementary MI detection algorithm in the intensive care unit (ICU) of hospitals to assist the clinicians in confirming their diagnosis. Overall, our results verify that the pro- posed features may satisfactorily reflect cardiac system dynamics, and are complementary to the existing ECG features for automatic cardiac function analysis.
