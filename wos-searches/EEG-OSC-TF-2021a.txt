An accurate and robust time-frequency analysis tool with high resolution would facilitate the understanding of TMS-evoked oscillations. Methods: The synchrosqueezing transform (SST), the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) and the Morlet wavelet transform (MWT) were used to analyze TMS-evoked oscillations. Firstly, we generated simulation data, and compared the performance of three methods to analyze the time-frequency characteristics of simulation data; then, we collected TMS-EEG data from normal people (NOR), patients with minimally conscious state (MCS) and vegetative state (VS). SST was used to analysis time-frequency characteristics of TMS-evoked oscillations in different states of consciousness. In addition, relative power (RP) and spectral entropy (SeEn) were calculated based on SST results. Results: Simulation results showed that SST detected rhythm characteristics of instantaneous signal and background signal more completely. Results of NOR group showed that SST could more accurately detect TMS-evoked oscillations with high frequency resolution than HHT and MWT. The main frequency of TMS-evoked oscillations for DOC patients (MCS: 11.73 +/- 1.94 Hz; VS: 2.06 +/- 0.25 Hz) was different from that of NOR (22.79 +/- 1.42 Hz) based on SST. RP and SeEn further verified the differences of the main frequency of TMS-evoked oscillations between NOR and DOC patients. Conclusions: The results suggest that SST is a robust analytical method and outperforms HHT and MWT in studying TMS-evoked oscillations. The main frequency of TMS-evoked oscillations of DOC was lower than that of NOR.

J	Munia, TTK; Aviyente, S				Munia, Tamanna T.

Recently, phase-amplitude coupling, a form of cross-frequency coupling, where the phase of a slow oscillation modulates the amplitude of a fast oscillation, has gained attention. Existing phase-amplitude coupling measures are mostly confined to either coupling within a region or between pairs of brain regions. Given the availability of multi-channel electroencephalography recordings, a multivariate analysis of phase amplitude coupling is needed to accurately quantify the coupling across multiple frequencies and brain regions. In the present work, we propose a tensor based approach, i.e., higher order robust principal component analysis, to identify response-evoked phase-amplitude coupling across multiple frequency bands and brain regions. Our experiments on both simulated and electroencephalography data demonstrate that the proposed multivariate phase-amplitude coupling method can capture the spatial and spectral dynamics of phase-amplitude coupling more accurately compared to existing methods. Accordingly, we posit that the proposed higher order robust principal component analysis based approach filters out the background phase-amplitude coupling activity and predominantly captures the event-related phase-amplitude coupling dynamics to provide insight into the spatially distributed brain networks across different frequency bands.

Methods We enrolled 60 children with IS hospitalized from January 2019 to August 2020. Sixty healthy age-matched children comprised the control group. Time-frequency analysis was used to quantify gamma, ripple, and fast ripple (FR) oscillation energy changes. Results gamma, ripple, and FR oscillations dominated in the temporal and frontal lobes. The average HFO energy of the sleep stage is lower than that of the wake stage in the same frequency bands in both the normal control (NC) and IS groups (P < 0.05). The average HFO energy of the IS group was significantly higher than that of the NC group in gamma band during sleep stage (P < 0.01). The average HFO energy of S and Post-S stage were higher than that of sleep stage in gamma band (P < 0.05). In the ripple band, the average HFO energy of Pre-S, S, and Post-S stage was higher than that of sleep stage (P < 0.05). Before treatment, there was no significant difference in BASED score between the effective and ineffective groups. The interaction of curative efficacy x frequency and the interaction of curative efficacy x state are statistically significant. The average HFO energy of the effective group was lower than that of the ineffective group in the sleep stage (P < 0.05). For the 16 children deemed "effective" in the IS group, the average HFO energy of three frequency bands was not significantly different before compared with after treatment. Significance Scalp EEG can record HFOs. The energy of HFOs can distinguish physiological HFOs from pathological ones more accurately than frequency. On scalp EEG, gamma oscillations can better detect susceptibility to epilepsy than ripple and FR oscillations. HFOs can trigger spasms. The analysis of average HFO energy can be used as a predictor of the effectiveness of epilepsy treatment.

The relationship between TMT performance and the underlying brain activity remains to be characterized in detail. Accordingly, sixteen healthy young adults performed the TMT using a touch-sensitive tablet to capture enhanced performance metrics, such as the speed of linking movements, during simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG). Linking and non-linking periods were derived as estimates of the time spent executing and preparing movements, respectively. The seconds per link (SPL) was also used to quantify TMT performance. A strong effect of TMT Part A and B was observed on the SPL value as expected (Part B showing increased SPL value); whereas the EEG results indicated robust effects of linking and non-linking periods in multiple frequency bands, and effects consistent with the underlying cognitive demands of the test.

These limitations lead to continuous interests of researchers and clinicians toward the automatic sleep stages classification of EEG signals. This paper proposes a scheme for automatic classification of sleep stages using edge strength of visibility graph technique from single-channel EEG signals. To discover the validity of the proposed study with noise, we perform simulation analysis with two different time series named Lorenz and Rossler time series. The proposed technique accomplishes better performance than other related work for the two standard groups of sleep stages: Rechtschaffen and Kales standard and American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

Evidence using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) remains scarce. We assessed if electrical source imaging of FO using 256-channel high-density EEG (HD-EEG) is useful for EZ identification. Methods: We analyzed HD-EEG recordings of 10 focal drug-resistant epilepsy patients with seizure-free postsurgical outcome. We marked FO candidate events at the time of epileptic spikes and verified them by screening for an isolated peak in the time-frequency plot. We performed electrical source imaging of spikes and FO within the Maximum Entropy of the Mean framework. Source localization maps were validated against the surgical cavity. Results: We identified FO in five out of 10 patients who had a superficial or intermediate deep generator. The maximum of the FO maps was localized inside the cavity in all patients (100%). Analysis with a reduced electrode coverage using the 10-10 and 10-20 system showed a decreased localization accuracy of 60% and 40% respectively. Conclusions: FO recorded with HD-EEG localize the EZ. HD-EEG is better suited to detect and localize FO than conventional EEG approaches. Significance: This study acts as proof-of-concept that FO localization using 256-channel HD-EEG is a viable marker of the EZ. (c) 2020 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Biomarkers Based on Comprehensive Hierarchical EEG Coherence Analysis: Example Application to Social Competence in Autism (Preliminary Results)	NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article; Early Access						EEG coherence; Functional connectivity; Autism; Social synchrony; Motor coordination		Electroencephalography (EEG) coherence analysis, based on measurement of synchronous oscillations of neuronal clusters, has been used extensively to evaluate functional connectivity in brain networks. EEG coherence studies have used a variety of analysis variables (e.g., time and frequency resolutions corresponding to the analysis time period and frequency bandwidth), regions of the brain (e.g., connectivity within and between various cortical lobes and hemispheres) and experimental paradigms (e.g., resting state with eyes open or closed; performance of cognitive tasks). This variability in study designs has resulted in difficulties in comparing the findings from different studies and assimilating a comprehensive understanding of the underlying brain activity and regions with abnormal functional connectivity in a particular disorder. In order to address the variability in methods across studies and to facilitate the comparison of research findings between studies, this paper presents the structure and utilization of a comprehensive hierarchical electroencephalography (EEG) coherence analysis that allows for formal inclusion of analysis duration, EEG frequency band, cortical region, and experimental test condition in the computation of the EEG coherences. It further describes the method by which this EEG coherence analysis can be utilized to derive biomarkers related to brain (dys)function and abnormalities. In order to document the utility of this approach, the paper describes the results of the application of this method to EEG and behavioral data from a social synchrony paradigm in a small cohort of adolescents with and without Autism Spectral Disorder.

Wavelet-based cross-spectrum is one of the most widely implemented methods, but it is limited by the spectral leakage caused by the finite length of the basic function that impacts the time and frequency resolutions. This paper proposes a new time-frequency brain functional connectivity analysis framework to track the non-stationary association of two EEG signals based on a Revised Hilbert-Huang Transform (RHHT). The framework can estimate the cross-spectrum of decomposed components of EEG, followed by a surrogate significance test. The results of two simulation examples demonstrate that, within a certain statistical confidence level, the proposed framework outperforms the wavelet-based method in terms of accuracy and time-frequency resolution. A case study on classifying epileptic patients and healthy controls using interictal seizure-free EEG data is also presented. The result suggests that the proposed method has the potential to better differentiate these two groups benefiting from the enhanced measure of dynamic time-frequency association.

EEG microstate periodicity explained by rotating phase patterns of resting-state alpha oscillations	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Resting-state; Alpha oscillations; Microstates; Phase rotors	THEORETICAL-ANALYSIS; BIFURCATION-ANALYSIS; BRAIN; DYNAMICS; TOPOGRAPHY; ORIGIN; MODEL; WAVES; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SEQUENCES	Spatio-temporal patterns in electroencephalography (EEG) can be described by microstate analysis, a discrete approximation of the continuous electric field patterns produced by the cerebral cortex. Resting-state EEG microstates are largely determined by alpha frequencies (8-12 Hz) and we recently demonstrated that microstates occur periodically with twice the alpha frequency. To understand the origin of microstate periodicity, we analyzed the analytic amplitude and the analytic phase of resting-state alpha oscillations independently. In continuous EEG data we found rotating phase patterns organized around a small number of phase singularities which varied in number and location. The spatial rotation of phase patterns occurred with the underlying alpha frequency. Phase rotors coincided with periodic microstate motifs involving the four canonical microstate maps. The analytic amplitude showed no oscillatory behaviour and was almost static across time intervals of 1-2 alpha cycles, resulting in the global pattern of a standing wave. In n=23 healthy adults, time-lagged mutual information analysis of microstate sequences derived from amplitude and phase signals of awake eyes-closed EEG records showed that only the phase component contributed to the periodicity of microstate sequences. Phase sequences showed mutual information peaks at multiples of 50 ms and the group average had a main peak at 100 ms (10 Hz), whereas amplitude sequences had a slow and monotonous information decay. This result was confirmed by an independent approach combining temporal principal component analysis (tPCA) and autocorrelation analysis. We reproduced our observations in a generic model of EEG oscillations composed of coupled non-linear oscillators (Stuart-Landau model). Phase-amplitude dynamics similar to experimental EEG occurred when the oscillators underwent a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, a common feature of many computational models of the alpha rhythm. These findings explain our previous description of periodic microstate recurrence and its relation to the time scale of alpha oscillations. Moreover, our results corroborate the predictions of computational models and connect experimentally observed EEG patterns to properties of critical oscillator networks.

In this paper we apply time-frequency analysis to the ERPs to investigate the sub-cognitive processes of the Stroop test. EEG data from 50 healthy participants are collected while performing the Stroop test. The test comprised of congruent and incongruent trials. Response time, response accuracy, and peak amplitudes and latencies are compared between congruent and incongruent trials. It is found that participants took significantly longer time to respond to incongruent trials than the congruent trials. It is also observed that the peak amplitudes in multiple ERPs are significantly higher in the congruent trials than incongruent trials. The time-frequency results revealed that brain oscillations in both congruent and incongruent trials increased in the higher beta range (18-30 Hz). We conclude that brain responses to stimulus are strongly correlated with higher beta band (18-30 Hz).

EEG has been praised for its high temporal resolution but, because the signal recorded at the scalp is a mixture of brain activities, it is often considered to have poor spatial resolution. Besides, EEG data analysis has most often relied on event related potentials (ERPs) which cancel out non-phase locked oscillatory activity, thus limiting the functional discriminative power of EEG attainable through spectral analyses. Because these three dimensions-temporal, spatial and spectral-have been unequally leveraged in reward studies, we argue that the full potential of EEG has not been exploited. To back up our claim, we first performed a systematic survey of EEG studies assessing reward processing. Specifically, we report on the nature of the cognitive processes investigated (i.e., reward anticipation or reward outcome processing) and the methods used to collect and process the EEG data (i.e., event-related potential, time-frequency or source analyses). A total of 359 studies involving healthy subjects and the delivery of monetary rewards were surveyed. We show that reward anticipation has been overlooked (88% of studies investigated reward outcome processing, while only 24% investigated reward anticipation), and that time-frequency and source analyses (respectively reported by 19% and 12% of the studies) have not been widely adopted by the field yet, with ERPs still being the dominant methodology (92% of the studies). We argue that this focus on feedback-related ERPs provides a biased perspective on reward processing, by ignoring reward anticipation processes as well as a large part of the information contained in the EEG signal. Finally, we illustrate with selected examples how addressing these issues could benefit the field, relying on approaches combining time-frequency analyses, blind source separation and source localization.

Thus, the purpose of this study is to use a time-frequency analysis (i.e., wavelet) of electroencephalographic (EEG) data to determine differences in motor and auditory cortical activity when moving to music at two different rates. Twenty healthy young adults tapped their index finger while electroencephalography was collected. There were three conditions (tapping in time with a tone and with two contrasting music styles), and each condition was repeated at two different rates (70 and 140 beats per minute). A time-frequency Morlet wavelet analysis was completed for electrodes of interest over the sensorimotor areas (FC3, FC4, FCz, C3, C4, Cz) and the primary auditory areas (T7, T8). Cluster-based permutation testing was applied to the electrodes of interest for all conditions. Results showed few differences between cortical oscillations when moving to music versus a tone. However, the two music conditions elicited a variety of distinct responses, particularly at the slower movement rate. These results suggest that music style and movement rate should be considered when designing therapeutic applications that include music to target motor performance.

However, there is a concern that the filtration of steep waveforms such as spikes may cause spurious oscillations or "false ripples." We excluded such possibility from at least some ripples by EEG differentiation, which, in theory, enhances high-frequency signals and does not generate spurious oscillations or ringing. Methods The subjects were 50 pediatric patients, and ten consecutive spikes during sleep were selected for each patient. Five hundred spike data segments were initially reviewed by two experienced electroencephalographers using consensus to identify the presence or absence of ripples in the ordinary filtered EEG and an associated spectral blob in time-frequency analysis (Session A). These EEG data were subjected to numerical differentiation (the second derivative was denoted as EEG ''). The EEG '' trace of each spike data segment was shown to two other electroencephalographers who judged independently whether there were clear ripple oscillations or uncertain ripple oscillations or an absence of oscillations (Session B). Results In Session A, ripples were identified in 57 spike data segments (Group A-R), but not in the other 443 data segments (Group A-N). In Session B, both reviewers identified clear ripples (strict criterion) in 11 spike data segments, all of which were in Group A-R (p < 0.0001 by Fisher's exact test). When the extended criterion that included clear and/or uncertain ripples was used in Session B, both reviewers identified 25 spike data segments that fulfilled the criterion: 24 of these were in Group A-R (p < 0.0001). Discussion We have demonstrated that real ripples over scalp spikes exist in a certain proportion of patients. Ripples that were visualized consistently using both ordinary filters and the EEG '' method should be true, but failure to clarify ripples using the EEG '' method does not mean that true ripples are absent. Conclusion The numerical differentiation of EEG data provides convincing evidence that HFOs were detected in terms of the presence of such unusually fast oscillations over the scalp and the importance of this electrophysiological phenomenon.

The functions of the human brain have been the focus of neuroscience research for a long time. However, the spinal cord is largely ignored, and the functional interaction of these two parts of the CNS is only partly understood. This study developed a novel method to simultaneously record spinal cord electrophysiology (SCE) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals and validated its performance using a classical resting-state study design with two experimental conditions: eyesclosed (EC) and eyes-open (EO). We recruited nine postherpetic neuralgia patients implanted with a spinal cord stimulator, which was modified to record SCE signals simultaneously with EEG signals. For both EEG and SCE, similar differences were found in delta- and alpha-band oscillations between the EC and EO conditions, and the spectral power of these frequency bands was able to predict EC/EO behaviors. Moreover, causal connectivity analysis suggested a top-down regulation in delta-band oscillations from the brain to the spinal cord. Altogether, this study demonstrates the validity of simultaneous SCE-EEG recording and shows that the novel method is a valuable tool to investigate the brain-spinal interaction. With this method, we can better unite knowledge about the brain and the spinal cord for a deeper understanding of the functions of the whole CNS.

Therefore, an analysis method of neural signals is critical, as it provides the basis for many brain studies. In many cases, researchers want to understand how neural signals change according to different conditions. However, it is challenging to find distinguishing characteristics, and doing so requires complex statistical analysis. In this study, we propose a novel analysis method, FTF (F-value time-frequency) analysis, that applies the F-value of ANOVA to time-frequency analysis. The proposed method shows the statistical differences among conditions in time and frequency. To evaluate the proposed method, electroencephalography (EEG) signals were analyzed using the proposed FTF method. The EEG signals were measured during imagined movement of the left hand, right hand, foot, and tongue. The analysis revealed the important characteristics which were different among different conditions and similar within the same condition. The FTF analysis method will be useful in various fields, as it allows researchers to analyze how frequency characteristics vary according to different conditions.

Besides, EEG is so weak and non-stationary that easily causes distribution discrepancies for EEG data collected at different times; therefore, it is necessary to explore the affective activation patterns in cross-session emotion recognition. To address these two problems, we propose a self-weighted semi-supervised classification (SWSC) model in this article for joint EEG-based cross-session emotion recognition and affective activation patterns mining, whose merits include: 1) using both the labeled and unlabeled samples from different sessions for better capturing data characteristics; 2) introducing a self-weighted variable to learn the importance of EEG features adaptively and quantitatively; and 3) mining the activation patterns including the critical EEG frequency bands and channels automatically based on the learned self-weighted variable. Extensive experiments are conducted on the benchmark SEED_IV emotional dataset and SWSC obtained excellent average accuracies of 77.40%, 79.55%, and 81.52% in three cross-session emotion recognition tasks. Moreover, SWSC identifies that the Gamma frequency band contributes the most and the EEG channels in prefrontal, left/right temporal, and (central) parietal lobes are more important for cross-session emotion recognition.

Cortical gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) are considered to reflect processing of memory in local cortical networks. The temporal and regulatory relationship between spindles and gamma activity might therefore provide clues into how sleep strengthens cortical memory representations. Here, combining EEG with MEG recordings during sleep in healthy humans (n = 12), we investigated the temporal relationships of cortical gamma band activity, always measured by MEG, during fast (12-16 Hz) and slow (8-12 Hz) sleep spindles detected in the EEG or MEG. Time-frequency distributions did not show a consistent coupling of gamma to the spindle oscillation, although activity in the low gamma (30-40 Hz) and neighboring beta range (<30 Hz) was generally increased during spindles. However, more fine-grained analyses of cross-frequency interactions revealed that both low and high gamma power (30-100 Hz) was coupled to the phase of slow and fast EEG spindles, importantly, with this coupling at a fixed phase only for the oscillations within an individual spindle, but with variable phase across spindles. We did not observe any coupling of gamma activity for spindles detected solely in the MEG and not in parallel EEG recordings, raising the possibility that these are more local spindles of different quality. Similar to fast spindle activity, low gamma band power followed a similar to 0.025 Hz infraslow rhythm during sleep whose frequency, however, was significantly faster than that of spindle activity. Our findings suggest a general function of fast and slow spindles that by spanning larger cortical networks might serve to synchronize gamma band activity occurring in more local but distributed networks. Thereby, spindles might help linking local memory processing between distributed networks.

Most feature extraction techniques are based on spatial filters and power analyses in multiple frequency bands. The global geometry feature is seldom investigated. In this paper, the spatial aspects of EEG signals are studied using the Laplace-Beltrami operator. The eigenvectors of the Laplace-Beltrami operator form an orthonormal basis for square-integrable functions over the scalp and capture the geometry of electrodes' position in a hierarchical way. The signals are decomposed into different spatial frequency components by the projection into the eigenspaces of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Dimensionality reduction could be done by using only the low frequency components. This method is compared with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) filtering on publicly available motor imagery BCI data and achieved comparable results while being unsupervised, data-independent and requiring 33.7% less computation time.

How the rhythms of various frequency ranges are coordinated across the space of the human cortex and time of memory processing is inconclusive. They can either be coordinated together across the frequency spectrum at the same cortical site and time or induced independently in particular bands. We used a large dataset of human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) to parse the spatiotemporal dynamics of spectral activities induced during formation of verbal memories. Encoding of words for subsequent free recall activated low frequency theta, intermediate frequency alpha and beta, and high frequency gamma power in a mosaic pattern of discrete cortical sites. A majority of the cortical sites recorded activity in only one of these frequencies, except for the visual cortex where spectral power was induced across multiple bands. Each frequency band showed characteristic dynamics of the induced power specific to cortical area and hemisphere. The power of the low, intermediate, and high frequency activities propagated in independent sequences across the visual, temporal and prefrontal cortical areas throughout subsequent phases of memory encoding. Our results provide a holistic, simplified model of the spectral activities engaged in the formation of human memory, suggesting an anatomically and temporally distributed mosaic of coordinated brain rhythms.

Classification of visual comprehension based on EEG data using sparse optimal scoring	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						discriminant analysis; classification; optimal scoring; EEG; sign language	LANGUAGE; BRAIN; REGULARIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; STATE; THETA	Objective. Understanding and differentiating brain states is an important task in the field of cognitive neuroscience with applications in health diagnostics, such as detecting neurotypical development vs. autism spectrum or coma/vegetative state vs. locked-in state. Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is a particularly useful tool for this task as EEG data can detect millisecond-level changes in brain activity across a range of frequencies in a non-invasive and relatively inexpensive fashion. The goal of this study is to apply machine learning methods to EEG data in order to classify visual language comprehension across multiple participants. Approach. 26-channel EEG was recorded for 24 Deaf participants while they watched videos of sign language sentences played in time-direct and time-reverse formats to simulate interpretable vs. uninterpretable sign language, respectively. Sparse optimal scoring (SOS) was applied to EEG data in order to classify which type of video a participant was watching, time-direct or time-reversed. The use of SOS also served to reduce the dimensionality of the features to improve model interpretability. Main results. The analysis of frequency-domain EEG data resulted in an average out-of-sample classification accuracy of 98.89%, which was far superior to the time-domain analysis.

The FNS-based analysis of precursors and cross-correlations in EEG signal related to an imaginary motor task	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Flicker noise spectroscopy (FNS); Movement imagery (MI); Electroencephalography (EEG); Cross-correlation; Precursor	FLICKER-NOISE SPECTROSCOPY; BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; TIME-FREQUENCY MICROSTRUCTURE; STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE; MOVEMENT; DESYNCHRONIZATION; IMAGERY; HAND; MU; SYNCHRONIZATION	Flicker noise spectroscopy (FNS) is a time series analysis method to extract information contained in complex nonlinear systems using parameters characterizing the chaotic component of signal in different frequency ranges. In the paper, FNS (precursor function and cross-correlations) is used to study electroencephalography (EEG) signal related to the hand movement imagination. Our analysis of the precursor function calculated for different electrodes reveals a distinct peak just before the imagination which allows for detection of the motor task and distinction of the hand being a subject of the imagination. The EEG rhythms in subsequent stages of the task are determined based on cross-correlation maps which are furthermore used to describe directions of flows between different parts of the sensorimotor cortex.

Recently, focused ultrasound stimulation has been investigated as a promising non-invasive neuromodulation tool for neurological disorders, including epilepsy. To investigate the neuronal dynamics in epilepsy, we acutely stimulated 29 Sprague-Dawley rats to low-intensity focused ultrasound stimulation (LIFUS) three times for 3 minutes. Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) was injected into the abdominal cavity of the anesthetized rats to induce epilepsy. During the anesthesia, the electroencephalography (EEG) signal was measured and analyzed for 1 h in groups of animals untreated (sham) and treated with LIFUS. The EEG signal was quantitatively processed to show the different characteristics of the frequency change over time and of the band power between sham and treated groups. Histological analyses (Nissl, Iba1, c-Fos, and GAD65) measured the degree of staining of expression factors to confirm the effect of the stimulation on seizure suppression. These results suggest that repetitive LIFUS can effectively reduce epileptic seizure activity by attenuating theta and beta-band oscillation in a PTZ-induced rat model. LIFUS can potentially facilitate hippocampal and cortical cellular recovery by augmenting GABAergic inhibitory neurons via its anti-seizure effect.

Feasibility of Reconstructing Source Functional Connectivity with Low-Density EEG	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Functional connectivity; Low-density; Electroencephalography; Alpha oscillations; Neurofeedback	VOLUME CONDUCTION; MEG; LOCALIZATION; MOTOR; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; BEAMFORMERS; RESOLUTION; SELECTION; NETWORK	Objectives Functional connectivity (FC) is increasingly used as target for neuromodulation and enhancement of performance. A reliable assessment of FC with electroencephalography (EEG) currently requires a laboratory environment with high-density montages and a long preparation time. This study investigated the feasibility of reconstructing source FC with a low-density EEG montage towards a usage in real life applications. Methods Source FC was reconstructed with inverse solutions and quantified as node degree of absolute imaginary coherence in alpha frequencies. We used simulated coherent point sources as well as two real datasets to investigate the impact of electrode density (19 vs. 128 electrodes) and usage of template vs. individual MRI-based head models on localization accuracy. In addition, we checked whether low-density EEG is able to capture inter-individual variations in coherence strength. Results In numerical simulations as well as real data, a reduction of the number of electrodes led to less reliable reconstructions of coherent sources and of coupling strength. Yet, when comparing different approaches to reconstructing FC from 19 electrodes, source FC obtained with beamformers outperformed sensor FC, FC computed after independent component analysis, and source FC obtained with sLORETA. In particular, only source FC based on beamformers was able to capture neural correlates of motor behavior. Conclusion Reconstructions of FC from low-density EEG is challenging, but may be feasible when using source reconstructions with beamformers.

WF effect has also been reported in the domain of written production; however, how WF affects written production is a controversial issue. The present study attempts to investigate the time course of and neural oscillation underlying the WF effect in handwritten production. Participants were asked to handwrite pictures names of high versus low WF, while concurrently recording EEG. EEG trials were extracted time-locked to picture onsets and then submitted to event-related potential analysis and time-frequency analysis. WF affected ERPs in the time windows of around 98-160 and 282-360 ms after picture onsets. More importantly, WF modulated the evoked and induced theta-band (4-8 Hz) neural oscillations in the time window of around 36-240 and 244-472 ms, respectively. Considering the time course of language production and the role of theta-band oscillation in long-term memory retrieval, we suggest that the two stages of the WF effect, respectively, reflect conceptual preparation and retrieval of orthographic word-forms in written production.

Considering the aforesaid fact, in this paper, we propose a novel approach for automated detection and classification of focal electroencephalography (EEG) signals. In this contribution, we procured the focal and non focal EEG signals recorded from the temporal lobe epileptic patients and decomposed the recorded EEG data into several brain rhythms to obtain their time variation of different neural oscillations. Then, we selected a random EEG signal from each rhythm as a reference and performed cross wavelet transform (XWT) of the rest of the EEG rhythms with their respective chosen reference rhythms to examine their nature of correlation in both time scale and time-frequency frame. Finally, the obtained cross-rhythm spectrum time-frequency image plots were fed to a customized CNN model for the purpose of automated feature extraction and classification of EEG signals. The performance of the proposed CNN model was also compared with two pre-trained benchmark CNN models namely AlexNet and VGGNet16, respectively. We observed that the proposed EEG signal classification framework has delivered 100% accuracy for the delta (delta) rhythm and that too at a significantly reduced training time compared to the existing state-of-the-art CNN models. Interestingly, the detection accuracy was also found to be the highest for a particular EEG rhythm, which can be proven useful in real time analysis for accurate diagnosis of focal epilepsy.

With the evolution of multi-channel sensor implementations, the employment of multi-channel techniques for the extraction of features arising from multi-channel dependency and mono-channel characteristics has become common. MSST has recently been proposed as a method for modeling the combined oscillatory mechanisms of multi-channel signals. It makes use of the concepts of instantaneous frequency (IF) and bandwidth. Electrophysiological data, like other nonstationary signals, necessitates both joint time-frequency analysis and independent time and frequency domain studies. The usefulness and effectiveness of a multi-variate, wavelet-based synchrosqueezing algorithm paired with a band extraction method are tested using electroencephalography data obtained from OCD patients and control groups in this research. The proposed methodology yields substantial results when analyzing differences between patient and control groups.

Thirty-four participants completed a self-reported measure of dialectical thinking, and their resting-state electroencephalography was recorded. After wave filtration and eye movement removal, time-frequency electroencephalography signals were converted into four frequency domains: delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (7-13 Hz), and beta (13-30 Hz). Functional principal component analysis with B-spline approximation was then applied for feature reduction. Five machine learning methods (support vector regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, K-nearest neighbors, random forest, and gradient boosting decision tree) were applied to the reduced features for prediction. The model ensemble technique was used to create the best performing final model. The results showed that the alpha wave of the electroencephalography signal in the early period (12-15 s) contributed most to the prediction of dialectical thinking. With data-driven electrode selection (FC1, FCz, Fz, FC3, Cz, AFz), the prediction model achieved an average coefficient of determination of 0.45 on 200 random test sets. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was found between the alpha value of standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography activity in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and dialectical self-scale score. The prefrontal and midline alpha oscillations of resting electroencephalography are good predictors of the dispositional level of dialectical thinking, possibly reflecting these brain structures' involvement in dialectical thinking.

Since the cerebellar region has been associated with cognitive and lower-limb motor functions, it is imperative to study cerebellar oscillations in PD. Here, we evaluated cerebellar electroencephalography (EEG) during cognitive processing and lower-limb motor performances in PD. Cortical and cerebellar EEG were collected from 74 PD patients and 37 healthy control subjects during a 7-second interval timing task, 26 PD patients and 13 controls during a lower-limb pedaling task, and 23 PD patients during eyes-open/closed resting conditions. Analyses were focused on the mid-cerebellar Cbz electrode and further compared to the mid-occipital Oz and mid-frontal Cz electrodes. Increased alpha-band power was observed during the eyes-closed resting-state condition over Oz, but no change in alpha power was observed over Cbz. PD patients showed higher dispersion when performing the 7-second interval timing cognitive task and executed the pedaling motor task with reduced speed compared to controls. PD patients exhibited attenuated cue-triggered theta-band power over Cbz during both the interval timing and pedaling motor tasks. Connectivity measures between Cbz and Cz showed thetaband differences, but only during the pedaling motor task. Cbz oscillatory activity also differed from Oz across multiple frequency bands in both groups during both tasks.

Therefore, a novel refined-detrended fluctuation analysis method multi-order detrended fluctuation analysis (MODFA) was proposed. The best fitting order is selected according to the inflection point in the dependence degree curve of high frequency EEG and multi-order polynomial. MODFA measures the power-law long-range correlation of high frequency nonlinear signals. Prefrontal EEG signals were recorded during six emotion-inducing tasks (neutral, fear, sad, happy, anger, and disgust). To confirm the susceptibility and efficiency of MODFA indices, including hurst-exponent MODFA-h1 and intercept MODFA-a1, on emotion recognition, we compared MODFA with original detrended fluctuation analysis, as well as the conventionally used fuzzy entropy (FE) and power spectral density (PSD) on high frequency EEG oscillations (62.50-93.75 Hz). The results showed that MODFA achieved the best performance in binary emotion classification (positive and negative, accuracy = 96.81%), ternary classification (neutral, positive, and negative, accuracy = 76.39%), and six-classification (accuracy = 42.17%). Moreover, along with inducing time, the cumulative effects of the four negative emotions (fear, sad, anger, and disgust) were observed by MODFA-a1, FE, and PSD, which demonstrated that the accumulation of negative emotions are associated with the prefrontal lobe and could be measured via high frequency gamma rhythms. These findings indicated the nonlinear dynamics of high frequency brain activity during emotion induction, and the prefrontal EEG-based emotion recognition might have great application prospect in real-life practice.

Previous studies have shown that corticospinal excitability is influenced by fluctuations of brain oscillations in the sensorimotor region, but it is unclear whether brain network activity modulates corticospinal excitability. Here, we addressed this question by recording electroencephalography (EEG) and TMS measurements in 32 healthy individuals. The resting motor threshold (RMT) and active motor threshold (AMT) were determined as markers of corticospinal excitability. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to identify significant EEG metrics and then correlation analysis was performed. The analysis revealed that alpha2 power in the sensorimotor region was inversely correlated with RMT and AMT. Innovatively, graph theory was used to construct a brain network, and the relationship between the brain network and corticospinal excitability was explored. It was found that the global efficiency in the theta band was positively correlated with RMT. Additionally, the global efficiency in the alpha2 band was negatively correlated with RMT and AMT. These findings indicated that corticospinal excitability can be modulated by the power spectrum in sensorimotor regions and the global efficiency of functional networks. EEG network analysis can provide a useful supplement for studying the association between EEG oscillations and corticospinal excitability.

J	Kim, K; Duc, NT; Choi, M; Lee, B				Kim, Kyungwon; Nguyen Thanh Duc; Choi, Min; Lee, Boreom			EEG microstate features for schizophrenia classification	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CONNECTIVITY ALTERATIONS; SIGNAL CLASSIFICATION; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; BIPOLAR DISORDER; RESTING EEG; BRAIN; EMOTION; NETWORK; NAIVE; TIME	Electroencephalography (EEG) microstate analysis is a method wherein spontaneous EEG activity is segmented at sub-second levels to analyze quasi-stable states. In particular, four archetype microstates and their features are known to reflect changes in brain state in neuropsychiatric diseases. However, previous studies have only reported differences in each microstate feature and have not determined whether microstate features are suitable for schizophrenia classification. Therefore, it is necessary to validate microstate features for schizophrenia classification. Nineteen microstate features, including duration, occurrence, and coverage as well as thirty-one conventional EEG features, including statistical, frequency, and temporal characteristics were obtained from resting-state EEG recordings of 14 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and from 14 healthy (control) subjects. Machine-learning based multivariate analysis was used to evaluate classification performance. EEG recordings of patients and controls showed different microstate features. More importantly, when differentiating among patients and controls, EEG microstate features outperformed conventional EEG ones. The performance of the microstate features exceeded that of conventional EEG, even after optimization using recursive feature elimination. EEG microstate features applied with conventional EEG features also showed better classification performance than conventional EEG features alone. The current study is the first to validate the use of microstate features to discriminate schizophrenia, suggesting that EEG microstate features are useful for schizophrenia classification.

In previous work Makin et al. (2014, Journal of Vision, 14, 1-12) and Wright et al. (2015, Psychophysiology, 52, 638-647) examined occipital alpha event-related desynchronization (alpha ERD). It was concluded that alpha ERD is right lateralized during active regularity discrimination but not during a secondary task. Furthermore, alpha ERD was unaffected by stimulus properties, such as the type of regularity. These conclusions are refuted by new time-frequency analysis on an electroencephalography (EEG) data set first introduced by Makin et al. (2020, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 32, 353-366). We compared alpha ERD across five tasks. First, we found that right lateralization of alpha ERD was evident in all tasks, not just active regularity discrimination. This was caused by hemispheric differences in alpha power during prestimulus baseline (left < right), which equalized after stimulus onset (left = right). Second, we found that Alpha ERD increased with the proportion of symmetric elements in the image (PSYMM). Sensitivity to PSYMM was stronger on the right. These findings suggest that known extrastriate symmetry activations are accompanied by reduced alpha power.	[Makin, Alexis D.

However, those studies focused on healthy subjects, and failed to examine the group-level comparisons during music listening. Here, we combined group-level spatial Fourier ICA with acoustic feature extraction, to enable group comparisons in frequency-specific brain networks of musical feature processing. It was then applied to healthy subjects and subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD). The music-induced oscillatory brain patterns were determined by permutation correlation analysis between individual time courses of Fourier-ICA components and musical features. We found that (1) three components, including a beta sensorimotor network, a beta auditory network and an alpha medial visual network, were involved in music processing among most healthy subjects; and that (2) one alpha lateral component located in the left angular gyrus was engaged in music perception in most individuals with MDD. The proposed method allowed the statistical group comparison, and we found that: (1) the alpha lateral component was activated more strongly in healthy subjects than in the MDD individuals, and that (2) the derived frequency-dependent networks of musical feature processing seemed to be altered in MDD participants compared to healthy subjects. The proposed pipeline appears to be valuable for studying disrupted brain oscillations in psychiatric disorders during naturalistic paradigms.

A notable exception are low-amplitude high-frequency (similar to 600 Hz) somatosensory EEG/MEG responses that can represent population spikes when averaged over hundreds of trials to raise the signal-to-noise ratio. Here, a recent leap in MEG technology-featuring a factor 10 reduction in white noise level compared with standard systems-is leveraged to establish an effective single-trial portrayal of evoked cortical population spike bursts in healthy human subjects. This time-resolved approach proved instrumental in revealing a significant trial-to-trial variability of burst amplitudes as well as timecorrelated (similar to 10 s) fluctuations of burst response latencies. Thus, ultralow-noise MEG enables noninvasive single-trial analyses of human cortical population spikes concurrent with low-frequency mass postsynaptic activity and thereby could comprehensively characterize cortical processing, potentially also in diseases not amenable to invasive microelectrode recordings.

Calibrating rhythmic stimulation parameters to individual electroencephalography markers: The consistency of individual alpha frequency in practical lab settings	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						consistency; electroencephalography (EEG); individual alpha frequency (IAF); intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC); neuronal oscillations; reliability	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; EEG-ALPHA; INTRAINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY; INTERINDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES; LOCAL ENTRAINMENT; BETA OSCILLATIONS; PEAK FREQUENCY; BACKGROUND EEG	Rhythmic stimulation can be applied to modulate neuronal oscillations. Such 'entrainment' is optimized when stimulation frequency is individually calibrated based on magneto/encephalography markers. It remains unknown how consistent such individual markers are across days/sessions, within a session, or across cognitive states, hemispheres and estimation methods, especially in a realistic, practical, lab setting. We here estimated individual alpha frequency (IAF) repeatedly from short electroencephalography (EEG) measurements at rest or during an attention task (cognitive state), using single parieto-occipital electrodes in 24 participants on 4 days (between-sessions), with multiple measurements over an hour on 1 day (within-session). First, we introduce an algorithm to automatically reject power spectra without a sufficiently clear peak to ensure unbiased IAF estimations. Then we estimated IAF via the traditional 'maximum' method and a 'Gaussian fit' method. IAF was reliable within- and between-sessions for both cognitive states and hemispheres, though task-IAF estimates tended to be more variable. Overall, the 'Gaussian fit' method was more reliable than the 'maximum' method. Furthermore, we evaluated how far from an approximated 'true' task-related IAF the selected 'stimulation frequency' was, when calibrating this frequency based on a short rest-EEG, a short task-EEG, or simply selecting 10 Hz for all participants. For the 'maximum' method, rest-EEG calibration was best, followed by task-EEG, and then 10 Hz. For the 'Gaussian fit' method, rest-EEG and task-EEG-based calibration were similarly accurate, and better than 10 Hz. These results lead to concrete recommendations about valid, and automated, estimation of individual oscillation markers in experimental and clinical settings.	[Janssens, Shanice E.

J	Gyurkovics, M; Clements, GM; Low, KA; Fabiani, M; Gratton, G				Gyurkovics, Mate; Clements, Grace M.; Low, Kathy A.; Fabiani, Monica; Gratton, Gabriele			The impact of 1/ f activity and baseline correction on the results and interpretation of time-frequency analyses of EEG/MEG data: A cautionary tale	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Magnetoencephalography (MEG); 1; f activity; Neural oscillations; Time-frequency analysis; Baseline correction; dB conversion	BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; THETA; COMPONENTS	Typically, time-frequency analysis (TFA) of electrophysiological data is aimed at isolating narrowband signals (oscillatory activity) from broadband non-oscillatory (1/ f ) activity, so that changes in oscillatory activity resulting from experimental manipulations can be assessed. A widely used method to do this is to convert the data to the decibel (dB) scale through baseline division and log transformation. This procedure assumes that, for each frequency, sources of power (i.e., oscillations and 1/ f activity) scale by the same factor relative to the baseline (multiplicative model). This assumption may be incorrect when signal and noise are independent contributors to the power spectrum (additive model). Using resting-state EEG data from 80 participants, we found that the level of 1/ f activity and alpha power are not positively correlated within participants, in line with the additive but not the multiplicative model. Then, to assess the effects of dB conversion on data that violate the multiplicativity assumption, we simulated a mixed design study with one between-subject (noise level, i.e., level of 1/ f activity) and one within-subject (signal amplitude, i.e., amplitude of oscillatory activity added onto the background 1/ f activity) factor. The effect size of the noise level & times; signal amplitude interaction was examined as a function of noise difference between groups, following dB conversion. Findings revealed that dB conversion led to the over-or under-estimation of the true interaction effect when groups differing in 1/ f levels were compared, and it also led to the emergence of illusory interactions when none were present. This is because signal amplitude was systematically underestimated in the noisier compared to the less noisy group. Hence, we recommend testing whether the level of 1/ f activity differs across groups or conditions and using multiple baseline correction strategies to validate results if it does. Such a situation may be particularly common in aging, developmental, or clinical studies.& nbsp;	[Gyurkovics, Mate; Clements, Grace M.; Low, Kathy A.; Fabiani, Monica; Gratton, Gabriele] Univ Illinois, Beckman Inst Adv Sci & Technol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Clements, Grace M.; Fabiani, Monica; Gratton, Gabriele] Univ Illinois, Dept Psychol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA		Gyurkovics, M (corresponding author), 405 N Mathews Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.	mategy@illinois.edu			NIA [RF1AG062666]	NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA))	This work was supported by NIA grant RF1AG062666 to G.

Characterizing Cortical Oscillatory Responses in Major Depressive Disorder Before and After Convulsive Therapy: A TMS-EEG Study	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Major depressive disorder; Magnetic seizure therapy; Electroconvulsive therapy; Tms-eeg; Oscillations	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; THETA BURST STIMULATION; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; ELECTROCONVULSIVE-THERAPY; SEIZURE THERAPY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RESTING EEG; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS	Background: Combined transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) is emerging as a powerful technique for interrogating neural circuit dysfunction in psychiatric disorders. Here, we utilized timefrequency analyses to characterize differences in neural oscillatory dynamics between subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls (HC). We further examined changes in TMS-related oscillatory power following convulsive therapy. Methods: Oscillatory power was examined following TMS over the dorsolateral prefrontal and motor cortices (DLPFC and M1) in 38 MDD subjects, and 22 HCs. We further investigated how these responses changed in the MDD group following an acute course of convulsive therapy (either magnetic seizure therapy [MST, n = 24] or electroconvulsive therapy [ECT, n = 14]). Results: Prior to treatment, MDD subjects exhibited increased oscillatory power within delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands with TMS-EEG over the DLPFC, but showed no differences to HCs with stimulation over M1. Following MST, DLPFC stimulation revealed attenuated baseline-normalized power in the delta and theta bands, with reductions in the delta, theta, and alpha power following ECT. TMS over M1 revealed reduced delta and theta power following ECT, with no changes observed following MST. An association was also observed between the treatment- induced change in alpha power and depression severity score. Limitations: Limitations include the modest sample size, open-label MST and ECT treatment designs, and lack of a placebo condition. Conclusions: These results provide evidence of alterations in TMS-related oscillatory activity in MDD, and further suggest modulation of oscillatory power following ECT and MST.

We analyze the potential predictive performance of event-related potential analysis in this high gamma band, provide evidence that detection algorithms should take into account the varying strength of a patient's common frequency extremes, and provide evidence that patient-specific approaches to machine learning algorithms may be more successful in the detection of pediatric seizures as they are more difficult to detect than adult seizures. Using these results, machine learning detection algorithm performance on pediatric patient data, which is prone to issues from limitations within the algorithms, may be significantly improved by incorporating high gamma band signal processing at the locations identified by this process.

Seizures induced in electroconvulsive therapy as a human epilepsy model: A comparative case study	EPILEPSIA OPEN			English	Article						alpha-delta ratio; electroencephalography; ictal; postictal; time-frequency analyses	ANIMAL-MODELS; QUANTITATIVE EEG; CHALLENGES; NETWORKS; BRAIN; ECT	Objective Standardized investigation of epileptic seizures and the postictal state may contribute to a better understanding of ictal and postictal phenomena. This comparative case study aims to assess whether electrically induced seizures in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) show sufficient similarities with spontaneous seizures to serve as a human epilepsy model. Methods We compared six EEG recordings, three ECT-induced seizures and three generalized tonic-clonic seizures, using quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) analyses. EEG recordings during and after ECT sessions (under general anesthesia and muscle paralysis) were collected prospectively, whereas epilepsy data were selected retrospectively. Time-frequency representations, dominant ictal frequencies, and postictal alpha-delta ratios were calculated. Results In all EEG recordings, a decrease in dominant ictal frequency was observed, as well as postictal suppression. Postictal alpha-delta ratio indicated the same trend for all: a gradual increase from predominantly delta to alpha frequencies on timescales of hours after the seizure. Postictal spectral representation was similar. Muscle artifacts were absent in ECT-induced seizures and present in spontaneous seizures. Ictal amplitude was higher in epileptic than in ECT-induced seizures. Temporospectral ictal dynamics varied slightly between groups. Significance We show that ictal and postictal characteristics in ECT and patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures are essentially similar. ECT-induced seizures may be used to investigate aspects of ictal and postictal states in a highly predictable manner and well-controlled environment. This suggests that clinical and electrophysiological observations during ECT may be extrapolated to epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures.	[Pottkamper, Julia C. M.; Verdijk, Joey P. A.

Dry electrodes do not require the application of conductive gel, which mostly confines the use of gel EEG systems to the laboratory environment. The aim of this study is to validate soft, multipin, dry EEG electrodes by comparing their performance to conventional gel EEG electrodes. Fifteen healthy volunteers performed three tasks, with a 32-channel gel EEG system and a 32-channel dry EEG system: the 40 Hz Auditory Steady-State Response (ASSR), the checkerboard paradigm, and an eyes open/closed task. Within-subject analyses were performed to compare the signal quality in the time, frequency, and spatial domains. The results showed strong similarities between the two systems in the time and frequency domains, with strong correlations of the visual (rho = 0.89) and auditory evoked potential (rho = 0.81), and moderate to strong correlations for the alpha band during eye closure (rho = 0.81-0.86) and the 40 Hz-ASSR power (rho = 0.66-0.72), respectively. However, delta and theta band power was significantly increased, and the signal-to-noise ratio was significantly decreased for the dry EEG system. Topographical distributions were comparable for both systems. Moreover, the application time of the dry EEG system was significantly shorter (8 min). It can be concluded that the soft, multipin dry EEG system can be used in brain activity research with similar accuracy as conventional gel electrodes.</p>	[Heijs, Janne J. A.; van Wezel, Richard J.

This study investigated the Dex effects on propofol GA via analysis of EEG changes. Methods: A study cohort of 21 surgical patients (age range, 20-60 years) categorized as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I or II was enrolled. We used time-varying spectral and bicoherence methods to compare electroencephalogram signatures 5 min before versus 10 min after intravenous Dex injection under propofol GA. The means and medians are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and inter-quartile ranges (IQRs), respectively. Results: Dex augmented the slow waves power and theta (theta) oscillation bicoherence peak from a mean (95% CI) of 22.1% (19.0, 25.2) to 25.2% (21.8, 28.6). Meanwhile, Dex reduced alpha (alpha) peak power and bicoherence from 3.5 dB (1.0, 6.0) and 41.5% (34.0, 49.0) to 1.7 dB (- 0.6, 4.0) and 35.4% (29.0, 41.8), respectively, while diminishing the median frequency of alpha oscillation peak values and the mean frequency of alpha peaks in bicoherence spectra from 12.0 Hz (IQR 11.2, 12.6) and 11.7 Hz (11.3, 12.2) to 11.1 Hz (IQR 10.3, 11.8) and 11.2 Hz (10.9, 11.6), respectively. Conclusions: Profound EEG changes support the supposition that Dex enhances propofol-induced GA from a moderate to a deeper state. The present findings provide a theoretical basis and reference regarding protocols aimed at reducing anesthetic/sedative dosage while maintaining sufficient depth of GA.

Visual search performance in cerebral visual impairment is associated with altered alpha band oscillations	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article							SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; EEG-DATA; CHILDREN; MOTION; ARTIFACTS; DORSAL; ACUITY; SEGMENTATION; MECHANISMS	Individuals with cerebral visual impairment (CVI) often present with deficits related to visuospatial processing. However, the neurophysiological basis underlying these higher order perceptual dysfunctions have not been clearly identified. We assessed visual search performance using a novel virtual reality based task paired with eye tracking to simulate the exploration of a naturalistic scene (a virtual toy box). This was combined with electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and an analysis pipeline focusing on time frequency decomposition of alpha oscillatory activity. We found that individuals with CVI showed an overall impairment in visual search performance (as indexed by decreased success rate, as well as increased reaction time, visual search area, and gaze error) compared to controls with neurotypical development. Analysis of captured EEG activity following stimulus onset revealed that in the CVI group, there was a distinct lack of strong and well defined posterior alpha desynchronization; an important signal involved in the coordination of neural activity related to visual processing. Finally, an exploratory analysis revealed that in CVI, the magnitude of alpha desynchronization was associated with impaired visual search performance as well as decreased volume of specific thalamic nuclei implicated in visual processing. These results suggest that impairments in visuospatial processing related to visual search in CVI are associated with alterations in alpha band oscillations as well as early neurological injury at the level of visual thalamic nuclei.

In view of the characteristics of nonstationarity, time-variability, and individual diversity of EEG signals, a deep learning framework termed SSD-SE-convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for MI-EEG classification. The framework consists of three parts: 1) the sparse spectrotemporal decomposition (SSD) algorithm is proposed for feature extraction, overcoming the drawbacks of conventional time-frequency analysis methods and enhancing the robustness to noise; 2) a CNN is constructed to fully exploit the time-frequency features, thus outperforming traditional classification methods both in terms of accuracy and kappa value; and 3) the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks are adopted to adaptively recalibrate channelwise feature responses, which further improves the overall performance and offers a compelling classification solution for MI-EEG applications. Experimental results on two datasets reveal that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both classification quality and robustness. The advantages of SSD-SE-CNN include high accuracy, high efficiency, and robustness to cross-trial and cross-session variations, making it an ideal candidate for long-term MI-EEG applications. Note to Practitioners-Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) are widely used to allow a user to control a device using only his or her neural activity. This article proposed a new framework to classify two-class MI tasks based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals. In this framework, a new sparse spectrotemporal decomposition method is used to extract time-frequency features from EEG signals. A convolutional neural network with squeeze-and-excitation blocks is then constructed to classify the MI tasks. We show the superiority of our method on two datasets and prove its feasibility for long-term MI-BCI applications.

Current practice, however, limits our ability to observe the potentially-important features of the sleeping brain because it focuses on discrete stage-based averaging of manually labeled metrics. This study proposes a high-resolution objective framework that can comprehensively represent individualized continuous brain states during sleep. We develop a computational framework around a novel visualization called the slow-oscillation power spectrogram (SOPS), which describes EEG spectral activity as a function of a continuum of sleep depth rather than over discrete stages. Continuous sleep depth is represented by the instantaneous ratio of slow-oscillation (0.5 - 2 Hz) power to the total power (SO-power ratio). We analyzed sleep EEG of two consecutive nights of polysomnography obtained from 10 healthy subjects (mean age of 25.8 +/- 5.09 years, 50% female). Through visualization and quantitative analysis, our results suggest that the SOPS can offer a concise high-resolution summary of an individual's unique depth-of-sleep profile. Our framework provides a basis for exploring the critical biomarker of neurocognitive functions for which sleep EEG properties are significantly relevant.

The objective of this study was to investigate differences in sleep parameters and quantitative electroencephalography of patients with insomnia according to age and sex. Methods: Patients with insomnia disorder ages 40-79 years were recruited. Each participant was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 4-day wrist actigraphy, and quantitative electroencephalography derived from a 64-channel electroencephalogram system. These variables were compared between age groups (40-64 years vs 65-79 years) and sexes. Results: Among 173 participants, 61(35%) were ages 65-79 years and 64 (35%) were males. The older group reported shorter (P=.009) total sleep time than the middle-aged group based on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, while women slept longer than men based on actigraphy (P = .040). Regarding electroencephalography, women had higher relative beta power than men (P = .006). Older patients showed slower dominant occipital frequency than younger patients (P = .008). The age effect was more noticeable on both clinical variables and quantitative electroencephalography for women. Compared with younger women, older women reported shorter total sleep time in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (P = .025), underestimated their sleep time (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index total sleep time/actigraphic total sleep time, P = .034), and showed reduced alpha power in the frontal area (P = .009). Conclusions: Clinicians should be aware of the age and sex difference on manifestation of insomnia, which may further impact an individual's behaviors, such as staying in bed for a longer time or seeking sleep aids.

Most studies on FE recognition use static (image) stimuli, even though real-life FEs are dynamic. FE processing is complex and multifaceted, and its neural correlates remain unclear. Transitioning from static to dynamic FE stimuli might help disentangle the neural oscillatory mechanisms underlying face processing and recognition of emotion expression. To our knowledge, we here present the first time-frequency exploration of oscillatory brain mechanisms underlying the processing of dynamic FEs. Results Videos of joyful, fearful, and neutral dynamic facial expressions were presented to 18 included healthy young adults. We analyzed event-related activity in electroencephalography (EEG) data, focusing on the delta, theta, and alpha-band oscillations. Since the videos involved a transition from neutral to emotional expressions (onset around 500 ms), we identified time windows that might correspond to face perception initially (time window 1; first TW), and emotion expression recognition subsequently (around 1000 ms; second TW). First TW showed increased power and phase-locking values for all frequency bands. In the first TW, power and phase-locking values were higher in the delta and theta bands for emotional FEs as compared to neutral FEs, thus potentially serving as a marker for emotion recognition in dynamic face processing. Conclusions Our time-frequency exploration revealed consistent oscillatory responses to complex, dynamic, ecologically meaningful FE stimuli. We conclude that while dynamic FE processing involves complex network dynamics, dynamic FEs were successfully used to reveal temporally separate oscillation responses related to face processing and subsequently emotion expression recognition.

EEGs are useful in Brain controlled interfaces and other intelligent Neuroscience applications, but manual analysis of these brainwaves is complicated and time-consuming even for the experts of neuroscience. Various EEG analysis and classification techniques have been proposed to address this problem however, the conventional classification methods require identification and learning of specific EEG characteristics beforehand. Deep learning models can learn features from data without having in depth knowledge of data and prior feature identification. One of the great implementations of deep learning is Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which has outperformed traditional neural networks in pattern recognition and image classification. Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is an efficient signal analysis technique that presents the magnitude of EEG signals as time-related Frequency components. Existing deep learning architectures suffer from poor performance when classifying EEG signals in the Time-frequency domain. To improve classification accuracy, we propose an integrated CWT and CNN technique which classifies five types of EEG signals using. We compared the results of proposed integrated CWT and CNN method with existing deep learning models e.g., GoogleNet, VGG16, AlexNet. Furthermore, the accuracy and loss of the proposed integrated CWT and CNN method have been cross validated using Kfold cross validation. The average accuracy and loss of Kfold cross-validation for proposed integrated CWT and CNN method are, 76.12% and 56.02% respectively. This model produces results on a publicly available dataset: Epilepsy dataset by UCI (Machine Learning Repository).

The effectiveness of the CSP algorithm depends on optimal selection of the frequency band and time window from the EEG. Many algorithms have been designed to optimize frequency band selection for CSP, while few algorithms seek to optimize the time window. This study proposes a novel framework, termed common time-frequency-spatial patterns (CTFSP), to extract sparse CSP features from multi-band filtered EEG data in multiple time windows. Specifically, the whole MI period is first segmented into multiple subseries using a sliding time window approach. Then, sparse CSP features are extracted from multiple frequency bands in each time window. Finally, multiple support vector machine (SVM) classifiers with the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel are trained to identify the MI tasks and the voting result of these classifiers determines the final output of the BCI. This study applies the proposed CTFSP algorithm to three public EEG datasets (BCI competition III dataset IVa, BCI competition III dataset IIIa, and BCI competition IV dataset 1) to validate its effectiveness, compared against several other state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is a promising candidate for improving the performance of MI-BCI systems.

However, some researchers found that multiscale entropy curves of sleep and wakefulness intercept, a cross-over phenomenon whose origin remains unexplored. The objective of the present work is to trace the origin of the cross-over phenomenon and to propose a workaround strategy. We simulated EEG by generating 1/f broadband signal and chirp signals with continuously varying frequencies. We then retrieved the rhythmic component from simulated EEG and real-world EEG and conducted MSE analysis of the instantaneous frequency variation (IFV) of the rhythmic component. The simulation revealed that this interception was ubiquitous in the MSE analysis of simulated EEG with rhythmic components of different frequencies. The cross-over point moved toward larger scale factors with the increasing sampling rate. We found that the MSE curve of IFV from real-world EEG for the wakefulness group was higher than that for sleep, showing no interception. These results suggest that (1) for a rhythmic signal like EEG, MSE analysis of the raw signal is highly affected by the rhythmic component, presenting artificial cross-over curves in sleep EEG study, (2) frequency variation of rhythmic components are complex signal which differs between wakefulness and sleep, in accordance with the complexity loss theory.

This study investigated the relationship between development and non-epileptic, probably physiological, fast (40-200 Hz) oscillations (FOs) including gamma (40 - 80 Hz) and ripple (80 - 200 Hz) oscillations in scalp EEG in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Methods: Participants were 124 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Gamma and ripple oscillations were explored from 60-second-long sleep EEG data in each subject using a semiautomatic detection tool supplemented with visual confirmation and time-frequency analysis. Results: Gamma and ripple oscillations were detected in 25 (20.2%) and 22 (17.7%) children, respectively. The observation of one or more occurrence(s) of ripple oscillations, but not gamma oscillations, was significantly related to lower age at EEG recording (odds ratio, OR: 0.727 [95% confidence interval, CI: 0.568-0.929]), higher intelligence/developmental quotient (OR: 1.041, 95% CI: 1.002-1.082), and lack of a diagnosis with ADHD (OR: 0.191, 95% CI: 0.039-0.937) according to a binominal logistic regression analysis that included diagnosis with ASD, sex, history of perinatal complications, history of febrile seizures, and use of a sedative agent for the EEG recording as the other non-significant parameters. Diagnostic group was not related to frequency or power of spectral peaks of FOs. Conclusion: The production of non-epileptic scalp ripples was confirmed to be associated with brain development and function/dysfunction in childhood. Further investigation is necessary to interpret all of the information on higher brain functions that may be embedded in scalp FOs. (C) 2021 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

Here, we aimed to assess the genetic correlation between epilepsy and background EEG oscillations. Methods Confounding factors, including the heterogeneous etiology of epilepsies and medication effects, hamper studies on background brain activity in people with epilepsy. To overcome this limitation, we compared genetic data from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on epilepsy (n = 12 803 people with epilepsy and 24 218 controls) with that from a GWAS on background EEG (n = 8425 subjects without epilepsy), in which background EEG oscillation power was quantified in four different frequency bands: alpha, beta, delta, and theta. We replicated our findings in an independent epilepsy replication dataset (n = 4851 people with epilepsy and 20 428 controls). To assess the genetic overlap between these phenotypes, we performed genetic correlation analyses using linkage disequilibrium score regression, polygenic risk scores, and Mendelian randomization analyses. Results Our analyses show strong genetic correlations of genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) with background EEG oscillations, primarily in the beta frequency band. Furthermore, we show that subjects with higher beta and theta polygenic risk scores have a significantly higher risk of having generalized epilepsy. Mendelian randomization analyses suggest a causal effect of GGE genetic liability on beta oscillations. Significance Our results point to shared biological mechanisms underlying background EEG oscillations and the susceptibility for GGE, opening avenues to investigate the clinical utility of background EEG oscillations in the diagnostic workup of epilepsy.

The underlying neuroplastic mechanisms remain unclear. Electrocorticography (ECOG), electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) may help elucidate the brain mechanisms underlying CR, as CR is thought to be related to efficient utilization of remaining brain resources. The purpose of this systematic review is to collect, evaluate, and synthesize the findings on neural correlates of CR estimates using ECOG, EEG, and MEG. Method: We examined articles that were published from the first standardized definition of CR. Eleven EEG and five MEG cross-sectional studies met the inclusion criteria: They concerned original research, analyzed (M)EEG in humans, used a validated CR estimate, and related (M)EEG to CR. Quality assessment was conducted using an adapted form of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. No ECOG study met the inclusion criteria. Results: A total of 1383 participants from heterogeneous patient, young and older healthy groups were divided into three categories by (M)EEG methodology: Eight (M)EEG studies employed event-related fields or potentials, six studies analyzed brain oscillations at rest (of which one also analyzed a cognitive task), and three studies analyzed brain connectivity. Various CR estimates were employed and all studies compared different (M)EEG measures and CR estimates. Several associations between (M)EEG measures and CR estimates were observed. Conclusion: Our findings support that (M)EEG measures are related to CR estimates, particularly in healthy individuals. However, the character of this relationship is dependent on the population and task studied, warranting further studies.

However, previous research gave little attention to the physical appearance and early onset warnings of seizure. When a seizure occurs, electrodes near the epileptic foci will exhibit significantly fluctuating and inconsistent voltages. In this article, a novel approach to epileptic detection based on the hierarchy graph convolution network (HGCN) structure is proposed. Multiple features of time or frequency domains extracted from the raw EEG signals are taken as the input of HGCN. The topological relationship between every single electrode is utilized by HGCN. The tree classification (TC) and preictal fuzzification (PF) are proposed to adapt both multiclassification tasks and refine-classification tasks. Experiments are performed on the CHB-MIT and TUH data sets. Compared with the state of the art, our proposed model achieves a 5.77% improvement of accuracy on the CHB-MIT data set, and an improvement of 2.43% and 19.7% for sensitivity and specificity on the TUH data set, respectively.

Large-scale collaboration in ENIGMA-EEG: A perspective on the meta-analytic approach to link neurological and psychiatric liability genes to electrophysiological brain activity	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						brain disorders; electroencephalography; ENIGMA; harmonization; imaging genetics; open science	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; GAMMA OSCILLATION FREQUENCY; SELF-ORGANIZED CRITICALITY; GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; MINIMUM SPANNING TREE; PHASE-LAG INDEX; HUMAN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS	Background and purpose The ENIGMA-EEG working group was established to enable large-scale international collaborations among cohorts that investigate the genetics of brain function measured with electroencephalography (EEG). In this perspective, we will discuss why analyzing the genetics of functional brain activity may be crucial for understanding how neurological and psychiatric liability genes affect the brain. Methods We summarize how we have performed our currently largest genome-wide association study of oscillatory brain activity in EEG recordings by meta-analyzing the results across five participating cohorts, resulting in the first genome-wide significant hits for oscillatory brain function located in/near genes that were previously associated with psychiatric disorders. We describe how we have tackled methodological issues surrounding genetic meta-analysis of EEG features. We discuss the importance of harmonizing EEG signal processing, cleaning, and feature extraction. Finally, we explain our selection of EEG features currently being investigated, including the temporal dynamics of oscillations and the connectivity network based on synchronization of oscillations. Results We present data that show how to perform systematic quality control and evaluate how choices in reference electrode and montage affect individual differences in EEG parameters. Conclusion The long list of potential challenges to our large-scale meta-analytic approach requires extensive effort and organization between participating cohorts; however, our perspective shows that these challenges are surmountable. Our perspective argues that elucidating the genetic of EEG oscillatory activity is a worthwhile effort in order to elucidate the pathway from gene to disease liability.	[Smit, Dirk J.

To accomplish this in real-time, a conventional Yule-Walker (YW)-based autoregressive (AR) model has been used. However, the brain state-dependent real-time implementation of a closed-loop system employing an adaptive method has not yet been explored. Our primary purpose was to investigate whether time-series forward prediction using an adaptive least mean square (LMS)-based AR model would be implementable in a real-time closed-loop system or not. EEG state-dependent triggers synchronized with the EEG peaks and troughs of alpha oscillations in both an open-eyes resting state and a visual task. For the resting and visual conditions, statistical results showed that the proposed method succeeded in giving triggers at a specific phase of EEG oscillations for all participants. These individual results showed that the LMS-based AR model was successfully implemented in a real-time closed-loop system targeting specific phases of alpha oscillations and can be used as an adaptive alternative to the conventional and machine-learning approaches with a low computational load.

Electrocorticography (ECOG), electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) may help elucidate the brain mechanisms underlying CR, as CR is thought to be related to efficient utilization of remaining brain resources. The purpose of this systematic review is to collect, evaluate, and synthesize the findings on neural correlates of CR estimates using ECOG, EEG, and MEG. Method We examined articles that were published from the first standardized definition of CR. Eleven EEG and five MEG cross-sectional studies met the inclusion criteria: They concerned original research, analyzed (M)EEG in humans, used a validated CR estimate, and related (M)EEG to CR. Quality assessment was conducted using an adapted form of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. No ECOG study met the inclusion criteria. Results A total of 1383 participants from heterogeneous patient, young and older healthy groups were divided into three categories by (M)EEG methodology: Eight (M)EEG studies employed event-related fields or potentials, six studies analyzed brain oscillations at rest (of which one also analyzed a cognitive task), and three studies analyzed brain connectivity. Various CR estimates were employed and all studies compared different (M)EEG measures and CR estimates. Several associations between (M)EEG measures and CR estimates were observed. Conclusion Our findings support that (M)EEG measures are related to CR estimates, particularly in healthy individuals. However, the character of this relationship is dependent on the population and task studied, warranting further studies.

In this study, we use infants' high-density electroencephalography (EEG) to characterize spatiotemporal and spectral functional organizations of brain network dynamics.</p> Methods: We used source-reconstructed EEG and graph theoretical analyses in 100 infants (84 preterm, 16 term born) to identify the rich-club topological organization, temporal dynamics, and spectral fingerprints of dynamic functional brain networks.</p> Results: Five dynamic functional brain networks are identified, which have rich-club topological organizations, distinctive spectral fingerprints (in the delta and low-alpha frequency), and scale-invariant temporal dynamics (<0.1 Hz): The default mode, primary sensory-limbic system, thalamo-frontal, thalamo-sensorimotor, and visual-limbic system. The temporal dynamics of these networks are correlated in a hierarchically leading-following organization, showing that infant brain networks arise from long-range synchronization of band-limited cortical oscillation based on interacting fast- and slow-coherent cortical oscillations.</p> Conclusion: Dynamic functional brain networks do not solely depend on the maturation of cognitive networks; instead, the brain network dynamics exist in infants at term age well before the childhood and adulthood, and hence, it offers a quantitative measurement of neurotypical development in infants. Clinical Trial Registration Number: ACTRN12615000591550.</p> Impact statement Our work offers novel functional insights into the brain network characterization in infants, providing a new functional basis for future deployable prognostication approaches.</p>	[Mehrkanoon, Steve; Boashash, Boualem; Colditz, Paul] Univ Queensland, Clin Res Ctr, Bldg 71-918, Brisbane, Qld 4029, Australia; [Mehrkanoon, Steve; Boashash, Boualem; Colditz, Paul] Royal Brisbane & Womens Hosp, Metro North Hosp & Hlth Serv, Herston, Qld, Australia; [Mehrkanoon, Steve; Colditz, Paul] Univ Queensland, Perinatal Res Ctr, St Lucia, Qld, Australia		Mehrkanoon, S (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Clin Res Ctr, Bldg 71-918, Brisbane, Qld 4029, Australia.	steve.mehrkanoon@unimelb.edu.au			Advance Queensland Fellowship Grant - Queensland State Government, Australia [AQRF06016-17RD2]; National Health and Medical Research Project [APP1084032]; Qatar Foundation [NPRP6-885-2-364, NPRP6-680-2282]	Advance Queensland Fellowship Grant - Queensland State Government, Australia; National Health and Medical Research Project; Qatar Foundation	S.M. was supported by an Advance Queensland Fellowship Grant (AQRF06016-17RD2) funded by the Queensland State Government, Australia (2017-2019).

Detection of high-frequency oscillations in electroencephalography: A scoping review and an adaptable open-source framework	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Review						Epilepsy; High frequency oscillations; Automated detection; Electroencephalography	AUTOMATIC DETECTION; FAST RIPPLES; K-MEANS; EPILEPSY; HFOS; CLASSIFICATION; HZ; IDENTIFICATION; RECORDINGS; IMPROVE	Purpose: High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are putative biomarkers of epileptogenicity. These electrophysiological phenomena can be effectively detected in electroencephalography using automated methods. Nonetheless, the implementation of these methods into clinical practice remains challenging as significant variability exists between algorithms and their characterizations of HFOs. Here, we perform a scoping review of the literature pertaining to automated HFO detection methods. In addition, we propose a framework for defining and detecting HFOs based on a simplified single-stage time-frequency based detection algorithm with clinically familiar parameters. Methods: Several databases (OVID Medline, Web of Science, PubMed) were searched for articles presenting novel, automated HFO detection methods. Details related to the algorithm and various stages of data acquisition, preprocessing, and analysis were abstracted from included studies. Results: From the 261 records screened, 57 articles presented novel, automated HFO detection methods and were included in the scoping review. These algorithms were categorized into 3 groups based on their most salient features: energy thresholding, time-frequency analysis, and data mining/machine learning. Algorithms were optimized for specific datasets and suffered from low specificity. A framework for user-constrained inputs is proposed to circumvent some of the weaknesses of highly performant detectors. Conclusions: Further efforts are required to optimize and validate existing automated HFO detection methods for clinical utility. The proposed framework may be applied to understand and standardize the variations in HFO definitions across institutions.

Seizure prediction, can greatly improve patients' quality of life in many ways, such as preventing accidents and reducing harm that may occur during epileptic seizures. This work aims to develop a general method for predicting seizures in specific patients through exploring the time-frequency correlation of features obtained from multi-channel EEG signals. We convert the original EEG signals into spectrograms that represent time-frequency characteristics by applying short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to the EEG signals. For the first time, we propose a dual self-attention residual network (RDANet) that combines a spectrum attention module integrating local features with global features, with a channel attention module mining the interdependence between channel mappings to achieve better forecasting performance. Our proposed approach achieved a sensitivity of 89.33%, a specificity of 93.02%, an AUC of 91.26% and an accuracy of 92.07% on 13 patients from the public CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset. Our experiments show that different EEG signal prediction segment lengths are an important factor affecting prediction performance. Our proposed method is competitive and achieves good robustness without patient-specific engineering.

This paper proposes the acquisition and processing of surface Electromyography (sEMG) on the facial muscles activated during the process of speaking and Electroencephalography (EEG), synchronized in time by means of an audio file. Data was collected in seven healthy volunteers and seven patients with dysarthria at the Physiotherapy Department of the Porto Alegre Clinical Hospital. The main objective is to classify the biosignals for verbal commands established by Support Vector Machine (SVM) method for the sEMG and Naive Bayes (NB) method for the EEG. Both methods were compared with the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) method. Extracted features of sEMG signal were: standard deviation, arithmetic mean, skewness, kurtosis and RMS. For the EEG signal, characteristics were extracted in frequency domain such as: minimum, maximum, average and standard deviation, and skewness and kurtosis, in the time domain. As part of the processing method, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) filters were employed in order to increase the discriminating activity between motion classes in the EEG signal. Mental task identification in healthy and dysarthric subjects reached an accuracy of 77.6-80.8%.

Cognitive fatigue - a neural state that is associated with an increased incidence of errorful performance - is responsible for accidents on a daily basis which at times can cost human lives. To gain better insight into the neural signature of cognitive fatigue in the present study we used mEEG to examine the relationship between perceived cognitive fatigue and human-event related brain potentials (ERPs) and electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations in a sample of 1,000 people. As a secondary goal, we wanted to further demonstrate the capability of mEEG to accurately measure ERP and EEG data. To accomplish these goals, participants performed a standard visual oddball task on an Apple iPad while EEG data were recorded from a Muse EEG headband. Counter to traditional EEG studies, experimental setup and data collection was completed in less than seven minutes on average. An analysis of our EEG data revealed robust N200 and P300 ERP components and neural oscillations in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. In line with previous findings we observed correlations between ERP components and EEG power and perceived cognitive fatigue. Further, we demonstrate here that a linear combination of ERP and EEG features is a significantly better predictor of perceived cognitive fatigue than any ERP or EEG feature on its own. In sum, our results provide validation of mEEG as a viable tool for research and provide further insight into the impact of cognitive fatigue on the human brain.

In recent studies, the introduction of convolutional neural networks (CNN) has contributed to substantial improvements in the EEG signal classification performance. However, there is still a key challenge with the existing CNN-based EEG signal classification methods, the accuracy of them is not very satisfying. This is because most of the existing methods only utilize the feature maps in the last layer of CNN for EEG signal classification, which might miss some local and detailed information for accurate classification. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a multi-scale CNN model-based EEG signal classification method. In this method, first, the EEG signals are preprocessed and converted to time-frequency images using the short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) technique. Then, a multi-scale CNN model is designed for EEG signal classification, which takes the converted time-frequency image as the input. Especially, in the designed multi-scale CNN model, both the local and global information is taken into consideration. The performance of the proposed method is verified on the benchmark data set 2b used in the BCI contest IV. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of the proposed method is 73.9 percent, which improves the classification accuracy of 10.4, 5.5, 16.2 percent compared with the traditional methods including artificial neural network, support vector machine, and stacked auto-encoder.

Dichotic listening deficits in amblyaudia are characterized by aberrant neural oscillations in auditory cortex	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Auditory processing disorders (APD); Event-related brain potentials (ERPs); Gamma/beta band response; Hemispheric asymmetries; Phase-locking; Time-frequency analysis	WHITE-MATTER MICROSTRUCTURE; PROCESSING DISORDER APD; CONDUCTIVE HEARING-LOSS; RIGHT-EAR ADVANTAGE; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; BINAURAL INTERACTION; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; INTRACEREBRAL SOURCES; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; BETA-OSCILLATIONS	Objective: Children diagnosed with auditory processing disorder (APD) show deficits in processing complex sounds that are associated with difficulties in higher-order language, learning, cognitive, and communicative functions. Amblyaudia (AMB) is a subcategory of APD characterized by abnormally large ear asymmetries in dichotic listening tasks. Methods: Here, we examined frequency-specific neural oscillations and functional connectivity via high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in children with and without AMB during passive listening of non-speech stimuli. Results: Time-frequency maps of these "brain rhythms" revealed stronger phase-locked beta-gamma (similar to 35 Hz) oscillations in AMB participants within bilateral auditory cortex for sounds presented to the right ear, suggesting a hypersynchronization and imbalance of auditory neural activity. Brain-behavior correlations revealed neural asymmetries in cortical responses predicted the larger than normal right-ear advantage seen in participants with AMB. Additionally, we found weaker functional connectivity in the AMB group from right to left auditory cortex, despite their stronger neural responses overall. Conclusion: Our results reveal abnormally large auditory sensory encoding and an imbalance in communication between cerebral hemispheres (ipsi- to -contralateral signaling) in AMB. Significance: These neurophysiological changes might lead to the functionally poorer behavioral capacity to integrate information between the two ears in children with AMB.

To see, not to see or to see poorly: Perceptual quality and guess rate as a function of electroencephalography (EEG) brain activity in an orientation perception task	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; orientation perception; standard mixture model; time-frequency analysis; variable precision model; visual perception	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; ERP; THETA; RESPONSES; COMPONENT; TOOLBOX	Detection of visual stimuli fluctuates over time, and these fluctuations have been shown to correlate with time domain evoked activity and frequency-domain periodic activity. However, it is unclear if these fluctuations are related to a change in guess rate, perceptual quality or both. Here we determined whether the quality of perception randomly varies across trials or is fixed so that the variability is the same. Then we estimated how perceptual quality and guess rate on an orientation perception task relate to electroencephalography (EEG) activity. Response errors were fitted to variable precision models and the standard mixture model to determine whether perceptual quality is from a varying or fixed distribution. Overall, the best fit was the standard mixture model that assumes that response variability can be defined by a fixed distribution. The power and phase of 2-7 Hz post-target activities were found to vary along with task performance in that more accurate trials had greater power, and the preferred phase differed significantly between accurate and guess trials. Guess rate and sigma were significantly lower on trials with high 2- to 3-Hz power than low, and the difference started around 250-ms post-target. These effects coincide with changes in the P3 event-related potential (ERP): There was a more positive deflection in the accurate trials versus guesses. These results suggest that the spread of errors (perceptual quality) can be characterised by a fixed range of values. Where the errors fall within that range is modulated by the post-target power in the lower-frequency bands and their analogous ERPs.

Here we examined human electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations in the context of motor imagery performance as measured by imagery success within participants and imagery ability between participants. We recorded continuous EEG activity while participants performed the Test of Ability in Movement Imagery (TAMI), an objective test of motor imagery task. Results demonstrated that mu oscillatory activity significantly decreased during successful as compared to unsuccessful imagery trials. However, the extent of reduction in mu oscillations did not correlate with overall imagery ability as measured by the total TAMI score. These findings provide further support for the involvement of mu oscillations in indexing motor imagery performance and suggest that mu oscillations may reflect important processes related to imagery accuracy, processes likely related to those underlying overt motor production and motor understanding.

The considerable differences in their technical design and practical use give rise to the impression that these are quite different techniques altogether. Here, we review, discuss and illustrate the fundamental principle of Helmholtz reciprocity that provides a common ground for all four techniques. We show that, more than 150 years after its discovery by Helmholtz in 1853, reciprocity is important to appreciate the strengths and limitations of these four classical tools in neuroscience. We build this case by explaining the concept of Helmholtz reciprocity, presenting a methodological account of this principle for all four methods and, finally, by illustrating its application in practical clinical studies.

Previous studies indicate beta band modulation is involved in predicting the onset of auditory rhythmic events (Fujioka et al., 2009, 2012; Snyder & Large, 2005). We sought to determine if similar processes are recruited for prediction of visual rhythms by investigating whether beta band activity plays a role in a modality-dependent manner for rhythm perception. We looked at electroencephalography time-frequency neural correlates of prediction using an omission paradigm with auditory and visual rhythms. By using omissions, we can separate out predictive timing activity from stimulus-driven activity. We hypothesized that there would be modality-independent markers of rhythm prediction in induced beta band oscillatory activity, and our results support this hypothesis. We find induced and evoked predictive timing in both auditory and visual modalities. Additionally, we performed an exploratory-independent components-based spatial clustering analysis, and describe all resulting clusters. This analysis reveals that there may be overlapping networks of predictive beta activity based on common activation in the parietal and right frontal regions, auditory-specific predictive beta in bilateral sensorimotor regions, and visually specific predictive beta in midline central, and bilateral temporal/parietal regions. This analysis also shows evoked predictive beta activity in the left sensorimotor region specific to auditory rhythms and implicates modality-dependent networks for auditory and visual rhythm perception.

Methods: In a sham-controlled interventional study on 31 healthy volunteers, we used concomitant tran-scranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG). We compared baseline motor evoked potentials (MEPs), M1 iTBS-evoked EEG oscillations, and resting-state EEG (rsEEG) between sub-jects who did and did not show MEP facilitation following iTBS. We also investigated whether baseline MEP and iTBS-evoked EEG oscillations could explain inter and intraindividual variability in iTBS afteref-fects. Results: The facilitation group had smaller baseline MEPs than the no-facilitation group and showed more iTBS-evoked EEG oscillation synchronization in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Resting-state EEG power was similar between groups and iTBS had a similar non-significant effect on rsEEG in both groups. Baseline MEP amplitude and beta iTBS-evoked EEG oscillation power explained both inter and intraindividual variability in MEP modulation following iTBS. Conclusions: The results show that variability in iTBS-associated plasticity depends on baseline corti-cospinal excitability and on the ability of iTBS to engage M1 beta oscillations. Significance: These observations can be used to optimize iTBS investigational and therapeutic applications. (c) 2021 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Motor Imagery (MI) classification is one of the major contributions in BCI which works on segment of EEG signal within particular frequency band. Herein, feature selection plays important role in obtaining good classification results. In this article, Beta and Gamma frequency are considered with Statistical DWT (SDWT) based features for classification of EEG signals (MI classification) for patient monitoring, assistance healthcare services and daily living activities. Harmony search algorithm of feature selection is used to obtain the optimal feature set for classification of MI. The results show that frequency centric SDWT achieves average accuracy of 92.49% for weighted KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour) method. Comparison of accuracies before and after feature selection portrays that feature selection with harmony search improves the performance of proposed MI classification.

Estimation of the independent components reliability of EEG signal in a clinical application	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Independent Component Analysis (ICA); Electroencephalography; Component reliability degree; Visual sustained attention; Fourier ICA		Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a statistical method that has effective roles in processing the electroencephalography (EEG) signal, especially for finding artifacts. This research aimed to automatically estimate the validity of independent components in the EEG signal and extracting more brain-related sources. Data were obtained from adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) participants and control groups during the continuous performance task (CPT). The reliability of ICs was estimated by different methods, including the statistical validity measurement for each component, their physiological plausibility and the equivalent dipole interpretation both in time and frequency domain. Group-ICA algorithm was applied to ADHD/control groups in order to compare the validity of components between subjects. Homogenous components in each group were determined by clustering. The results showed that in all algorithms, including the automatic algorithm and Group-ICA, the number of reliable components in the frequency domain is greater than (about twice) the number of estimated components in the time domain. Statistical results (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) for comparison the number of reliable components of degree 3 in both methods showed a significant difference (P-value: 0.0113) and the same result was observed for reliable components of degree 2 (P-value: 4.8e-04).

Here, we propose a single-trial electroencephalography (EEG) classification process predicting individuals' responses, that is, target correct versus target non-correct during a working memory task, N-back. We used event-related (de-)synchronization (ERD and ERS) prior to an anticipatory cue as features. The proposed comprehensive process addresses single-trial EEG classification challenges such as temporal overlap between training and testing datasets, feature selection's stability, and significance of the classification accuracy which have been often overlooked. Our model identified for the first time a few (ranged between 4 and 10) brain regions and oscillations where ERD and ERS predicted an individual's performance. Mean (SD) prediction accuracy across 50 participants (mean age [SD] = 28.56 [7.55]) was 69.51% (8.41). Accuracy was significantly above chance in 34 participants. This machine learning-based approach provides a proof of principle for individualizing EEG targets for potential interventions.

J	Li, MA; Peng, WM; Yang, JF				Li, Ming-Ai; Peng, Wei-Min; Yang, Jin-Fu			Key Band Image Sequences and A Hybrid Deep Neural Network for Recognition of Motor Imagery EEG	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Motor imagery electroencephalography; data representation; convolutional neural network; long short-term memory; image sequence	CLASSIFICATION	Deep neural network is a promising method to recognize motor imagery electroencephalography (MI-EEG), which is often used as the source signal of a rehabilitation system; and the core issues are the data representation and the matched neural networks. MI-EEG images is one of the main expressions, however, all the measured data of a trial are usually integrated into one image, causing information loss, especially in the time dimension; and the neural network architecture might not fully extract the features over the alpha and beta frequency bands, which are closely related to MI. In this paper, we propose a key band imaging method (KBIM). A short time Fourier transform is applied to each electrode of the MI-EEG signal to generate a time-frequency image, and the parts corresponding to the alpha and beta bands are intercepted, fused, and further arranged into the EEG electrode map by the nearest neighbor interpolation method, forming two key band image sequences. In addition, a hybrid deep neural network named the parallel multimodule convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network (PMMCL) is designed for the extraction and fusion of the spatial-spectral and temporal features of two key band image sequences to realize automatic classification of MI-EEG signals. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets, and the accuracies after 10-fold cross-validation are 97.42% and 77.33%, respectively.

However, its relationships with sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) have been scarcely investigated. Here, our main objective was to characterize the overnight EEG of OSA-affected children and its putative relationships with polysomnographic measures and cognitive functions. A two-step analysis involving 294 children (176 controls, 57% males, age range: 5-9 years) was conducted for this purpose. First, the activity and irregularity of overnight EEG spectrum were characterized in the typical frequency bands by means of relative spectral power and spectral entropy, respectively: delta(1) (0.1-2 Hz), delta(2) (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), sigma (10-16 Hz), beta(1) (13-19 Hz), beta(2) (19-30 Hz), and gamma (30-70 Hz). Then, a correlation network analysis was conducted to evaluate relationships between them, six polysomnography variables (apnea-hypopnea index, respiratory arousal index, spontaneous arousal index, overnight minimum blood oxygen saturation, wake time after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency), and six cognitive scores (differential ability scales, Peabody picture vocabulary test, expressive vocabulary test, design copying, phonological processing, and tower test). We found that as the severity of the disease increases, OSA broadly affects sleep EEG to the point that the information from the different frequency bands becomes more similar, regardless of activity or irregularity. EEG activity and irregularity information from the most severely affected children were significantly associated with polysomnographic variables, which were coherent with both micro and macro sleep disruptions. We hypothesize that the EEG changes caused by OSA could be related to the occurrence of respiratory-related arousals, as well as thalamic inhibition in the slow oscillation generation due to increases in arousal levels aimed at recovery from respiratory events. Furthermore, relationships between sleep EEG and cognitive scores emerged regarding language, visual-spatial processing, and executive function with pronounced associations found with EEG irregularity in delta(1) (Peabody picture vocabulary test and expressive vocabulary test maximum absolute correlations 0.61 and 0.54) and beta(2) (phonological processing, 0.74; design copying, 0.65; and Tow 0.52). Our results show that overnight EEG informs both sleep alterations and cognitive effects of pediatric OSA. Moreover, EEG irregularity provides new information that complements and expands the classic EEG activity analysis. These findings lay the foundation for the use of sleep EEG to assess cognitive changes in pediatric OSA.

This study aims to investigate whether the resting-state EEG microstate analysis could provide novel insights into the abnormal temporal and spatial properties of intrinsic brain activities in patients with IGE.Methods: Three groups of participants were chosen for this study (namely IGE-Seizure, IGE-Seizure Free, and Healthy Controls). EEG microstate analysis on the resting-state EEG datasets was conducted for all participants. The average duration ("Duration"), the average number of microstates per second ("Frequency"), as well as the percentage of total analysis time occupied in that state ("Coverage") of the EEG microstate were compared among the three groups.Results: For microstate classes B and D, the differences in Duration, Frequency, and Coverage among the three groups were not statistically significant. Both Frequency and Coverage of microstate class A were statistically significantly larger in the IGE-Seizure group than in the other two groups. The Duration and Coverage of microstate class C were statistically significantly smaller in the IGE-Seizure group than those in the other two groups.Conclusions: The Microstate class A was regarded as a sensorimotor network and Microstate class C was mainly related to the salience network, this study indicated an altered sensorimotor and salience network in patients with IGE, especially in those who had experienced seizures in the past 2 years, while the visual and attention networks seemed to be intact.Significance: The temporal dynamics of resting-state networks were studied through EEG microstate analysis in patients with IGE, which is expected to generate indices that could be utilized in clinical researches of epilepsy.

J	Masood, N; Farooq, H				Masood, Naveen; Farooq, Humera			Comparing Neural Correlates of Human Emotions across Multiple Stimulus Presentation Paradigms	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						classification; common spatial pattern (CSP); electroencephalography (EEG); emotional imagery; emotions; feature extraction	PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EEG ACTIVITY; CLASSIFICATION; ASYMMETRY; ALGORITHM; RESPONSES; SELECTION; MUSIC; FACES	Most electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition systems rely on a single stimulus to evoke emotions. These systems make use of videos, sounds, and images as stimuli. Few studies have been found for self-induced emotions. The question "if different stimulus presentation paradigms for same emotion, produce any subject and stimulus independent neural correlates" remains unanswered. Furthermore, we found that there are publicly available datasets that are used in a large number of studies targeting EEG-based human emotional state recognition. Since one of the major concerns and contributions of this work is towards classifying emotions while subjects experience different stimulus-presentation paradigms, we need to perform new experiments. This paper presents a novel experimental study that recorded EEG data for three different human emotional states evoked with four different stimuli presentation paradigms. Fear, neutral, and joy have been considered as three emotional states. In this work, features were extracted with common spatial pattern (CSP) from recorded EEG data and classified through linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The considered emotion-evoking paradigms included emotional imagery, pictures, sounds, and audio-video movie clips. Experiments were conducted with twenty-five participants. Classification performance in different paradigms was evaluated, considering different spectral bands. With a few exceptions, all paradigms showed the best emotion recognition for higher frequency spectral ranges. Interestingly, joy emotions were classified more strongly as compared to fear. The average neural patterns for fear vs. joy emotional states are presented with topographical maps based on spatial filters obtained with CSP for averaged band power changes for all four paradigms. With respect to the spectral bands, beta and alpha oscillation responses produced the highest number of significant results for the paradigms under consideration. With respect to brain region, the frontal lobe produced the most significant results irrespective of paradigms and spectral bands. The temporal site also played an effective role in generating statistically significant findings. To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted for EEG emotion recognition while considering four different stimuli paradigms. This work provides a good contribution towards designing EEG-based system for human emotion recognition that could work effectively in different real-time scenarios.

Most often, experiencing fatigue on the road leads to operator errors and behavioral lapses. Thus, there is a need to predict the cognitive state of drivers, particularly their fatigue level. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been demonstrated to be effective for monitoring changes in the human brain state and behavior. Thirty-seven subjects participated in this driving experiment and performed a perform lane-keeping task in a visual-reality environment. Three domains, namely, frequency, temporal, and 2-D spatial information, of the EEG channel location were comprehensively considered. A 4-D convolutional neural-network (4-D CNN) algorithm was then proposed to associate all information from the EEG signals and the changes in the human state and behavioral performance. A 4-D CNN achieves superior forecasting performance over 2-D CNN, 3-D CNN, and shallow networks. The results showed a 3.82% improvement in the root mean-square error, a 3.45% improvement in the error rate, and a 11.98% improvement in the correlation coefficient with 4-D CNN compared with 3-D CNN. The 4-D CNN algorithm extracts the significant theta and alpha activations in the frontal and posterior cingulate cortices under distinct fatigue levels. This work contributes to enhancing our understanding of deep learning methods in the analysis of EEG signals. We even envision that deep learning might serve as a bridge between translation neuroscience and further real-world applications.

Contagious itch, i.e., subjective feelings of itchiness induced by watching others' scratching behavior, is common in patients with AD. Using electroencephalography, we examined alpha (8-13 Hz) oscillations in sensorimotor areas associated with the desire to scratch in patients with AD. Methods: Thirty-six patients with AD and 34 healthy controls (HCs) participated in this study. They evaluated their itch levels after watching short videos of a model scratching or tapping parts of his body. Neural oscillations were recorded from nine electrodes, including those placed over sensorimotor areas. Time-frequency analysis was used to compare mu rhythm suppression over the sensorimotor areas in response to these videos between patients with AD and HCs. Results: The behavioral test showed that the visual stimuli induced increased feelings of itchiness in patients with AD relative to HCs under the tapping and scratching conditions. The time-frequency analysis revealed that mu rhythm suppression in response to scratching images was significantly prominent in patients with AD, but not in HCs. Conclusion: Patients with AD exhibited increased susceptibility to contagious itch. This phenomenon might be related to enhanced mu rhythm suppression in sensorimotor areas of the brain in these patients. Our findings provide new insight into the neurophysiological basis of itch sensations in patients with AD.

Binaural hearing is fundamental in understanding speech in noisy backgrounds. Any disfunction in one or both ears could cause a disruption in the processing mechanism. Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) are electrical potentials evoked by externally presented auditory stimuli from any part of the auditory system. A non-invasive technology, electroencephalography (EEG) is used for the monitoring of AEPs. The research aims to identify the best suited electrode positions through correlation analysis and analyse the AEP signals from the selected electrodes in order to detect binaural sensitivity of the human brain. The study evaluates the time-averaged EEG responses of normal hearing subjects to auditory stimuli. The stimuli used for the study are 500 Hz Blackman windowed pure tones, presented in either homophasic (the same phase in both ears) or antiphasic (180-degree phase difference between the two ears) conditions. The study focuses on understanding the effect of phase reversal of auditory stimuli, an under interaural time difference (ITD) cue, on the middle latency response (MLR) region of the AEPs. A correlation analysis was carried out between the eight different locations and as a result, Cz and Pz electrode positions were selected as the best suited positions for further analysis. The selected electrode signals were further processed in the time domain and frequency domain analysis. In the time domain analysis, it was found that Cz electrode for eight subjects out of nine and Pz electrode for seven subjects out of nine, had the larger area under signal curve obtained in the antiphasic condition than in the homophasic signals. Frequency domain analysis showed that the frequency bands 20 to 25Hz and 25 to 30Hz had the most energy when elicited by antiphasic stimuli than by homophasic stimuli. The findings of this study can be further utilised for the detection of binaural processing in a human brain.

Materials and Methods Two women with isolated generalized dystonia were selected for bilateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) DBS. After the electrodes' implantation, cortical activity was recorded by a portable electroencephalography (EEG) system simultaneously with GPi LFPs activity, during several motor tasks, gait, and rest condition. Recordings were not performed during stimulation. EEG and LFPs signals relative to each specific movement were coupled together and grouped in neck/upper limbs movements and gait. Power spectral density (PSD), EEG-LFP coherence (through envelope of imaginary coherence operator), and 1/f exponent of LFP-PSD background were calculated. Results In both patients, the pallidal LFPs PSD at rest was characterized by prominent 4-12 Hz activity. Voluntary movements increased activity in the theta (theta) band (4-7 Hz) compared to rest, in both LFPs and EEG signals. Gait induced a drastic raise of theta activity in both patients' pallidal activity, less marked for the EEG signal. A coherence peak within the 8-13 Hz range was found between pallidal LFPs and EEG recorded at rest. Conclusions Neck/upper limbs voluntary movements and gait suppressed the GPi-LFPs-cortical-EEG coherence and differently impacted both EEG and LFPs low frequency activity. These findings suggest a selective modulation of the cortico-basal ganglia network activity in dystonia.

Traditionally, EEG signals have been studied from a linear viewpoint by means of statistical and frequency features. Nevertheless, given that the brain follows a completely nonlinear and nonstationary behavior, linear metrics present certain important limitations. In this sense, the use of nonlinear methods has recently revealed new information that may help to understand how the brain works under a series of emotional states. Hence, this paper summarizes the most recent works that have applied nonlinear methods in EEG signal analysis for emotion recognition. This paper also identifies some nonlinear indices that have not been employed yet in this research area.

However, its relationship with neurophysiological pain mechanisms is poorly understood. Brain oscillations measured by electroencephalography (EEG) might help gain insight into this complex relationship. Objective To investigate the relationship between CPM response and self-reported pain intensity in non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) and explore respective EEG signatures associated to these mechanisms. Design Cross-sectional analysis. Participants Thirty NSCLBP patients participated. Methods Self-reported low back pain, questionnaires, mood scales, CPM (static and dynamic quantitative sensory tests), and resting surface EEG data were collected and analyzed. Linear regression models were used for statistical analysis. Results CPM was not significantly correlated with self-reported pain intensity scores. Relative power of EEG in the beta and high beta bands as recorded from the frontal, central, and parietal cortical areas were significantly associated with CPM. EEG relative power at delta and theta bands as recorded from the central area were significantly correlated with self-reported pain intensity scores while controlling for self-reported depression. Conclusions Faster EEG frequencies recorded from pain perception areas may provide a signature of a potential cortical compensation caused by chronic pain states. Slower EEG frequencies may have a critical role in abnormal pain processing.	[Teixeira, Paulo E.

However, they ignore the characteristic relationship of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in the time domain. Therefore, this paper proposes a network decomposition model based on Improved Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), it is suitable for time-frequency analysis of brain functional network. On the one hand, it solves the problem of mode mixing on original EMD method, especially on high-density EEG data. On the other hand, by building brain function networks on different intrinsic mode function (IMF), we can perform time-frequency analysis of brain function connections. It provides a new insight for brain function connectivity analysis of major depressive disorder (MDD). Experimental results found that the IMFs waveform decomposed by Improved EMD was more stable and the difference between IMFs was obvious, it indicated that the mode mixing can be effectively solved. Besides, the analysis of the brain network, we found that the changes in MDD functional connectivity on different IMFs, it may be related to the pathological changes for MDD. More statistical results on three network metrics proved that there were significant differences between MDD and normal controls (NC) group. In addition, the aberrant brain network structure of MDDs was also confirmed in the hubs characteristic. These findings may provide potential biomarkers for the clinical diagnosis of MDD patients.

Since this variability exists even in an identical stimulus condition, it reflects the internal neural dynamics of the brain. To understand the neural dynamics that influence the reaction time, we conducted an electroencephalogram (EEG) experiment in which participants were asked to press a response button as quickly as possible when a stimulus was visually presented. Phase-locking factor analysis revealed that phase resetting in two frequency bands, which appeared 0.2 s after the stimulus presentation, characterized the reaction time. The combination of the theta band phase resetting in the left parietal region and the delta band phase resetting mainly in the posterior region was associated with the fastest reaction time, whereas delta band phase resetting without theta band phase resetting was associated with the faster reaction time. The results indicated that there were frequency-dependent effects in the relationships between the EEG phase resetting and reaction time. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. and Japan Neuroscience Society.

Oscillatory phase is an important correlate of excitability and phase synchrony mediates information transfer between neuronal populations oscillating at that frequency. The ability to extract and exploit the prefrontal theta rhythm in real time in humans would facilitate insight into neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive processes involving the prefrontal cortex, and development of brain-state-dependent stimulation for therapeutic applications. Objectives We investigate individual source-space beamforming-based estimation of the prefrontal theta oscillation as a method to target specific phases of the ongoing theta oscillations in the human dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) with real-time EEG-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Different spatial filters for extracting the prefrontal theta oscillation from EEG signals are compared and additional signal quality criteria are assessed to take into account the dynamics of this cortical oscillation. Methods Twenty two healthy participants were recruited for anatomical MRI scans and EEG recordings with 18 composing the final analysis. We calculated individual spatial filters based on EEG beamforming in source space. The extracted EEG signal was then used to simulate real-time phase-detection and quantify the accuracy as compared to post-hoc phase estimates. Different spatial filters and triggering parameters were compared. Finally, we validated the feasibility of this approach by actual real-time triggering of TMS pulses at different phases of the prefrontal theta oscillation. Results Higher phase-detection accuracy was achieved using individualized source-based spatial filters, as compared to an average or standard Laplacian filter, and also by detecting and avoiding periods of low theta amplitude and periods containing a phase reset. Using optimized parameters, prefrontal theta-phase synchronized TMS of DMPFC was achieved with an accuracy of +/- 55 degrees. Conclusion This study demonstrates the feasibility of triggering TMS pulses during different phases of the ongoing prefrontal theta oscillation in real time. This method is relevant for brain state-dependent stimulation in human studies of cognition. It will also enable new personalized therapeutic repetitive TMS protocols for more effective treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Auditory attention detection (AAD) seeks to detect the attended speaker from one's brain signals that will enable many innovative human-machine systems. However, effective representation learning of electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a challenge. In this article, we propose a neural attention mechanism that dynamically assigns differentiated weights to the subbands and the channels of EEG signals to derive discriminative representations for AAD. In the nutshell, we would like to build a computational attention mechanism, i.e., neural attention, to model the auditory attention in human brain. We incorporate the proposed neural attention into an AAD system, and validate the neural attention mechanism through comprehensive experiments on two publicly available datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art reference baselines.

An experiment was conducted with thirty-three undergraduate students majoring in Computer Science. We recorded their EEG activities when they were reading two programs with three types of program constructs. At the same time, the participants' eye movements were recorded by an eye tracker to further understand the relationship between the program comprehension process and EEG activities. Experimental results show that the high-performance participants displayed higher performance for working memory (theta power), attention resource allocation (lower alpha power), and interaction between working memory and semantic memory (upper alpha power) in program comprehension tasks of complex constructs, which proves related theories proposed in the existing research on programming and cognition. The results of this study not only offer objective evidence of the roles cognition plays in program comprehension but also provide educators with suggestions for designing suitable pedagogical strategies.

Many recent studies on electroencephalography (EEG) have been focusing on modeling and estimating brain connectivity due to increasing evidence that it can help better understand various brain neurological conditions. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive updated review on studies of EEG-based brain connectivity, particularly on visualization options and associated machine learning applications, aiming to translate those techniques into useful clinical tools. This article reviews EEG-based functional and effective connectivity studies undertaken over the last few years, in terms of estimation, visualization, and applications associated with machine learning classifiers. Methods are explored and discussed from various dimensions, such as either linear or nonlinear, parametric or nonparametric, time-based, and frequency-based or time-frequency-based. Then it is followed by a novel review of brain connectivity visualization methods, grouped by Heat Map, data statistics, and Head Map, aiming to explore the variation of connectivity across different brain regions. Finally, the current challenges of related research and a roadmap for future related research are presented.

Since electroencephalography (EEG) signals maintain their normal state in PNES cases, it is not possible to diagnose using the EEG recordings alone. Therefore, long-term video EEG records and detailed patient history are needed for reliable diagnosis and correct treatment. However, the video EEG recording method is more expensive than the classical EEG. Therefore, it has great importance to distinguish PNES signals from normal epileptic seizure (ES) signals using only the EEG recordings. In the proposed study, using the Synchrosqueezed Transform (SST) that gives high-resolution time-frequency representations (TFR), inter-PNES, PNES, and Epileptic seizure EEG classification is introduced. 17 joint TF features are calculated from the TFRs, and various classifiers are used for classification processes. Classification problems with three classes (inter-PNES, PNES, and ES) and two classes (inter-PNES and PNES) are considered. Experimental results indicated that both three-class and two-class classification approaches achieved encouraging validation performances (three-class problem: 95.8% ACC, 86.9% SEN, 91.4% PRE, and 8.6% FDR; two-class problem: 96.4% ACC, 96.8% SEN, 973% PRE, and FDR lower than 10%).

Methods: Eighteen patients with drug-refractory epilepsy who underwent stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) evaluation and subsequent resective surgery were included. All patients were seizure-free post-operatively. The recorded seizures were retrospectively reviewed and time episodes including 5 min before electrographic onset were selected for further analysis to verify the presence of a transitional pattern in the transitional phase, which was distinct from interictal background and ictal onset. Besides, the components of transitional patterns which characterized by different pathological waveforms were identified by visual analysis and time-frequency analysis. The prevalence of transitional patterns between resection and non-resection, lesion and non-lesion sites were compared. In addition, the association between transitional patterns and types of epilepsy was explored. Results: Six transitional patterns characterized by different combinations of multiple pathological waveforms by visual analysis combined with time-frequency analysis were identified: spike/spike-waves/polyspikes; spike superimposed by HFOs; spike superimposed by gamma oscillations; spike followed by suppression; spike superimposed by HFOs and followed by suppression; and spike superimposed by gamma oscillations and followed by suppression. A higher prevalence of transitional patterns in resection than non-resection (p < 0.001) and in lesion than non-lesion contacts (p < 0.001). The pattern characterized by spike superimposed by HFOs and followed by suppression was more prevalent in resection than non-resection sites (p = 0.004). Further, there was an association between the complexity of transitional patterns and the location of contacts. Patterns with higher degree of complexity were more likely to be inside the resection area (p = 0.035). Besides, we found the pattern with spike superimposed by HFOs was associated more with limbic epilepsy than neocortical epilepsy (p < 0.001), whereas another 3 patterns, spike superimposed by gamma oscillation, spike followed by suppression and spike combined with HFOs and suppression, were observed more frequently in neocortical epilepsy than limbic epilepsy (p = 0.018, 0.011 and < 0.001, respectively). Conclusion: Transitional patterns from interictal to ictal state were characterized by different combinations of multiple pathological waveforms, which may be a potential marker of epileptogenic zone. Our findings support that the interaction of different neuronal oscillations or waveforms generated by different neuronal populations may be the potential mechanism of seizure generation.

The response of the gamma-oscillation to human visual stimuli is known to be both burst and resonant in nature, and the coupling between alpha and gamma oscillations may play a functional role in visual processing. To date, there is no study that examined the effects of gamma-frequency violet light (VL) stimulation on human electroencephalography (EEG). In this study, we investigated the neurophysiological changes induced by light stimulation using EEG. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the specific effects of 40 Hz gamma-frequency VL stimulation on EEG activity by comparing the effects of white light (WL) with the same condition. Twenty healthy participants (10 females: 37.5 +/- 14.3 years; 10 males: 38.0 +/- 13.3 years) participated in this study and the following results were observed. First, when compared with the power spectrum density (PSD) of baseline EEG, 40 Hz-WL induced significant increase of PSD in theta band. Second, compared the PSDs between EEG with 40 Hz-VL and EEG with 40 Hz-WL, 40 Hz-VL induced significantly lower enhancement in delta and theta bands than 40 Hz-WL. Third, when focused on the occipital area, negative peak of VEP with 40 Hz-VL was smaller than that of 40 Hz-WL. Fourth, 40 Hz-VL induced an increase of alpha-gamma coupling during the VEP at the F5 electrode site as well as post-EEG at the C4 electrode site, compared with baseline EEG. Thus, the present study suggested that 40 Hz-VL stimulation may induce unique photobiological neuromodulations on human EEG activity.

J	Wu, M; Wan, T; Wan, XB; Fang, ZL; Du, YX				Wu, Min; Wan, Ting; Wan, Xiongbo; Fang, Zelin; Du, Yuxiao			A new localization method for epileptic seizure onset zones based on time-frequency and clustering analysis	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Epilepsy; Seizure onset zones; High-frequency oscillations; Time-frequency analysis; Clustering analysis	AUTOMATIC DETECTION; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; IDENTIFICATION; CLASSIFICATION; HZ	High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are spontaneous electroencephalogram patterns that have been regarded as potential biomarkers of epileptic seizure onset zones (SOZs). Accurately detected HFOs are used to localize SOZs, which is crucial for the presurgical assessment. Since the visual marking of HFOs is time-consuming, a method is desirable to automatically detect HFOs for localizing SOZs in clinical practice. However, the existing methods cannot obtain satisfactory performance, which are not suitable for clinical application. In order to solve this problem, we present a new localization method for epileptic SOZs in this study. Firstly, a threshold method is used to detect events of interest (EoIs). Secondly, a time-frequency analysis method is adopted to acquire channels of interest (CoIs) by calculating the average power of EoIs on each channel. Then, the k-medoids clustering method is employed to detect HFOs of CoIs. Finally, the concentrations of detected HFOs are used to localize SOZs. The superiority of our localization method is demonstrated by comparing its sensitivity and specificity with some existing methods. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Related works have acquired many desirable outcomes. However, most of current studies focus on time-domain or frequency-domain measures as classification features using single or very few channels, which only obtain the local features but ignore the global information exchanging between different brain regions. Meanwhile, brain functional connectivity is considered to be closely related to brain activity and can be used to study the interaction relationship between brain areas. To explore the electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain mechanisms of sleep stages through functional connectivity, especially from different frequency bands, we applied phase-locked value (PLV) to build the functional connectivity network and analyze the brain interaction during sleep stages for different frequency bands. Then, we performed the feature-level, decision-level and hybrid fusion methods to discuss the performance of different frequency bands for sleep stages. The results show that (1) PLV increases in the lower frequency band (delta and alpha bands) and vice versa during different stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM); (2) alpha band shows a better discriminative ability for sleeping stages; (3) the classification accuracy of feature-level fusion (six frequency bands) reaches 96.91% and 96.14% for intra-subject and inter-subjects respectively, which outperforms decision-level and hybrid fusion methods.

Yet, what is meant by "computational model" is understood in many different ways by researchers in different fields of neuroscience and psychology, hindering communication and collaboration. In this review, we point out the state of the art of computational modeling in Electroencephalography (EEG) and outline how these models can be used to integrate findings from electrophysiology, network-level models, and behavior. On the one hand, computational models serve to investigate the mechanisms that generate brain activity, for example measured with EEG, such as the transient emergence of oscillations at different frequency bands and/or with different spatial topographies. On the other hand, computational models serve to design experiments and test hypotheses in silico. The final purpose of computational models of EEG is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the EEG signal. This is crucial for an accurate interpretation of EEG measurements that may ultimately serve in the development of novel clinical applications.

We propose a novel method to estimate the instantaneous oscillatory phase to implement a real-time system for state-informed sensory stimulation in electroencephalography (EEG) experiments. Approach. The method uses Kalman filter-based prediction to estimate current and future EEG signals. We tested the performance of our method in a real-time situation. Main results. Our method showed higher accuracy in predicting the EEG phase than the conventional autoregressive (AR) model-based method. Significance. A Kalman filter allows us to easily estimate the instantaneous phase of EEG oscillations based on the automatically estimated AR model implemented in a real-time signal processing machine. The proposed method has a potential for versatile applications targeting the modulation of EEG phase dynamics and the plasticity of brain networks in relation to perceptual or cognitive functions.

Signals of the central nervous system may disclose bioelectrical patterns, since listening to rhythmic sequences activates specific brain areas. In this paper, we analyze 42 neurologically normal Brazilian individuals, submitted to musical stimulation based on a procedure consisting of three different steps, during which the volunteer is kept with closed eyes. The first step is associated with the preliminary control silence period, without any stimulus, as the volunteer remains at rest. The second step consisted of unknown music stimulation. Finally, the third step involves post-music rest. Quantitative signal analysis computes the power spectrum time variations. Results point out stronger changes in gamma and high gamma waves (30 - 100 Hz). Even though the clinical rhythms (0- 30 Hz) change throughout the whole period of the experiment, quantitative differences at gamma and high gamma bands are remarkably greater. Particularly, when comparing the initial silent period and the final post-stimulation silent one, bioelectrical differences are only highlighted by gamma and high gamma rhythms. In consequence, this paper points out that the EEG analysis of cognitive issues related to musical perception cannot disregard gamma and high gamma waves.

In the literature, patient's electroencephalography (EEG) signals are frequently used for an epilepsy diagnosis. However, the success of epileptic examination procedures from quantitative EEG signals is limited. In this paper, a high-resolution time-frequency (TF) representation called Synchrosqueezed Transform (SST) is used to classify epileptic EEG signals. The SST matrices of seizure and pre-seizure EEG data of 16 epilepsy patients are calculated. Two approaches based on machine learning and deep learning are proposed to classify pre-seizure and seizure signals. In the machine learning-based approach, the various features like higher-order joint moments are calculated and these features are classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers. In the deep learning-based approach, the SST matrix was recorded as an image and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture was used to classify these images. Simulation results demonstrate that both approaches achieved promising validation accuracy rates. While the maximum (90.2%) validation accuracy is achieved for the machine learning-based approach, (90.3%) validation accuracy is achieved for the deep learning-based approach.

Neurocognitive subprocesses of working memory performance	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Working memory; EEG; Alpha; Theta; Gamma; P3; Cross-frequency coupling; Maintenance; Updating; Goal maintenance; RDoC	ALPHA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; LONG-TERM; INTRAINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; NEURAL MECHANISMS; GOAL MAINTENANCE; DECISION-MAKING; EEG DYNAMICS	Working memory (WM) has been defined as the active maintenance and flexible updating of goal-relevant information in a form that has limited capacity and resists interference. Complex measures of WM recruit multiple subprocesses, making it difficult to isolate specific contributions of putatively independent subsystems. The present study was designed to determine whether neurophysiological indicators of proposed subprocesses of WM predict WM performance. We recruited 200 individuals defined by care-seeking status and measured neural responses using electroencephalography (EEG), while participants performed four WM tasks. We extracted spectral and time-domain EEG features from each task to quantify each of the hypothesized WM subprocesses: maintenance (storage of content), goal maintenance, and updating. We then used EEG measures of each subprocess as predictors of task performance to evaluate their contribution to WM. Significant predictors of WM capacity included contralateral delay activity and frontal theta, features typically associated with maintenance (storage of content) processes. In contrast, significant predictors of reaction time and its variability included contingent negative variation and the P3b, features typically associated with goal maintenance and updating. Broadly, these results suggest two principal dimensions that contribute to WM performance, tonic processes during maintenance contributing to capacity, and phasic processes during stimulus processing that contribute to response speed and variability. The analyses additionally highlight that reliability of features across tasks was greater (and comparable to that of WM performance) for features associated with stimulus processing (P3b and alpha), than with maintenance (gamma, theta and cross-frequency coupling).

Dynamics of Long-Range Temporal Correlations in Broadband EEG During Different Motor Execution and Imagery Tasks	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						movement execution; motor imagery; electroencephalography (EEG); long-range temporal correlation (LRTC); broadband EEG; brain-computer interface (BCI); movement classification	DETRENDED FLUCTUATION ANALYSIS; SCALING BEHAVIOR; TIME-SERIES; OSCILLATIONS; POWER; STATE; CRITICALITY; PREDICTION; DEPENDENCE; EXPONENTS	Brain activity is composed of oscillatory and broadband arrhythmic components; however, there is more focus on oscillatory sensorimotor rhythms to study movement, but temporal dynamics of broadband arrhythmic electroencephalography (EEG) remain unexplored. We have previously demonstrated that broadband arrhythmic EEG contains both short- and long-range temporal correlations that change significantly during movement. In this study, we build upon our previous work to gain a deeper understanding of these changes in the long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) in broadband EEG and contrast them with the well-known LRTC in alpha oscillation amplitude typically found in the literature. We investigate and validate changes in LRTCs during five different types of movements and motor imagery tasks using two independent EEG datasets recorded with two different paradigms-our finger tapping dataset with single self-initiated asynchronous finger taps and publicly available EEG dataset containing cued continuous movement and motor imagery of fists and feet. We quantified instantaneous changes in broadband LRTCs by detrended fluctuation analysis on single trial 2 s EEG sliding windows. The broadband LRTC increased significantly (p < 0.05) during all motor tasks as compared to the resting state. In contrast, the alpha oscillation LRTC, which had to be computed on longer stitched EEG segments, decreased significantly (p < 0.05) consistently with the literature. This suggests the complementarity of underlying fast and slow neuronal scale-free dynamics during movement and motor imagery. The single trial broadband LRTC gave high average binary classification accuracy in the range of 70.54 +/- 10.03% to 76.07 +/- 6.40% for all motor execution and imagery tasks and hence can be used in brain-computer interface (BCI). Thus, we demonstrate generalizability, robustness, and reproducibility of novel motor neural correlate, the single trial broadband LRTC, during different motor execution and imagery tasks in single asynchronous and cued continuous motor-BCI paradigms and its contrasting behavior with LRTC in alpha oscillation amplitude.

A Novel Local Explainability Approach for Spectral Insight into Raw EEG-based Deep Learning Classifiers	2021 IEEE 21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOENGINEERING (IEEE BIBE 2021)	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering		English	Proceedings Paper	21st IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (IEEE BIBE)	OCT 25-27, 2021	Kragujevac, SERBIA	IEEE, Minist Educ Sci & Technol Dev Republ Serbia, Res & Dev Ctr Bioengineering BioIRC, Univ Kragujevac		Explainability; Deep Learning; EEG; Spectral Analysis; Sleep Scoring	NEURAL-NETWORKS	Spectral analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) data has developed as an important area of EEG research. EEG spectra have been analyzed with explainable machine learning and deep learning methods. However, as deep learning has developed, many studies have used raw EEG data, which is poorly suited for traditional explainability methods. Several studies have introduced methods for spectral insight into classifiers trained on raw EEG data. These studies have provided global insight into the frequency bands important to a classifier but not local insight into the frequency bands important to the classification of individual samples. Local explainability could be particularly helpful for EEG domains like sleep stage classification that feature multiple evolving states. We present a novel local spectral explainability approach and use it to explain a convolutional neural network trained for automated sleep stage classification. We use our approach to show how the importance of frequency bands varies over time and even within the same sleep stages. Also, to better understand how our approach compares to existing methods, we compare a global estimate of spectral importance generated from our local results with an existing global spectral importance approach. We find that the delta band is most important for most sleep stages, though beta is most important for the non-rapid eye movement 2 (NREM2) sleep stage. Additionally, theta is particularly important for identifying Awake and NREMI samples. Our study represents the first approach developed for local spectral insight into deep learning classifiers trained on raw EEG time series.

During the early stages of PD, these changes are very subtle and hence accurate diagnosis is challenging. Pathological and neurological experts assess the PD patients by examining their drawing, writing, walking, tremor, facial expressions, and speech. The manual analysis performed by specialists is time-consuming and prone to errors. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals represent changes in the brain activities, but it is difficult to manually analyze these signals due to their non-linear, non-stationary, and complex nature. Traditional machine learning methods require several manual steps, such as decomposition, extraction of features, and classification. To overcome these limitations, automated PD detection using smoothed pseudo-Wigner Ville distribution (SPWVD) coupled with convolutional neural networks (CNN) called Parkinson's disease CNN (PDCNNet) is proposed. First the EEG signals are subjected to SPWVD to obtain time-frequency representation (TFR). Then these two-dimensional plots are fed to an CNN. The proposed model is developed using two public databases. We have obtained an accuracy of 100% and 99.97% for dataset 1 and 2, respectively in detecting PD automatically using our proposed PDCNNet model. Our developed prototype has outperformed all existing state-of-the-art techniques and ready to be validated with more diverse datasets.

IMI2-PainCare-BioPain-RCT3 will focus on biomarkers derived from non-invasive electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of brain activity. Methods: This is a multisite single-dose, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 4-period, 4-way crossover, pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) study in healthy subjects. Biomarkers derived from scalp EEG measurements (laser-evoked brain potentials [LEPs], pinprick-evoked brain potentials [PEPs], resting EEG) will be obtained before and three times after administration of three medications known to act on the nociceptive system (lacosamide, pregabalin, tapentadol) and placebo, given as a single oral dose in separate study periods. Medication effects will be assessed concurrently in a non-sensitized normal condition and a clinically relevant hyperalgesic condition (high-frequency electrical stimulation of the skin). Patient-reported outcomes will also be collected. A sequentially rejective multiple testing approach will be used with overall alpha error of the primary analysis split between LEP and PEP under tapentadol. Remaining treatment arm effects on LEP or PEP or effects on EEG are key secondary confirmatory analyses. Complex statistical analyses and PK-PD modeling are exploratory. Discussion: LEPs and PEPs are brain responses related to the selective activation of thermonociceptors and mechanonociceptors. Their amplitudes are dependent on the responsiveness of these nociceptors and the state of the pathways relaying nociceptive input at the level of the spinal cord and brain. The magnitude of resting EEG oscillations is sensitive to changes in brain network function, and some modulations of oscillation magnitude can relate to perceived pain intensity, variations in vigilance, and attentional states. These oscillations can also be affected by analgesic drugs acting on the central nervous system. For these reasons, IMI2-PainCare-BioPain-RCT3 hypothesizes that EEG-derived measures can serve as biomarkers of target engagement of analgesic drugs for future Phase 1 clinical trials. Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials could also benefit from these tools for patient stratification.

The electroencephalography (EEG) changes caused by the stimulation of light-emitting diode (LED) in normal subjects have not been investigated. This study aimed at identifying the effects of LED stimulation on the human brain using EEG analysis. Moreover, the dosage has been raised 4 times than that in the previous LLL study. The LED array stimulator (6 pcs LEDs, central wavelength 850 nm, output power 30 mW, and operating frequency 10 Hz) was used as the stimulation source. The LED stimulation was found to induce significant variation in alpha activity in the occipital, parietal, and temporal regions of the brain. Compared to the previous low-level laser study, LED has similar effects on EEG in alpha (8-12 Hz) activity. Theta (4-7 Hz) power significantly increased in the posterior head region of the brain. The effect lasted for at least 15 minutes after stimulation ceased. Conversely, beta (13-35 Hz) intensity in the right parietal area increased significantly, and a biphasic dose response has been observed in this study.

Face-selective responses in combined EEG/MEG recordings with fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS)	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Face recognition; Face categorization; Frequency tagging; Magnetoencephalography; Electroencephalography; Source estimation	HUMAN EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; NEURAL MECHANISMS; MEG; EEG; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; BRAIN; DISCRIMINATION; INFORMATION; FEEDFORWARD	Fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) allows the recording of objective brain responses of human face categorization (i.e., generalizable face-selective responses) with high signal-to-noise ratio. This approach has been successfully employed in a number of scalp electroencephalography (EEG) studies but has not been used with magnetoencephalography (MEG) yet, let alone with combined MEG/EEG recordings and distributed source estimation. Here, we presented various natural images of faces periodically (1.2 Hz) among natural images of objects (base frequency 6 Hz) whilst recording simultaneous EEG and MEG in 15 participants. Both measurement modalities showed face-selective responses at 1.2 Hz and harmonics across participants, with high and comparable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in about 3 min of stimulation. The correlation of face categorization responses between EEG and two MEG sensor types was lower than between the two MEG sensor types, indicating that the two sensor modalities provide independent information about the sources of face-selective responses. Face-selective EEG responses were right-lateralized as reported previously, and were numerically but non-significantly rightlateralized in MEG data. Distributed source estimation based on combined EEG/MEG signals confirmed a more bilateral face-selective response in visual brain regions located anteriorly to the common response to all stimuli at 6 Hz and harmonics. Conventional sensor and source space analyses of evoked responses in the time domain further corroborated this result. Our results demonstrate that FPVS in combination with simultaneously recorded EEG and MEG may serve as an efficient localizer paradigm for human face categorization.	[Hauk, O.; Rice, G.

The polysomnographic studies showed an increase in sleep fragmentation and an atypical slow wave activity (SWA) in participants with NREM parasomnias compared to healthy controls. To date, the pathophysiology of NREM parasomnias is still poorly understood. The recent investigation of the EEG patterns immediately before parasomnia events could shed light on the motor activations' processes. This systematic review aims to summarize empirical evidence about these studies and provide an overview of the methodological issues. Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The documents obtained were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Results: Nine studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. The major evidence revealed an increased slow frequency EEG activity immediately before the motor activations in frontal and central areas and increased beta activity in the anterior cingulate cortices. Discussion: The investigation of EEG patterns before parasomniac episodes could provide new insight into the study of NREM parasomnia pathophysiology. The high- and low-frequency EEG increase before the episodes could represent a predictive electrophysiological pattern of the motor activations' onset. Overall, identifying specific sleep markers before parasomnias might also help differentiate between NREM parasomnias and other motor sleep disorders. Different methodological protocols should be integrated for overcoming the lack of consistent empirical findings. Thus, future studies should focus on the topographical examination of canonical EEG frequency bands to better understand spatial and time dynamics before the episodes and identify the networks underlying the onset of activations.

J	Ke, M; Li, JP; Wang, LB				Ke, Ming; Li, Jianpan; Wang, Lubin			Alteration in Resting-State EEG Microstates Following 24 Hours of Total Sleep Deprivation in Healthy Young Male Subjects	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sleep deprivation; resting states; electroencephalography; topographical analysis; EEG microstate		Purpose: The cognitive effects of total sleep deprivation (TSD) on the brain remain poorly understood. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a very useful tool for detecting spontaneous brain activity in the resting state. Quasi-stable electrical distributions, known as microstates, carry useful information about the dynamics of large-scale brain networks. In this study, microstate analysis was used to study changes in brain activity after 24 h of total sleep deprivation. Participants and Methods: Twenty-seven healthy volunteers were recruited and underwent EEG scans before and after 24 h of TSD. Microstate analysis was applied, and six microstate classes (A-F) were identified. Topographies and temporal parameters of the microstates were compared between the rested wakefulness (RW) and TSD conditions. Results: Microstate class A (a right-anterior to left-posterior orientation of the mapped field) showed lower global explained variance (GEV), frequency of occurrence, and time coverage in TSD than RW, whereas microstate class D (a fronto-central extreme location of the mapped field) displayed higher GEV, frequency of occurrence, and time coverage in TSD compared to RW. Moreover, subjective sleepiness was significantly negatively correlated with the microstate parameters of class A and positively correlated with the microstate parameters of class D. Transition analysis revealed that class B exhibited a higher probability of transition than did classes D and F in TSD compared to RW. Conclusion: The observation suggests alterations of the dynamic brain-state properties of TSD in healthy young male subjects, which may serve as system-level neural underpinnings for cognitive declines in sleep-deprived subjects.

A multi scale time-frequency analysis on Electroencephalogram signals	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Non-stationary time series; Electroencephalogram; Epilepsy; Continuous wavelet transform; Scalogram	DETRENDED FLUCTUATION ANALYSIS; SEIZURE DETECTION; EEG SIGNALS; BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; ENTROPY; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; CHAOS; POWER	It is well known, the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are non-stationary signals which helps us in understanding the complex brain dynamics, cognitive processes, etc. In this paper, we have analysed the healthy and Epilepsy seizure subjects through continuous wavelet transform using Morlet wavelet function. We identify the key differences between healthy and epilepsy seizure EEG signals' low frequency periodic modulations and transient time varying patterns. Persistent intermixing of alpha and beta waves is found to be a key characteristic feature of the patients. The frequency intermixing is completely absent in signals from the hippocampal formation of the opposite hemisphere of the brain for the patients without seizure, akin to the healthy subjects. Our study further reveals dominance of frequency broadened gamma waves for seizure patients as compared to the low frequency regular alpha and beta waves for the healthy subjects. The time-frequency localization of wavelet transform clearly shows transfer of power to high frequency beta waves from the low frequency alpha waves in the signals of the epileptogenic zone of the patients. The observed frequency intermixing, reported here, is analogous to the bi-stability behaviour of dynamical systems. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this sense, analyzing the evoked or phase activity can confirm results from traditional event-related potential (ERP) studies. However, studying the induced or nonphase activity may be necessary to elucidate hidden compensatory or affected cognitive mechanisms. In this study, 30 remitting-relapsing multiple sclerosis patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs) matched in sociodemographic variables performed a visual oddball task. The main goal was to analyze phase and nonphase alpha and gamma bands by applying temporal spectral evolution (TSE) and its potential relation with cognitive impairment in these patients. The behavioural results showed slower reaction time and poorer accuracy in MS patients compared to controls. In contrast, the time-frequency analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) revealed a delay in latency and lower amplitude in MS patients in evoked and induced alpha compared to controls. With respect to the gamma band, there were no differences between the groups. In summary, MS patients showed deficits in early sensorial (evoked alpha activity) and cognitive processing (induced alpha activity in longer latencies), whereas the induced gamma band supported the hypothesis of its role in translation of attentional focus (induced activity) and did not show strong activity in this paradigm (visual oddball).

Such mental responses stem from physiological, cognitive, and behavioral changes. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a noninvasive and nonradioactive solution for emotion identification. Accurate and automatic classification of emotions can boost the development of human-computer interface. This article proposes automatic extraction and classification of features through the use of different convolutional neural networks (CNNs). At first, the proposed method converts the filtered EEG signals into an image using a time-frequency representation. Smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution is used to transform time-domain EEG signals into images. These images are fed to pretrained AlexNet, ResNet50, and VGG16 along with configurable CNN. The performance of four CNNs is evaluated by measuring the accuracy, precision, Mathew's correlation coefficient, F1-score, and false-positive rate. The results obtained by evaluating four CNNs show that configurable CNN requires very less learning parameters with better accuracy. Accuracy scores of 90.98%, 91.91%, 92.71%, and 93.01% obtained by AlexNet, ResNet50, VGG16, and configurable CNN show that the proposed method is best among other existing methods.

During BCI-FEST, the stimulation is triggered by the patient's brain activity, often monitored using electroencephalography (EEG). Several studies have demonstrated that BCI-FEST can improve voluntary arm and hand function after an injury, but few studies have investigated the FES interference in EEG signals during BCI-FEST. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of band-pass filters, used to extract the BCI-relevant EEG components, in simultaneously reducing stimulation interference. Methods We used EEG data from eight participants recorded during BCI-FEST. Additionally, we separately recorded the FES signal generated by the stimulator to estimate the spectral components of the FES interference, and extract the noise in time domain. Finally, we calculated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values before and after band-pass filtering, for two types of movements practiced during BCI-FEST: reaching and grasping. Results The SNR values were greater after filtering across all participants for both movement types. For reaching movements, mean SNR values increased between 1.31 dB and 36.3 dB. Similarly, for grasping movements, mean SNR values increased between 2.82 dB and 40.16 dB, after filtering. Conclusions Band-pass filters, used to isolate EEG frequency bands for BCI application, were also effective in reducing stimulation interference. In addition, we provide a general algorithm that can be used in future studies to estimate the frequencies of FES interference as a function of the selected stimulation pulse frequency, F-STIM, and the EEG sampling rate, F-S.

The Effect of Hypoglycemia on Spectral Moments in EEG Epochs of Different Durations in Type 1 Diabetes Patients	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Glucose; Blood; Feature extraction; Clamps; Interpolation; Insulin; Electroencephalogram (EEG); hypoglycemia; optimal time window; spectral moment	DECREASE; HYPERGLYCEMIA; VIGILANCE; SLEEP	The potential of using an electroencephalogram (EEG) to detect hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been investigated in both time and frequency domains. Under hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic clamp conditions, we have shown that the brain's response to hypoglycemic episodes could be described by the centroid frequency and spectral gyration radius evaluated from spectral moments of EEG signals. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of hypoglycemia on spectral moments in EEG epochs of different durations and to propose the optimal time window for hypoglycemia detection without using clamp protocols. The incidence of hypoglycemic episodes at night time in five T1D adolescents was analyzed from selected data of ten days of observations in this study. We found that hypoglycemia is associated with significant changes (P < 0.05) in spectral moments of EEG segments in different lengths. Specifically, the changes were more pronounced on the occipital lobe. We used effect size as a measure to determine the best EEG epoch duration for the detection of hypoglycemic episodes. Using Bayesian neural networks, this study showed that 30 second segments provide the best detection rate of hypoglycemia. In addition, Clarke's error grid analysis confirms the correlation between hypoglycemia and EEG spectral moments of this optimal time window, with 86% of clinically acceptable estimated blood glucose values. These results confirm the potential of using EEG spectral moments to detect the occurrence of hypoglycemia.

Expanding our understanding of sensory gating in children with autism spectrum disorders	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sensory gating; Autism spectrum disorders; Electroencephalography (EEG); Auditory filtering; Time-frequency analysis	GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; P50 SUPPRESSION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; N100	Objective: This study examined sensory gating in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Gating is usually examined at the P50 component and rarely at mid- and late-latency components. Methods: Electroencephalography data were recorded during a paired-click paradigm, from 18 children with ASD (5-12 years), and 18 typically-developing (TD) children. Gating was assessed at the P50, N1, P2, and N2 event-related potential components. Parents of all participants completed the Short Sensory Profile (SSP). Results: TD children showed gating at all components while children with ASD showed gating only at P2 and N2. Compared to TD children, the ASD group showed significantly reduced gating at P50, N1, and P2. No group differences were found at N2, suggesting typical N2 gating in the ASD group. Time-frequency analyses showed reduced orientation and neural synchronization of auditory stimuli. P50 and N1 gating significantly correlated with the SSP. Conclusion: Although children with ASD have impaired early orientation and filtering of auditory stimuli, they exhibited gating at P2 and N2 components suggesting use of different gating mechanisms compared to TD children.

A novel approach to the study of spatio-temporal brain dynamics using change-based complexity	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						AG complexity; EEG analysis; Neural oscillations; Nonlinear signals; Schizophrenia	APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; EEG; HYPOFRONTALITY; TIME	Brain complexity and neural oscillations are of vital significance for understanding brain dynamics. Although widely used in the quantification of complex behavior of the brain, standard complexity measures are hampered by some theoretical and implementation issues which limit their applicability to the study of nonlinear brain signals. Further, they have been used for spatial analysis but are insensitive to the temporal structure of data and not applicable to short EEG segments. We demonstrated the ability of a change-based complexity measure (Aksentijevic-Gibson complexity) to analyze neural activity in both spatial and temporal domains. We examined EEG recordings from a group of adolescents with schizophrenia and an age-matched group of healthy controls. AG revealed that the spatial complexity was significantly lower in the patient group across all electrodes with the lowest complexity at the frontal area of the brain. By focusing on outer frontal regions and temporal data averaged over schizophrenia adolescents, we observed periodic drops in complexity and low-delta oscillations at the left electrode F7 and numerous irregularly placed drops at the right side (F8). Periodicity was caused by zero complexity troughs in several individuals associated with large voltage declensions and connected with hypofrontality supporting left frontal pathology. Both averaged spatial and temporal complexities of healthy and schizophrenia adolescents were significantly different from the complexities of random sequences confirming that neural activity is more regular than a true random process. As a final step, we performed the analysis of short EEG segments for the two subjects (one control, one patient) in order to search for differences in neural oscillations. The examination revealed a clear 33 Hz gamma rhythm in a healthy participant and only a fast beta rhythm of 27 Hz in a patient as well as the presence of a full range of rhythms in a healthy EEG and only theta oscillations in that of a patient. The results support the large body of work which associates schizophrenia with lowered complexity, low-frequency rhythms and the scarcity of high-frequency oscillations. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Although these alterations may interfere with the processing of speech in degraded listening conditions, behavioural studies have generally found preserved speech-in-noise recognition in PD. However, behavioural speech audiometry does not capture the neurophysiological mechanisms supporting speech-in-noise processing. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the neural oscillatory mechanisms associated with speech-in-noise processing in PD. Twelve persons with PD and 12 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study. Persons with PD were studied in the medication off condition. All subjects underwent an audiometric screening and performed a sentence-in-noise recognition task under simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) recording. Behavioural speech recognition scores and self-reported ratings of effort, performance, and motivation were collected. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data revealed no significant difference between persons with PD and HCs regarding delta-theta (2-8 Hz) inter-trial phase coherence to noise and sentence onset. In contrast, significantly increased alpha (8-12 Hz) power was found in persons with PD compared with HCs during the sentence-in-noise recognition task. Behaviourally, persons with PD demonstrated significantly decreased speech recognition scores, whereas no significant differences were found regarding effort, performance, and motivation ratings. These results suggest that persons with PD allocate more cognitive resources to support speech-in-noise processing. The interpretation of this finding is discussed in the context of a top-down mediated compensation mechanism for inefficient filtering and degradation of auditory input in PD.

Separability of Motor Imagery Directions Using Subject-Specific Discriminative EEG Features	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Feature extraction; Kinematics; Task analysis; Man-machine systems; Data mining; Trajectory; Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs); electroencephalography; feature extraction; motor imagery (MI) kinematics; phase locking values (PLVs)	CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION	Electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) is an augmented communication modality between the brain and computer that exclusively depends on noninvasively recorded neuro-electrical activity. To establish multiple control commands in BCI systems, it is essential to efficiently identify unique EEG activation patterns underlying multiple motor tasks. This article investigates the brain activation modulations elicited by imagined movement directions and the EEG features that characterize them. An experiment was conducted in which ten subjects imagined two-dimensional right-hand movement in the left, right, up, and down directions in the vertical plane. The frequency and phase characteristics of EEG rhythms are explored to identify the features that discriminate movement imagination toward multiple directions. The proposed decoding step consists of Fisher's analysis of instantaneous phase values to identify EEG channels with optimal discriminative information followed by extraction of phase-locking values and temporal-spatial features, which are then used for classification. The proposed approach offers significantly higher (p < 0.05) performance than the state-of-the-art method while employing subject-specific time segments and channels. Hence, an average accuracy of 69.25% is obtained for binary classification of all pairs of movement directions with a performance increment of 8.33% compared to the conventional approaches using fixed channel-time paradigm. The results illustrate the potential use of noninvasive EEG signals in decoding imagined movement kinematics, and further research is needed to investigate and optimize the separability in multiple directions.

The prospective classification of tissue sampled by individual electrode contacts remains a challenge. We have developed an automated, prospective definition of clinically relevant high-frequency oscillations in intracranial EEG from Montreal and tested it in recordings from Zurich. We here validated the algorithm on intracranial EEG that was recorded in an independent epilepsy centre so that the analysis was blinded to seizure outcome. We selected consecutive patients who underwent resective epilepsy surgery in Geneva with post-surgical follow-up > 12 months. We analysed long-term recordings during sleep that we segmented into intervals of 5 min. High-frequency oscillations were defined in the ripple (80-250 Hz) and the fast ripple (250-500Hz) frequency bands. Contacts with the highest rate of ripples co-occurring with fast ripples designated the relevant area. As a validity criterion, we calculated the test-retest reliability of the high-frequency oscillations area between the 5 min intervals (dwell time >= 50%). If the area was not fully resected and the patient suffered from recurrent seizures, this was classified as a true positive prediction. We included recordings from 16 patients (median age 32 years, range 18-53 years) with stereotactic depth electrodes and/or with subdural electrode grids (median follow-up 27 months, range 12-55 months). For each patient, we included several 5 min intervals (median 17 intervals). The relevant area had high test-retest reliability across intervals (median dwell time 95%). In two patients, the test-retest reliability was too low (dwell time < 50%) so that outcome prediction was not possible. The area was fully included in the resected volume in 2/4 patients who achieved post-operative seizure freedom (specificity 50%) and was not fully included in 9/10 patients with recurrent seizures (sensitivity 90%), leading to an accuracy of 79%. An additional exploratory analysis suggested that high-frequency oscillations were associated with interictal epileptic discharges only in channels within the relevant area and not associated in channels outside the area. We thereby validated the automated procedure to delineate the clinically relevant area in each individual patient of an independently recorded dataset and achieved the same good accuracy as in our previous studies. The reproducibility of our results across datasets is promising for a multicentre study to test the clinical application of high-frequency oscillations to guide epilepsy surgery.

The correlation means quantification of the degree of association between apparently different signals, with regard to parameters they depend on. In this work, the analysis refers to the EEG activity; the relative power of the signal, dependent on frequency and location of cortical areas is assessed in normal and pathological cases. Signal acquisition and primary processing was performed with a Bio Script Zwonitz 2000 electroencephalography equipment. Standard 10-20 electrodes positioning system (with 19 electrodes) is used and the cortical activity is illustrated by signals with a spectral content within the range of 0-62 Hz. Data analyzed in the study comes from numerous normal and pathological subjects. After numerical processing, the results are shown in colored maps, in a suggestive manner, enhancing the patterns of correlation specific to normal versus pathological states. That type of data processing is useful when different pathologies need to be monitored and assessed in time.

This contribution presents a new description of the 200 Hz band activity in somatosensory evoked electrical potentials (SEPs) and somatosensory evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) with the help of tensor decompositions. The SEPs and SEFs elicited by electrical stimulation of the median nerve were measured in eight healthy volunteers. A time-frequency analysis of the SEPs and SEFs produced the time-dependent spectra of the signals that were arranged into three-dimensional EEG and MEG data tensors, respectively. We then propose a novel multi-way component analysis approach by employing a tensor decomposition known as the multi-linear rank-(L-r, L-r, 1) decomposition. Featuring the ability to extract channel-dependent spectral signatures, this method is able to separate the 200 Hz band activity-related signal components in SEPs and SEFs. Via a coupled version of the multi-linear rank-(L-r, L-r, 1) decomposition, a joint processing of these simultaneous EEG and MEG recordings has been achieved. The advantages of the joint processing over the separate processing of EEG or MEG alone have been both qualitatively and quantitatively validated in seven out of eight subjects.

However, EEG data obtained from the simultaneous EEG-fMRI are strongly influenced by MRI-related artefacts, namely gradient artefacts (GA) and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artefacts. When compared to the GA correction, the BCG correction is more challenging to remove due to its inherent variabilities and dynamic changes over time. The standard BCG correction (i.e., average artefact subtraction [AAS]), require detecting cardiac pulses from simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) recording. However, ECG signals are also distorted and will become problematic for detecting reliable cardiac peaks. In this study, we focused on a beamforming spatial filtering technique to attenuate all unwanted source activities outside of the brain. Specifically, we applied the beamforming technique to attenuate the BCG artefact in EEG-fMRI, and also to recover meaningful task-based neural signals during an attentional network task (ANT) which required participants to identify visual cues and respond accurately. We analysed EEG-fMRI data in 20 healthy participants during the ANT, and compared four different BCG corrections (non-BCG corrected, AAS BCG corrected, beamforming + AAS BCG corrected, beamforming BCG corrected). We demonstrated that the beamforming approach did not only significantly reduce the BCG artefacts, but also significantly recovered the expected task-based brain activity when compared to the standard AAS correction. This data-driven beamforming technique appears promising especially for longer data acquisition of sleep and resting EEG-fMRI. Our findings extend previous work regarding the recovery of meaningful EEG signals by an optimized suppression of MRI-related artefacts.

With the advent of digital EEG, more advanced applications of EEG have emerged. Compared with technologically advanced practice in focal epilepsies, the utilization of EEG in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) has been lagging, often restricted to a simple diagnostic tool. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of broader applications of EEG beyond this narrow scope, discussing how the current clinical and research applications of EEG may potentially be extended to IGE. The current literature, although limited, suggests that EEG can be used in syndromic classification, guiding antiseizure medication therapy, predicting prognosis, unraveling biorhythms, and investigating functional brain connectivity of IGE. We emphasize the need for longer recordings, particularly 24-h ambulatory EEG, to capture discharges reflecting circadian and sleep-wake cycle-associated variations for wider EEG applications in IGE. Finally, we highlight the challenges and limitations of the current body of literature and suggest future directions to encourage and enhance more extensive applications of this potent tool.

Contrasting Electroencephalography-Derived Entropy and Neural Oscillations With Highly Skilled Meditators	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						meditation; electroencephalography; oscillations; power spectra; entropy; Lempel&#8211; Ziv	HUMAN THETA-OSCILLATIONS; SPONTANEOUS BRAIN ACTIVITY; LEMPEL-ZIV COMPLEXITY; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; RELAXATION RESPONSE; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; FOCUSED ATTENTION; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; ALTERED STATES; EEG COMPLEXITY	Meditation is an umbrella term for a number of mental training practices designed to improve the monitoring and regulation of attention and emotion. Some forms of meditation are now being used for clinical intervention. To accompany the increased clinical interest in meditation, research investigating the neural basis of these practices is needed. A central hypothesis of contemplative neuroscience is that meditative states, which are unique on a phenomenological level, differ on a neurophysiological level. To identify the electrophysiological correlates of meditation practice, the electrical brain activity of highly skilled meditators engaging in one of six meditation styles (shamatha, vipassana, zazen, dzogchen, tonglen, and visualization) was recorded. A mind-wandering task served as a control. Lempel-Ziv complexity showed differences in nonlinear brain dynamics (entropy) during meditation compared with mind wandering, suggesting that meditation, regardless of practice, affects neural complexity. In contrast, there were no differences in power spectra at six different frequency bands, likely due to the fact that participants engaged in different meditation practices. Finally, exploratory analyses suggest neurological differences among meditation practices. These findings highlight the importance of studying the electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of different meditative practices.

However, the relationship between psychiatric symptoms and severity of sleep apnea in BRSD is controversial. We conducted this study to investigate the relationship between psychiatric symptoms and sleep electroencephalography (EEG) findings in BRSD patients using spectral analysis. Methods: All participants underwent polysomnography and evaluation using Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) scale. We analyzed the absolute spectral power density values of standard EEG frequency bands in the participants (n = 169) with BRSD during the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep period. We performed correlation analysis between the domain scores of SCL-90-R scale and the absolute values of the EEG frequency bands. Results: Significant positive correlation was observed between the absolute spectral power density values in the slow oscillation band and the degree of paranoid ideation (r = 0.226, p = 0.028) and depression (r = 0.216, p = 0.044) in SCL-90-R. The multiple linear regression model showed that higher paranoid ideation domain score (B = 0.007, p = 0.020), younger age (B = - 0.011, p < 0.001), and female sex (B = 0.213, p = 0.004) were associated with higher slow oscillation power during NREM sleep. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggested a relationship between sleep EEG and psychiatric symptoms in patients with BRSD. This relationship needs to be validated with further studies.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the association of standard electroencephalography with mortality and command following in this setting. Design, Setting, and Patients: In a single-center study, we retrospectively analyzed standard electroencephalography performed in consecutive mechanically ventilated patients remaining unresponsive (comatose/stuporous or unable to follow commands) after sedation interruption. Standard electroencephalography parameters (background activity, continuity, and reactivity) were reassessed by neurophysiologists, blinded to patients' outcome. Patients were categorized during follow-up into three groups based on their best examination as: 1) command following, 2) unresponsive, or 3) deceased. Cause-specific models were used to identify independent standard electroencephalography parameters associated with main outcomes, that is, mortality and command following. Follow-up was right-censored 30 days after standard electroencephalography. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Main standard electroencephalography parameters recorded in 121 unresponsive patients (median time between sedation interruption and standard electroencephalography: 2 d [interquartile range, 1-4 d]) consisted of a background frequency greater than 4 Hz in 71 (59%), a discontinuous background in 19 (16%), and a preserved reactivity in 98/120 (82%) patients. At 30 days, 66 patients (55%) were command following, nine (7%) were unresponsive, and 46 (38%) had died. In a multivariate analysis adjusted for nonneurologic organ failure, a reactive standard electroencephalography with a background frequency greater than 4 Hz was independently associated with a reduced risk of death (cause-specific hazard ratio, 0.38; CI 95%, 0.16-0.9). By contrast, none of the standard electroencephalography parameters were independently associated with command following. Sensitivity analyses conducted after exclusion of 29 patients with hypoxic brain injury revealed similar findings. CONCLUSIONS: In patients remaining unresponsive after sedation interruption, a pattern consisting of a reactive standard electroencephalography with a background frequency greater than 4 Hz was associated with decreased odds of death. None of the standard electroencephalography parameters were independently associated with command following.

J	McGeady, C; Vuckovic, A; Zheng, YP; Alam, M				McGeady, Ciaran; Vuckovic, Aleksandra; Zheng, Yong-Ping; Alam, Monzurul			EEG Monitoring Is Feasible and Reliable during Simultaneous Transcutaneous Electrical Spinal Cord Stimulation	SENSORS			English	Article						transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation; electroencephalography; artifact removal; brain-computer interface; BCI; rehabilitation	HAND	Transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique that has in recent years been linked to improved volitional limb control in spinal-cord injured individuals. Although the technique is growing in popularity there is still uncertainty regarding the neural mechanisms underpinning sensory and motor recovery. Brain monitoring techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) may provide further insights to the changes in coritcospinal excitability that have already been demonstrated using other techniques. It is unknown, however, whether intelligible EEG can be extracted while tSCS is being applied, owing to substantial high-amplitude artifacts associated with stimulation-based therapies. Here, for the first time, we characterise the artifacts that manifest in EEG when recorded simultaneously with tSCS. We recorded multi-channel EEG from 21 healthy volunteers as they took part in a resting state and movement task across two sessions: One with tSCS delivered to the cervical region of the neck, and one without tSCS. An offline analysis in the time and frequency domain showed that tSCS manifested as narrow, high-amplitude peaks with a spectral density contained at the stimulation frequency. We quantified the altered signals with descriptive statistics-kurtosis, root-mean-square, complexity, and zero crossings-and applied artifact-suppression techniques-superposition of moving averages, adaptive, median, and notch filtering-to explore whether the effects of tSCS could be suppressed. We found that the superposition of moving averages filter was the most successful technique at returning contaminated EEG to levels statistically similar to that of normal EEG. In the frequency domain, however, notch filtering was more effective at reducing the spectral power contribution of stimulation from frontal and central electrodes. An adaptive filter was more appropriate for channels closer to the stimulation site. Lastly, we found that tSCS posed no detriment the binary classification of upper-limb movements from sensorimotor rhythms, and that adaptive filtering resulted in poorer classification performance. Overall, we showed that, depending on the analysis, EEG monitoring during transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation is feasible. This study supports future investigations using EEG to study the activity of the sensorimotor cortex during tSCS, and potentially paves the way to brain-computer interfaces operating in the presence of spinal stimulation.

However, due to the low accuracy of the current analysis methods for low frequency signal extraction of ALFF, we propose the Fourier-based synchrosqueezing transform (FSST), which is often used in the field of signal processing to extract the ALFF of the low frequency power spectrum of the whole-time dimension. The low frequency characteristics of the extracted signal are compared with those of FSST and fast Fourier transform (FFT) through the resting-state data. It is clear that the signal extracted by FSST has more low frequency characteristics, which is significantly different from FFT.

Methods that directly extract features from raw EEG signals ignores key frequency domain information. One of the challenges in MI classification tasks is finding a way to supplement the frequency domain information ignored by the raw EEG signal. Approach. In this study, we fuse different models using their complementary characteristics to develop a multiscale space-time-frequency feature-guided multitask learning convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The proposed method consists of four modules: the space-time feature-based representation module, time-frequency feature-based representation module, multimodal fused feature-guided generation module, and classification module. The proposed framework is based on multitask learning. The four modules are trained using three tasks simultaneously and jointly optimized. Results. The proposed method is evaluated using three public challenge datasets. Through quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms most state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques for EEG classification, thereby demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our method. Moreover, the proposed method is employed to realize control of robot based on EEG signal, verifying its feasibility in real-time applications. Significance. To the best of our knowledge, a deep CNN architecture that fuses different input cases, which have complementary characteristics, has not been applied to BCI tasks. Because of the interaction of the three tasks in the multitask learning architecture, our method can improve the generalization and accuracy of subject-dependent and subject-independent methods with limited annotated data.

Wavelet packets has been widely used as a means of time-frequency analysis of EEG in many different applications including brain computer interface systems. Features for emotion recognition are extracted from the EEG signals using a depth 6 wavelet packet tree. Wavelet packet energy of the sub-bands corresponding to delta (0-4Hz), theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-13Hz), beta (13-30Hz), and gamma (30-49Hz) are taken as emotional features. Feature selection based on feature ranking is applied to select the most prominent EEG channel-frequency combinations for emotion recognition. Four classical classifiers such as linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, K nearest neighbor and naive Bayes were used to detect the emotional states from the extracted features. To evaluate the effectiveness and validation of the proposed model, the SEED database has been employed. Based on the experiment results obtained, our method demonstrates that the LDA is more suitable for emotion recognition as compared to other classical classifier, which achieving the best average accuracy of 90.9386. Emotion recognition systems with high accuracy give opportunities to study real world applications such as mental state and fatigue monitoring.	[Algumaei, M.

The signals differed in their temporal ITD patterns so as to simulate either stationary sounds or stepwise auditory motion. The reversed oddball stimulation was used to present both stimulus types as standards and deviants in different blocks. The event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) were calculated from the time-frequency decomposition of EEG signals. The abrupt displacement of the standard stimulus increased the ITC in the alpha range and to a lesser extent in the theta range, compared to the stationary standard. When the moving stimuli were used as deviants, the differences in the coherence of the evoked oscillations increased. The deviance detection was accompanied by synchronization of slow oscillations in the direct oddball sequence and by their desynchronization in the reversed sequence. Our results suggest that phase coherence of slow oscillations may be considered as neural correlate of the preattentive discrimination of sound motion.	[Shestopalova, L. B.; Petropavlovskaia, E.

To this end, we introduce a new analysis technique termed frequency-based intrinsic network dynamic reactivity (FINDR), which quantifies the extent to which different brain regions (defined in EEG channel space) are responsive to each other in terms of their frequency-domain activity. The technique generalizes the idea of EEG reactivity, a measure of how well EEG signals react/respond to exogenous stimuli. In the present work we generalize this notion to endogenous 'stimuli,' defined as short-time window frequency domain motifs that are most predominant on a per channel basis. For each of these predominant motifs, we quantify the variance of the activity in all other channels as a measure of 'intrinsic reactivity', under the hypothesis that channels proximal to injured regions will be systematically disassociated from other brain areas. We use this method as a front-end to a neural network classifier to predict injury location in a cohort of etiologically heterogeneous comatose patients. We achieve a 0.6 correlation between the predicted injury location and the actual brain injury. These results suggest a possibility of precise localization of brain injury using EEG.

Several electrophysiological studies showed that neural activity associated with the prospective and the retrospective component differed between older and younger adults. However, these studies mainly reported event-related potentials (ERP), without considering other oscillatory parameters of age-related neural modulations that might be associated with the two components. Objective: In the present study, we analysed electrophysiological data to describe the age-related patterns of brain oscillations associated with the prospective and the retrospective components of prospective memory. Methods: The prospective and the retrospective components were manipulated in two experiments. In experiment 1, the prospective component was manipulated by varying the cue distinctiveness (i.e., how easy it was to detect the cue based on colour). In experiment 2, the retrospective component was manipulated by varying the number of intentions to be remembered (i.e., one or two intentions). We used time-frequency analysis to characterise the EEG oscillatory activity in younger and older adults. Results: The prospective component was associated with age differences in alpha and beta frequency bands. Compared to younger adults, older adults showed a decrease of parietal alpha activity when they detected distinct prospective memory cues, and a decrease of parietal beta when they detected less distinct cues. Moreover, older adults showed less beta activity compared to the younger adults across experimental manipulations. No age differences emerged with respect to the retrospective component. Conclusions: The specific pattern of oscillatory activity associated with the prospective component in older adults could underlie the dynamic deployment of different attentional resources supporting cue detection. Moreover, beta activity in both experiments might support an attempt exerted by older adults to enhance task coordination processes. Overall, cluster-based permutation analyses provided a first description of the changes of the EEG time-frequency responses related to intention retrieval in older adults.

However, only a few previous studies showed FOs in neonates. Reported frequencies of such neonatal FOs were in the low-gamma (<60 Hz) band and, therefore, they were not high compared to those in pediatric patients. We herein report a newborn patient with severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), who showed pathological FOs with a frequency in the high-gamma band. She was born at a gestational age of 39 weeks 4 days by emergency cesarean section because of non-reassuring fetal status. She had focal motor seizures involving unilateral upper and lower limbs lasting for tens of seconds on days 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, and 9 and subclinical seizures on days 4-11. Phenobarbital (PB) was intravenously administered on days 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6. We found FOs that were superimposed on the ictal delta activities using visual inspection and time-frequency analysis on 8-11 days of age. Among them, we detected high-gamma (71.4-100 Hz) oscillations that appeared to be temporally independent of low-gamma activities in the ictal EEG on 11 days of age. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the earliest reports showing pathological FOs with a frequency of >60 Hz in the high-gamma band in human neonatal seizures, which were previously observed in animal studies. Further studies are needed to elucidate the pathophysiology of ictal FOs in neonatal seizures.

Here, we extend this idea to the memory domain. We tested the hypothesis that ongoing fluctuations in neural activity impact memory encoding in two experiments using a picture paired-associates task in order to gauge episodic memory performance. Experiment 1 was behavioural only and capitalized on the principle of phase resetting. We tested if subsequent memory performance fluctuates rhythmically, time-locked to a resetting cue presented before the to-be-remembered pairs at different time intervals. We found an indication that behavioural performance was periodically and selectively modulated at Theta frequency (similar to 4 Hz). In Experiment 2, we focused on pre-stimulus ongoing activity using scalp EEG while participants performed a paired-associates task. The pre-registered analysis, using large electrode clusters and generic Theta and Alpha spectral ranges, returned null results of the pre-stimulus phase-behaviour correlation. However, as expected from prior literature, we found that variations in stimulus-related Theta-power predicted subsequent memory performance. Therefore, we used this post-stimulus effect in Theta power to guide a post-hoc pre-stimulus phase analysis in terms of scalp and frequency of interest. This analysis returned a correlation between the pre-stimulus Theta phase and subsequent memory. Altogether, these results suggest that pre-stimulus Theta activity at encoding may impact later memory performance.

We performed a statistical analysis using Spearman's correlation between the EEG traits and the emotional information. We found that EEG traits had strong correlation with arousal and valence scores; also, common EEG traits with strong correlations, belonged to the theta band of the central channels. Then, we implemented a regression algorithm with feature selection to predict arousal and valence scores using EEG traits. We achieved better result for arousal regression, than for valence regression. EEG traits selected for arousal and valence regression belonged to time domain (standard deviation, complexity, mobility, kurtosis, skewness), and frequency domain (power spectral density-PDS, and differential entropy-DE from theta, alpha, beta, gamma, and all EEG frequency spectrum). Addressing game events, we found that EEG traits related with the theta, alpha and beta band had strong correlations. In addition, distinctive event-related potentials where identified in the presence of both types of game events. Finally, we implemented a classification algorithm to discriminate between positive and negative events using EEG traits to identify emotional information. We obtained good classification performance using only two traits related with frequency domain on the theta band and on the full EEG spectrum.

Change in Brain Oscillations as a Mechanism of Mindfulness-Meditation, Cognitive Therapy, and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Chronic Low Back Pain	PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Mechanism; Mindfulness Meditation; Cognitive Therapy; Chronic Low Back Pain; Neural Oscillations	BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; STRESS REDUCTION; CLINICAL-TRIALS; GRAY-MATTER; SAMPLE-SIZE; EEG; CONNECTIVITY; INTERVENTIONS; RELIABILITY; BONFERRONI	Objective. Psychological treatments for chronic low back pain (CLBP) are effective. However, limited research has investigated their neurophysiological mechanisms. This study examined electroencephalography- (EEG-) assessed brain oscillation changes as potential mechanisms of cognitive therapy (CT), mindfulness-meditation (MM), and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for CLBP. The a priori bandwidths of interest were changes in theta, alpha and beta power, measured at pre- and post-treatment. Design. A secondary analysis of a clinical trial. Setting. University of Queensland Psychology Clinic. Subjects. Adults (N = 57) with CLBP who completed pre- and posttreatment EEG and pain outcome assessments. Methods. EEG data were examined for five regions of interest (ROls); the primary outcome was pain intensity. Results. A significant reduction in theta (P=.015) and alpha (P=.006) power in the left frontal ROI across all treatments was found, although change in theta and alpha power in this region was not differentially associated with outcome across treatments. There were significant reductions in beta power in all five ROls across all treatments (P <=.013). Beta power reduction in the central ROI showed a significant association with reduced pain intensity in MBCT only (P=.028). Changes in other regions were not statistically significant. Conclusions. These findings provide support for the capacity of psychological CLBP treatments to induce changes in brain activity. The reduced beta power in all five ROls indicated that all three treatments engendered a state of lowered cortical arousal. The growing body of research in this area could potentially inform novel directions towards remedying central nervous system abnormalities associated with CLBP.

Previous electroencephalography (EEG) research focused on contributions of phase-locked neural activities to racial categorization of faces. We investigated functional roles of non-phase-locked neural oscillations in spontaneous racial categorization of faces by recording EEG from Chinese adults who performed an individuation task on Asian/White faces in Experiment 1 and on Asian/Black faces in Experiment 2. We quantified neural processes involved in spontaneous racial categorization of faces by examining repetition suppression of non-phase-locked neural oscillations when participants viewed faces of one race presented repeatedly in the same block of trials (repetition condition), or faces of two races presented alternately in the same block of trials (alternating condition). We found decreased power of alpha (9-13 Hz) oscillations in the repetition than alternating conditions at 80-240 ms over frontal-central electrodes induced by White/Black (but not Asian) faces. Moreover, larger repetition suppression of alpha oscillations in response to White/Black (vs. Asian) faces predicted greater implicit negative attitudes toward White/Black faces across individuals. Our findings suggest that non-phase-locked alpha oscillations are engaged in spontaneous racial categorization of faces and are associated with implicit negative attitudes toward other-race faces.

The most obvious feature of BECT is the existence of a large number of electroencephalogram (EEG) spikes in the Rolandic area during the interictal period, that is an important basis to assist neurologists in BECT diagnosis. With this regard, the paper proposes a novel BECT spike detection algorithm based on time domain EEG sequence features and the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. Three time domain sequence features, that can obviously characterize the spikes of BECT, are extracted for EEG representation. The synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is applied to address the spike imbalance issue in EEGs, and the bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM) is trained for spike detection. The algorithm is evaluated using the EEG data of 15 BECT patients recorded from the Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine (CHZU). The experiment shows that the proposed algorithm can obtained an average of 88.54% F1 score, 92.04% sensitivity, and 85.75% precision, that generally outperforms several state-of-the-art spike detection methods.

Hence, we propose a new scheme for DoA monitoring considering the time-frequency analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) signals and GLCM features extracted from them. To this end, at first, the time-frequency map (TFM) of each channel of each EEG is computed by smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution (SPWVD), where the EEG signal used in this paper is recorded in 15 channels. After that, we consider the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) to obtain the content of TFM, and after that, four features such as homogeneity, correlation, energy, and contrast are obtained for each GLCM. Finally, after the selection of efficient features using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) method, the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier is utilized to determine the DoA. Here, we consider the three states, namely, deep hypnotic, surgical anesthesia, and sedation and awake states according to bispectral index (BIS), and each EEG epoch is classified to these states. We also employ data augmentation to enhance the training phase and increase accuracy. We obtain the accuracy and confusion matrix of the proposed method. We also analyze the effects of a number of gray levels of GLCM, distance measure in KNN classifier, and parameters of data augmentation on the performance of the proposed method. Results indicate the efficiency of the proposed method to determine the DoA during surgery.

However, manual analysis of EEG signals could be strenuous and a time-consuming process for experts. It requires long training time for physicians to develop expertise in it and additionally experts have low inter-rater agreement (IRA) among themselves. Therefore, many Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) based studies have considered the automation of interpreting EEG signals to alleviate the workload and support the final diagnosis. In this paper, we present an automatic binary classification framework for brain signals in multi-channel EEG recordings. We propose to use Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) techniques to decompose the EEG signals into frequency sub-bands and extract a set of statistical features from each of the selected coefficients. Moreover, we propose a novel method to reduce the dimension of the feature space without compromising the quality of the extracted features. The extracted features are classified using different Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) based classification frameworks, which are CatBoost, XGBoost and LightGBM. We used Temple University Hospital EEG Abnormal Corpus V2.0.0 to test our proposed technique. We found that CatBoost classifier achieves the binary classification accuracy of 87.68%, and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on the same dataset by more than 1% in accuracy and more than 3% in sensitivity. The obtained results in this research provide important insights into the usefulness of WPD feature extraction and GBDT classifiers for EEG classification.

Though some studies have attempted to develop brain-computer interface (BCI)-based communication methods with CLIS patients, little information is available of the neuroelectric brain activity of CLIS patients. However, because of the difficulties with and often loss of communication, the neuroelectric signature may provide some indications of the state of consciousness in these patients. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 10 CLIS patients during resting state and compared their power spectral densities with those of healthy participants in fronto-central, central, and centro-parietal channels. The results showed significant power reduction in the high alpha, beta, and gamma bands in CLIS patients, indicating the dominance of slower EEG frequencies in their oscillatory activity. This is the first study showing group-level EEG change of CLIS patients, though the reason for the observed EEG change cannot be concluded without any reliable communication methods with this population.

Detection of large vessel occlusion stroke with electroencephalography in the emergency room: first results of the ELECTRA-STROKE study	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Diagnostic method; Acute ischemic stroke; Large vessel occlusion	ENDOVASCULAR THROMBECTOMY; ISCHEMIC-STROKE	Background Prehospital detection of large vessel occlusion stroke of the anterior circulation (LVO-a) would enable direct transportation of these patients to an endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) capable hospital. The ongoing ELECTRA-STROKE study investigates the diagnostic accuracy of dry electrode electroencephalography (EEG) for LVO-a stroke in the prehospital setting. To determine which EEG features are most useful for this purpose and assess EEG data quality, EEG recordings are also performed in the emergency room (ER). Here, we report data of the first 100 patients included in the ER. Methods Patients presented to the ER with a suspected stroke or known LVO-a stroke underwent a single EEG prior to EVT. Diagnostic accuracy for LVO-a stroke of frequency band power, brain symmetry and phase synchronization measures were evaluated by calculating receiver operating characteristic curves. Optimal cut-offs were determined as the highest sensitivity at a specificity of >= 80%. Results EEG data were of sufficient quality for analysis in 65/100 included patients. Of these, 35/65 (54%) had an acute ischemic stroke, of whom 9/65 (14%) had an LVO-a stroke. Median onset-to-EEG-time was 266 min (IQR 121-655) and median EEG-recording-time was 3 min (IQR 3-5). The EEG feature with the highest diagnostic accuracy for LVO-a stroke was theta-alpha ratio (AUC 0.83; sensitivity 75%; specificity 81%). Combined, weighted phase lag index and relative theta power best identified LVO-a stroke (sensitivity 100%; specificity 84%). Conclusion Dry electrode EEG is a promising tool for LVO-a stroke detection, but data quality needs to be improved and validation in the prehospital setting is necessary.

A Systematic Review of Electrophysiological Findings in Binge-Purge Eating Disorders: A Window Into Brain Dynamics	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						EEG; binge eating; neurophysiology; bulimia nervosa; electroneurophysiology; ERP; frequency analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ANOREXIA-NERVOSA; ATTENTIONAL BIAS; BULIMIA-NERVOSA; FOOD; STIMULI; OVERWEIGHT; WEIGHT; TIME; CUES	Binge-purge eating disorders (BP-ED), such as bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder, may share some neurobiological features. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive measurement modality that may aid in research and diagnosis of BP-ED. We conducted a systematic review of the literature on EEG findings in BP-ED, seeking to summarize and analyze the current evidence, as well as identify shortcomings and gaps to inform new perspectives for future studies. Following PRISMA Statement recommendations, the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched using terms related to "electroencephalography" and "binge-purge" eating disorders. Of 555 articles retrieved, 15 met predefined inclusion criteria and were included for full-text analysis. Eleven studies investigated EEG by means of event-related potentials (ERP) in BP-ED individuals: 7 using eating disorder-related stimuli (i.e., food, body image) and 4 using non-eating disorder-related stimuli (i.e., facial expressions or auditory clicks). These studies found significant differences in the N200, P200, P300, and LPP components in BP-ED participants compared to controls, indicating that this population exhibits impairments in selective attention, attentional allocation/processing, and allocation of motivational or emotion-based attention. Five studies investigated EEG using frequency analysis; reporting significant differences in beta activity in fronto-temporal and occipito-temporo-parietal areas in BP-ED individuals compared to controls, revealing a dysfunctional brain network. However, the small number of studies, the heterogeneity of samples, study paradigms, stimulus types, and the lack of an adequate assessment of neuropsychological parameters are some limitations of the current literature. Although some EEG data are promising and consistent with neuroimaging and neuropsychological findings in individuals with BP-ED, future studies need to overcome current methodological shortcomings.

These methods mainly use EEG signal features in either the time or the frequency domain to separate regular, interictal, and ictal brain activity. The aim of this work was to evaluate the feasibility of using functional connectivity (FC) based feature extraction methods for the analysis of epileptiform discharges in EEG signals. These signals were obtained from EEG-fMRI sessions of 10 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) with unilateral hippocampal atrophy. The connectivity functions investigated were motif synchronization, imaginary coherence, and magnitude squared coherence in the alpha, beta, and gamma bands of the EEG. EEG signals were sectioned into 1-s epochs and classified according to (using neurologist markers): activity far from interictal epileptiform discharges (IED), activity immediately before an IED and, finally, mid-IED activity. Connectivity matrices for each epoch for each FC function were built, and graph theory was used to obtain the following metrics: strength, cluster coefficient, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality (both local and global), and global efficiency. The statistical distributions of these metrics were compared among the three classes, using ANOVA, for each FC function. We found significant differences in all global (p < 0.001) and local (p < 0.00002) graph metrics of the far class compared with before and mid for motif synchronization on the beta band; local betweenness centrality also pointed to a degree of lateralization on the frontotemporal structures. This analysis demonstrates the potential of FC measures, computed using motif synchronization, for the characterization of epileptiform activity of MTLE patients. This methodology may be helpful in the analysis of EEG-fMRI data applied to epileptic foci localization. Nonetheless, the methods must be tested with a larger sample and with other epileptic phenotypes.

Regarding biosignal processing, this interplay involves predominantly neural and heartbeat linear dynamics expressed via time and frequency domain-related features. However, the dynamics of central and autonomous nervous systems show nonlinear and multifractal behaviours, and the extent to which this behaviour influences brain-heart interactions is currently unknown. Here, we report a novel signal processing framework aimed at quantifying nonlinear functional brain-heart interplay in the non-Gaussian and multifractal domains that combines electroencephalography (EEG) and heart rate variability series. This framework relies on a maximal information coefficient analysis between nonlinear multiscale features derived from EEG spectra and from an inhomogeneous point-process model for heartbeat dynamics. Experimental results were gathered from 24 healthy volunteers during a resting state and a cold pressor test, revealing that synchronous changes between brain and heartbeat multifractal spectra occur at higher EEG frequency bands and through nonlinear/complex cardiovascular control. We conclude that significant bodily, sympathovagal changes such as those elicited by cold-pressure stimuli affect the functional brain-heart interplay beyond second-order statistics, thus extending it to multifractal dynamics. These results provide a platform to define novel nervous-system-targeted biomarkers.

To explore the impact of automation and scenario complexity on the passive fatigue of a driver, we collected electroencephalography (EEG), detection-response task (DRT) performance, and the subjective report scores of 48 drivers. We found that in automated driving under monotonic conditions, after 40 min, the alpha power of the driver's EEG indicators increased significantly, the accuracy of the detection reaction task decreased, and the reaction time became slower. The receiver characteristic curve was used to calculate the critical threshold of the alpha power during passive fatigue. The determination of the threshold further clarifies the occurrence time and physiological characteristics of passive fatigue and improves the passive fatigue theory.

The auditory steady-state response (ASSR) is the most robust index for gamma oscillations, and it is impaired in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. Although ASSR reduction is known to vary in terms of frequency and time, the neural mechanisms are poorly understood. We obtained high-density electrocorticography recordings from a wide area of the cortex in 8 patients with refractory epilepsy. In an ASSR paradigm, click sounds were presented at frequencies of 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 120, and 160 Hz. We performed time-frequency analyses and analyzed intertrial coherence, event-related spectral perturbation, and high-gamma oscillations. We demonstrate that the ASSR is globally distributed among the temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices. The ASSR was composed of time-dependent neural subcircuits differing in frequency tuning. Importantly, the frequency tuning characteristics of the late-latency ASSR varied between the temporal/frontal and parietal cortex, suggestive of differentiation along parallel auditory pathways. This large-scale survey of the cortical ASSR could serve as a foundation for future studies of the ASSR in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.

Recurrence quantification analysis provides the link between age-related decline in motor brain response and complexity of the baseline EEG	IZVESTIYA VYSSHIKH UCHEBNYKH ZAVEDENIY-PRIKLADNAYA NELINEYNAYA DINAMIKA			English	Article						complexity; recurrence quantification analysis; EEG; age-related changes; event-related desynchronization	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; SAMPLE ENTROPY; CLASSIFICATION; CONNECTIVITY; DIMENSION; PATTERNS; MEG	The goal of the present study is to investigate the effect of healthy aging on the neuronal mechanisms supporting human brain activity during motor task performance. Such biomarkers of the age-related changes can be detected using mathematical methods of time-series analysis and complexity analysis. Methods. In the present paper, recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) measures are employed to explore the complexity of the pre-movement EEG in young and elderly adult groups. To evaluate the neural brain response during motor execution, we applied the traditional methods of time-frequency analysis. Results. The proposed approach demonstrated that (i) the RQA measures show a significant increase of complexity in elderly adults; (ii) increased pre-movement EEG complexity comes with the reduced motor-related brain response in the a/m-band (p < 0.01), estimated via the traditional methods of time-frequency analysis. It allows to conclude that the increased pre-movement EEG complexity indicates the weak neuronal plasticity degenerated under the factor of age. Conclusion. The complexity of the pre-movement a/m-band neuronal oscillations could be considered as a relevant measure for the detection of age-related cognitive or motor impairments. Besides, applied RQA method demonstrated a good ability to assess the complexity features of pre-stimulus EEG and provided a clear interpretation of age-related changes in electrical activity of the brain cortex.

Unmitigated Surgical Castration in Calves of Different Ages: Electroencephalographic and Neurohormonal Findings	ANIMALS			English	Article						age; calves; electroencephalography; pain; substance P; surgical castration	FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; QUANTITATIVE EEG; PLASMA-CORTISOL; PAIN PERCEPTION; SUBSTANCE-P; CATTLE; BEEF; VETERINARIANS; VALIDATION; MODULATION	Simple Summary Castration is a painful procedure that is commonly performed on cattle without analgesia. Although castration is considered to be more painful in older calves, studies examining the effect of age on electrophysiological and neurohormonal responses to pain under the same experimental conditions are limited. There are several limitations to providing pain mitigation for castration, one being the lack of available approved analgesics for use in alleviating the pain associated with castration in the United States. It is necessary to validate methods of pain assessment in cattle to support the development of pain relief drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of unmitigated surgical castration on the electroencephalography (EEG) responses and plasma substance P (SP) concentrations in calves, without pain relief across different age groups. Age, time, and procedure (castration or a simulated castration) impacted outcomes. The findings suggest that surgical castration without pain relief causes variations in EEG responses and in SP concentrations and that these responses are age related. Castration is a common management procedure employed in North American cattle production and is known to cause a pain response. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of unmitigated surgical castration on the electroencephalography (EEG) responses and plasma substance P (SP) concentrations in calves of different ages under the same experimental conditions. Thirty male Holstein calves in three age categories [<6 weeks (6W); 3 months (3M); 6 months (6M); 10 calves per age group] were used in the study. Calves were subjected to a simulated castration session (SHAM) followed 24 h later by surgical castration (CAST) without analgesia. An EEG analysis was performed before the procedure (i.e., baseline), at treatment, and 0-5, 5-10, and 10-20 min post-treatment for both SHAM and CAST, respectively. Blood samples were collected immediately prior to both treatments (time 0) and again at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after both treatments. The EEG results showed a three-way interaction between treatment, age, and time for delta and beta absolute power, beta relative power, total power, and median frequency (p = 0.004, p = 0.04, p = 0.04, p = 0.03, and p = 0.008, respectively). Following CAST, EEG total power decreased, and median frequency increased relative to SHAM in 6W and 3M calves only following treatment. For 6W and 3M calves, delta and beta absolute power increased at CAST and at later time points relative to SHAM. Marginal evidence for two-way interactions was noted between time and treatment and between age and treatment on the concentration of SP (p = 0.068 and p = 0.066, respectively). Substance P concentrations decreased in CAST treatment compared to SHAM at the later times (8 h: p = 0.007; 12 h: p = 0.048); 6W calves showed lower SP concentration at CAST relative to SHAM (p = 0.017). These findings indicate variation in EEG responses and in SP concentrations following unmitigated surgical castration in calves and that these responses may be age specific. These EEG findings have implications for supporting the perception of the pain associated with surgical castration in young calves and emphasize the urgency of pain mitigation strategies during routine husbandry practices such as castration, as typically implemented in North American cattle management.

Objective: To determine whether EEG oscillations underlie the interictal spike changes after tDCS in rats with chronic spontaneous seizures. Methods: Rats with kainic acid-induced spontaneous seizures were subjected to cathodal tDCS or sham stimulation for 5 consecutive days. Video-EEG recordings were collected immediately pre-and post stimulation and for the subsequent 2 weeks following stimulation. The acute pre-post stimulation and subacute follow-up changes of interictal spikes and EEG oscillations in tDCS-treated rats were compared with sham. Ictal EEG with seizure behaviors, hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein expression, and mossy fiber sprouting were compared between tDCS and sham rats. Results: Interictal spike counts were reduced immediately following tDCS with augmented delta and diminished beta and gamma oscillations compared with sham. Cathodal tDCS also enhanced delta oscillations in normal rats. However, increased numbers of interictal spikes with a decrease of delta and theta oscillations were observed in tDCS-treated rats compared with sham during the following 2 weeks after stimulation. Resuming tDCS suppressed the increase of interictal spike activity. In tDCS rats, hippocampal BDNF protein expression was decreased while mossy fiber sprouting did not change compared with sham. Conclusions: The inverse relationship between the changes of delta oscillation and interictal spikes during tDCS on and off stimulation periods indicates that an enhanced endogenous delta oscillation underlies the tDCS inhibitory effect on epileptic excitability.

However, as the EEG dynamics show nonlinear and non-stationary behavior, results using the FFT approach may result meaningless. A novel method has been developed for the analysis of nonlinear and non-stationary signals known as the Hilbert-Huang transform method. In this study we analyze the differences for the broadband (SPA) of the EEG using the traditional FFT approach with those calculated with the Hilbert Marginal Spectra (HMS) after decomposition of the EEG with a multivariate empirical mode decomposition algorithm. EEG segments recorded from 19 leads of 47 healthy volunteers were studied. Statistically significant differences between methods were found for almost all leads by variance analyses. The agreement assessment shows that mean weighted frequencies have a good agreement for almost all bands, with the exception of beta-2 and gamma bands where values for the HMS where higher than 3 Hz. Also the HMS method received lower than 5% energy values for alpha activity with an increment in the adjacent bands. The HMS may be considered a good alternative for the SPA of the EEG when nonlinearity or non-stationarity may be present.

Due to its safety and high time resolution, electroencephalogram (EEG) based BCIs have become popular. Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is an EEG particularly attractive due to high signal to noise ratio (SNR) and robustness. A spatio-spectral feature fusion approach is introduced to recognize the frequency of short-time SSVEP using correlated component analysis (CORRCA). Two reference signals are generated by averaging each half of the training trials. The signal of each channel is passed through a filter bank designed to decompose into a predefined set of subbands. The spatial correlation coefficients are calculated between each subband of the test trial and the reference signals using CORRCA. The two sets of coefficients derived from two reference signals are merged and sorted in descending order. Thus obtained coefficients are weighted using a nonlinear function to define their contribution in frequency recognition. The weighted coefficients are fused to obtain a single coefficient for the target stimulus frequency of individual subband. The derived coefficients for each subband are weighted with another nonlinear function and fused to single coefficient for the target stimulus. A similar process is applied for each stimulus frequency and then the frequency corresponding to the highest coefficient is recognized as the target stimulus. The performance of the proposed method outperforms other existing algorithms to recognize the stimulus frequencies of SSVEP.

Investigating neurophysiological markers of impaired cognition in schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Non-invasive brain stimulation; Oscillations; Cortical reactivity; Cognitive impairment; Experimental therapeutics	DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN-STIMULATION; TMS-EEG; INHIBITION; MECHANISMS; SYNCHRONY; DYSFUNCTION	Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent in schizophrenia and treatment options are severely limited. A greater understanding of the pathophysiology of impaired cognition would have broad implications, including for the development of effective treatments. In the current study we used a multimodal approach to identify neurophysiological markers of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Fifty-seven participants (30 schizophrenia, 27 controls) underwent neurobiological assessment (electroencephalography [EEG] and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation combined with EEG [TMS-EEG]) and assessment of cognitive functioning using an n-back task and the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery. Neurobiological outcome measures included oscillatory power during a 2-back task, TMS-related oscillations and TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs). Cognitive outcome measures were d prime and accurate reaction time on the 2-back and MATRICS domain scores. Compared to healthy controls, participants with schizophrenia showed significantly reduced theta oscillations in response to TMS, and trend level decreases in task-related theta and cortical reactivity (i.e. reduced N100 and N40 TEPs). Participants with schizophrenia also showed significantly impaired cognitive performance across all measures. Correlational analysis identified significant associations between cortical reactivity and TMS-related oscillations in both groups; and trend level associations between task-related oscillations and impaired cognition in schizophrenia. The current study provides experimental support for possible neurophysiological markers of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The potential implications of these findings, including for treatment development, are discussed.

This study aims to compare the power amplitude of electrodes covering the central and frontal regions of a 32-channel scalp EEG. The activations from a standard index finger-tapping and a game paradigm are analyzed. Twenty-five right-handed and five left-handed healthy subjects (range = 18-30 years; mean = 24.25 years; SD = 3.96 years) participated in this study. A novel single-frequency filter (SFF) bank was applied to identify the peak amplitude from the power spectral density plots. The results show that the gaming paradigm yields lower or comparable power amplitudes than the standard finger tapping. We observed that the right-hand finger tapping by the left-handed subjects shows lower between-subject dispersion in amplitude. Nonparametric Spearman correlation showed no association between game scores and power amplitude for the right-handed participants. However, for left-handers, both positive and negative associations were observed. This study demonstrates the efficacy of SFF for extracting power amplitudes with a better signalto-noise ratio, which has implications in BCI and motor rehabilitation applications. The findings support the role of game paradigms for motor movement research and in understanding bilateral hemispheric activations in cognitive tasks.

Coherent neural oscillations inform early stroke motor recovery	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						biomarker; electroencephalography; motor cortex; stroke	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; EEG ALPHA; PERFORMANCE; REGRESSION; IMPAIRMENT; SYNCHRONIZATION; ATTENTION; INTEGRITY; SELECTION	Neural oscillations may contain important information pertaining to stroke rehabilitation. This study examined the predictive performance of electroencephalography-derived neural oscillations following stroke using a data-driven approach. Individuals with stroke admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation facility completed a resting-state electroencephalography recording and structural neuroimaging around the time of admission and motor testing at admission and discharge. Using a lasso regression model with cross-validation, we determined the extent of motor recovery (admission to discharge change in Functional Independence Measurement motor subscale score) prediction from electroencephalography, baseline motor status, and corticospinal tract injury. In 27 participants, coherence in a 1-30 Hz band between leads overlying ipsilesional primary motor cortex and 16 leads over bilateral hemispheres predicted 61.8% of the variance in motor recovery. High beta (20-30 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) frequencies contributed most to the model demonstrating both positive and negative associations with motor recovery, including high beta leads in supplementary motor areas and ipsilesional ventral premotor and parietal regions and alpha leads overlying contralesional temporal-parietal and ipsilesional parietal regions. Electroencephalography power, baseline motor status, and corticospinal tract injury did not significantly predict motor recovery during hospitalization (R-2 = 0-6.2%). Findings underscore the relevance of oscillatory synchronization in early stroke rehabilitation while highlighting contributions from beta and alpha frequency bands and frontal, parietal, and temporal-parietal regions overlooked by traditional hypothesis-driven prediction models.

High-Density EEG in Current Clinical Practice and Opportunities for the Future	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Electrical source imaging; Spatial resolution; HD-EEG; Noninvasive; Localization; Epilepsy	EPILEPTIC SOURCE LOCALIZATION; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; WORD PRODUCTION; ARRAY; SURFACE; HEAD; DISCHARGES; ACCURACY; SEIZURE; SPIKES	High-density EEG (HD-EEG) recordings use a higher spatial sampling of scalp electrodes than a standard 10-20 low-density EEG montage. Although several studies have demonstrated improved localization of the epileptogenic cortex using HD-EEG, widespread implementation is impeded by cost, setup and interpretation time, and lack of specific or sufficient procedural billing codes. Despite these barriers, HD-EEG has been in use at several institutions for years. These centers have noted utility in a variety of clinical scenarios where increased spatial resolution from HD-EEG has been required, justifying the extra time and cost. We share select scenarios from several centers, using different recording techniques and software, where HD-EEG provided information above and beyond the standard low-density EEG. We include seven cases where HD-EEG contributed directly to current clinical care of epilepsy patients and highlight two novel techniques which suggest potential opportunities to improve future clinical care. Cases illustrate how HD-EEG allows clinicians to: case 1-lateralize falsely generalized interictal epileptiform discharges; case 2-improve localization of falsely generalized epileptic spasms; cases 3 and 4-improve localization of interictal epileptiform discharges in anatomic regions below the circumferential limit of standard low-density EEG coverage; case 5-improve noninvasive localization of the seizure onset zone in lesional epilepsy; cases 6 and 7-improve localization of the seizure onset zone to guide invasive investigation near eloquent cortex; case 8-identify epileptic fast oscillations; and case 9-map language cortex. Together, these nine cases illustrate that using both visual analysis and advanced techniques, HD-EEG can play an important role in clinical management.

Abnormal phase discontinuity of alpha- and theta-frequency oscillations in schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG); Phase discontinuity; Source level analysis; Schizophrenia; Alpha oscillation; Theta oscillation	EEG; NETWORK; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; CONNECTIVITY; COHERENCE; NOISE	Background: Schizophrenia patients have abnormal electroencephalographic (EEG) power over multiple frequency bands, even at rest, though the primary neural generators and spatiotemporal dynamics of these abnormalities are largely unknown. Disturbances in the precise synchronization of oscillations within and across cortical sources may underlie abnormal resting-state EEG activity in schizophrenia patients. Methods: A novel assessment method was applied to identify the independent contributing sources of resting-state EEG and assess the phase discontinuity in schizophrenia patients (N = 148) and healthy subjects (N = 143). Results: A network of 11 primary contributing sources of scalp EEG was identified in both groups. Schizophrenia patients showed abnormal elevations of EEG power in the temporal region in the theta, beta, and gamma-bands, as well as the posterior cingulate gyrus in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta-bands. The higher theta-band power in the middle temporal gyrus was significantly correlated with verbal memory impairment in patients. The peak frequency of alpha was lower in patients in the cingulate and temporal regions. Furthermore, patients showed a higher rate of alpha phase discontinuity in the temporal region as well as a lower rate of theta phase discontinuity in the temporal and posterior cingulate regions. Conclusions: Abnormal rates of phase discontinuity of alpha-and theta-band, abnormal elevations of EEG power in multiple bands, and a lower peak frequency of alpha were identified in schizophrenia patients at rest. Clarification of the mechanistic substrates of abnormal phase discontinuity may clarify core pathophysiologic abnormalities of schizophrenia and contribute to the development of novel biomarkers for therapeutic interventions.

Previous studies indicated that the inherent information about brain activity may be used to identify individual during resting-state of eyes open (REO) and eyes closed (REC). Electroencephalographic (EEG) records the data from the scalp, and it is believed that the noisy EEG signals can influence the accuracies of one experiment causing unreliable results. Therefore, the stability and time-robustness of inter-individual features can be investigated for the purpose of individual identification. In this work, we conducted three experiments with the time interval of at least 2 weeks, and used different types of measures (Power Spectral Density, Cross Spectrum, Channel Coherence and Phase Lags) to extract the individual features. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) is calculated to measure the level of linear correlation for intra-individual, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to obtain the related classification accuracy. Results show that the classification accuracies of four features were 85-100% for intra-experiment dataset, and were 80-100% for fusion experiments dataset. For inter-experiments classification of REO features, the optimized frequency range is 13-40 Hz for three features, Power Spectral Density, Channel Coherence and Cross Spectrum. For inter-experiments classification of REC, the optimized frequency range is 8-40 Hz for three features, Power Spectral Density, Channel Coherence and Cross Spectrum. The classification results of Phase Lags are much lower than the other three features. These results show the time-robustness of EEG, which can further use for individual identification system.

A rejection of independent components (ICs) is usually performed in semiautomatic mode and requires experts' involvement. As also revealed by our study, experts' opinions about the nature of a component often disagree, highlighting the need to develop a robust and sustainable automatic system for EEG ICs classification. The current article presents a toolbox and crowdsourcing platform for Automatic Labeling of Independent Components in Electroencephalography (ALICE) available via link . The ALICE toolbox aims to build a sustainable algorithm to remove artifacts and find specific patterns in EEG signals using ICA decomposition based on accumulated experts' knowledge. The difference from previous toolboxes is that the ALICE project will accumulate different benchmarks based on crowdsourced visual labeling of ICs collected from publicly available and in-house EEG recordings. The choice of labeling is based on the estimation of IC time-series, IC amplitude topography, and spectral power distribution. The platform allows supervised machine learning (ML) model training and re-training on available data subsamples for better performance in specific tasks (i.e., movement artifact detection in healthy or autistic children). Also, current research implements the novel strategy for consentient labeling of ICs by several experts. The provided baseline model could detect noisy IC and components related to the functional brain oscillations such as alpha and mu rhythm.

The main objective of this study is to quantify the severity of SAD by using effective connectivity (EC). Electroencephalography (EEG) is a suitable estimation mechanism to assess the EC network underlying the SAD data, due to its high temporal resolution. EEG data were acquired from 20 subjects divided to 5 severe, 5 average, 5 mild, and 5 healthy control (HC) in the anticipation time (before delivering a speech in public). The EEG data was used to estimate the EC network using the phase slope index (PSI) algorithm in the alpha band (8-13 Hz). The difference between the PSI metrics in all the SAD groups was significant (p< 0.024). EEG results showed that the severe and average groups have greater EC in the left hemisphere for alpha networks, while mild and HC groups have shown greater EC networks in the right hemisphere. The mid-parietal lobe has shown to be the main brain hub in the severe group, while the right frontal cortex has shown to be the major brain hub for HC. The current results confirm that the involvement of the PSI algorithm in alpha oscillations is providing higher recognition of SAD level due to its sensitivity to characterize mental illness such as SAD and depression.

As with other psychedelics, the experience induced by DMT strongly depends upon contextual factors, yet the neurobiological determinants of this variability remain unknown. The present study investigated changes in neural oscillations elicited by inhaled DMT, and whether baseline electroencephalography (EEG) recordings could predict the subjective effects reported by the participants. Healthy volunteers (N = 35) were measured with EEG before and during the acute effects of DMT consumed in a natural setting. Source-localized neural oscillations were correlated with the results of multiple questionnaires employed to assess the subjective effects of the drug. DMT resulted in a marked reduction of alpha and beta oscillations, and increased posterior spectral power in the delta, theta and gamma bands. The power of fronto-temporal theta oscillations was inversely correlated with scales indexing feelings of unity and transcendence, which are an integral part of the phenomenology of mystical-type experiences. The robustness of these results was supported using a machine learning model for regression trained and tested following a cross-validation procedure. These results are consistent with the observation that the state of mind prior to consuming a psychedelic drug influences the ensuing subjective experience of the user. They also suggest that baseline EEG screenings before administration of a serotonergic psychedelic could be useful to estimate the likelihood of inducing mystical-type experiences, previously linked to sustained positive effects in well-being and improved outcome of therapeutic interventions.

We investigated potential quantitative electroencephalography biomarkers in 57 patients with post-concussive syndrome and chronic pain following motor vehicle collision, and 54 healthy nearly age- and sex-matched controls. (2) Methods: Electroencephalography processing was completed in MATLAB, statistical modeling in SPSS, and machine learning modeling in Rapid Miner. Group differences were calculated using current-source density estimation, yielding whole-brain topographical distributions of absolute power, relative power and phase-locking functional connectivity. Groups were compared using independent sample Mann-Whitney U tests. Effect sizes and Pearson correlations were also computed. Machine learning analysis leveraged a post hoc supervised learning support vector non-probabilistic binary linear kernel classification to generate predictive models from the derived EEG signatures. (3) Results: Patients displayed significantly elevated and slowed power compared to controls: delta (p = 0.000000, r = 0.6) and theta power (p < 0.0001, r = 0.4), and relative delta power (p < 0.00001) and decreased relative alpha power (p < 0.001). Absolute delta and theta power together yielded the strongest machine learning classification accuracy (87.6%). Changes in absolute power were moderately correlated with duration and persistence of symptoms in the slow wave frequency spectrum (<15 Hz). (4) Conclusions: Distributed increases in slow wave oscillatory power are concurrent with post-concussive syndrome and chronic pain.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) coherence and graph theory can be used to measure functional connections between different brain regions and information interaction between different clusters of neurons. At the same time, it was found that better cognitive performance of individuals indicated stronger small-world characteristics of resting-state WM networks. However, little is known about the neural synchronization of the retention stage during ongoing WM tasks (i.e., online WM) by training on the whole-brain network level. Therefore, combining EEG coherence and graph theory analysis, the present study examined the topological changes of WM networks before and after training based on the whole brain and constructed differential networks with different frequency band oscillations (i.e., theta, alpha, and beta). The results showed that after WM training, the subjects' WM networks had higher clustering coefficients and shorter optimal path lengths than before training during the retention period. Moreover, the increased synchronization of the frontal theta oscillations seemed to reflect the improved executive ability of WM and the more mature resource deployment; the enhanced alpha oscillatory synchronization in the frontoparietal and fronto-occipital regions may reflect the enhanced ability to suppress irrelevant information during the delay and pay attention to memory guidance; the enhanced beta oscillatory synchronization in the temporoparietal and frontoparietal regions may indicate active memory maintenance and preparation for memory-guided attention. The findings may add new evidence to understand the neural mechanisms of WM on the changes of network topological attributes in the task-related mode.

Simultaneous electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) recordings offer a high spatiotemporal resolution approach to study human brain and understand the underlying mechanisms mediating cognitive and behavioral processes. However, the high susceptibility of EEG to MRI-induced artifacts hinders a broad adaptation of this approach. More specifically, EEG data collected during fMRI acquisition are contaminated with MRI gradients and ballistocardiogram artifacts, in addition to artifacts of physiological origin. There have been several attempts for reducing these artifacts with manual and time-consuming pre-processing, which may result in biasing EEG data due to variations in selecting steps order, parameters, and classification of artifactual independent components. Thus, there is a strong urge to develop a fully automatic and comprehensive pipeline for reducing all major EEG artifacts. In this work, we introduced an open-access toolbox with a fully automatic pipeline for reducing artifacts from EEG data collected simultaneously with fMRI (refer to APPEAR). Approach. The pipeline integrates average template subtraction and independent component analysis to suppress both MRI-related and physiological artifacts. To validate our results, we tested APPEAR on EEG data recorded from healthy control subjects during resting-state (n= 48) and task-based (i.e. event-related-potentials (ERPs); n= 8) paradigms. The chosen gold standard is an expert manual review of the EEG database. Main results. We compared manually and automated corrected EEG data during resting-state using frequency analysis and continuous wavelet transformation and found no significant differences between the two corrections. A comparison between ERP data recorded during a so-called stop-signal task (e.g. amplitude measures and signal-to-noise ratio) also showed no differences between the manually and fully automatic fMRI-EEG-corrected data. Significance. APPEAR offers the first comprehensive open-source toolbox that can speed up advancement of EEG analysis and enhance replication by avoiding experimenters' preferences while allowing for processing large EEG-fMRI cohorts composed of hundreds of subjects with manageable researcher time and effort.

Essential hand functionality includes movements such as wrist extension and flexion, finger extension and flexion and tripod pinch. There are a limited number of EEG studies focusing on the combination of these movements. A novel grouping of these movements was investigated in the current study: i.e., right wrist, right finger, left wrist and left finger movements. The associated EEG was discriminated in a novel four-class BCI problem. Real and imagined movement data was recorded from healthy test subjects. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used as a spatial filter. Time-frequency-based features were extracted from the mu and beta EEG frequency bands. A subset of features were selected using the Bhattacharya distance. Two classifier configurations were compared i.e., a single-stage four-class classifier architecture and a two-stage four-class architecture. Artificial neural networks, support vector machines, Mahalanobis distance clustering and a group classifier were compared within these architectures. The two-stage group classifier performed best with average accuracies of 68% and 62% for the real and imagined movements respectively. These results imply a possibility of multiclass EEG discrimination of hand movements. Time-frequency plots of the selected features suggest that different underlying neural mechanisms control wrist and finger movements. This study implies that an EEG-based BCI can control more degrees of freedom of a prosthetic or orthotic hand.

Two widely-used techniques are the microstate analysis of EEG signals and hidden Markov modeling (HMM) of MEG power envelopes. Both reportedly lead to similar state lifetimes on the 100 ms timescale, suggesting a common neural basis. To investigate whether microstates and power envelope HMM states describe the same neural dynamics, we used simultaneous MEG/EEG recordings at rest and compared the spatial signature and temporal activation dynamics of microstates and power envelope HMM states obtained separately from EEG and MEG. Results showed that microstates and power envelope HMM states differ both spatially and temporally. Microstates reflect sharp events of neural synchronization, whereas power envelope HMM states disclose network-level activity with 100-200 ms lifetimes. Further, MEG microstates do not correspond to the canonical EEG microstates but are better interpreted as split HMM states. On the other hand, both MEG and EEG HMM states involve the (de)activation of similar functional networks. Microstate analysis and power envelope HMM thus appear sensitive to neural events occurring over different spatial and temporal scales. As such, they represent complementary approaches to explore the fast, sub-second scale bursting electrophysiological dynamics in spontaneous human brain activity.

Twenty five healthy subjects performed a three-level N-back test using a fully mobile setup including tablet-based presentation of the task and EEG data collection with a self-mounted mobile EEG device at two assessment time points. A two-fold analysis approach was chosen including a standard analysis of variance and an artificial neural network to distinguish the levels of cognitive load. Our findings indicate that the setup is feasible for detecting changes in cognitive load, as reflected by alterations across lobes in different frequency bands. In particular, we observed a decrease of occipital alpha and an increase in frontal, parietal and occipital theta with increasing cognitive load. The most distinct levels of cognitive load could be discriminated by the integrated machine learning models with an accuracy of 86%.

A frontotemporal network generated by means of gamma oscillations and comprising the auditory cortex (AC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been shown to be involved in the cognitively demanding auditory information processing. This study aims to reveal patterns of functional and effective connectivity within this network in healthy subjects by means of simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI in 28 healthy subjects during the performance of a cognitively demanding auditory choice reaction task. Connectivity between the ACC and AC was analysed employing EEG and fMRI connectivity measures. We found a significant BOLD signal correlation between the ACC and AC, a significant task-dependant increase of fMRI connectivity (gPPI) and a significant increase in functional coupling in the gamma frequency range between these regions (LPS), which was increased in top-down direction (granger analysis). EEG and fMRI connectivity measures were positively correlated. The results of these study point to a role of a top-down influence of the ACC on the AC executed by means of gamma synchronisation. The replication of fMRI connectivity patterns in simultaneously recorded EEG data and the correlation between connectivity measures from both domains found in our study show, that brain connectivity based on the synchronisation of gamma oscillations is mirrored in fMRI connectivity patterns.

It negatively impacts the quality of life. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying pain in PD remain to be elucidated. This study sought to use electroencephalographic (EEG) coherence analysis to compare neuronal synchronization in neuronal networks between patients with PD, with and without pain. Twenty-four patients with sporadic PD were evaluated for the presence of pain. Time-frequency and coherence analyses were performed on their EEG data. Whole-brain and regional coherence were calculated and compared between pain-positive and pain-negative patients. There was no significant difference in the whole-brain coherence between the pain-positive and pain-negative groups. However, temporal-temporal coherence differed significantly between the two groups (p = 0.031). Our findings indicate that aberrant synchronization of inter-temporal regions is involved in PD-related pain. This will further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain in PD.

An example is the analysis of intracranial EEG (iEEG) from epilepsy patients for the detection of High Frequency Oscillations (HFO), which are a biomarker for epileptogenic brain tissue. Mixed-signal neuromorphic circuits offer the possibility of building compact and low-power neural network processing systems that can analyze data on-line in real-time. Here we present a neuromorphic system that combines a neural recording headstage with a spiking neural network (SNN) processing core on the same die for processing iEEG, and show how it can reliably detect HFO, thereby achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. This is a first feasibility study towards identifying relevant features in iEEG in real-time using mixed-signal neuromorphic computing technologies. A major challenge across a variety of fields is how to process the vast quantities of data produced by sensors without large computation resources. Here, the authors present a neuromorphic chip which can detect a relevant signature of epileptogenic tissue from intracranial recordings in patients.

The aim of this study was to investigate how efficient information flows through a network, i.e. how resting-state EEG networks are organized and whether this organization it also subject to fluctuations. Differences of the network organization (small-worldness), degree of clustered connectivity, and path length as an indicator of how information is integrated into the network across time was compared between theta, alpha and beta bands. We show robust differences in network organization (small-worldness) between frequency bands. Fluctuations in network organization were larger in the theta, compared to the alpha and beta frequency. Variation in network organization and not the frequency of fluctuations differs between frequency bands. Furthermore, the degree of clustered connectivity and its modulation across time is the same across frequency bands, but the path length revealed the same modulatory pattern as the small-world metric. It is therefore the interplay of local processing efficiency and global information processing efficiency in the brain that fluctuates in a frequency-specific way. Properties of how information can be integrated is subject to fluctuations in a frequency-specific way in the resting-state. The possible relevance of these resting-state EEG properties is discussed including its clinical relevance. (C) 2020 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the first part of the document, we describe the economic and social implications of the disease, traditional diagnosis techniques, and the fundaments of automated AD detection. Then, we present electroencephalography (EEG) as an appropriate alternative for the early detection of AD, owing to its reduced cost, portability, and non-invasiveness. We also describe the main time and frequency domain EEG features that are employed in AD detection. Subsequently, we examine some of the main studies of the last decade that aim to provide an automatic detection of AD and its previous stages by means of SP and ML. In these studies, brain data was acquired using multiple medical techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and EEG. The main aspects of each approach, namely feature extraction, classification model, validation approach, and performance metrics, are compiled and discussed. Lastly, a set of conclusions and recommendations for future research on AD automatic detection are drawn in the final section of the paper.

Examining the neural antecedents of tics in Tourette syndrome using electroencephalography	JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						beta&#8208; band oscillations; electroencephalography; mu&#8208; band oscillations; tics; Tourette syndrome		Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by the occurrence of motor and vocal tics. TS is associated with cortical-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit dysfunction and hyper-excitability of cortical limbic and motor regions that lead to the occurrence of tics. Importantly, individuals with TS often report that their tics are preceded by premonitory sensory/urge phenomena (PU) that are described as uncomfortable bodily sensations that precede the execution of a tic and are experienced as an urge for motor discharge. While tics are most often referred to as involuntary movements, it has been argued by some that tics should be viewed as voluntary movements that are executed in response to the presence of PU. To investigate this issue further, we conducted a study using electroencephalography (EEG). We recorded movement-related EEG (mu- and beta-band oscillations) during (1) the immediate period leading up to the execution of voluntary movements by a group of individuals with TS and a group of matched healthy control participants, and (2) the immediate period leading up to the execution of a tic in a group of individuals with TS. We demonstrate that movement-related mu and beta oscillations are not reliably observed prior to tics in individuals with TS. We interpret this effect as reflecting the greater involvement of a network of brain areas, including the insular and cingulate cortices, the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, in the generation of tics in TS. We also show that beta-band desynchronization does occur when individuals with TS initiate voluntary movements, but, in contrast to healthy controls, desynchronization of mu-band oscillations is not observed during the execution of voluntary movements for individuals with TS. We interpret this finding as reflecting a dysfunction of physiological inhibition in TS, thereby contributing to an impaired ability to suppress neuronal populations that may compete with movement preparation processes.

J	Cura, OK; Akan, A				Cura, Ozlem Karabiber; Akan, Aydin			Classification of Epileptic EEG Signals Using Synchrosqueezing Transform and Machine Learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Synchrosqueezing transform (SST); electroencephalogram (EEG); epileptic seizure classification; machine learning	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; SEIZURE DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; METHODOLOGY; EXTRACTION; IMAGE	Epilepsy is a neurological disease that is very common worldwide. Patient's electroencephalography (EEG) signals are frequently used for the detection of epileptic seizure segments. In this paper, a high-resolution time-frequency (TF) representation called Synchrosqueezing Transform (SST) is used to detect epileptic seizures. Two different EEG data sets, the IKCU data set we collected, and the publicly available CHB-MIT data set are analyzed to test the performance of the proposed model in seizure detection. The SST representations of seizure and nonseizure (pre-seizure or inter-seizure) EEG segments of epilepsy patients are calculated. Various features like higher-order joint TF (HOJ-TF) moments and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based features are calculated using the SST representation. By using single and ensemble machine learning methods such as k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Boosted Trees (BT), and Subspace kNN (S-kNN), EEG features are classified. The proposed SST-based approach achieved 95.1% ACC, 96.87% PRE, 95.54% REC values for the IKCU data set, and 95.13% ACC, 93.37% PRE, 90.30% REC values for the CHB-MIT data set in seizure detection. Results show that the proposed SST-based method utilizing novel TF features outperforms the short-time Fourier transform (STFT)-based approach, providing over 95% accuracy for most cases, and compares well with the existing methods.

J	van Bree, S; Sohoglu, E; Davis, MH; Zoefel, B				van Bree, Sander; Sohoglu, Ediz; Davis, Matthew H.; Zoefel, Benedikt			Sustained neural rhythms reveal endogenous oscillations supporting speech perception	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; LOCAL ENTRAINMENT; EEG; RESPONSES; ALPHA; MEG; INFORMATION	Rhythmic sensory or electrical stimulation will produce rhythmic brain responses. These rhythmic responses are often interpreted as endogenous neural oscillations aligned (or "entrained") to the stimulus rhythm. However, stimulus-aligned brain responses can also be explained as a sequence of evoked responses, which only appear regular due to the rhythmicity of the stimulus, without necessarily involving underlying neural oscillations. To distinguish evoked responses from true oscillatory activity, we tested whether rhythmic stimulation produces oscillatory responses which continue after the end of the stimulus. Such sustained effects provide evidence for true involvement of neural oscillations. In Experiment 1, we found that rhythmic intelligible, but not unintelligible speech produces oscillatory responses in magnetoencephalography (MEG) which outlast the stimulus at parietal sensors. In Experiment 2, we found that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) leads to rhythmic fluctuations in speech perception outcomes after the end of electrical stimulation. We further report that the phase relation between electroencephalography (EEG) responses and rhythmic intelligible speech can predict the tACS phase that leads to most accurate speech perception. Together, we provide fundamental results for several lines of research-including neural entrainment and tACS-and reveal endogenous neural oscillations as a key underlying principle for speech perception.

However, existing decoding models are built under the attended state while subjects perform motion tasks. In practice, people are often distracted by other tasks or environmental factors, which may impair decoding performance. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical decoding model of human upper limb motion intention from EEG signals based on attention state estimation. The proposed decoding model includes two components. First, the attention state detection (ASD) component estimates the attention state during the upper limb movement. Next, the motion intention recognition (MIR) component decodes the motion intention by using the decoding models built under the attended and distracted states. The experimental results show that the proposed hierarchical decoding model performs well under the attended and distracted states. This work can advance the application of human movement intention decoding and provides new insights into the study of brain-machine interfaces.

J	Harpale, V; Bairagi, V				Harpale, Varsha; Bairagi, Vinayak			An adaptive method for feature selection and extraction for classification of epileptic EEG signal in significant states	JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Epilepsy; Fuzzy inference engine; Pattern adapted wavelet transform (PAWT)		Electroencephalography (EEG) is a measurement tool to measure the electrical activity of brain observed due to chemical variation in brain. The EEG analysis has important role in feature extraction and classification methods for detecting and predicting various brain diseases. Epilepsy is a major disease characterized by seizures and observed due to sudden abnormal electrical discharges in the brain. Mostly the research is carried out to classify the normal EEG signal from epileptic EEG signal. The objective of the paper is to identify pre-seizure state and seizure state of EEG signal using time and frequency features. Classifying these states of EEG signal using fuzzy classifier helps in predicting seizures. The methodology uses hypothetical testing to refine feature selection and pattern adapted wavelet transform to improve classification. The appropriate feature selection reduces computational complexity of the classifier. The artifacts are removed from the EEG signal using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The CHB-MIT EEG scalp dataset from Children's Hospital, Boston is used for experimentation. The result shows classification accuracy of 96.48 %, True Positive Rate 96.52% and False Positive Rate 0.352 for seizure detection and 96.02% accuracy for Pre-seizure state detection with 13-110 s earlier than the onset seizures.

J	Lerga, J; Saulig, N; Stankovic, L; Sersic, D				Lerga, Jonatan; Saulig, Nicoletta; Stankovic, Ljubisa; Sersic, Damir			Rule-Based EEG Classifier Utilizing Local Entropy of Time-Frequency Distributions	MATHEMATICS			English	Article						R&#233; nyi entropy; short-term R&#233; nyi entropy; instantaneous frequency (IF) estimation; EEG signals; time&#8211; frequency signal analysis		Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are known to contain signatures of stimuli that induce brain activities. However, detecting these signatures to classify captured EEG waveforms is one of the most challenging tasks of EEG analysis. This paper proposes a novel time-frequency-based method for EEG analysis and characterization implemented in a computer-aided decision-support system that can be used to assist medical experts in interpreting EEG patterns. The computerized method utilizes EEG spectral non-stationarity, which is clearly revealed in the time-frequency distributions (TFDs) of multicomponent signals. The proposed algorithm, which is based on the modification of the Renyi entropy, called local or short-term Renyi entropy (STRE), was upgraded with a blind component separation procedure and instantaneous frequency (IF) estimation. The method was applied to EEGs of both forward and backward movements of the left and right hands, as well as to EEGs of imagined hand movements, which were captured by a 19-channel EEG recording system. The obtained results show that in a given virtual instrument, the proposed methods efficiently distinguish between real and imagined limb movements by considering their signatures in terms of the dominant EEG component's IFs at the specified subset of EEG channels (namely, F3, F4, F7, F8, T3, and T4). Furthermore, computing the number of EEG signal components, their extraction, and IF estimation provide important information that shows potential to enhance existing clinical diagnostic techniques for detecting the intensity, location, and type of brain function abnormalities in patients with neurological motor control disorders.

J	Kipinski, L; Kordecki, W				Kipinski, Lech; Kordecki, Wojciech			Time-series analysis of trial-to-trial variability of MEG power spectrum during rest state, unattended listening, and frequency-modulated tones classification	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography (MEG); Event-related responses; Frequency-modulated tones; Stochastic process; Nonstationarity; Trial-to-trial variability; Spectrum; Tests for stationarity; ARMA model	BRAIN RESPONSES; UNIT-ROOT; STATIONARITY; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; ESTIMATOR; EEG/MEG	Background: The nonstationarity of EEG/MEG signals is important for understanding the functioning of the human brain. From our previous research we know that short, 250-500-ms MEG signals are variancenonstationary. The covariance of a stochastic process is mathematically associated with its spectral density, therefore we investigate how the spectrum of such nonstationary signals varies in time. New method: We analyse data from 148-channel MEG, which represent rest state, unattended listening, and frequency-modulated tones classification. We transform short-time MEG signals to the frequency domain and for the dominant frequencies of 8-12 Hz we prepare the time series representing their trial-to-trial variability. Then, we test them for level- and trend-stationarity, unit root, heteroscedasticity, and gaussianity, and propose ARMAmodelling for their description. Results: The analysed time series have weak-stationarity properties independently of the functional state of the brain and channel localization. Only a small percentage of them, mostly related to the cognitive task, reveal nonstationarity. The obtained mathematical models show that the spectral density of the analysed signals depends on only two to three previous trials. Comparison with existing methods: The presented method has limitations related to FFT resolution and univariate models, but it is computationally simple and allows obtaining a low-complex stochastic model of the EEG/MEG spectrum variability. Conclusions: Although physiological short-time MEG signals are in principle nonstationary in time, their power spectrum at the dominant (alpha) frequencies varies as a weakly stationary process. The proposed methodology has possible applications in prediction of EEG/MEG spectral properties in theoretical and clinical neuroscience.

Here, we address the possibility that two types of slow waves co-exist in humans. Thirty young and 29 older adults underwent a night of polysomnographic recordings. Using the transition frequency, slow waves with a slow transition (slow switchers) and those with a fast transition (fast switchers) were discovered. Slow switchers had a high electroencephalography (EEG) connectivity along their depolarization transition while fast switchers had a lower connectivity dynamics and dissipated faster during the night. Aging was associated with lower temporal dissipation of sleep pressure in slow and fast switchers and lower EEG connectivity at the microscale of the oscillations, suggesting a decreased flexibility in the connectivity network of older individuals. Our findings show that two different types of slow waves with possible distinct underlying functions coexist in the slow wave spectrum.

A SG is focused on improving logical thinking, specifically on cognitive training of students in the field of basic logic gates, and we summarize SG description, design, and development. A method based on various signal processing techniques for evaluating electroencephalographic (EEG) data was implemented in the MATLAB. This assessment was based on the analysis of the spectrogram of particular brain activity. Changes in brain activity power at a characteristic frequency band during the gameplay were calculated from the spectrogram. The EEG of 21 respondents was measured. Based on the results, the respondents can be divided into three groups according to specific EEG activity changes during the gameplay compared to a relaxed state.

We tested the hypothesis that N-Pep-12 influences quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) parameters in patients with subacute to chronic supratentorial ischemic lesions. Methods We performed secondary data analysis on an exploratory clinical trial (ISRCTN10702895), assessing the efficacy and safety of 90 days of once-daily treatment with 90 mg N-Pep-12 on neurocognitive function and neurorecovery outcome in patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment against a control group. All participants performed two 32-channel QEEG in resting and active states at baseline (30-120 days after stroke) and 90 days later. Power spectral density on the alpha, beta, theta, delta frequency bands, delta/alpha power ratio (DAR), and (delta+theta)/(alpha+beta) ratio (DTABR) were computed and compared across study groups using means comparison and descriptive methods. Secondarily, associations between QEEG parameters and available neuropsychological tests were explored. Results Our analysis showed a statistically significant main effect of EEG segments (p<0.001) in alpha, beta, delta, theta, DA, and DTAB power spectral density. An interaction effect between EEG segments and time was noticed in the alpha power. There was a significant difference in theta spectral power between patients with N-Pep-12 supplementation versus placebo at 0.05 alpha level (p=0.023), independent of time points. Conclusion A 90-day, 90 mg daily administration of N-Pep-12 had significant impact on some QEEG indicators in patients after supratentorial ischemic stroke, confirming possible enhancement of post-stroke neurorecovery. Further research is needed to consolidate our findings.

J	Mostame, P; Sadaghiani, S				Mostame, Parham; Sadaghiani, Sepideh			Oscillation-Based Connectivity Architecture Is Dominated by an Intrinsic Spatial Organization, Not Cognitive State or Frequency	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						amplitude coupling; electrocorticography; functional connectivity; intrinsic; oscillations; phase coupling	BAND PHASE SYNCHRONY; BRAIN NETWORKS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; TIME-LAG; ALPHA; MEG; INTEGRATION; EEG; EMERGENCE	Functional connectivity of neural oscillations (oscillation-based FC) is thought to afford dynamic information exchange across task-relevant neural ensembles. Although oscillation-based FC is dassically defined relative to a prestimulus baseline, giving rise to rapid, context-dependent changes in individual connections, studies of distributed spatial patterns show that oscillation-based FC is omnipresent, occurring even in the absence of explicit cognitive demands. Thus, the issue of whether oscillation-based PC is primarily shaped by cognitive state or is intrinsic in nature remains open. Accordingly, we sought to reconcile these observations by interrogating the ECoG recordings of 18 presurgical human patients (8 females) for state dependence of oscillation-based FC in five canonical frequency bands across an array of six task states. FC analysis of phase and amplitude coupling revealed a highly similar, largely state-invariant (i.e., intrinsic) spatial component across cognitive states. This spatial organization was shared across all frequency bands. Crucially, however, each band also exhibited temporally independent FC dynamics capable of supporting frequency-specific information exchange. In conclusion, the spatial organization of oscillation-based FC is largely stable over cognitive states (i.e., primarily intrinsic in nature) and shared across frequency bands. Together, our findings converge with previous observations of spatially invariant patterns of FC derived from extremely slow and aperiodic fluctuations in fMRI signals. Our observations indicate that "background" FC should be accounted for in conceptual frameworks of oscillation-based FC targeting task-related changes.

L.; Dalic, Linda J.; Pedersen, Mangor; Jackson, Graeme			Automatic detection of generalized paroxysmal fast activity in interictal EEG using time-frequency analysis	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; fMRI; Epilepsy; Automatic spike detection; Interictal epileptiform discharge; Time-frequency analysis; Lennox-gastaut syndrome; Generalized paroxysmal fast activity; General linear modelling	LENNOX-GASTAUT SYNDROME; SPIKE DETECTION; EPILEPTIC ACTIVITY; CLASSIFICATION; LOCALIZATION; RECOGNITION	Objective: Markup of generalized interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) on EEG is an important step in the diagnosis and characterization of epilepsy. However, manual EEG markup is a time-consuming, subjective, and the specialized task where the human reviewer needs to visually inspect a large amount of data to facilitate accurate clinical decisions. In this study, we aimed to develop a framework for automated detection of generalized paroxysmal fast activity (GPFA), a generalized IED seen in scalp EEG recordings of patients with the severe epilepsy of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Methods: We studied 13 children with LGS who had GPFA events in their interictal EEG recordings. Timefrequency information derived from manually marked IEDs across multiple EEG channels was used to automatically detect similar events in each patient's interictal EEG. We validated true positives and false positives of the proposed spike detection approach using both standalone scalp EEG and simultaneous EEG-functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) recordings. Results: GPFA events displayed a consistent low-high frequency arrangement in the time-frequency domain. This 'bimodal' spectral feature was most prominent over frontal EEG channels. Our automatic detection approach using this feature identified EEG events with similar time-frequency properties to the manually marked GPFAs. Brain maps of EEG-fMRI signal change during these automatically detected IEDs were comparable to the EEGfMRI brain maps derived from manual IED markup. Conclusion: GPFA events have a characteristic bimodal time-frequency feature that can be automatically detected from scalp EEG recordings in patients with LGS. The validity of this time-frequency feature is demonstrated by EEG-fMRI analysis of automatically detected events, which recapitulates the brain maps we have previously shown to underlie generalized IEDs in LGS. Significance: This study provides a novel methodology that enables a fast, automated, and objective inspection of generalized IEDs in LGS. The proposed framework may be extendable to a wider range of epilepsy syndromes in which monitoring the burden of epileptic activity can aid clinical decision-making and faster assessment of treatment response and estimation of future seizure risk.

J	Fan, YY; Dong, LP; Liu, XY; Wang, H; Liu, YH				Fan, Yuying; Dong, Liping; Liu, Xueyan; Wang, Hua; Liu, Yunhui			Recent advances in the noninvasive detection of high-frequency oscillations in the human brain	REVIEWS IN THE NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article						electroencephalography; high-frequency brain oscillations; magnetoencephalography; noninvasive		In recent decades, a significant body of evidence based on invasive clinical research has showed that highfrequency oscillations (HFOs) are a promising biomarker for localization of the seizure onset zone (SOZ), and therefore, have the potential to improve postsurgical outcomes in patients with epilepsy. Emerging clinical literature has demonstrated that HFOs can be recorded noninvasively using methods such as scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Not only are HFOs considered to be a useful biomarker of the SOZ, they also have the potential to gauge disease severity, monitor treatment, and evaluate prognostic outcomes. In this article, we review recent clinical research on noninvasively detected HFOs in the human brain, with a focus on epilepsy. Noninvasively detected scalp HFOs have been investigated in various types of epilepsy. HFOs have also been studied noninvasively in other pathologic brain disorders, such as migraine and autism. Herein, we discuss the challenges reported in noninvasive HFO studies, including the scarcity of MEG and high-density EEG equipment in clinical settings, low signal-to-noise ratio, lack of clinically approved automated detection methods, and the difficulty in differentiating between physiologic and pathologic HFOs. Additional studies on noninvasive recording methods for HFOs are needed, especially prospective multicenter studies. Further research is fundamental, and extensive work is needed before HFOs can routinely be assessed in clinical settings; however, the future appears promising.

Compared with the multi-channel automatic sleep staging system, the single-channel EEG signal contains less information, and the traditional single analysis domain feature parameter extraction algorithm cannot meet the requirement of sleep stage classification accuracy. To solve this problem, we propose an automatic sleep staging method based on the combination of time-domain and frequency-domain features based on single-channel EEG signals. Empirical mode decomposition is used to decompose EEG signals in the time domain to obtain the decomposed signals at different time scales. Multiple local features are extracted from each decomposed signal. The frequency-domain features of EEG signals are obtained by using the frequency domain decomposition of EEG signals in various rhythms. The time-domain and frequency-domain decomposition features are combined into eigenvectors and selected for sleep staging. The experimental results show that the sleep staging method proposed in this paper with time-frequency domain features of single-cyhannel EEG signals can approach the accuracy of sleep staging of multi-channel signals on the same data set, and superior to the sleep staging method with the same single-channel EEG signals.

The majority of the proposed approaches assume stationarity in brain activity and disregard the systematic timing organization among brain regions during cognitive tasks. In this study, we propose a novel cognitive activity recognition method that captures the activity-specific timing parameters from training data that elicits maximal average short-lived pairwise synchronization between electroencephalography signals. We evaluated the characterization power of the activity-specific timing parameter triplets in a motor imagery activity recognition framework. The activity-specific timing parameter triplets consist of latency of the maximally synchronized signal segments from activity onset Delta t, the time lag between maximally synchronized signal segments t, and the duration of the maximally synchronized signal segments w. We used cosine-based similarity, wavelet bi-coherence, phase-locking value, phase coherence value, linearized mutual information, and cross-correntropy to calculate the channel synchronizations at the specific timing parameters. Recognition performances as well as statistical analyses on both BCI Competition-III dataset IVa and PhysioNet Motor Movement/Imagery dataset, indicate that the interchannel short-lived synchronization calculated using activity-specific timing parameter triplets elicit significantly distinct synchronization profiles for different motor imagery tasks and can thus reliably be used for cognitive task recognition purposes.

J	Jenson, D				Jenson, David			Audiovisual incongruence differentially impacts left and right hemisphere sensorimotor oscillations: Potential applications to production	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MU RHYTHM DYNAMICS; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; VISUAL SPEECH; BAND OSCILLATIONS; HEARING LIPS; EEG-DATA; INTEGRATION; MOTOR; CORTEX; ALPHA	Speech production gives rise to distinct auditory and somatosensory feedback signals which are dynamically integrated to enable online monitoring and error correction, though it remains unclear how the sensorimotor system supports the integration of these multimodal signals. Capitalizing on the parity of sensorimotor processes supporting perception and production, the current study employed the McGurk paradigm to induce multimodal sensory congruence/incongruence. EEG data from a cohort of 39 typical speakers were decomposed with independent component analysis to identify bilateral mu rhythms; indices of sensorimotor activity. Subsequent time-frequency analyses revealed bilateral patterns of event related desynchronization (ERD) across alpha and beta frequency ranges over the time course of perceptual events. Right mu activity was characterized by reduced ERD during all cases of audiovisual incongruence, while left mu activity was attenuated and protracted in McGurk trials eliciting sensory fusion. Results were interpreted to suggest distinct hemispheric contributions, with right hemisphere mu activity supporting a coarse incongruence detection process and left hemisphere mu activity reflecting a more granular level of analysis including phonological identification and incongruence resolution.

Neurophysiological signals are known to track the amplitude envelope of adult-directed speech (ADS), particularly in the theta-band. Acoustic analysis of infant-directed speech (IDS) has revealed significantly greater modulation energy than ADS in an amplitude-modulation (AM) band centred on similar to 2 Hz. Accordingly, cortical tracking of IDS by delta-band neural signals may be key to language acquisition. Speech also contains acoustic information within its higher-frequency bands (beta, gamma). Adult EEG and MEG studies reveal an oscillatory hierarchy, whereby low-frequency (delta, theta) neural phase dynamics temporally organize the amplitude of high-frequency signals (phase amplitude coupling, PAC). Whilst consensus is growing around the role of PAC in the matured adult brain, its role in the development of speech processing is unexplored. Here, we examined the presence and maturation of low-frequency (< 12 Hz) cortical speech tracking in infants by recording EEG longitudinally from 60 participants when aged 4-, 7- and 11-months as they listened to nursery rhymes. After establishing stimulus-related neural signals in delta and theta, cortical tracking at each age was assessed in the delta, theta and alpha [control] bands using a multivariate temporal response function (mTRF) method. Delta-beta, delta-gamma, theta-beta and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) was also assessed. Significant delta and theta but not alpha tracking was found. Significant PAC was present at all ages, with both delta and theta-driven coupling observed.

Here we demonstrate that a quantification of the dynamics of functional connectivity (FC) as measured using electroencephalography (EEG) offers an alternative means of observing an individual's brain functional organization. Using data from both healthy individuals as well as from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 103 healthy individuals, n = 57 PD patients), we show that "dynamic FC" (DFC) profiles can be used to identify individuals in a large group. Furthermore, we show that DFC profiles predict gender and exhibit characteristics shared both among individuals as well as between both hemispheres. Furthermore, DFC profile characteristics are frequency band specific, indicating that they reflect distinct processes in the brain. Our empirically derived method of DFC demonstrates the potential of studying the dynamics of the functional organization of the brain using EEG.

Low-Frequency Entrainment to Visual Motion Underlies Sign Language Comprehension	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Videos; Assistive technologies; Gesture recognition; Visualization; Electrodes; Electroencephalography; Coherence; EEG; sign language; perceptual sampling; vision; language comprehension	SPEECH; OSCILLATIONS	When people listen to speech, neural activity tracks the entropy fluctuation in the acoustic envelope of the signal. This signal-based entrainment has been shown to be the basis of speech parsing and comprehension. In this electroencephalography (EEG) study, we compute sign language users' cortical tracking of changes in visual dynamics of the communicative signal in the time-direct videos of sign language, and their time-reversed counterparts, and assess the relative contribution of response frequencies between.2 and 12.4 Hz to comprehension using a machine learning approach to brain state classification. Lower frequencies of EEG response (.2-4 Hz) yield 100% classification accuracy, while information about cortical tracking of the visual envelope in higher frequencies is less informative. This suggests that signers rely on lower visual frequency data, such as envelope of visual signal, for sign language comprehension. In the context of real-time language processing, given the speed of comprehension responses, this suggests that fluent signers employ a predictive processing heuristic based on sign language knowledge.

Due to the non-invasive nature and high temporal resolution of electroencephalography (EEG), it is widely used to evaluate real-time cortical activity. In this study, we investigated the stroke-related EEG biomarkers and developed a predictive model for quantifying the structural brain damage in a focal cerebral ischaemic rat model. We enrolled 31 male Sprague-Dawley rats and randomly assigned them to mild stroke, moderate stroke, severe stroke, and control groups. We induced photothrombotic stroke targeting the right auditory cortex. We then acquired EEG signal responses to sound stimuli (frequency linearly increasing from 8 to 12 kHz with 750 ms duration). Power spectral analysis revealed a significant correlation of the relative powers of alpha, theta, delta, delta/alpha ratio, and (delta+theta)/(alpha+beta) ratio with the stroke lesion volume. The auditory evoked potential analysis revealed a significant association of amplitude and latency with stroke lesion volume. Finally, we developed a multiple regression model combining EEG predictors for quantifying the ischaemic lesion (R-2=0.938, p value<0.001). These findings demonstrate the potential application of EEG as a valid modality for monitoring the brain after a stroke.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is the primary tool in the observation of epilepsy. The detection and prediction of seizures in EEG signals require multi-domain analysis, one of which is the time domain combined with other approaches for feature extraction. In this study, a method for detecting seizures in epileptic EEG is proposed using analysis of the distribution of the signal spectrum in the time range t. The EEG signal, which includes normal, inter-ictal, and ictal, is transformed into the time-frequency domain using the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). To find the highest detection accuracy, simulations were carried out on varying window length, overlap, and FFT points. The frequency distribution and first-order statistics were then calculated as feature vectors for the classification process. A support vector machine was employed to evaluate the proposed method. The simulation results showed the highest accuracy of 92.3% using 25-20-512 STFT and quadratic SVM. The proposed method in this study is expected to be a basis for detecting and predicting seizures in long-term EEG recordings or real-time EEG monitoring of epilepsy patients.

Growing evidence suggests that electroencephalography (EEG) electrode (sensor) potential time series (PTS) of slow cortical potentials (SCPs) hold motor neural correlates that can be used for motion trajectory prediction, commonly by multiple linear regression (mLR). It is not yet known whether arm-joint trajectories can be reliably decoded from current sources, computed from sensor data, from which brain areas they can be decoded and using which neural features. Approach. In this study, the PTS of 44 sensors were fed into sLORETA source localization software to compute current source activity in 30 regions of interest (ROIs) found in a recent meta-analysis to be engaged in action execution, motor imagery and motor preparation. The current sources PTS and band-power time series (BTS) in several frequency bands and time lags were used to predict actual and imagined trajectories in 3D space of the three velocity components of the hand, elbow and shoulder of nine subjects using an mLR model. Main results. For all arm joints and movement types, current source SCPs PTS contributed most to trajectory reconstruction with time lags 150, 116 and 84 ms providing the highest contribution, and current source BTS in any of the tested frequency bands was not informative. Person's correlation coefficient (r) averaged across movement types, arm joints and velocity components using source data was slightly lower than using sensor data (r = 0.25 and r = 0.28, respectively). For each ROI, the three current source dipoles had different contribution to the reconstruction of each of the three velocity components. Significance. Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting of actual and imagined 3D trajectories of all arm joints from current sources, computed from scalp EEG. These findings may be used by developers of a future BCI as a validated set of contributing ROIs.

However, so far there has been limited research into the spatial and temporal characteristics of hf-tRNS-induced facilitatory effects. In the present study, electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of cortical activity modulated by offline hf-tRNS on performance on a motion direction discrimination task. We used EEG to measure the amplitude of motion-related VEPs over the parieto-occipital cortex, as well as oscillatory power spectral density (PSD) at rest. A time-frequency decomposition analysis was also performed to investigate the shift in event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) in response to the motion stimuli between the pre- and post-stimulation period. The results showed that the accuracy of the motion direction discrimination task was not modulated by offline hf-tRNS. Although the motion task was able to elicit motion-dependent VEP components (P1, N2, and P2), none of them showed any significant change between pre- and post-stimulation. We also found a time-dependent increase of the PSD in alpha and beta bands regardless of the stimulation protocol. Finally, time-frequency analysis showed a modulation of ERSP power in the hf-tRNS condition for gamma activity when compared to pre-stimulation periods and Sham stimulation. Overall, these results show that offline hf-tRNS may induce moderate aftereffects in brain oscillatory activity.

The target specification was a system with 19 EEG channels and data stored onto the smartphone via a Wi-Fi connection. The hardware was developed using three ADS1299 integrated circuits, and the game engine, Unity, was used to develop the smartphone app. An evaluation of the system was conducted using recordings of alpha waves during periods of eye closure in participants (Bland-Altman statistical comparison with a clinical grade EEG system). The smartphone was also used to deliver time-locked auditory stimuli using an oddball paradigm to evaluate the ability of the developed system to acquire event related potentials (ERP) during sitting and walking. No significant differences were found for the alpha wave peak amplitude, frequency and area under the curve for the intra-system (two consecutive periods of alpha waves) or inter-system (developed smartphone-based EEG system versus FDA-approved system) comparisons. ERP results showed the peak amplitude of the auditory P300 component to deviant tones was significantly higher when compared to standard tones for sitting and walking activities. It is envisaged that our general-purpose EEG system will encourage other researchers to design and build their own specific versions rather than being limited by the fixed features of commercial products.

Prediction of cortical theta oscillations in humans for phase-locked visual stimulation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Phase locked; EEG; Online processing; Visual stimulation	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; ALPHA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; RHYTHM; CA1	Background: The timing of an event within an oscillatory phase is considered to be one of the key strategies used by the brain to code and process neural information. Whereas existing methods of studying this phenomenon are chiefly based on retrospective analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) data, we now present a method to study it prospectively. New method: We present a system that allows for the delivery of visual stimuli at a specific phase of the cortical theta oscillation by fitting a sine to raw surface EEG data to estimate and predict the phase. One noteworthy feature of the method is that it can minimize potentially confounding effects of previous trials by using only a short sequence of past data. Results: In a trial with 10 human participants we achieved a significant phase locking with an inter-trial phase coherence of 0.39. We demonstrated successful phase locking on synthetic signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of less than - 20 dB. Comparison with existing method(s): We compared the new method to an autoregressive method published in the literature and found the new method was superior in mean phase offset, circular standard deviation, and prediction latency. Conclusions: By fitting sine waves to raw EEG traces, we locked visual stimuli to arbitrary phases within the theta oscillatory cycle of healthy humans.

A spectral EEG analysis	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						sleep paralysis; false awakenings; REM sleep	NARCOLEPSY; CATAPLEXY	Study Objectives: To determine the polysomnography characteristics during sleep paralysis, false awakenings, and lucid dreaming (which are states intermediate to rapid eye movement [REM] sleep and wake but exceptionally observed in sleep laboratory). Methods: In 5 participants, we captured 5 episodes of sleep paralysis (2 time marked with the ocular left-right-left-right code normally used to signal lucid dreaming, 1 time marked by an external noise, and 2 retrospectively reported) and 2 episodes of false awakening. The sleep coding (using 3-second mini-epochs) and spectral electroencephalography analysis were compared during these episodes and normal REM sleep as well as wakefulness in the same 4 of 5 participants and vs lucid REM sleep in 4 other patients with narcolepsy. Results: During episodes of sleep paralysis, 70.8% of mini-epochs contained theta electroencephalography rhythm (vs 89.7% in REM sleep and 21.2% in wakefulness), 93.8% contained chin muscle atonia (vs 89.7% in REM sleep and 33.3% in wakefulness), and 6.9% contained rapid eye movements (vs 11.9% in REM sleep and 8.1% in wakefulness). The electroencephalography spectrum during sleep paralysis was intermediate between wakefulness and REM sleep in the alpha, theta, and delta frequencies, whereas the beta frequencies were not different between sleep paralysis and normal REM sleep. The power spectrum during false awakening followed the same profile as in sleep paralysis. Conclusions: The predominant theta electroencephalography rhythm during sleep paralysis and false awakenings (with rare and lower alpha rhythm) suggests that the brain during sleep paralysis is not in an awake but in a dreaming state.

J	Huang, T; Ding, HM; Tseng, YL				Huang, Ting; Ding, Hsien-Ming; Tseng, Yi-Li			Event-Related Phase-Amplitude Coupling During Working Memory of Musical Chords	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Couplings; Task analysis; Picture archiving and communication systems; Music; Encoding; Electroencephalography; Oscillators; EEG; event-related phase-amplitude coupling; working memory; musical chords	GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; FRONTAL THETA; ALPHA-GAMMA; HUMAN EEG; FREQUENCY; SYNCHRONIZATION; DYNAMICS; CORTEX	Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is a well-established concept for evaluating the strength of memory coding within brain regions, and has been shown to possess the characteristic of presenting memory mechanisms. It has been demonstrated that oscillations of theta and gamma brain waves can represent the neural coding structure of memory retrieval. However, most previous studies have presented PAC-related memory mechanisms with visual modalities, and little is known about the influence of auditory stimuli. In this study, 18 participants were recruited and 36-channels electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded while they were performing an n-back auditory working memory task. There were three experimental conditions with different levels of working memory load. Event-related phase-amplitude coupling (ERPAC) with the advantage of better temporal resolution was used to evaluate the coupling phenomenon from the reconstructed dipole brain sources. We primarily focused on independent components from the frontal and parietal regions, which were reported to be related to memory mechanisms. The results suggest that significant ERPAC was observed in both the frontal and parietal regions. In addition to the coupling between theta (4-7 Hz) and low gamma (30-40 Hz) frequency bands, pronounced high beta oscillations (20-30 Hz) were also observed to be modulated by the phases of theta oscillations. These findings suggest the existence of phase-amplitude coupling in the neocortex during auditory working memory, and provide a highly resolved timeline to evaluate brain dynamics. In addition, the ERPAC results also support the involvement of theta-gamma and theta-beta neural coding mechanisms in cognitive and memory tasks. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the existence of ERPAC within the frontal and parietal regions during an auditory working memory task using complex chords as stimuli, and prompt the use of complex stimuli in studies that are closer to the real-life applications of cognitive evaluations, mental treatments, and brain-computer interfaces.

The psychopathological and neurophysiological aspects of the mechanism underlying the comorbidity of both disorders have been investigated, but the pathophysiological aspects remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the neurophysiological characteristics of ADHD with those of TD using resting-state electroencephalography and exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA) analysis. Methods: We performed eLORETA analysis based on the resting-state scalp-recorded electrical potential distribution in 34 children with ADHD and 21 age-matched children with TD. Between-group differences in electroencephalography (EEG) current source density in delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands were investigated in each cortical region. Results: Compared with the TD group, the ADHD group showed significantly increased theta activity in the frontal region (superior frontal gyrus, t = 3.37, p < 0.05; medial frontal gyrus, t = 3.35, p < 0.05). In contrast, children with TD showed decreased posterior alpha activity than those with ADHD (precuneus, t= -3.40, p < 0.05; posterior cingulate gyrus, t = -3.38, p < 0.05). These findings were only significant when the eyes were closed. : Increased theta activity in the frontal region is a neurophysiological marker that can distinguish ADHD from TD. Also, reduced posterior alpha activity might represent aberrant inhibitory control. Further research needs to confirm these characteristics by simultaneously measuring EEG-functional magnetic resonance imaging.

Stimulation artifact source separation (SASS) for assessing electric brain oscillations during transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Brain oscillations; Single-trial; Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS); Stimulation artifact; Electroencephalography (EEG)		Brain oscillations, e.g. measured by electro- or magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG), are causally linked to brain functions that are fundamental for perception, cognition and learning. Recent advances in neurotechnology pro vide means to non-invasively target these oscillations using frequency-tuned amplitude-modulated transcranial alternating current stimulation (AM-tACS). However, online adaptation of stimulation parameters to ongoing brain oscillations remains an unsolved problem due to stimulation artifacts that impede such adaptation, particularly at the target frequency. Here, we introduce a real-time compatible artifact rejection algorithm (Stimulation Artifact Source Separation, SASS) that overcomes this limitation. SASS is a spatial filter (linear projection) removing EEG signal components that are maximally different in the presence versus absence of stimulation. This enables the reliable removal of stimulation-specific signal components, while leaving physiological signal components unaffected. For validation of SASS, we evoked brain activity with known phase and amplitude using 10 Hz visual flickers across 7 healthy human volunteers. 64-channel EEG was recorded during and in absence of 10 Hz AM-tACS targeting the visual cortex. Phase differences between AM-tACS and the visual stimuli were randomized, so that steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) were phase-locked to the visual stimuli but not to the AM-tACS signal. For validation, distributions of single-trial amplitude and phase of EEG signals recorded during and in absence of AM-tACS were compared for each participant. When no artifact rejection method was applied, AM-tACS stimulation artifacts impeded assessment of single-trial SSVEP amplitude and phase. Using SASS, amplitude and phase of single trials recorded during and in absence of AM-tACS were comparable. These results indicate that SASS can be used to establish adaptive (closed-loop) AM-tACS, a potentially powerful tool to target various brain functions, and to investigate how AM-tACS interacts with electric brain oscillations.

Illusions pertaining to a body, such as the rubber hand illusion (RHI), can be easily conducted in VR settings, and some phenomena, such as full-body illusions, are only realized in virtual environments. However, the multisensory-integration process in VR is not yet fully understood. Thus, it remains to be clarified if specific phenomena that occur under VR settings manifest in real life as well. One useful investigative approach is measuring brain activities during a psychological experiment. Electroencephalography (EEG) oscillatory activities provide insight into the human multisensory integration process. Nevertheless, EEG data can be vulnerable to VR noise, which causes measurement and analytical difficulties for EEG data recorded in VR environments. Here, we achieve an experimental RHI setting using a head-mounted display that provides a VR visual space and VR dummy hand along with EEG measurements. We compared EEG data collected in both real and VR environments and observed the gamma and theta band oscillatory activities. Ultimately, we observed statistically significant differences between congruent (RHI) and incongruent (not RHI) conditions in the real environment, which is consistent with previous studies. Differences in the VR condition were observed only on the late theta band oscillation, suggesting that the VR setting itself altered the perceptual and sensory integration mechanisms. Thus, we must model this difference between real and VR settings whenever we use VR to investigate our bodily self-perception.

However, long-time attention to repetitive visual stimuli could cause physical and psychological fatigue, resulting in weaker reliable response and stronger noise interference, which exacerbates the difficulty of Visual Evoked Potentials EEG decoding. In this state, subjects' attention could not be concentrated enough and the frequency response of their brains becomes less reliable. To solve these problems, we propose an attention-based parallel multiscale convolutional neural network (AMS-CNN). Specifically, the AMS-CNN first extract robust temporal representations via two parallel convolutional layers with small and large temporal filters respectively. Then, we employ two sequential convolution blocks for spatial fusion and temporal fusion to extract advanced feature representations. Further, we use attention mechanism to weight the features at different moments according to the output-related interest. Finally, we employ a full connected layer with softmax activation function for classification. Two fatigue datasets collected from our lab are implemented to validate the superior classification performance of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Analysis reveals the competitiveness of multiscale convolution and attention mechanism. These results suggest that the proposed framework is a promising solution to improving the decoding performance of Visual Evoked Potential BCIs.

However, gamma band activity shares frequency range with unwanted artefacts from muscular activity. New Method: We developed a novel approach to remove muscle artefacts from neurophysiological data. We reanalysed existing EEG data that were decomposed by a blind source separation method (independent component analysis, ICA), which helped to better spatially and temporally separate single muscle spikes. We then applied an adapting algorithm that detects these singled-out muscle spikes. Results: We obtained data almost free from muscle artefacts; we needed to remove significantly fewer artefact components from the ICA and we included more trials for the statistical analysis compared to standard ICA artefact removal. All pain-related cortical effects in the gamma band have been preserved, which underlines the high efficacy and precision of this algorithm. Conclusions: Our results show a significant improvement of data quality by preserving task-relevant gamma oscillations of presumed cortical origin. We were able to precisely detect, gauge, and carve out single muscle spikes from the time course of neurophysiological measures without perturbing cortical gamma. We advocate the application of the tool for studies investigating gamma activity that contain a rather low number of trials, as well as for data that are highly contaminated with muscle artefacts. This validation of our tool allows for the application on event-free continuous EEG, for which the artefact removal is more challenging.

Alterations in coordinated EEG activity precede the development of seizures in comatose children	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Coma; Critically ill children; ICU; Brain connectivity	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; ELECTROGRAPHIC STATUS EPILEPTICUS; CRITICALLY-ILL; PHASE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; STATE; CONSCIOUSNESS; CONNECTIVITY	Objective: We aimed to test the hypothesis that computational features of the first several minutes of EEG recording can be used to estimate the risk for development of acute seizures in comatose critically-ill children. Methods: In a prospective cohort of 118 comatose children, we computed features of the first five minutes of artifact-free EEG recording (spectral power, inter-regional synchronization and cross-frequency coupling) and tested if these features could help identify the 25 children who went on to develop acute symptomatic seizures during the subsequent 48 hours of cEEG monitoring. Results: Children who developed acute seizures demonstrated higher average spectral power, particularly in the theta frequency range, and distinct patterns of inter-regional connectivity, characterized by greater connectivity at delta and theta frequencies, but weaker connectivity at beta and low gamma frequencies. Subgroup analyses among the 97 children with the same baseline EEG background pattern (generalized slowing) yielded qualitatively and quantitatively similar results. Conclusions: These computational features could be applied to baseline EEG recordings to identify critically-ill children at high risk for acute symptomatic seizures. Significance: If confirmed in independent prospective cohorts, these features would merit incorporation into a decision support system in order to optimize diagnostic and therapeutic management of seizures among comatose children.

Improved epileptic seizure detection using singular spectrum empirical mode decomposition and machine learning approach	JOURNAL OF STATISTICS AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Epilepsy; Machine learning classifier; Statistics; Functional analysis; Singular spectrum empirical mode decomposition (SSEMD); Wavelet transform (WT) and ANOVA analysis	CLASSIFICATION	Electroencephalography (EEG) is multi-channel electrical signal acquiring tool used to acquire the brain signals and used in various application such as neurological disorder detection and prediction, monitoring psychological condition, emotion analysis and Brain-Computer interface (BCI). Epilepsy is a highly prevalent neurological disorder caused by the occurrence of seizures. Epilepsy is a neurological condition of the brain where some neurons change its behaviours such as hyper-activeness and channel synchronization. The EEG signals recorded from epileptic patients are analysed for monitoring and extracting behaviour of signals during onset seizures. The Time and Frequency Domain (TFD), Wavelet Transform (WT) and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) are well-proven feature extraction methods used for various applications. The objective of the paper is to propose a new effective method, Singular Spectrum Empirical Mode Decomposition (SSEMD) for effective classification of Normal and Epileptic EEG Signals. The high-performance machine learning classifiers are used for classification of EEG signal in normal and epileptic class. The performance observed with the proposed feature extraction method is 99.8 percent of detection accuracy with nearly zero false positive rates. The average dimensionality reduction of 70 percent of total feature space is observed due to the use of ANOVA.

Recently, studies have revealed that gamma-band waves of electrical brain activity, particularly 40 Hz oscillations, are closely associated with high-order cognitive functions and can activate microglia to clear amyloid-beta deposition. Here, we found that compared with sham stimulation, applying 40-Hz high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the bilateral angular gyrus in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 37) resulted in up to 8 weeks of significantly improved cognitive function. Power spectral density analysis of the resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) demonstrated that 40-Hz rTMS modulated gamma-band oscillations in the left posterior temporoparietal region. Further testing with magnetic resonance imaging and TMS-EEG revealed the following: 40-Hz rTMS 1) prevented gray matter volume loss, 2) enhanced local functional integration within bilateral angular gyrus, as well as global functional integration in bilateral angular gyrus and the left middle frontal gyrus, 3) strengthened information flow from the left posterior temporoparietal region to the frontal areas and strengthened the dynamic connectivity between anterior and posterior brain regions. These findings demonstrate that modulating gamma-band oscillations effectively improves cognitive function in patients with probable AD by promoting local, long-range, and dynamic connectivity within the brain.

In this work, the relationship between the hemodynamic response and brain oscillation activity was investigated using the concurrent recording of fNIRS and EEG during ankle joint movements. Twenty subjects participated in this experiment. The EEG was recorded using 20 electrodes and hemodynamic responses were recorded using 32 optodes positioned over the motor cortex areas. The event-related desynchronization (ERD) feature was extracted from the EEG signal in the alpha band (8-11) Hz, and the concentration change of the oxy-hemoglobin (oxyHb) was evaluated from the hemodynamics response. During the motor execution of the ankle joint movements, a decrease in the alpha (8-11) Hz amplitude (desynchronization) was found to be correlated with an increase of the oxyHb (r = -0.64061, p < 0.00001) observed on the Cz electrode and the average of the fNIRS channels (ch28, ch25, ch32, ch35) close to the foot area representation. Then, the correlated channels in both modalities were used for ankle joint movement classification. The result demonstrates that the integrated modality based on the correlated channels provides a substantial enhancement in ankle joint classification accuracy of 93.01 +/- 5.60% (p < 0.01) compared with single modality. These results highlight the potential of the bimodal fNIR-EEG approach for the development of future BCI for lower limb rehabilitation.

However, it remains unclear whether these results can be generalized to fear learning in humans. We addressed this question using intracranial electroencephalography recordings in 13 patients with epilepsy during a fear conditioning paradigm. We observed increased power and inter-regional synchronization of amygdala and mPFC in theta (4 to 8 hertz) oscillations for conditioned stimulus (CS+) versus CS-. Analysis of information flow revealed that the dorsal mPFC (dmPFC) led amygdala activity in theta oscillations. Last, a computational model showed that trial-by-trial changes in amygdala theta oscillations predicted the model-based associability (i.e., learning rate). This study provides compelling evidence that theta oscillations within and between amygdala, ventral mPFC, and dmPFC constitute a general mechanism of fear learning across species.

Although the enhanced effects of congruent audiovisual information on our affective experiences have been well documented, the role of neural oscillations in the audiovisual integration of affective signals remains unclear. First, it is unclear whether oscillatory activity changes as a function of valence. Second, the function of phase-locked and non-phase-locked power changes in audiovisual integration of affect has not yet been clearly distinguished. To fill this gap, the present study performed time-frequency analyses on EEG data acquired while participants perceived positive, neutral and negative naturalistic video and music clips. A comparison between the congruent audiovisual condition and the sum of unimodal conditions was used to identify supra-additive (Audiovisual > Visual + Auditory) or sub-additive (Audiovisual < Visual + Auditory) integration effects. The results showed that early evoked sub-additive theta and sustained induced supra-additive delta and beta activities are linked to audiovisual integration of affect regardless of affective content.

Reward Responsiveness in Suicide Attempters: An Electroencephalography/Event-Related Potential Study	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY-COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE AND NEUROIMAGING			English	Article							RISK-FACTORS; NEUROSCIENCE; BEHAVIORS; INTERVIEW; ANHEDONIA; THOUGHTS; CHILDREN	BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to objectively examine the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) subconstructs of reward anticipation and initial response to reward in adult suicide attempters, compared with nonattempters, using electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) within the context of the RDoC- recommended experimental paradigms for these subconstructs. METHODS: Participants had either a history of at least 1 suicide attempt (n = 30) or no history of attempting suicide (n = 30). They completed diagnostic interviews, self-report questionnaires, and 2 computer-based tasks-the monetary incentive delay task and the doors task-during which continuous EEG was recorded. Temporospatial principal component analysis was used to isolate each of the ERP components of interest from other temporally or spatially overlapping components. Exploratory time-frequency analyses were also conducted to supplement the ERP analyses. RESULTS: Suicide attempters, compared with nonattempters, exhibited specific deficits in reward anticipation (i.e., blunted cue-P3 ERP during the monetary incentive delay task) and in initial response to reward (i.e., reduced feedback-related delta power in the gain condition of the doors task). These results were at least partially independent of current symptoms or diagnoses of depression and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: These findings constitute an important step in obtaining a more fine-grained understanding of the specific reward-related abnormalities that might contribute to suicide risk.

Fast and effective emotion recognition can play an important role in understanding a patient's emotions and in monitoring stress levels in real-time. Due to the noisy and non-linear nature of the EEG signal, it is still difficult to understand emotions and can generate large feature vectors. In this article, we have proposed an efficient spatial feature extraction and feature selection method with a short processing time. The raw EEG signal is first divided into a smaller set of eigenmode functions called (IMF) using the empirical model-based decomposition proposed in our work, known as intensive multivariate empirical mode decomposition (iMEMD). The Spatio-temporal analysis is performed with Complex Continuous Wavelet Transform (CCWT) to collect all the information in the time and frequency domains. The multiple model extraction method uses three deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract features and dissect them together to have a combined feature vector. To overcome the computational curse, we propose a method of differential entropy and mutual information, which further reduces feature size by selecting high-quality features and pooling the k-means results to produce less dimensional qualitative feature vectors. The system seems complex, but once the network is trained with this model, real-time application testing and validation with good classification performance is fast. The proposed method for selecting attributes for benchmarking is validated with two publicly available data sets, SEED, and DEAP. This method is less expensive to calculate than more modern sentiment recognition methods, provides real-time sentiment analysis, and offers good classification accuracy.

Neural oscillations exert a key role in coordinating the activity of remote brain regions, and various assemblies of oscillations can modulate different networks to support different cognitive tasks. Studies have demonstrated that the dysconnectivity of electroencephalography (EEG) oscillatory networks is related with MDD. In this study, we investigated the oscillatory hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity networks in MDD under a naturalistic and continuous stimuli condition of music listening. With the assumption that the healthy group and the MDD group share similar brain topology from the same stimuli and also retain individual brain topology for group differences, we applied the coupled nonnegative tensor decomposition algorithm on two adjacency tensors with the dimension of time x frequency x connectivity x subject, and imposed double-coupled constraints on spatial and spectral modes. The music-induced oscillatory networks were identified by a correlation analysis approach based on the permutation test between extracted temporal factors and musical features. We obtained three hyperconnectivity networks from the individual features of MDD and three hypoconnectivity networks from common features. The results demonstrated that the dysfunction of oscillatory networks could affect the involvement in music perception for MDD patients. Those oscillatory dysconnectivity networks may provide promising references to reveal the pathoconnectomics of MDD and potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of MDD.

Emotion recognition from EEG signals has facilitated to impaired peoples to intact with real world. Multi-components EEG signal need to decomposed into set of components to extract the hidden information, empirical selection of decomposition parameters can lead to loss of information due to mode mixing, generation of noisy modes, poor signal synthesis, etc. In this paper, optimized variational mode decomposition is proposed for emotion recognition using single-channel EEG signals. The Eigenvector centrality method (EVCM) is employed for dominant channel selection. An optimum number of modes (K-opt) and penalty factor (alpha(opt)) are selected adaptively for decomposition of non- stationary EEG signals. Time-domain features are elicited from the modes of EEG signals. The posthoc analysis are employed for significant features selection, these features are used as input to different classifiers for emotion classification. The overall accuracy of 97.24% is achieved with an extreme learning machine classifier for a four emotion classification. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by five performance parameters. F-1 score, false-positive rate, Mathew's correlation coefficient, and Cohen's Kappa of 0.9454, 0.94%, 92.92%, and 0.9633 is obtained. In comparison with traditional variationalmode decomposition and existing state-of-the-art using the same dataset, the proposed method shows improved performance of about 4% and 2%.

The combination of VR with electroencephalography (EEG) presents further opportunities to improve therapeutic efficacy by personalizing the paradigm. Specifically, the idea is to synchronize the choice and timing of stimuli in the perceived virtual world with fluctuating brain states relevant to motor behavior. Here, we present an open source EEG single-trial based classification pipeline that is designed to identify ongoing brain states predictive of the planning and execution of movements. 9 healthy volunteers each performed 1080 trials of a repetitive reaching task with an implicit two-alternative forced choice, i.e., use of the right or left hand, in response to the appearance of a visual target. The performance of the EEG decoding pipeline was assessed with respect to classification accuracy of right vs. left arm use, based on the EEG signal at the time of the stimulus. Different features, feature extraction methods, and classifiers were compared at different time windows; the number and location of informative EEG channels and the number of calibration trials needed were also quantified, as well as any benefits from individual-level optimization of pipeline parameters. This resulted in a set of recommended parameters that achieved an average 83.3% correct prediction on never-before-seen testing data, and a state-of-the-art 77.1% in a real-time simulation. Neurophysiological plausibility of the resulting classifiers was assessed by time-frequency and event-related potential analyses, as well as by Independent Component Analysis topographies and cortical source localization. We expect that this pipeline will facilitate the identification of relevant brain states as prospective therapeutic targets in closed-loop EEG-VR motor neurorehabilitation.

Modulation of GABA can alter the characteristic rest as well as movement-related oscillatory activity in the alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz, and gamma (60-90 Hz) frequencies, but the specific mechanisms by which GABAergic modulation can modify these well-described changes remains unclear. Through pharmacologic GABAergic modulation and evaluation across the age spectrum. the contributions of GABA to these characteristic oscillatory activities are beginning to be understood. Here, we review how baseline GABA signaling plays a key role in motor networks and in cortical oscillations detected by scalp electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography. We also discuss the data showing specific alterations to baseline movement related oscillatory changes from pharmacologic intervention on GABAergic tone as well as with healthy aging. These data provide greater insight into the physiology of movement and may help improve future development of novel therapeutics for patients who suffer from movement disorders.

EEG-based neurofeedback is a technique successfully used in traumatic brain injury and stroke to rehabilitate cognitive and motor sequelae. There are not individualized comparisons of the effects of EEG-based neurofeedback versus conventional neuropsychological rehabilitation. We present a case study of a traumatic brain injury subject in whom eight sessions of a neuropsychological rehabilitation protocol targeting attention, executive functions, and working memory as compared with a personalized EEG-based neurofeedback protocol focused on the electrodes and bands that differed from healthy subjects (F3, F1, Fz, FC3, FC1, and FCz), targeting the inhibition of theta frequency band (3 Hz-7 Hz) in the same number of sessions. Quantitative EEG and neuropsy-chological testing were performed. Clear benefits of EEG-based neurofeedback were found in divided and sustained attention and several aspects related to visuospatial skills and the processing speed of motor-dependent tasks. Correlative quantitative EEG changes justify the results. EEG-based neurofeedback is probably an excellent complementary technique to be considered to enhance conventional neuropsychological rehabilitation.

While its effects are different for each person, they mostly include abnormal behaviour, periods of loss of awareness and seizures. There are various traditional methods used to analyse EEG signals for epilepsy detection, which concludes to be time-consuming. Recently, several automated seizure detection frameworks using machine learning algorithms have been proposed to replace conventional methods. In this paper, more emphasis has been given to develop SPPCA and SUBXPCA dimensionality reduction algorithms to increase the classification accuracy of various machine learning models. Firstly, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is applied to EEG signals for extracting the time-frequency domain features of epileptic seizures such as the energy of each sub-pattern, spike rhythmicity, Relative Spike Amplitude (RSA), Dominant Frequency (DF) and Spectral Entropy (SE). The features obtained after performing DWT on an EEG signal are extensive in number, to select the prominent features and to retain their properties, correlation feature sub-pattern-based PCA (SPPCA), and cross sub-pattern correlation-based PCA (SUBXPCA) are used as a dimensionality reduction techniques. To validate the proposed work, performance evaluation parameter such as the accuracy of the time-frequency domain features from different combinations of the dataset has been compared with the latest state-of-the-art works. Simulation results show that the best accuracy of 97% is achieved for SPPCA algorithm by CatBoost classifier. And the best accuracy of 98% for SUBXPCA is achieved by random forest classifier, which clearly outperformed the other related works both in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.

In this paper, the EEG signal is used to evaluate the cognitive response of subjects during watching test video clips. The measurements are performed with 25 subjects using eight channels while simultaneously running the video clips. The beta and gamma waves of the EEG signal are used to extract the features that represent the evoked activity in each group of frames using the Peak-Over-Threshold (POT) technique. Significant EEG patterns are derived from the time-correlated measurements, which can be related to the subjects' interests. In addition, the conjunctions that represent the occurrence of segments-of-interest in more than one channel are determined. The results show that similar to 15% of the segments attracted the attention of the viewers in each test video clip. Such a technique can potentially be implemented in neuromarketing analysis or to develop a new video compression technique that depends on the human cognitive system.

Effectiveness was measured using multimodal physiological measures, combining eye tracking and electroencephalography (EEG). Using a between-subjects design, 42 university students were randomly assigned to two video lecture conditions (color-coded vs. grayscale). The participants' eye tracking and EEG signals were recorded while watching the assigned video, and their learning performance was subsequently assessed. The results showed that the color-coded design was more beneficial than the grayscale design, as indicated by smaller pupil diameter, shorter fixation duration, higher EEG theta and alpha band power, lower EEG cognitive load, and better learning performance. The present findings have practical implications for designing slide-based programming learning video lectures; slides should highlight the format of the program code using color coding.

EEG as a Functional Marker of Nicotine Activity: Evidence From a Pilot Study of Adults With Late-Life Depression	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						nicotine; EEG; late-life depression; beta power; event-related oscillations	COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; TRANSDERMAL NICOTINE; PARIETAL CORTEX; ANTERIOR SHIFT; EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION; GENERATOR PATTERNS; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; FRONTAL SHIFT; DOUBLE-BLIND; ATTENTION	Late-life depression (LLD) is a debilitating condition that is associated with poor response to antidepressant medications and deficits in cognitive performance. Nicotinic cholinergic stimulation has emerged as a potentially effective candidate to improve cognitive performance in patients with cognitive impairment. Previous studies of nicotinic stimulation in animal models and human populations with cognitive impairment led to examining potential cognitive and mood effects of nicotinic stimulation in older adults with LLD. We report results from a pilot study of transdermal nicotine in LLD testing whether nicotine treatment would enhance cognitive performance and mood. The study used electroencephalography (EEG) recordings as a tool to test for potential mechanisms underlying the effect of nicotine. Eight non-smoking participants with LLD completed EEG recordings at baseline and after 12 weeks of transdermal nicotine treatment (NCT02816138). Nicotine augmentation treatment was associated with improved performance on an auditory oddball task. Analysis of event-related oscillations showed that nicotine treatment was associated with reduced beta desynchronization at week 12 for both standard and target trials. The change in beta power on standard trials was also correlated with improvement in mood symptoms. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence for the impact of nicotine in modulating cortical activity and improving mood in depressed older adults and shows the utility of using EEG as a marker of functional engagement in nicotinic interventions in clinical geriatric patients.

Sleep spindle activity correlates with implicit statistical learning consolidation in untreated obstructive sleep apnea patients	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						Implicit learning; Quantitative electroencephalography; Power spectral analysis; Sleep-disordered breathing; Memory consolidation	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; NEURAL EVIDENCE; REGULARITIES; ENHANCEMENT; CHILDREN; CORTEX; TIME	Objective/Background: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between overnight consolidation of implicit statistical learning with spindle frequency EEG activity and slow frequency delta power during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Patients/Methods: Forty-seven OSA participants completed the experiment. Prior to sleep, participants performed a reaction time cover task containing hidden patterns of pictures, about which participants were not informed. After the familiarisation phase, participants underwent overnight polysomnography. 24 h after the familiarisation phase, participants performed a test phase to assess their learning of the hidden patterns, expressed as a percentage of the number of correctly identified patterns. Spindle frequency activity (SFA) and delta power (0.5-4.5 Hz), were quantified from NREM electroencephalography. Associations between statistical learning and sleep EEG, and OSA severity measures were examined. Results: SFA in NREM sleep in frontal and central brain regions was positively correlated with statistical learning scores (r = 0.41 to 0.31, p = 0.006 to 0.044). In multiple regression, greater SFA and longer sleep onset latency were significant predictors of better statistical learning performance. Delta power and OSA severity were not significantly correlated with statistical learning. Conclusions: These findings suggest spindle activity may serve as a marker of statistical learning capability in OSA. This work provides novel insight into how altered sleep physiology relates to consolidation of implicitly learnt information in patients with moderate to severe OSA. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, a new approach of extracting and measuring the variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) was proposed to assess the depth of anesthesia (DOA) under general anesthesia. Approach. The EEG variability (EEGV) was extracted as a fluctuation in time interval that occurs between two local maxima of EEG. Eight parameters related to EEGV were measured in time and frequency domains, and compared with state-of-the-art DOA estimation parameters, including sample entropy, permutation entropy, median frequency and spectral edge frequency of EEG. The area under the receiver-operator characteristics curve (AUC) and Pearson correlation coefficient were used to validate its performance on 56 patients. Main results. Our proposed EEGV-derived parameters yield significant difference for discriminating between awake and anesthesia stages at a significance level of 0.05, as well as improvement in AUC and correlation coefficient on average, which surpasses the conventional features of EEG in detection accuracy of unconscious state and tracking the level of consciousness. Significance. To sum up, EEGV analysis provides a new perspective in quantifying EEG and corresponding parameters are powerful and promising for monitoring DOA under clinical situations.

Methods: AE patients with a current high frequency of seizures were included (n=21). Each included subject underwent a two-hour and 19-channel video EEG examination. Five epochs of 10-second EEG data in interictal, pre-seizure, and post-seizure states were collected from each AE patient. Five 10-second resting-state EEG epochs from sex- and age-matched HCs who reported no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders and visited the hospital for routine physical examinations were collected. Microstate analysis and source localization of microstates were performed using the LORETA KEY tool. Results: Compared with the resting-state EEGs of HCs, the interictal EEGs of AE patients showed a higher relative transition rate from microstates B to D (p < 0.05). From interictal to pre-seizure EEG, the total time ratio of microstate C and the occurrence of microstate B decreased significantly, while the duration of microstate B increased significantly (p < 0.05). Compared with pre-seizure EEGs, microstate C in post-seizure EEGs showed a significantly downregulated total time percentage and occurrence (p < 0.05). The source localization of each microstate in each condition also varied and showed spatial recovery tends from pre- to post-seizure states. Conclusion: Altered EEG microstate dynamics exist between inter-ictal EEGs of AE patients and resting-state EEGs of HCs and between pre- and post-seizure EEGs in AE patients. The EEG microstates of epileptic patients before and after absence seizures are characterized by a "slowdown" in transitions between microstates. Microstates might be used as an index to evaluate the temporal and spatial recovery process of absence seizures in AE.

The Role of Gamma Oscillations in the Pathophysiology of Substance Use Disorders	JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE			English	Review						gamma oscillations; alcohol; tobacco; cannabis; cognition; co-morbidity	ACUTE ALCOHOL-INTOXICATION; HEAVY CANNABIS USERS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VISUAL-SEARCH; 40 HZ	Substance use disorders (SUDs) are a major public health problem-with over 200 million people reporting drug use in 2016. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a powerful tool that can provide insights into the impact of SUDs on cognition. Specifically, modulated gamma activity may provide an index of the pathophysiology of SUDs. Thus, the purpose of this review was to investigate the impact of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, and amphetamine on gamma activity, among pre-clinical and clinical populations during acute and chronic exposure and withdrawal states. We searched multiple databases for key terms related to SUDs, EEG, and gamma and ensured rigorous methods by using a standardized review reporting tool. We included 30 studies in this review and found that all substances were associated with modulation of gamma activity, across states and in both preclinical and clinical populations. Gamma oscillations appeared to be differentially modulated in clinical versus preclinical populations and had the most complex relationship with alcohol, indicating that it may act differently than other substances. The findings of this review offer insights into the pathophysiology of SUDs, providing a potential window into novel treatments for SUDs via modulation of gamma activity.

Furthermore, the information carried by their phases is fundamental for the coordination of anatomically distributed processing in the brain. The concept of phase transfer entropy refers to an information theory-based measure of directed connectivity among neural oscillations that allows studying such distributed processes. Phase TE is commonly obtained from probability estimations carried out over data from multiple trials, which bars its use as a characterization strategy in brain-computer interfaces. In this work, we propose a novel methodology to estimate TE between single pairs of instantaneous phase time series. Our approach combines a kernel-based TE estimator defined in terms of Renyi's alpha entropy, which sidesteps the need for probability distribution computation with phase time series obtained by complex filtering the neural signals. Besides, a kernel-alignment-based relevance analysis is added to highlight relevant features from effective connectivity-based representation supporting further classification stages in EEG-based brain-computer interface systems. Our proposal is tested on simulated coupled data and two publicly available databases containing EEG signals recorded under motor imagery and visual working memory paradigms. Attained results demonstrate how the introduced effective connectivity succeeds in detecting the interactions present in the data for the former, with statistically significant results around the frequencies of interest. It also reflects differences in coupling strength, is robust to realistic noise and signal mixing levels, and captures bidirectional interactions of localized frequency content. Obtained results for the motor imagery and working memory databases show that our approach, combined with the relevance analysis strategy, codes discriminant spatial and frequency-dependent patterns for the different conditions in each experimental paradigm, with classification performances that do well in comparison with those of alternative methods of similar nature.

Correct assessment of the anesthesia depth is crucial to its safety. At present, intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring is the primary mode of anesthesia depth monitoring and judgment. However, most clinical anesthesiologists rely on commercial anesthesia depth monitors to judge anesthesia depth, such as bispectral index (BIS) and patient state index (PSI). This may lack an understanding of associated changes in brain wave quantization. Therefore, this study conducts quantitative analyses of EEG signals during anesthesia induction. EEG signals are processed within specific time windows and extracted brainpower density spectrum arrays with different frequency bands, brain electrical signal spectra, source frequencies and other key indicators. Analysis and comparison of these indicators clarifies patterns of variation in EEG signals during early anesthesia induction. The spectral edge frequencies (SEFs) of EEG signals within different time windows can be modeled accurately, from which the specific time points of EEG signal changes are derived. Furthermore, the relationship between patient age and the effect of anesthetic drugs is preliminarily investigated by analyzing the SEF variations of different age groups. This study quantifies changes in the EEG signals of patients at the initial stage of anesthesia induction and drug-related effects are observed, which opens a way for further exploration of EEG changes in patients under general anesthesia.

One primary research focus area is the identification of bio-markers that not only identify stress but also predict the conditions (or tasks) that cause stress. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) have been used for a long time to study and identify bio-markers. While these bio-markers have successfully predicted stress in EEG studies for binary conditions, their performance is suboptimal for multiple conditions of stress. Methods: To overcome this challenge, we propose using latent based representations of the bio-markers, which have been shown to significantly improve EEG performance compared to traditional bio-markers alone. We evaluated three commonly used EEG based bio-markers for stress, the brain load index (BLI), the spectral power values of EEG frequency bands (alpha, beta and theta), and the relative gamma (RG), with their respective latent representations using four commonly used classifiers. Results: The results show that spectral power value based bio-markers had a high performance with an accuracy of 83%, while the respective latent representations had an accuracy of 91%.

The present study aimed to investigate the association of APOE epsilon 4 genotypes with brain functional impairment, as assessed by quantitative EEG (qEEG) in patients on the AD continuum. The study population included 101 amyloid positive patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 50) and AD (n = 51) that underwent resting-state EEG recording and CSF A beta 42 analysis. In total, 31 patients were APOE epsilon 4 non-carriers, 42 were carriers of one, and 28 were carriers of two APOE epsilon 4 alleles. Quantitative EEG analysis included computation of the global field power (GFP) and global field synchronization (GFS) in conventional frequency bands. Amyloid positive patients who were carriers of APOE epsilon 4 allele(s) had significantly higher GFP beta and significantly lower GFS in theta and beta bands compared to APOE epsilon 4 non-carriers. Increased global EEG power in beta band in APOE epsilon 4 carriers may represent a brain functional compensatory mechanism that offsets global EEG slowing in AD patients. Our findings suggest that decreased EEG measures of global synchronization in theta and beta bands reflect brain functional deficits related to the APOE epsilon 4 genotype in patients that are on a biomarker-verified AD continuum.

The aims of the study are to apply time-frequency and power spectrum analysis to study the PDs pattern and prediction of seizures. Methods: We retrospectively searched continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) recordings to identify patients exhibiting the PDs pattern. Artifact-free cEEG segments demonstrating the PDs pattern with stable baselines were chosen for time-frequency and power spectrum analysis. Results: In total, 72 patients (1.3%) exhibited the PDs pattern, with a mean age 36.0 +/- 20.7 years (range, 8-76 years). The median spectral power of PDs with a length of 60 s was 70.94 mu V-2 and that of PDs with a length of 20 s was 195.80 mu V-2. During follow-up, patients with spectral power of PDs of length 60 and 20 s lower than 28.65 and 36.09 mu V-2, respectively, exhibited no seizure. For predicting seizures, when the spectral power for PDs of 60 and 20 s equaled to 17.26 and 21.40 mu V-2, respectively, the diagnostic sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 86%. The locations of maximal spectral power of PDs, crude seizure onset zone (SOZ) judged from scalp EEG, and the most prominent regions of hyper- or hypo-metabolism on FDG-PET were congruent. Conclusions: Spectral power might be a candidate seizure marker of the PDs pattern. High spectral power predicted a high risk of seizures, and low spectral power was associated with a low risk of seizures.

High-Frequency Oscillations on Interictal Epileptiform Discharges in Routinely Acquired Scalp EEG: Can It Be Used as a Prognostic Marker?	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						high-frequency oscillations; ripples; scalp EEG; prognostic marker; epilepsy	MIRROR DISEASE-ACTIVITY; FAST RIPPLES; CLINICAL-SIGNIFICANCE; EPILEPSY; SEIZURE; SPIKES; GENERATORS; CHILDREN	Introduction: Despite all the efforts for optimizing epilepsy management in children over the past decades, there is no clear consensus regarding whether to treat or not to treat epileptiform discharges (EDs) after a first unprovoked seizure or the optimal duration of therapy with anti-seizure medication (ASM). It is therefore highly needed to find markers on scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) that can help identify pathological EEG discharges that require treatment. Aim of the study: This retrospective study aimed to identify whether the coexistence of ripples/high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) with interictal EDs (IEDs) in routinely acquired scalp EEG is associated with a higher risk of seizure recurrence and could be used as a prognostic marker. Methods: 100 children presenting with new onset seizure to Children's Medical Center- Dallas during 2015-2016, who were not on ASM and had focal EDs on an awake and sleep EEG recorded with sample frequency of 500 HZ, were randomly identified by database review. EEGs were analyzed blinded to the data of the patients. HFOs were visually identified using review parameters including expanded time base and adjusted filter settings. Results: The average age of patients was 6.3 years (+/- 4.35 SD). HFOs were visually identified in 19% of the studied patients with an inter-rater reliability of 99% for HFO negative discharges and 78% agreement for identification of HFOs. HFOs were identified more often in the younger age group; however, they were identified in 11% of patients > 5 years old. They were more frequently associated with spikes than with sharp waves and more often with higher amplitude EDs. Patients with HFOs were more likely to have a recurrence of seizures in the year after the first seizure (P < 0.05) and to continue to have seizures after 2 years (P < 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with regards to continuing ASM after 2 years. Conclusion: Including analysis for HFOs in routine EEG interpretation may increase the yield of the study and help guide the decision to either start or discontinue ASM. In the future, this may also help to identify pathological discharges with deleterious effects on the growing brain and set a new target for the management of epilepsy.

The purpose of this study is to investigate how the ongoing alpha oscillation acts upon the local temporal dynamics and spatial hyperconnectivity in epilepsy. Methods: We evaluated the spatiotemporal regulation of alpha oscillations in epileptic state based on simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings in 45 IGE patients. The alpha-BOLD temporal consistency, as well as the effect of alpha power windows on dynamic functional connectivity strength (dFCS) was analyzed. Then, stable synchronization networks during GSWD were constructed, and the spatial covariation with alpha-based network integration was investigated. Results: Increased temporal covariation was demonstrated between alpha power and BOLD fluctuations in thalamus and distributed cortical regions in IGE. High alpha power had inhibition effect on dFCS in healthy controls, while in epilepsy, high alpha windows arose along with the enhancement of dFCS in thalamus, caudate and some default mode network (DMN) regions. Moreover, synchronization networks in GSWD-before, GSWD-onset and GSWD-after stages were constructed, and the connectivity strength in prominent hub nodes (precuneus, thalamus) was associated with the spatially disturbed alpha-based network integration. Conclusion: The results indicated spatiotemporal regulation of alpha in epilepsy by means of the increased power and decreased coherence communication. It provided links between alpha rhythm and the altered temporal dynamics, as well as the hyperconnectivity in thalamus-default mode circuit. Significance: The combination between neural oscillations and epileptic representations may be of clinical importance in terms of seizure prediction and non-invasive interventions.

Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the electroencephalogram dynamics of etomidate-induced loss of consciousness (LOC) in order to understand the neurological mechanism of etomidate-induced LOC. Methods This study is a prospective observational study. Etomidate-induced anesthesia was performed on eligible patients undergoing elective surgery. We analyzed EEG data from 20 patients who received etomidate for the induction of general anesthesia. We used power spectra and coherence methods to process and analyze the EEG data. Our study was based on 4-channel EEG recordings. Results Compared with the baseline (awake period), etomidate induced an increase in power in delta, theta, alpha and beta waves during LOC. Compared with the awake period, the delta-wave (1-4 Hz), alpha-wave(8-13 Hz), and theta-wave(4-8 Hz) coherence increased significantly during LOC, while the slow-wave (< 1 Hz) coherence decreased. However, the delta wave (1.0-4.0 Hz) during etomidate-induced LOC was more coherent than during the awake period (1.86-3.17 Hz, two-group test for coherence, p < 0.001). Conclusions The neural circuit mechanism of etomidate-induced LOC is closely related to the induction of oscillation in delta, theta, alpha and beta waves and the enhancement of delta-wave coherence.

J	Beker, S; Foxe, JJ; Molholm, S				Beker, Shlomit; Foxe, John J.; Molholm, Sophie			Oscillatory entrainment mechanisms and anticipatory predictive processes in children with autism spectrum disorder	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						autism spectrum disorder (ASD); CNV; EEG; phase locking; predictive processing	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; LOW-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; BRAINS ATTENTIONAL SET; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; VISUAL-CORTEX; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; PHASE ENTRAINMENT; SUPPRESSION; PERCEPTION	Anticipating near-future events is fundamental to adaptive behavior, whereby neural processing of predictable stimuli is significantly facilitated relative to nonpredictable events. Neural oscillations appear to be a key anticipatory mechanism by which processing of upcoming stimuli is modified, and they often entrain to rhythmic environmental sequences. Clinical and anecdotal observations have led to the hypothesis that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may have deficits in generating predictions, and as such, a candidate neural mechanism may be failure to adequately entrain neural activity to repetitive environmental patterns, to facilitate temporal predictions. We tested this hypothesis by interrogating temporal predictions and rhythmic entrainment using behavioral and electrophysiological approaches. We recorded high-density electroencephalography in children with ASD and typically developing (TD) age-and IQ-matched controls, while they reacted to an auditory target as quickly as possible. This auditory event was either preceded by predictive rhythmic visual cues or was not preceded by any cue. Both ASD and control groups presented comparable behavioral facilitation in response to the Cue versus No-Cue condition, challenging the hypothesis that children with ASD have deficits in generating temporal predictions. Analyses of the electrophysiological data, in contrast, revealed significantly reduced neural entrainment to the visual cues and altered anticipatory processes in the ASD group. This was the case despite intact stimulus-evoked visual responses. These results support intact behavioral temporal prediction in response to a cue in ASD, in the face of altered neural entrainment and anticipatory processes. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We examined behavioral and EEG indices of predictive processing in children with ASD to rhythmically predictable stimuli. Although behavioral measures of predictive processing and evoked neural responses were intact in the ASD group, neurophysiological measures of preparatory activity and entrainment were impaired. When sensory events are presented in a predictable temporal pattern, performance and neuronal responses in ASD may be governed more by the occurrence of the events themselves and less by their anticipated timing.

Currently Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most popular tool to inspect the existence of neurological disorders like autism biomarkers due to its low setup cost, high temporal resolution and wide availability. Generally, EEG recordings produce vast amount of data with dynamic behavior, which are visually analyzed by professional clinician to detect autism. It is laborious, expensive, subjective, error prone and has reliability issue. Therefor this study intends to develop an efficient diagnostic framework based on time-frequency spectrogram images of EEG signals to automatically identify ASD. In the proposed system, primarily, the raw EEG signals are pre-processed using re-referencing, filtering and normalization. Then, Short-Time Fourier Transform is used to transform the pre-processed signals into two-dimensional spectrogram images. Afterward those images are evaluated by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, separately. In the ML process, textural features are extracted, and significant features are selected using principal component analysis, and feed them to six different ML classifiers for classification. In the DL process, three different convolutional neural network models are tested. The proposed DL based model achieves higher accuracy (99.15%) compared to the ML based model (95.25%) on an ASD EEG dataset and also outperforms existing methods. The findings of this study suggest that the DL based structure could discover important biomarkers for efficient and automatic diagnosis of ASD from EEG and may assist to develop computer-aided diagnosis system.

The brain dynamics underlying design is unclear, since a design process consists of many basic cognitive behaviours, such as problem understanding, idea generation, idea analysis, idea evaluation, and idea evolution. In this present study, we simulated the design process in a loosely controlled setting, aiming to quantify the design-related cognitive workload and control, identify EEG-defined large-scale brain networks, and uncover their temporal dynamics. The effectiveness of this loosely controlled setting was tested through comparing the results with validated findings available in the literature. Task-related power (TRP) analysis of delta, theta, alpha and beta frequency bands revealed that idea generation was associated with the highest cognitive workload and lowest cognitive control, compared to other design activities in the experiment, including problem understanding, idea evaluation, and self-rating. EEG microstate analysis supported this finding as microstate class C, being negatively associated with the cognitive control network, was the most prevalent in idea generation. Furthermore, EEG microstate sequence analysis demonstrated that idea generation was consistently associated with the shortest temporal correlation times concerning finite entropy rate, autoinformation function, and Hurst exponent. This finding suggests that during idea generation the interplay of functional brain networks is less restricted and the brain has more degrees of freedom in choosing the next network configuration than during other design activities. Taken together, the TRP and EEG microstate results lead to the conclusion that idea generation is associated with the highest cognitive workload and lowest cognitive control during open-ended creation task.

Connectivity of EEG synchronization networks increases for Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait	COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY			English	Article							PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN NETWORKS; OSCILLATIONS; PREDICTION; FREQUENCY; PROFILES; DYNAMICS	Freezing of gait (FoG), a paroxysmal gait disturbance commonly experienced by patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), is characterized by sudden episodes of inability to generate effective forward stepping. Recent studies have shown an increase in beta frequency of local-field potentials in the basal-ganglia during FoG, however, comprehensive research on the synchronization between different brain locations and frequency bands in PD patients is scarce. Here, by developing tools based on network science and non-linear dynamics, we analyze synchronization networks of electroencephalography (EEG) brain waves of three PD patient groups with different FoG severity. We find higher EEG amplitude synchronization (stronger network links) between different brain locations as PD and FoG severity increase. These results are consistent across frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta, gamma) and independent of the specific motor task (walking, still standing, hand tapping) suggesting that an increase in severity of PD and FoG is associated with stronger EEG networks over a broad range of brain frequencies. This observation of a direct relationship of PD/FoG severity with overall EEG synchronization together with our proposed EEG synchronization network approach may be used for evaluating FoG propensity and help to gain further insight into PD and the pathophysiology leading to FoG. Asher et al analyzed synchronization networks of electroencephalography brain waves from three Parkinson's disease (PD) patient groups with different freezing of gait (FoG) severity using tools based on network science and non-linear dynamics. Their findings suggest that there is a potential relationship between PD/FoG severity and overall EEG synchronization and their approach could be used to help gain further insight into the pathophysiology leading to FoG.

J	Sameer, M; Gupta, B				Sameer, Mustafa; Gupta, Bharat			Time-Frequency Statistical Features of Delta Band for Detection of Epileptic Seizures	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article; Early Access						Electroencephalogram; Seizure detection; Delta band; t-f statistical features; Random Forest	EEG	Various research groups are working on the automated detection of epileptic seizures using Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. EEG waveforms are composed of distinct bands of frequencies. Most of the researchers have used a wide range of frequencies or every frequency band of EEG for detection process of epileptic seizures to obtain high accuracy. However, not all frequency bins contain relevant information about seizures, thereby degrading the performance of the detection system. This paper demonstrates the suitability of only delta band (0.5-4 Hz) for the detection of seizures due to epilepsy. The work has been performed in four stages: (1) Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) of EEG data, (2) extraction of delta band from the time-frequency (t-f) plane, (3) calculation of four statistical features (4) performance analysis using Random Forest (RF) classifier. The proposed methodology achieved an average accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of 99.6%, 99.5% and 99.67% respectively between persons suffering from epilepsy and healthy people on Bonn EEG dataset. Proposed work is computationally efficient as it uses only single band which results in small data computation. Its detection time is very short (< 0.5 s) which makes it suitable for real-time clinical application.

A tutorial on generalized eigendecomposition for denoising, contrast enhancement, and dimension reduction in multichannel electrophysiology	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; MEG; LFP; Oscillations; Source separation; GED; Eigendecomposition; Components analysis; Covariance matrix	BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; LINEAR SPATIAL FILTERS; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; TIME; MEG	The goal of this paper is to present a theoretical and practical introduction to generalized eigendecomposition (GED), which is a robust and flexible framework used for dimension reduction and source separation in multichannel signal processing. In cognitive electrophysiology, GED is used to create spatial filters that maximize a researcher-specified contrast. For example, one may wish to exploit an assumption that different sources have different frequency content, or that sources vary in magnitude across experimental conditions. GED is fast and easy to compute, performs well in simulated and real data, and is easily adaptable to a variety of specific research goals. This paper introduces GED in a way that ties together myriad individual publications and applications of GED in electrophysiology, and provides sample MATLAB and Python code that can be tested and adapted. Practical considerations and issues that often arise in applications are discussed.

The traditional EEG signal analysis and processing methods mainly focus on time-domain analysis and simple frequency-domain filtering, and take the second-order statistics as the mathematical analysis tool. However, due to the loss of high-order useful information, the traditional time-domain and frequency-domain analysis methods are difficult to obtain satisfactory results. To conduct the systematic optimization work, this research study applies the IoT measurement framework to overcome the challenges and achieve the efficient model. The designed framework is simulated on the public data sets and the model is compared with the other methods.

This coupling is a dynamical process, it must cope with a huge variety of rhythms with frequencies ranging from milliseconds to hours, days, seasons. The brain is a central hub for this crosstalk. During sleep, automatic rhythmic interrelations are enhanced and provide a direct insight into organ dysfunctions, however their origin remains a difficult issue, in particular in sleep disorders. In this study, we focus on EEG, ECG, and airflow recordings from polysomnography databases. Because these signals are non-stationary, non-linear, noisy, and span wide spectral ranges, a time-frequency analysis, based on wavelet transforms, is more appropriate to handle this complexity. We design a wavelet-based extraction method to identify the characteristic rhythms of these different signals, and their temporal variability. These new constructs are combined in pairs to compute their wavelet-based time-frequency complex coherence. These time-frequency coherence maps highlight the occurrence of a slowly modulated coherence pattern in the frequency range [0.01-0.06] Hz, which appears in both obstructive and central apnea. A preliminary exploration of a large database from the National Sleep Research Resource with respiration disorders, such as apnea provides some clues on its relation with autonomic cardio-respiratory coupling and brain rhythms. We also observe that during sleep apnea episodes (either obstructive or central), the cardiopulmonary coherence (in particular respiratory sinus-arrhythmia) in the frequency range [0.1-0.7] Hz strongly diminishes, suggesting a modification of this coupling. Finally, comparing time-averaged coherence with heart rate variability spectra in different apnea episodes, we discuss their common trait and their differences.

The intake of nicotine may also lead to abnormal patterns of oscillatory brain activity and inhibition control deficits. However, little is known about the specific relationship between oscillatory brain activity during the resting state and inhibition control capacity in young smokers. In the present study, we acquired resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data from thirty-four young smokers and 39 age-matched non-smoking controls. Inhibition control performance was measured by a Go/NoGo task. Compared with non-smoking controls, we detected reduced low-frequency delta band activity in the frontal, central and posterior cortices of young smokers. Furthermore, young smokers committed more errors in response to infrequent NoGo trials. Notably, we demonstrated that delta absolute power in the frontal region was negatively correlated with NoGo errors and that alpha power in the central region was positively correlated with NoGo errors in non-smoking controls but not in young smokers. These findings may suggest that these inhibitory control processes were associated with alterations in oscillatory brain activity during the resting state. Our findings suggest that alterations of power spectra in delta bands may act as a useful biomarker of inhibitory control performance and provide a scientific basis for the diagnosis and treatment of nicotine addiction in adolescents.

Precise diagnosis prior to the onset of the symptoms can prevent the rapid progression of the emerging cognitive impairment. Recent progress has shown that electroencephalography (EEG) is the promising and cost-effective test to facilitate the detection of neurocognitive disorders. However, most of the existing works have been using only resting-state EEG. The efficiencies of EEG signals from various cognitive tasks, for DEM classification, have yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this study, we designed four cognitive tasks that engage different cognitive performances: attention, working memory, and executive function. We investigated these tasks by using statistical analysis on both time and frequency domains of EEG signals from three classes of human subjects: DEM, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal control (NC). We also further evaluated the classification performances of two features extraction methods: principal component analysis (PCA) and filter hank common spatial pattern (FBCSP). We found that the working memoryrelated tasks yielded good performances for DEM recognition in both cases using PCA and FBCSP. Moreover, FBCSP with features combination from four tasks revealed the best sensitivity of 0.87 and the specificity of 0.80. To our hest knowledge, this is the first work that concurrently investigated several cognitive tasks for DEM recognition using both statistical analysis and classification scores. Our results yielded essential information to design and aid in conducting further experimental tasks to early diagnose DEM patients.

In this study, we assess whether putative differences in the subjective experience of meditation between meditators and non-meditators are reflected in EEG spectral modulations. For this purpose, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) during rest and two breath focus meditations (with and without experience sampling) in a group of 29 adult participants with more than 3 years of meditation experience and a control group of 29 participants without any meditation experience. Experience sampling in one of the meditation conditions allowed us to disentangle periods of breath focus from mind wandering (i.e. moments of distraction driven by task-irrelevant thoughts) during meditation practice. Overall, meditators reported a greater level of focus and reduced mind wandering during meditation practice than controls. In line with these reports, EEG spectral modulations associated with meditation and mind wandering also differed significantly between meditators and controls. While meditators (but not controls) showed a significant decrease in individual alpha frequency / amplitude and a steeper 1/f slope during meditation relative to rest, controls (but not meditators) showed a relative increase in individual alpha amplitude during mind wandering relative to breath focus periods. Together, our results show that the subjective experience of meditation and mind wandering differs between meditators and novices and that this is reflected in oscillatory and non-oscillatory properties of EEG.

As such, they could be a good predictor of brain maturation and cognitive development. We recorded high density EEG in 71 healthy infants (32 females) aged between 3 and 9 months, while they listened to vowel sequences (standard /a/a/a/i/ [80%] and deviant /a/a/a/a/ [20%]). Adaptive skills, a surrogate of cognitive development, were measured via the parent form of the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System Second Edition (ABAS-II). Cortical auditory-evoked potentials (CAEPs) analyses, time-frequency analyses and a statistical approach using linear mixed models (LMMs) and linear regression models were performed. Age and adaptive skills were tested as predictors. Age modulation of repetition effects and change detection response was observed in theta (3-5 Hz), alpha (5-10 Hz) and high gamma (80-90 Hz) oscillations and in all CAEPs. Moreover, adaptive skills modulation of repetition effects was evidenced in theta (3-5 Hz), high gamma oscillations (80-90 Hz), N250/P350 peak-to-peak amplitude and P350 latency. Finally, adaptive skills modulation of change detection response was observed in the N250/P350 peak-to-peak amplitude. Our results confirm that repetition effects and change detection response evolve with age. Moreover, our results suggest that repetition effects and change detection response vary according to adaptive skills displayed by infants during the first year of life, demonstrating their predictive value for neurodevelopment.

Reduced working memory capacity manifests as reduced accuracy in memory recall and prolonged speed of memory retrieval in older adults. Currently, the relationship between healthy older individuals' age-related changes in resting brain oscillations and their working memory capacity is not clear. Eyes-closed resting electroencephalogram (rEEG) is gaining momentum as a potential neuromarker of mild cognitive impairments. Wearable and wireless EEG headset measuring key electrophysiological brain signals during rest and a working memory task was utilized. This research's central hypothesis is that rEEG (e.g., eyes closed for 90 s) frequency and network features are surrogate markers for working memory capacity in healthy older adults. Forty-three older adults' memory performance (accuracy and reaction times), brain oscillations during rest, and inter-channel magnitude-squared coherence during rest were analyzed. We report that individuals with a lower memory retrieval accuracy showed significantly increased alpha and beta oscillations over the right parietal site. Yet, faster working memory retrieval was significantly correlated with increased delta and theta band powers over the left parietal sites. In addition, significantly increased coherence between the left parietal site and the right frontal area is correlated with the faster speed in memory retrieval. The frontal and parietal dynamics of resting EEG is associated with the "accuracy and speed trade-off" during working memory in healthy older adults. Our results suggest that rEEG brain oscillations at local and distant neural circuits are surrogates of working memory retrieval's accuracy and processing speed. Our current findings further indicate that rEEG frequency and coherence features recorded by wearable headsets and a brief resting and task protocol are potential biomarkers for working memory capacity. Additionally, wearable headsets are useful for fast screening of cognitive impairment risk.

Wearable and portable brain-computer interface devices provide a powerful means for real-time monitoring of the vigilance level of drivers to help with avoiding distracted or impaired driving. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for in-vehicle vigilance estimation from Electroencephalogram and Electrooculogram. To enable the system to focus on the most salient parts of the learned multimodal representations, we propose an architecture composed of a capsule attention mechanism following a deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Our model learns hierarchical dependencies in the data through the LSTM and capsule feature representation layers. To better explore the discriminative ability of the learned representations, we study the effect of the proposed capsule attention mechanism including the number of dynamic routing iterations as well as other parameters. Experiments show the robustness of our method by outperforming other solutions and baseline techniques, setting a new state-of-the-art. We then provide an analysis on different frequency bands and brain regions to evaluate their suitability for driver vigilance estimation. Lastly, an analysis on the role of capsule attention, multimodality, and robustness to noise is performed, highlighting the advantages of our approach.

When people perceive speech, low-frequency (<10 Hz) activity in the brain synchronizes with bursts of sound and visual motion. This phenomenon, called cortical stimulus-tracking, is thought to be one way that the brain predicts the timing of upcoming words, phrases, and syllables. In this study, we test whether stimulus-tracking depends on domain-general expertise or on language-specific prediction mechanisms. We go on to examine how the effects of expertise differ between frontal and sensory cortex. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from human participants who were experts in either sign language or ballet, and we compared stimulus-tracking between groups while participants watched videos of sign language or ballet. We measured stimulus-tracking by computing coherence between EEG recordings and visual motion in the videos. Results showed that stimulus-tracking depends on domain-general expertise, and not on language-specific prediction mechanisms. At frontal channels, fluent signers showed stronger coherence to sign language than to dance, whereas expert dancers showed stronger coherence to dance than to sign language. At occipital channels, however, the two groups of participants did not show different patterns of coherence. These results are difficult to explain by entrainment of endogenous oscillations, because neither sign language nor dance show any periodicity at the frequencies of significant expertise-dependent stimulus-tracking. These results suggest that the brain may rely on domain-general predictive mechanisms to optimize perception of temporally-predictable stimuli such as speech, sign language, and dance.

However, little is known about the impact of instructional contexts on student attention, in part due to limitations in our ability to measure attention in the classroom, typically based on behavioral observation and self-reports. To address this issue, we used portable electroencephalography (EEG) measurements of neural oscillations to evaluate the effects of learning context on student attention. The results suggest that attention, as indexed by lower alpha power as well as higher beta and gamma power, is stronger during student-initiated activities than teacher-initiated activities. EEG data revealed different patterns in student attention as compared to standardized coding of attentional behaviors. We conclude that EEG signals offer a powerful tool for understanding differences in student cognitive states as a function of classroom instruction that are unobservable from behavior alone.

Visual inspection of Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a relatively common analytic method of epilepsy, but it is costly, time-consuming and relies on the experiences of the doctor. Therefore, the development of an efficient and accurate epileptic seizure automatic diagnosis system suitable for clinical diagnosis has become an urgent task. In order to better solve the problem of early diagnosis of epileptic and bring timely treatment to patients, the comprehensive representation of k nearest neighbors for multi-distance decision making (CRMKNN) is proposed in this research. In the proposed scheme, Euclidean distance and Hassanat distance are firstly used to select neighbors. Subsequently, the similarity distance is obtained through the linear representation of the nearest neighbors, and calculate the distribution of nearest neighbors in the category to get the discrete distance. Finally, the distance based on the comprehensive representation of the category is used to determine the category of the query EEG signal. In order to verify the method, we used the EEG signals from Bonn university public database and conducted experiments on six kinds of EEG combinations. Experimental results showed that our method could automatically detect seizure in all situations with an accuracy of not less than 99.50%. At the same time, compared with the classification results of existing methods, this method is more effective.

Yet, the neural codes for spatial and temporal information remain unclear, particularly the involvement of neural oscillations in maintaining such codes. To address these issues, we designed an immersive virtual reality environment containing teleporters that displace participants to a different location after entry. Upon exiting the teleporters, participants made judgments from two given options regarding either the distance they had traveled (spatial distance condition) or the duration they had spent inside the teleporters (temporal duration condition). We wirelessly recorded scalp EEG while participants navigated in the virtual environment by physically walking on an omnidirectional treadmill and traveling through teleporters. An exploratory analysis revealed significantly higher alpha and beta power for short-distance versus long-distance traversals, whereas the contrast also revealed significantly higher frontal midline delta-theta-alpha power and global beta power increases for short versus long temporal duration teleportation. Analyses of occipital alpha instantaneous frequencies revealed their sensitivity for both spatial distances and temporal durations, suggesting a novel and common mechanism for both spatial and temporal coding. We further examined the resolution of distance and temporal coding by classifying discretized distance bins and 250-msec time bins based on multivariate patterns of 2- to 30-Hz power spectra, finding evidence that oscillations code fine-scale time and distance information. Together, these findings support partially independent coding schemes for spatial and temporal information, suggesting that low-frequency oscillations play important roles in coding both space and time.

To avoid negative consequences on health and safety, it is very important to detect mental stress at its early stages, i.e., when it is still limited to acute or episodic stress. In this study, we developed an experimental protocol to induce two different levels of stress by utilizing a mental arithmetic task with time pressure and negative feedback as the stressors. We assessed the levels of stress on 22 healthy subjects using frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, salivary alpha-amylase level (AAL), and multiple machine learning (ML) classifiers. The EEG signals were analyzed using a fusion of functional connectivity networks estimated by the Phase Locking Value (PLV) and temporal and spectral domain features. A total of 210 different features were extracted from all domains. Only the optimum multi-domain features were used for classification. We then quantified stress levels using statistical analysis and seven ML classifiers. Our result showed that the AAL level was significantly increased (p < 0.01) under stress condition in all subjects. Likewise, the functional connectivity network demonstrated a significant decrease under stress, p < 0.05. Moreover, we achieved the highest stress classification accuracy of 93.2% using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Other classifiers produced relatively similar results.

Closed-Loop Acoustic Stimulation During Sedation with Dexmedetomidine (CLASS-D): Protocol for a Within-Subject, Crossover, Controlled, Interventional Trial with Healthy Volunteers	NATURE AND SCIENCE OF SLEEP			English	Article						sleep; anesthesia; consciousness; dexmedetomidine; electroencephalography; acoustic stimulation	SLEEP SLOW WAVES; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; RECOVERY	Introduction: The relative power of slow-delta oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG), termed slow-wave activity (SWA), correlates with level of unconsciousness. Acoustic enhancement of SWA has been reported for sleep states, but it remains unknown if pharmacologically induced SWA can be enhanced using sound. Dexmedetomidine is a sedative whose EEG oscillations resemble those of natural sleep. This pilot study was designed to investigate whether SWA can be enhanced using closed-loop acoustic stimulation during sedation (CLASS) with dexmedetomidine. Methods: Closed-Loop Acoustic Stimulation during Sedation with Dexmedetomidine (CLASS-D) is a within-subject, crossover, controlled, interventional trial with healthy volunteers. Each participant will be sedated with a dexmedetomidine target-controlled infusion (TCI). Participants will undergo three CLASS conditions in a multiple crossover design: in-phase (phase-locked to slow-wave upslopes), anti-phase (phase-locked to slow-wave downslopes) and sham (silence). High-density EEG recordings will assess the effects of CLASS across the scalp. A volitional behavioral task and sequential thermal arousals will assess the anesthetic effects of CLASS. Ambulatory sleep studies will be performed on nights immediately preceding and following the sedation session. EEG effects of CLASS will be assessed using linear mixed-effects models. The impacts of CLASS on behavior and arousal thresholds will be assessed using logistic regression modeling. Parametric modeling will determine differences in sleepiness and measures of sleep homeostasis before and after sedation. Results: The primary outcome of this pilot study is the effect of CLASS on EEG slow waves. Secondary outcomes include the effects of CLASS on the following: performance of a volitional task, arousal thresholds, and subsequent sleep. Discussion: This investigation will elucidate 1) the potential of exogenous sensory stimulation to potentiate SWA during sedation; 2) the physiologic significance of this intervention; and 3) the connection between EEG slow-waves observed during sleep and sedation.

Resting-state EEG alpha/theta power ratio discriminates early-onset Alzheimer's disease from healthy controls	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Resting-state EEG; Early-onset AD; Late-onset AD; FFT; Alpha/theta ratio; Power	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID BIOMARKERS; SUBJECTIVE MEMORY COMPLAINTS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; QUANTITATIVE EEG; HIPPOCAMPAL ATROPHY; ALPHA-RHYTHMS; GRAY-MATTER; METABOLIC FUNCTION; BAND OSCILLATIONS	Objectives: The present study aims to compare early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) patients with healthy controls (HC), and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) patients using resting-state delta, theta, alpha, and beta oscillations and provide a cut-off score of alpha/theta ratio to discriminate individuals with EOAD and young HC. Methods: Forty-seven individuals with EOAD, 51 individuals with LOAD, and demographically-matched 49 young and 51 older controls were included in the study. Spectral-power analysis using Fast-Fourier Transformation (FFT) is performed on resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data. Delta, theta, alpha, and beta oscillations compared between groups and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted. Results: Compared to healthy controls individuals with EOAD showed an increase in slow frequency bands and a decrease in fast frequency bands. Frontal alpha/theta power ratio is the best discriminating value between EOAD and young HC with the sensitivity and specificity greater than 80% with area under the curve (AUC) 0.881. Conclusions: EOAD display more widespread and severe electrophysiological abnormalities than LOAD and HC which may reflect more pronounced pathological burden and cholinergic deficits in EOAD. Additionally, the alpha/theta ratio can discriminate EOAD and young HC successfully. Significance: This study is the first to report that resting-state EEG power can be a promising marker for diagnostic accuracy between EOAD and healthy controls.

Research in neuroeconomics can improve our understanding of their causes. We conducted an experiment in which 28 healthy subjects traded in a simulated market bubble, while scalp EEG was recorded using a low-cost, BCI-friendly desktop device with 14 electrodes. Independent component (IC) analysis was performed to decompose brain signals and the obtained scalp topography was used to cluster the ICs. We computed single-trial time-frequency power relative to the onset of stock price display and estimated the correlation between EEG power and stock price across trials using a general linear model. We found that delta band (1-4 Hz) EEG power within the left frontal region negatively correlated with the trial-by-trial stock prices including the financial bubble. We interpreted the result as stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) occurring as a dis-inhibition of the resting state network. We conclude that the combination between the desktop-BCI-friendly EEG, the simulated financial bubble and advanced signal processing and statistical approaches could successfully identify the neural correlate of the financial bubble. We add to the neuroeconomics literature a complementary EEG neurometric as a bubble predictor, which can further be explored in future decision-making experiments.

EEG signals are highly irregular, nonlinear, and nonstationary in nature and are traditionally studied from a linear viewpoint by means of statistical and frequency features. Since, linear metrics present certain limitations and nonlinear methods have proven to be an efficient tool in understanding the complexities of the brain in the identification of underlying behavior of biological signals, such as electrocardiogram, EEG and magnetoencephalogram and thus, can be applied to all nonstationary signals. Various nonlinear algorithms can be used in the analysis of EEG signals. In this research paper, we aim to develop a novel methodology for EEG-based depression diagnosis utilizing 2 advanced computational techniques: frequency-domain extended multivariate autoregressive (eMVAR) and deep learning (DL). We proposed a hybrid method comprising a pretrained ResNet-50 and long-short term memory (LSTM) to capture depression-specific information and compared with a strong conventional machine learning (ML) framework having eMVAR connectivity features. The following 8 causality measures, which interpret the interaction mechanisms among spectrally decomposed oscillations, were used to extract features from multivariate EEG time series: directed coherence (DC), directed transfer function (DTF), partial DC (PDC), generalized PDC (gPDC), extended DC (eDC), delayed DC (dDC), extended PDC (ePDC), and delayed PDC (dPDC). The classification accuracies were 84% with DC, 85% with DTF, 95.3% with PDC, 95.1% with gPDC, 84.8% with eDC, 84.6% with dDC, 84.2% with ePDC, and 95.9% with dPDC for the eMVAR framework. Through a DL framework (ResNet-50 + LSTM), the classification accuracy was achieved as 90.22%. The results demonstrate that our DL methodology is a competitive alternative to the strong feature extraction-based ML methods in depression classification.

Central to the utility of EEG-fMRI neuroimaging systems are the methods for fusing the two data streams, with machine learning playing a key role. These methods can be dichotomized into those that are symmetric and asymmetric in terms of how the two modalities inform the fusion. Studies using these methods have shown that fusion yields new insights into brain function that are not possible when each modality is acquired separately. As technology improves and methods for fusion become more sophisticated, the future of EEG-fMRI for noninvasive measurement of brain dynamics includes mesoscale mapping at ultrahigh magnetic resonance fields, targeted perturbation-based neuroimaging, and using deep learning to uncover nonlinear representations that link the electrophysiological and hemodynamic measurements.

Most datasets used 2D images or videos as mood induction procedures (MIPs); however, considering the differences in EEG dynamics between 2D and 3D environments, experimental research based on 2D MIPs may have poor results being applied in a real 3D world. In this paper, we (1) developed a new emotion EEG dataset, virtual reality (VR) emotional EEG dataset (VREED), which used 3D VR videos as MIPs; and (2) Presented a baseline for the performance of negative/positive emotion classification in the new dataset. The best average accuracy of 73.77% +/- 2.01% was obtained by using the combination of theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-49 Hz) relative power features. Additionally, we observed that occipital and frontal regions played a more critical role than other regions in emotion processing from Spearman correlation analysis and feature selection. This new VR emotion EEG dataset will be publicly available, and we encourage other researchers to evaluate their emotion classification methods on the VREED.

For example, 3D games can enhance participants' working memory, thereby improving their learning efficiency, and the powerful immersion of VR games can improve the attention of patients with ADHD. However, previous works have not elaborated to what extent the two different game modes can affect cognitive ability respectively, nor have they determined which game mode has a greater effect on the cognitive level. Exploring the impact of different game modes on cognitive ability can help better apply gamification to the training and improvement of cognitive ability, and quantifying cognitive ability through human physiological signals such as brain electrical activity level (EEG) can help evaluate the changes of cognitive ability in different game modes more accurately. Therefore, different from previous studies, we used EEG signals and game performance data (such as game scores and time to complete the game) to calculate participants' cognitive level quantitatively, and did comparative experiments to study cognitive abilities in different game modes and the temporal characteristics of cognitive ability changes. We also explored whether gender would affect cognitive ability. Our research has the following findings. First, compared with the 3D mode, participants get better game scores and higher EEG scores in the VR mode, the time to complete the game task is shorter, and the time to reach the best state of working memory is shorter. Second, participants' gender has no significant effect on working memory, but there is a significant difference in attention in the VR game mode, it takes less time for males to reach the peak of attention than for females. Our conclusion indicates that VR games have greater potential in the field of training and enhancing cognitive ability than 3D games.

Accurate detection of HFOs is the key to pre-operative assessment for epilepsy. Due to the subjective bias caused by manual features and the class imbalance between HFOs and false HFOs, it is difficult to obtain satisfactory detection performance by the existing methods. To solve these problems, we put forward a novel method to accurately detect HFOs based on the stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) and the ensemble classifier with sample weight adjusting factors. First, the adjustable threshold of Hilbert envelopes is proposed to isolate the events of interest (EoIs) from background activities. Then, the SDAE network is utilized to automatically extract features of EoIs in the time-frequency domain. Finally, the AdaBoost-based support vector machine ensemble classifier with sample weight adjusting factors is devised to separate HFOs from EoIs by using the extracted features. These adjusting factors are used to solve the class imbalance problem by adjusting sample weights when learning the base classifiers. Our HFO detection method is evaluated by using clinical iEEG data recorded from 20 patients with medically refractory epilepsy. The experimental results show that our detection method outperforms some existing methods in terms of sensitivity and false discovery rate. In addition, the HFOs detected by our method are effective for localizing seizure onset zones.

The steepness of this 'roll-off' is approximated by the spectral exponent, which in invasively recorded neural populations reflects the balance of excitatory to inhibitory neural activity (E:I balance). Here, we first establish that the spectral exponent of non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) recordings is highly sensitive to general (i.e., anaesthesia-driven) changes in E:I balance. Building on the EEG spectral exponent as a viable marker of E:I, we then demonstrate its sensitivity to the focus of selective attention in an EEG experiment during which participants detected targets in simultaneous audio-visual noise. In addition to these endogenous changes in E:I balance, EEG spectral exponents over auditory and visual sensory cortices also tracked auditory and visual stimulus spectral exponents, respectively. Individuals' degree of this selective stimulus-brain coupling in spectral exponents predicted behavioural performance. Our results highlight the rich information contained in 1/f-like neural activity, providing a window into diverse neural processes previously thought to be inaccessible in non-invasive human recordings.

Emotion recognition based on EEG signals has attracted growing attention of researchers, especially with the fast progress of intelligent sensing technology. Numerous methods for the issue of EEG-based emotion classification have been presented in recent years. Although these methods have promoted the research development of this issue, the performance enhancement seems very slow, because the useful emotional information is quite weak compared with severe noise interferences and serious data variations. To capture the weak emotional information from the EEG signals that are distorted by various disturbances, this paper proposes a novel and effective approach, "Spatio-Temporal Field (STF)". This method extracts the Rational Asymmetry of Spectral Power features from the EEG signals at first, and then divides the feature space into the local field via the set-based discriminative measure, and finally employs the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory in the local field to exploit the local dynamic information for emotion classification. Experimental results have demonstrated the advantage of STF in EEG-based emotion classification by the public challenging databases, DEAP and DREAMER. STF can be regarded as an initial attempt to deal with the issue of EEG-based emotion classification from the local field perspective. We expect that the proposed method not only can provide inspirations for the further research on this issue, but may also enrich the field methodology for more general signal classification topics.

Automated preprocessing and phase-amplitude coupling analysis of scalp EEG discriminates infantile spasms from controls during wakefulness	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Preprocessing; Artifact rejection; Artifact subspace reconstruction; Independent component analysis; Phase-amplitude coupling	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SEIZURE-ONSET; WEST-SYNDROME; HYPSARRHYTHMIA; RIPPLES; CHILDREN; SLEEP; GAMMA; TIME	Objective: Delta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling in EEG is useful for localizing epileptic sources and to evaluate severity in children with infantile spasms. We (1) develop an automated EEG preprocessing pipeline to clean data using artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR) and independent component (IC) analysis (ICA) and (2) evaluate delta-gamma modulation index (MI) as a method to distinguish children with epileptic spasms (cases) from normal controls during sleep and awake. Methods: Using 400 scalp EEG datasets (200 sleep, 200 awake) from 100 subjects, we calculated MI after applying high-pass and line-noise filters (Clean 0), and after ASR followed by either conservative (Clean 1) or stringent (Clean 2) artifactual IC rejection. Classification of cases and controls using MI was evaluated with Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) to obtain area under curve (AUC). Results: The artifact rejection algorithm reduced raw signal variance by 29-45% and 38-60% for Clean 1 and Clean 2, respectively. MI derived from sleep data, with or without preprocessing, robustly classified the groups (all AUC > 0.98). In contrast, group classification using MI derived from awake data was successful only after Clean 2 (AUC = 0.85). Conclusions: We have developed an automated EEG preprocessing pipeline to perform artifact rejection and quantify delta-gamma modulation index.

Recently, the psychometric properties of two widely used neural measures in early childhood-frontal alpha asymmetry and delta-beta coupling-have come under scrutiny. Despite their growing use, additional work examining how the psychometric properties of these neural signatures may change across infancy is needed. The current study examined the developmental stability, split-half reliability, and construct validity of infant frontal alpha asymmetry and delta-beta coupling. Infants provided resting-state EEG data at 8, 12, and 18 months of age (N = 213). Frontal alpha asymmetry and delta-beta coupling showed significant developmental change from 8 to 18 months. Reliability for alpha asymmetry, and alpha, delta, and beta power, individually, was generally good. In contrast, the reliability of delta-beta coupling scores was poor. Associations between frontal alpha asymmetry and approach tendencies generally emerged, whereas stronger (over-coupled) delta-beta coupling scores were associated with profiles of dysregulation and low inhibition. However, the individual associations varied across time and specific measures of interest. We discuss these findings with a developmental lens, highlighting the importance of repeated measures to better understand links between neural signatures and typical and atypical development.

To our knowledge, this is the first time the specific role of touch has been investigated by means of a neuroscientific approach during consumer in-store experience within the field of sensory marketing. This study explores the presence of distinct cortical brain oscillations in consumers' brain while navigating a store that provides a high level of sensory arousal and being allowed or not to touch products. A 16-channel wireless electroencephalogram (EEG) was applied to 23 healthy participants (mean age = 24.57 years, SD = 3.54), with interest in cosmetics but naive about the store explored. Subjects were assigned to two experimental conditions based on the chance of touching or not touching the products. Cortical oscillations were explored by means of power spectral analysis of the following frequency bands: delta, theta, alpha, and beta. Results highlighted the presence of delta, theta, and beta bands within the frontal brain regions during both sensory conditions. The absence of touch was experienced as a lack of perception that needs cognitive control, as reflected by Delta and Theta band left activation, whereas a right increase of Beta band for touch condition was associated with sustained awareness on the sensory experience. Overall, EEG cortical oscillations' functional meaning could help highlight the neurophysiological implicit responses to tactile conditions and the importance of touch integration in consumers' experience.

Automated detection of ripple oscillations in long-term scalp EEG from patients with infantile spasms	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						epilepsy; high-frequency oscillation; scalp electroencephalography; prospective; pediatric; west syndrome	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPTIC SPASMS; INTERRATER RELIABILITY; WEST-SYNDROME; HYPSARRHYTHMIA; SLEEP; GAMMA; HZ; EPILEPTOGENICITY; ENCEPHALOPATHY	Objective. Scalp high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a promising biomarker of epileptogenicity in infantile spasms (IS) and many other epilepsy syndromes, but prior studies have relied on visual analysis of short segments of data due to the prevalence of artifacts in EEG. Here we set out to robustly characterize the rate and spatial distribution of HFOs in large datasets from IS subjects using fully automated HFO detection techniques. Approach. We prospectively collected long-term scalp EEG data from 12 subjects with IS and 18 healthy controls. For patients with IS, recording began prior to diagnosis and continued through initiation of treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The median analyzable EEG duration was 18.2 h for controls and 84.5 h for IS subjects (similar to 1300 h total). Ripples (80-250 Hz) were detected in all EEG data using an automated algorithm. Main results. HFO rates were substantially higher in patients with IS compared to controls. In IS patients, HFO rates were higher during sleep compared to wakefulness (median 5.5 min(-1) and 2.9 min(-1), respectively; p = 0.002); controls did not exhibit a difference in HFO rate between sleep and wakefulness (median 0.98 min(-1) and 0.82 min(-1), respectively). Spatially, IS patients exhibited significantly higher rates of HFOs in the posterior parasaggital region and significantly lower HFO rates in frontal channels, and this difference was more pronounced during sleep. In IS subjects, ACTH therapy significantly decreased the rate of HFOs. Significance. Here we provide a detailed characterization of the spatial distribution and rates of HFOs associated with IS, which may have relevance for diagnosis and assessment of treatment response. We also demonstrate that our fully automated algorithm can be used to detect HFOs in long-term scalp EEG with sufficient accuracy to clearly discriminate healthy subjects from those with IS.

J	Arsalan, A; Majid, M				Arsalan, Aamir; Majid, Muhammad			Human stress classification during public speaking using physiological signals	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Human stress wearable sensors physiological; signals multimodal fusionPublic speaking	MENTAL STRESS; INVENTORY; SYSTEM; SCALE; TASK	Public speaking is a common type of social evaluative situation and a significant amount of the population feel uneasy with it. It is of utmost importance to detect public speaking stress so that appropriate action can be taken to minimize its impacts on human health. In this study, a multimodal human stress classification scheme in response to real-life public speaking activity is proposed. Electroencephalography (EEG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals of forty participants are acquired in rest-state and during public speaking activity to divide data into a stressed and non-stressed group. Frequency domain features from EEG and time-domain features from GSR and PPG signals are extracted. The selected set of features from all modalities are fused to classify the stress into two classes. Classification is performed via a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme by using five different classifiers. The highest accuracy of 96.25% is achieved using a support vector machine classifier with radial basis function. Statistical analysis is performed to examine the significance of EEG, GSR, and PPG signals between the two phases of the experiment. Statistical significance is found in certain EEG frequency bands as well as GSR and PPG data recorded before and after public speaking supporting the fact that brain activity, skin conductance, and blood volumetric flow are credible measures of human stress during public speaking activity.

J	Kouti, M; Ansari-Asl, K; Namjoo, E				Kouti, Mayadeh; Ansari-Asl, Karim; Namjoo, Ehsan			Emotion discrimination using source connectivity analysis based on dynamic ROI identification	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Connectivity Analysis; Region of Interest (ROI); Emotion Recognition; EEG Inverse Problem	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; VOLUME-CONDUCTION; EEG DATA; BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; MEG; NETWORKS	Emotion plays a predominant role in external situations or events in daily life. Different emotions display different connectivity patterns through related information processing. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotional recognition is a controversial subject in the field of affective computing. However, EEG recordings are mixed-signals and cannot show the exact information about active sources from different emotional states. In this paper, we propose a method for emotion discrimination based on the source connectivity method. Features are extracted as connectivity patterns in different frequency bands based on emotion-based reconstructed EEG sources using sLORETA. In order to identify most related brain regions to emotions, we identify data-driven spatially compact regions, called regions of interest (ROIs), based on the reconstructed neural activity. Also, to estimates ROI time series with the intrinsic non-stationarity of neural activity, an iterative dynamic approach is used. The method explicitly contains a dynamic constraint, considering the neural activity evolution for advance connectivity analysis. Throughout this study, we consider three connectivity measures widely applied to emotion recordings including, iCoh, PLV, and WPLI. In the next step, the connectivity patterns are used as features to discriminate emotion states by training an SVM classifier. The performance of the proposed method is assessed over a real high-resolution emotional database. This study reveals that the proposed method can identify meaningful connection features between main emotion-related brain regions, leading to higher interpretability and accuracy. Our results demonstrate that the ROI-wise iCoh features enhance the average of accuracy up to 83.84% in comparison with raw EEG features (71.70%).

Large-scale dynamical functional network connectivity (dFNC) provides a more context-sensitive, dynamical, and straightforward sight at a higher network level. Nevertheless, dFNC analysis needs good enough resolution in both temporal and spatial domains, and the construction of dFNC needs to capture the time-varying correlations between two multivariate time series with unmatched spatial dimensions. Effective methods still lack. With well-developed source imaging techniques, electroencephalogram (EEG) has the potential to possess both high temporal and spatial resolutions. Therefore, we proposed to construct the EEG large-scale cortical dFNC based on brain atlas to probe the subtle dynamic activities in the brain and developed a novel method, that is, wavelet coherence-S estimator (WTCS), to assess the dynamic couplings among functional subnetworks with different spatial dimensions. The simulation study demonstrated its robustness and availability of applying to dFNC. The application in real EEG data revealed the appealing ``Primary peak'' and ``P3-like peak'' in dFNC network properties and meaningful evolutions in dFNC network topology for P300. Our study brings new insights for probing brain activities at a more dynamical and higher hierarchical level and pushing forward the development of brain-inspired artificial neural networks. The proposed WTCS not only benefits the dFNC studies but also gives a new solution to capture the time-varying couplings between the multivariate time series that is often encountered in signal processing disciplines.

High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are promising new biomarkers for epileptogenic tissue and can be found in intracranial and surface EEG. To date, we cannot reliably predict which neonates with seizures will develop childhood epilepsy. We questioned whether epileptic HFOs can be generated by the neonatal brain and potentially predict epilepsy. Methods: We selected 24 surface EEGs sampled at 2048 Hz with 175 seizures from 16 neonates and visually reviewed them for HFOs. Interictal epochs were also reviewed. Results: We found HFOs in thirteen seizures (7%) from four neonates (25%). 5025 ictal ripples (rate 10 to 1311/min; mean frequency 135 Hz; mean duration 66 ms) and 1427 fast ripples (rate 8 to 356/min; mean frequency 298 Hz; mean duration 25 ms) were marked. Two neonates (13%) showed interictal HFOs (285 ripples and 25 fast ripples). Almost all HFOs co-occurred with sharp transients. We could not find a relationship between neonatal HFOs and outcome yet. Conclusions: Neonatal HFOs co-occur with ictal and interictal sharp transients. Significance: The neonatal brain can generate epileptic ripples and fast ripples, particularly during seizures, though their occurrence is not common and potential clinical value not evident yet.

J	Malan, NS; Sharma, S				Malan, Nitesh Singh; Sharma, Shiru			Time window and frequency band optimization using regularized neighbourhood component analysis for Multi-View Motor Imagery EEG classification	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Dual-tree complex wavelet transform; Electroencephalogram; Motor imagery; Neighbourhood component analysis	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; SELECTION; FILTERS	Spatial features optimized at frequency bands have been widely used in motor imagery (MI) based braincomputer interface (BCI) systems. However, using a fixed time window of electroencephalogram (EEG) to extract discriminatory features results in suboptimal MI classification performance because time latency during MI tasks is inconsistent between different subjects. Thus, apart from frequency band optimization, time window optimization is equally important to develop a subject-specific MI-BCI. With time windows, extracted feature space becomes a higher-order tensor problem that requires multi-view learning approaches to optimize features. This study proposes a novel multi-view feature selection method based on regularized neighbourhood component analysis to simultaneously optimize time windows and frequency bands. In the experiment, we extracted spatial features using common spatial patterns (CSP) from MI related EEG data at multiple time windows and frequency bands and optimized them using the proposed feature selection method. A support vector machine is trained to classify optimized CSP features to identify MI tasks. The proposed method achieved classification accuracies on three public BCI datasets (BCI competition IV dataset 2a, BCI competition III dataset IIIa, and BCI competition IV dataset 2b), which are 82.1 %, 91.7 %, and 84.5 %, respectively. Obtained results are superior to those obtained using standard competing algorithms. Hence, the proposed multi-view learning approach for simultaneous optimization of time windows and frequency bands of MI signals shows the potential to enhance a practical MI BCI device?s performance.

To overcome the fatigue obstacle, the first step is to detect the fatigue accurately, reliably and quickly. This paper proposes an approach based on the wavelet entropy of the measured EEG to fatigue detection in real time when using an SSVEP-BCI. Specifically, the wavelet analysis is first applied to the EEG, resulting in the approximation and detail components at different levels. The sample entropy values of these components are then calculated to generate features for classification. Experimental results identified the entropy of the lower frequency components (0 - 4.6875Hz) as the most important feature. The proposed wavelet entropy improved the fatigue detection accuracy to 87.7% from 65.1% by the traditional entropy method, when distinguishing subjects' mental states between alert (before task) and fatigue (after task). Furthermore, the detection accuracy based on the state of art multiple conventional fatigue indices can be improved from 91.9% to 96.5% by replacing the delta band amplitude with the new wavelet entropy feature.

In particular, since electroencephalogram (EEG) signals represent the cognitive and emotional states of the user, many studies have been conducted to apply them. However, due to the nonlinear features of EEG signals, the extraction and analysis of individual-specific features become problematic matters. Thus, a user recognition algorithm, which applies the time frequency feature analysis method to EEG signal to solve these problems, is presented in this paper. First, Emperical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is applied to the EEG signal decomposing it into an Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) signal. The decomposed IMF signal is converted into a spectrogram for time frequency feature exfraction and then applied to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize the user. To verify user recognition performance, 109 subjects used the EEG Motor Movement/Imagery open data-set acquired through the 64 channels for one minute. The experiments prove that the user recognition performance was 75.7% for the method proposed in this paper, while the performance was improved 5. 1% better than previous studies using the spatial frequency feature analysis method.

Past findings on this issue have been mixed, partly due to the difficulty in collecting and isolating the relevant information. The purpose of this study was to contribute to this new and important literature. Research Question: Can left versus right imagined stepping be differentiated using the alpha, beta, and gamma frequencies of EEG data at four electrodes (C1, C2, PO3, and PO4)? Methods: An experiment was conducted with a sample of 16 healthy male participants. They imagined left and right lower limb movements across 60 trials at two time periods separated by one week. Participants were fitted with a 64-electrode headcap, lay supine on a specially designed device and then completed the imagined task while observing a customized computer-generated image of a human walking to signify the left and right steps, respectively. Results: Findings showed that eight of the twelve frequency bands from 4 EEG electrodes were significant in differentiating imagined left from right lower limb movement. Using these data points, a neural network analysis resulted in an overall participant average test classification accuracy of left versus right movements at 63 %. Significance: Our study provides support for using the alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands at the sensorimotor areas (C1 and C2 electrodes) and incorporating information from the parietal/occipital lobes (PO3 and PO4 electrodes) for focused, real-time EEG signal processing to assist in creating a BCI for those with lower limb compromised mobility.

A low-complexity electroencephalography (EEG)-based seizure monitoring algorithm is critically important for daily use, especially for wearable monitoring platforms. This paper presents a personalized EEG feature selection approach, which is the key to achieve a reliable seizure monitoring with a low computational cost. We advocate a two-step, personalized feature selection strategy to enhance monitoring performances for each patient. In the first step, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is applied to find a few seizure-indicative channels. Then in the second step, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method is employed to select a discriminative subset of both frequency and time domain features (spectral powers and entropy). A personalization strategy is further customized to find the best settings (number of channels and features) that yield the highest classification scores for each subject. Experimental results of analyzing 23 subjects in CHB-MIT database are quite promising. We have achieved an average F-1 score of 88% with excellent sensitivity and specificity using not more than 7 features extracted from at most 3 channels.

Methods: We employed 68 after-slow activities preceded by 32 EDs (26 sharp waves and six spikes) and 36 Sts from 52 patients with partial and generalized epilepsy (22 men, 30 women; mean age 39.08 +/- 13.13 years) defined by visual inspection. High-frequency activity (HFA) associated with the apical component of EDs and Sts was also investigated to endorse two groups. After separating nine Sts that were labeled by visual inspection but did not fulfill the amplitude criteria for after-slow of Sts, 59 activities (32 EDs and 27 Sts) were analyzed about the total area of after-slow under three TCs (long: 2 s; conventional: 0.3 s; and short: 0.1 s). Results: Compared to Sts, HFA was found significantly more with the apical component of EDs (p < 0.05). The total area of after-slow in all 32 EDs under TC 2 s was significantly larger than those under TC 0.3 s and 0.1 s (p < 0.001). Conversely, no significant differences were observed in the same parameter of 27 Sts among the three different TCs. Regarding separated nine Sts, the total area of after-slow showed a similar tendency to that of 27 Sts under three different TCs. Significance: These results suggest that long TC could be useful for selectively endorsing after-slow of EDs and differentiating EDs from Sts. These findings are concordant with the results of the HFA analysis. Visual inspection is also equally good as the total area of after-slow analysis.

Children with Cerebral Palsy Have Altered Occipital Cortical Oscillations during a Visuospatial Attention Task	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						brain imaging; magnetoencephalography; MEG; vision; visual perception	VISUAL-PERCEPTUAL IMPAIRMENT; GAMMA-OSCILLATION; EEG; MOTOR; MEG; BETA; ABNORMALITIES; FEEDFORWARD; MODULATION; NAVIGATION	Dynamically allocating neural resources to salient features or objects within our visual space is fundamental to making rapid and accurate decisions. Impairments in such visuospatial abilities have been consistently documented in the clinical literature on individuals with cerebral palsy (CP), although the underlying neural mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) and oscillatory analysis methods to examine visuospatial processing in children with CP and demographically matched typically developing (TD) children. Our results indicated robust oscillations in the theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-14 Hz), and gamma (64-80 Hz) frequency bands in the occipital cortex of both groups during visuospatial processing. Importantly, the group with CP exhibited weaker cortical oscillations in the theta and gamma frequency bands, as well as slower response times and worse accuracy during task performance compared to the TD children. Furthermore, we found that weaker theta and gamma oscillations were related to greater visuospatial performance deficits across both groups. We propose that the weaker occipital oscillations seen in children with CP may reflect poor bottom-up processing of incoming visual information, which subsequently affects the higher-order visual computations essential for accurate visual perception and integration for decision-making.

Wavelet-based neurovascular coupling can predict brain abnormalities in neonatal encephalopathy	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Neurovascular coupling; Wavelet coherence analysis; Neonatal EEG analysis; Amplitude-integrated EEG; Near infrared spectroscopy; Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy	HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; AMPLITUDE-INTEGRATED ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; CEREBRAL HEMODYNAMICS; PERINATAL ASPHYXIA; BIRTH ASPHYXIA; SERIAL MRI; TERM; HYPOTHERMIA; INJURY; INFANTS	Background: Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates, but quantitative methods to predict outcomes early in their course of illness remain elusive. Real-time physiologic biomarkers of neurologic injury are needed in order to predict which neonates will benefit from therapies. Neurovascular coupling (NVC) describes the correlation of neural activity with cerebral blood flow, and the degree of impairment could predict those at risk for poor outcomes. Objective: To determine if neurovascular coupling (NVC) calculated in the first 24-hours of life based on wavelet transform coherence analysis (WTC) of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) can predict abnormal brain MRI in neonatal HIE. Methods: WTC analysis was performed between dynamic oscillations of simultaneously recorded aEEG and cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO2) signals for the first 24 h after birth. The squared cross-wavelet coherence, R2, of the time-frequency domain described by the WTC, is a localized correlation coefficient (ranging between 0 and 1) between these two signals in the time-frequency domain. Statistical analysis was based on Monte Carlo simulation with a 95% confidence interval to identify the time-frequency areas from the WTC scalograms. Brain MRI was performed on all neonates and classified as normal or abnormal based on an accepted classification system for HIE. Wavelet metrics of % significant SctO2-aEEG coherence was compared between the normal and abnormal MRI groups. Result: This prospective study recruited a total of 36 neonates with HIE. A total of 10 had an abnormal brain MRI while 26 had normal MRI. The analysis showed that the SctO2-aEEG coherence between the group with normal and abnormal MRI were significantly different (p = 0.0007) in a very low-frequency (VLF) range of 0.06-0.2 mHz. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the use of WTC-analysis of NVC had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.808, and with a cutoff of 10% NVC. Sensitivity was 69%, specificity was 90%, positive predictive value (PPV) was 94%, and negative predictive value (NPV) was 52% for predicting brain injury on MRI. This was superior to the clinical Total Sarnat score (TSS) where AUC was 0.442 with sensitivity 61.5%, specificity 30%, PPV 75%, and NPV 31%. Conclusion: NVC is a promising neurophysiological biomarker in neonates with HIE, and in our prospective cohort was superior to the clinical Total Sarnat score for prediction of abnormal brain MRI.

Viability of Preictal High-Frequency Oscillation Rates as a Biomarker for Seizure Prediction	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						epilepsy; seizure prediction; preictal identification; high frequency oscillation; ROC analysis		Motivation: There is an ongoing search for definitive and reliable biomarkers to forecast or predict imminent seizure onset, but to date most research has been limited to EEG with sampling rates <1,000 Hz. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have gained acceptance as an indicator of epileptic tissue, but few have investigated the temporal properties of HFOs or their potential role as a predictor in seizure prediction. Here we evaluate time-varying trends in preictal HFO rates as a potential biomarker of seizure prediction. Methods: HFOs were identified for all interictal and preictal periods with a validated automated detector in 27 patients who underwent intracranial EEG monitoring. We used LASSO logistic regression with several features of the HFO rate to distinguish preictal from interictal periods in each individual. We then tested these models with held-out data and evaluated their performance with the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of their receiver-operating curve (ROC). Finally, we assessed the significance of these results using non-parametric statistical tests. Results: There was variability in the ability of HFOs to discern preictal from interictal states across our cohort. We identified a subset of 10 patients in whom the presence of the preictal state could be successfully predicted better than chance. For some of these individuals, average AUC in the held-out data reached higher than 0.80, which suggests that HFO rates can significantly differentiate preictal and interictal periods for certain patients. Significance: These findings show that temporal trends in HFO rate can predict the preictal state better than random chance in some individuals. Such promising results indicate that future prediction efforts would benefit from the inclusion of high-frequency information in their predictive models and technological architecture.

Our understanding of this has advanced substantially with the development of multivariate decoding analyses. However, conventional electroencephalography (EEG) decoding predominantly uses the mean neural activation within the analysis window to extract category information. Such temporal averaging overlooks the within-trial neural variability that is suggested to provide an additional channel for the encoding of information about the complexity and uncertainty of the sensory input. The richness of temporal variabilities, however, has not been systematically compared with the conventional mean activity. Here we compare the information content of 31 variability-sensitive features against the mean of activity, using three independent highly varied data sets. In whole-trial decoding, the classical event-related potential (ERP) components of P2a and P2b provided information comparable to those provided by original magnitude data (OMD) and wavelet coefficients (WC), the two most informative variability-sensitive features. In time-resolved decoding, the OMD and WC outperformed all the other features (including the mean), which were sensitive to limited and specific aspects of temporal variabilities, such as their phase or frequency. The information was more pronounced in the theta frequency band, previously suggested to support feedforward visual processing. We concluded that the brain might encode the information in multiple aspects of neural variabilities simultaneously such as phase, amplitude, and frequency rather than mean per se. In our active categorization data set, we found that more effective decoding of the neural codes corresponds to better prediction of behavioral performance. Therefore, the incorporation of temporal variabilities in time-resolved decoding can provide additional category information and improved prediction of behavior.

Previous studies, however, have emphasized time?frequency power changes, while overlooking the possibility that rhythmic amplitude variations can also code frequency-specific VWM information in a completely different dimension. Here, we employed the recently-developed Holo-Hilbert spectral analysis to characterize such nonlinear amplitude modulation(s) (AM) underlying VWM in the frontoparietal systems. We found that the strength of AM in mid-frontal beta and gamma oscillations during late VWM maintenance and VWM retrieval correlated with people?s VWM performance. When behavioral performance was altered with transcranial electric stimulation, AM power changes during late VWM maintenance in beta, but not gamma, tracked participants? VWM variations.

J	Donoghue, T; Schaworonkow, N; Voytek, B				Donoghue, Thomas; Schaworonkow, Natalie; Voytek, Bradley			Methodological considerations for studying neural oscillations	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						digital signal processing; electrophysiology; neural field data; time series analysis; spectral analysis	EEG SOURCE LOCALIZATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; SIGNAL ANALYSIS; ALPHA; MEG; RHYTHMS; MECHANISMS; AMPLITUDE	Neural oscillations are ubiquitous across recording methodologies and species, broadly associated with cognitive tasks, and amenable to computational modelling that investigates neural circuit generating mechanisms and neural population dynamics. Because of this, neural oscillations offer an exciting potential opportunity for linking theory, physiology and mechanisms of cognition. However, despite their prevalence, there are many concerns-new and old-about how our analysis assumptions are violated by known properties of field potential data. For investigations of neural oscillations to be properly interpreted, and ultimately developed into mechanistic theories, it is necessary to carefully consider the underlying assumptions of the methods we employ. Here, we discuss seven methodological considerations for analysing neural oscillations. The considerations are to (1) verify the presence of oscillations, as they may be absent; (2) validate oscillation band definitions, to address variable peak frequencies; (3) account for concurrent non-oscillatory aperiodic activity, which might otherwise confound measures; measure and account for (4) temporal variability and (5) waveform shape of neural oscillations, which are often bursty and/or nonsinusoidal, potentially leading to spurious results; (6) separate spatially overlapping rhythms, which may interfere with each other; and (7) consider the required signal-to-noise ratio for obtaining reliable estimates. For each topic, we provide relevant examples, demonstrate potential errors of interpretation, and offer suggestions to address these issues. We primarily focus on univariate measures, such as power and phase estimates, though we discuss how these issues can propagate to multivariate measures. These considerations and recommendations offer a helpful guide for measuring and interpreting neural oscillations.

Previous evidence and theoretical models suggest that the implementation of a novel instruction requires the reformatting of its declarative content into an action-oriented code optimized for the execution of the instructed behavior. While neuroimaging research focused on identifying the brain areas involved in such a process, the temporal and electrophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. These mechanisms, however, can provide information about the specific cognitive processes that characterize the proceduralization of information. In the present study, we recorded EEG activity while we asked participants to either simply maintain declaratively the content of novel S-R mappings or to proactively prepare for their implementation. By means of time-frequency analyses, we isolated the oscillatory features specific to the proceduralization of instructions. Implementation of the instructed mappings elicited stronger theta activity over frontal electrodes and suppression in mu and beta activity over central electrodes. On the contrary, activity in the alpha band, which has been shown to track the attentional deployment to task-relevant items, showed no differences between tasks. Together, these results support the idea that proceduralization of information is characterized by specific component processes such as orchestrating complex task settings and configuring the motor system that are not observed when instructions are held in a declarative format.

This paper presents the cognitive response to emotional speech and emotion recognition from EEG signals. A framework is proposed to recognize mental states from EEG signals induced by emotional speech: First, speech-evoked emotion cognitive experiment is designed, and EEG dataset is collected. Second, power-related features are extracted using EEMD-HHT, which is more accurate to reflect the instantaneous frequency of the signal than STFT and WT. An extensive analysis of relationships between frequency bands and emotional annotation of stimulus are presented using MIC and statistical analysis. The strongest correlations with EEG signals are found in lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Finally, the performance of different feature set and classifier combinations are evaluated, and the experiments show that the framework proposed in this paper can effectively recognize emotion from EEG signals with accuracy of 75.7% for valence and 71.4% for arousal.

We discuss the relationship between stress as human factor and cerebral and muscular signals as features. Ten male paraplegic, right-handed subjects were volunteers for the experiment (mean age 34 +/- 6). They drove a virtual wheelchair in an indoor environment. They filled five missions where, in each one, an environmental parameter was changed. Meanwhile, they were equipped with Electromyography (EMG) sensors and Electroencephalography (EEG). Frequency and temporal features were filtered and extracted. Principal component analysis (PCA), Fisher's tests, repeated measure Anova and post hoc Tukey test (alpha = 0.05) were implemented for statistics. Environmental modifications are subject to induce stress, which impacts muscular and cerebral activities. While the time pressure parameter was the most influent, the transition from static to moving obstacles (avatars), tends to have a significant impact on stress levels. However, adding more moving obstacles did not show any impact. A synchronization factor was noticed between cerebral and muscular features in higher stress levels. Further examination is needed to assess EEG reliability in these situations.

J	Zhao, X; Wang, ZY; Zhang, M; Hu, HL				Zhao, Xi; Wang, Zhenyu; Zhang, Min; Hu, Honglin			A comfortable steady state visual evoked potential stimulation paradigm using peripheral vision	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG); steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP); comfortable stimulation paradigm; task-related component analysis (TRCA); brain&#8211; computer interface (BCI)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; COMMUNICATION	Objective. Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can cause much visual discomfort if the users use the SSVEP-BCIs for a long time. As an alternative scheme to reduce users' visual fatigue, this study proposes a new stimulation paradigm (termed as steady state peripheral visual evoked potential, abbreviated as SSPVEP) which makes full use of peripheral vision. The electroencephalography (EEG) signals are classifiable which means this proposed stimulation paradigm can be used in BCI system with the aid of the latest hybrid signal processing approach. Approach. Under the SSPVEP stimulation paradigm, 20 targets are mounted on 20 frequencies and other targets are set between two targets with flicker stimuli coding. In order to ensure the classification accuracy of SSPVEP signal detection under the proposed stimulation paradigm, two optimization schemes are proposed for the detection stage of the conventional ensemble task-related component analysis (ETRCA) algorithm. The first optimization scheme uses nonlinear correlation coefficient at the detection part for the first time to improve the classification accuracy of the system. The second optimization scheme uses gamma correction to enhance the time domain features of the SSPVEP signals, and uses Manhattan distance for the final detection. Main results. According to the response waveforms of the EEG signals generated under the SSPVEP stimulation paradigm and the results of the questionnaire on user's comfort level to the two stimulation paradigms (SSPVEP paradigm and conventional SSVEP paradigm), the proposed stimulation paradigm brings less visual fatigue. The comparison results indicate that the proposed detection methods (ETRCA + gamma correction + Manhattan distance, ETRCA + Spearman correlation) can greatly improve the classification accuracy compared with the individual template canonical correlation analysis method and conventional ETRCA method based on Pearson correlation. Significance. The SSPVEP stimulation paradigm reduces users' visual fatigue via using peripheral vision, which provides a new design idea for SSVEP stimulation paradigm aimed at visual comfort.

When compared with the low-altitude individuals, the reaction time of mental rotation tasks was significantly slower in immigrants who had lived in high-altitude areas for 3 years. The time-frequency analysis showed that the alpha ERD and the beta ERD within the time window (400-700 ms) were decreased during the mental rotation tasks in these immigrants. The decreased ERD was observed at the parietal-occipital regions within the alpha band and at the central-parietal regions within the beta band. The decreased ERD might embody the sensorimotor-related cortical activity from hypoxia, which might be involved in cognitive control function in high-altitude immigrants, which provided insights into the neural mechanism of spatial cognition change on aspect of embodied cognition due to high-altitude exposure.

Recently, commonalities between conditions associated with burst-suppression patterns have led to new insights into the origin of burst-suppression EEG patterns, their effects on the brain, and their use as a therapeutic tool for protection against deleterious neural states. These insights have been further supported by advances in mechanistic modeling of burst suppression. In this Perspective, we review the origins of burst-suppression patterns and use recent insights to weigh evidence in the controversy regarding the extent to which burst-suppression patterns observed during profound anesthetic-induced brain inactivation are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Whether the clinical intent is to avoid or maintain the brain in a state producing burst-suppression patterns, monitoring and controlling neural activity presents a technical challenge. We discuss recent advances that enable monitoring and control of burst suppression.

Brain electrical dynamics in speech segmentation depends upon prior experience with the language	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Speech segmentation; Speech tracking; EEG; Prior language experience	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; CORTICAL ENTRAINMENT; PRIOR KNOWLEDGE; PHASE PATTERNS; SPOKEN WORDS; THETA-BAND; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; COMPREHENSION; TRACKING	It remains unclear whether the process of speech tracking, which facilitates speech segmentation, reflects topdown mechanisms related to prior linguistic models or stimulus-driven mechanisms, or possibly both. To address this, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) responses from native and non-native speakers of English that had different prior experience with the English language but heard acoustically identical stimuli. Despite a significant difference in the ability to segment and perceive speech, our EEG results showed that thetaband tracking of the speech envelope did not depend significantly on prior experience with language. However, tracking in the theta-band did show changes across repetitions of the same sentence, suggesting a priming effect. Furthermore, native and non-native speakers showed different phase dynamics at word boundaries, suggesting differences in segmentation mechanisms. Finally, we found that the correlation between higher frequency dynamics reflecting phoneme-level processing and perceptual segmentation of words might depend on prior experience with the spoken language.

J	Sawa, T; Yamada, T; Obata, Y				Sawa, Teiji; Yamada, Tomomi; Obata, Yurie			Power spectrum and spectrogram of EEG analysis during general anesthesia: Python-based computer programming analysis	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING			English	Review						EEG; General anesthesia; Spectrum analysis; Spectrogram; Multitaper method	EXCHANGE; FORMAT	The commonly used principle for measuring the depth of anesthesia involves changes in the frequency components of the electroencephalogram (EEG) under general anesthesia. Therefore, it is essential to construct an effective spectrum and spectrogram to analyze the relationship between the depth of anesthesia and the EEG frequency during general anesthesia. This paper reviews the computer programming techniques for analyzing the spectrum and spectrogram derived from a single-channel EEG recorded during general anesthesia. A periodogram is obtained by repeating a Fourier transform on EEG segments separated by short time intervals, but spectral leakage (i.e., dissociation from the true spectrum) occurs as a consequence of unnatural segmentation and noise. While offsetting the securing of the dynamic range, practical analyses of the adaptation of the window function are explained. Finally, the multitaper method, which can suppress artifacts caused by the edges of the analysis segments, suppress noise, and probabilistically infer values that are close to the real power spectral density, is explained using practical examples of the analysis. All analyses were performed and all graphs plotted using Python under Jupyter Notebook. The analyses demonstrated the effectiveness of Python-based programming under the integrated development environment Jupyter Notebook for constructing an effective spectrum and spectrogram for analyzing the relationship between the depth of anesthesia and EEG frequency analysis in general anesthesia.

An Effortful Approach to Social Affiliation in Schizophrenia: Preliminary Evidence of Increased Theta and Alpha Connectivity during a Live Social Interaction	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						schizophrenia; negative symptoms; social affiliation; functional connectivity; theta oscillations; alpha oscillations	FACIAL AFFECT RECOGNITION; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; METAANALYSIS; DYNAMICS; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; EXPERIENCE; EMOTION; PEOPLE	People with schizophrenia often experience a profound lack of motivation for social affiliation-a facet of negative symptoms that detrimentally impairs functioning. However, the mechanisms underlying social affiliative deficits remain poorly understood, particularly under realistic social contexts. Here, we investigated subjective reports and electroencephalography (EEG) functional connectivity in schizophrenia during a live social interaction. Individuals with schizophrenia (n = 16) and healthy controls (n = 29) completed a face-to-face interaction with a confederate while having EEG recorded. Participants were randomly assigned to either a Closeness condition designed to elicit feelings of closeness through self-disclosure or a Small-Talk condition with minimal disclosure. Compared to controls, patients reported lower positive emotional experiences and feelings of closeness across conditions, but they showed comparably greater subjective affiliative responses for the Closeness (vs. Small-Talk) condition. Additionally, patients in the Closeness (vs. Small-Talk) condition displayed a global increase in connectivity in theta and alpha frequency bands that was not observed for controls. Importantly, greater theta and alpha connectivity was associated with greater subjective affiliative responding, greater negative symptoms, and lower disorganized symptoms in patients. Collectively, findings indicate that patients, because of pronounced negative symptoms, utilized a less efficient, top-down mediated strategy to process social affiliation.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying postural instability in PD are poorly understood, and specific therapies are lacking. Previous electrophysiological studies have shown distinct cortical oscillations with a significant contribution of the cerebellum during postural control tasks in healthy individuals.Methods: We investigated cortical and mid-cerebellar oscillatory activity via electroencephalography (EEG) during a postural control task in 10 PD patients with postural instability (PDPI+), 11 PD patients without postural instability (PDPI-), and 15 age-matched healthy control participants. Relative spectral power was analyzed in the theta (4-7 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) frequency bands.Results: Time-dependent postural measurements computed by accelerometer signals showed poor performance in PDPI+ participants. EEG results revealed that theta power was profoundly lower in mid-frontal and mid-cerebellar regions during the postural control task in PDPI+, compared to PDPI- and control participants. In addition, theta power was correlated with postural control performance in PD subjects. No significant changes in beta power were observed. Additionally, oscillatory changes during the postural control task differed from the resting state.Conclusion: This study underlines the involvement of mid-frontal and mid-cerebellar regions in postural stability during a balance task and emphasizes the important role of theta oscillations therein for postural control in PD.

A standalone EEG Analyzer application was developed; raw EEG signals obtained from a bispectral index (BIS) monitor were analyzed using an on-line monitoring system. Correlations between Poincare plot parameters and other measurements associated with anesthesia depth were evaluated during emergence from inhalational general anesthesia. Of the participants, 20 were adults anesthetized with sevoflurane (adult(_SEV)), 20 were adults anesthetized with desflurane (adult(_DES)), and 20 were pediatric patients anesthetized with sevoflurane (ped(_SEV)). EEG signals were preprocessed through six bandpass digital filters (f0: 0.5-47 Hz, f1: 0.5-8 Hz, f2: 8-13 Hz, f3: 13-20 Hz, f4: 20-30 Hz, and f5: 30-47 Hz). The Poincare plot-area ratio (PPAR = PPA_fx/PPA_f0, fx = f1 similar to f5) was analyzed at five frequency ranges. Regardless of the inhalational anesthetic used, there were strong linear correlations between the logarithm of PPAR at f5 and BIS (R-2 = 0.67, 0.79, and 0.71, in the adult(_SEV), adult(_DES), and ped(_SEV) groups, respectively). As an additional observation, a part of EMG activity at the gamma range of 30-47 Hz probably influenced the calculations of BIS and PPAR_f5 with a non-negligible level. The logarithm of PPAR in the gamma band was most sensitive to state changes during the emergence process and could provide a new non-proprietary parameter that correlates with changes in BIS during measurement of anesthesia depth.

Establishing an optimal duration of recording for ambulatory video EEG	EPILEPSIA OPEN			English	Article						epilepsy; epilepsy monitoring; recording duration; remote care; video electroencephalography	DIAGNOSTIC YIELD; ROUTINE; UTILITY	Objective Ambulatory video EEG allows for extended recording of EEG in the comfort of a patient's home. However, the optimal duration of recording to capture clinical events is yet to be established. The current study uses retrospective analyses to identify an optimal recording duration for at-home video EEG. Methods A retrospective review was performed utilizing an anonymized database of ambulatory video EEG recordings performed between March and September 2020 with a national in-home EEG provider. Only completed assessments with neurologists' reads of raw data were reviewed, resulting in 3644 unique studies divided into three age cohorts: pediatrics (n = 941), adult (n = 2020), and geriatric (n = 683). Cohorts were characterized by assessment yield and time to first typical clinical event, as well as subsequent typical events over duration of recording. Results Frequency distributions reveal over half of first events are captured within 12 hours, but longer recording durations capture a much wider majority of both first typical events, as well as the mean number of subsequent events (5 clinical events). In 72 hours, over 97% of first events were observed in adult and geriatric patients, as well as over 95% of the mean number of subsequent events. In children, time to first event was significantly earlier than either adult or geriatric samples, with 98% of first events, and 92.8% of the mean number of subsequent events being observed in 48 hours. Significance These results from a large-scale, national dataset of patients using in-home EEG monitoring suggests recording at least 48 hours in duration for children, and at least 72 hours in duration for adult and geriatric samples, is optimal to maximize the likelihood of observing typical clinical events to facilitate diagnosis.

J	Wang, MY; Yuan, Z				Wang, Meng-Yun; Yuan, Zhen			EEG Decoding of Dynamic Facial Expressions of Emotion: Evidence from SSVEP and Causal Cortical Network Dynamics	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						SSVEP; dynamic facial expression; granger causality		The neural cognitive mechanism in processing static facial expressions (FEs) has been well documented, whereas the one underlying perceiving dynamic faces remains unclear. In this study, Fourier transformation and time-frequency analysis of Electroencephalography (EEG) data were carried out to detect the brain activation underlying dynamic or static FEs while twenty-one participants were viewing dynamic or static faces flicking at 10 Hz. In particular, steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) were quantified through spectral power analysis of EEG recordings. Besides, Granger causality (GC) analysis (GCA) was also performed to capture the causal cortical network dynamics during dynamic or static FEs of emotion. It was discovered that the dynamic (from neural to happy (N2H) or vice versa (H2N)) FEs elicited larger SSVEPs than the static ones. Additionally, GCA demonstrated that the H2N case, in which happy FEs were being gradually changed into neutral ones, exhibited larger GC measure during the late processing stage than that from the early stage. Consequently, enhanced SSVEPs and effective brain connectivity for dynamic FEs illustrated that participants might need consume more attentional resources to process the dynamic faces, particularly for the change from happy to neutral faces. The new neural index might facilitate us to better understand the cognitive processing of dynamic and static FEs. (C) 2021 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A public-domain library with emotion-annotated images (IAPS) was used to stimulate neutral, negative, and positive emotions. The associated EEG data were acquired from twelve volunteers (between 20 and 26 years old; ten males and two females). Each participant was exposed to three sessions back-toback on the same day. Each session corresponded to the induced emotional states (positive, negative and neutral) and consisted of relaxation, memorization of a list of ten words and ten numbers, watching a set of images to arouse emotion, and recalling the words and numbers memorized earlier. Statistical and spectral features of EEG data were analyzed for two instances: emotion recognition (neutral, negative, and positive) and recall events under the three emotional states. By designing two baseline machine-learning models, support vector machines (SVMs) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN), the significance of the EEG bands and the brain lobes were studied. Experimental results suggest that the short-term (working) memory recalls after exposure to neutral, negative, and positive images (to arouse neutral, negative, and positive emotions) differ from each other significantly (at alpha level 0.001). We have found that each EEG band carries unique information in both emotion and memory recall classification tasks and recommend that the entire EEG signal frequency range must be analyzed in future similar studies. On the other hand, we also have found that each brain region carries similar information as it relates to each task (i.e., memorization, recall), thus only one of the brain regions can be analyzed in future studies in order to avoid complexity and high computation time.

Increasing evidence appeared to show similarities between the effects of lavender EO and the anxiolytic drugs, benzodiazepines. However, its effects on sleep-wake and electrical brain patterns in comparison to that of the standard anxiolytic, diazepam, remained to be explored. Aim of the study: The aim of this work was to investigate electroencephalography (EEG) profiles and sleep-pattern elicited by lavender EO inhalation compared to that of diazepam, a standard anxiolytic drug in in vivo rat model. Materials and methods: Adult male Wistar rats were anesthetized for electrode implantation on the frontal and parietal skulls. EEG signals were recorded for 180 min following intraperitoneal injection of diazepam (10 mg/ kg) or during continuous inhalation of lavender EO (200 mu L) or distilled water (control). Fast Fourier transform was used for the analyses of EEG power spectra and sleep-wake parameters. Results: During a 30-60 min period, diazepam and lavender EO significantly increased frontal powers of 0.78-45.31 and 7.03-18.36 Hz, respectively. Both treatments also increased parietal powers with lower magnitudes of significant change. Significant increases in some frequency ranges remained until a 60-90 min period. Sleep-wake analyses also revealed that diazepam significantly reduced time spent in wake, increased time spent in non-rapid eye movement (NREM), increased episode duration of NREM, decreased numbers of wake episode and decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency. On the other hand, lavender EO only significantly decreased wake episodes and latency to REM sleep. Lavender EO inhalation reduced numbers of wake episode but maintain normal time spent in wake, NREM and REM sleeps. Conclusions: These findings might suggest beneficial and distinct anxiolytic-like effects of lavender EO for sleep enhancing purposes.

As characteristic features, functional connectivity as well as single-channel measures in both the time and frequency domain are considered. We compare the separation power of each feature set after nonlinear dimensionality reduction using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and demonstrate that ordinal pattern-based measures yield results comparable to frequency-based measures applied to preprocessed data, and outperform them if applied to raw data. Our analysis yields no significant differences in performance between single-channel features and functional connectivity features regarding the question of age group separation.

At present, no effective treatments exist to reverse the progress of AD, however, early diagnosis and intervention might delay its progression. The search for biomarkers with good safety, repeatable detection, reliable sensitivity and community application is necessary for AD screening and early diagnosis and timely intervention. Electroencephalogram (EEG) examination is a non-invasive, quantitative, reproducible, and cost-effective technique which is suitable for screening large population for possible AD. The power spectrum, complexity and synchronization characteristics of EEG waveforms in AD patients have distinct deviation from normal elderly, indicating these EEG features can be a promising candidate biomarker of AD. However, current reported deviation results are inconsistent, possibly due to multiple factors such as diagnostic criteria, sample sizes and the use of different computational measures. In this study, we collected two neurological tests scores (MMSE and MoCA) and the resting-state EEG of 30 normal control elderly subjects (NC group) and 30 probable AD patients confirmed by Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) inspection (AD group). We calculated the power spectrum, spectral entropy and phase synchronization index features of these two groups' EEG at left/right frontal, temporal, central and occipital brain regions in 4 frequency bands: delta oscillation (1-4 Hz), theta oscillation (4-8 Hz), alpha oscillation (8-13 Hz), and beta oscillation (13-30 Hz). In most brain areas, we found that the AD group had significant differences compared to NC group: (1) decreased alpha oscillation power and increased theta oscillation power; (2) decreased spectral entropy in alpha oscillation and elevated spectral entropy in beta oscillation; and (3) decrease phase synchronization index in delta, theta, and beta oscillation. We also found that alpha oscillation spectral power and beta oscillation phase synchronization index correlated well with the MMSE/MoCA test scores in AD groups. Our study suggests that these two EEG features might be useful metrics for population screening of probable AD patients.

All of these early life adversities can have long-lasting effects on brain function, especially the executive functions. Working memory, as one of the most studied aspects of executive functions, is also reported to be impaired in children with early adversity. However, limited data are available regarding how early life adverse events affect the neural dynamic associated with working memory processing in AIDS orphans. This study applied the electroencephalogram (EEG) technique to investigate the working memory process in 81 AIDS orphans and 62 non-orphan controls with n-back tasks. Results from EEG analysis and time-frequency analysis showed that AIDS orphans displayed smaller N2 and larger P2, P3 activation as well as enhanced theta and attenuated alpha band oscillations compared to the controls. The present findings indicated a deficit in working memory process in AIDS orphans and suggested that this deficit might be due to the impairments in attention allocation, detection and classi?cation of stimuli and updating process in working memory.

Firstly, Bonn and Freiburg datasets were used to perform experiments. The Bonn dataset consists of binary and multi-class classification problems, and the Freiburg dataset consists of two-class EEG classification problems. In the preprocessing step, all datasets were prepossessed using a Butterworth band pass filter with 0.5-60 Hz cut-off frequency. Then, the EEG signals of the datasets were segmented into different time windows. In this section, dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) was used to decompose the EEG signals into the different sub-bands. In the following section, in order to feature extraction, various FD techniques were used, including Higuchi (HFD), Katz (KFD), Petrosian (PFD), Hurst exponent (HE), detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), Sevcik, box counting (BC), multiresolution box-counting (MBC), Margaos-Sun (MSFD), multifractal DFA (MF-DFA), and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). In the next step, the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) technique was used for feature selection. Finally, the k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and convolutional autoencoder (CNN-AE) were used for the classification step. In the classification step, the K-fold cross-validation with k = 10 was employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the classifier methods. The experiment results show that the proposed CNN-AE method achieved an accuracy of 99.736% and 99.176% for the Bonn and Freiburg datasets, respectively.

The present study was conducted to show that the dynamic change of underlying mental effort can be further estimated by measuring the strength of theta oscillations at a forehead site on the scalp. Fourteen healthy adults (M-age = 26.1 years) performed a passive listening (PL) task and an auditory digit span (DS) task, and electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded simultaneously during the two tasks. Considering that the digit span paradigm has often been conducted in a non-laboratory location, the EEG data were collected with a wireless single-channel headset system. The headset system was validated in this study by replicating the EEG (an enhancement of frontal theta power) as well as event-related potential (N200 and P300) responses to the deviant tone stimuli in the PL task. The outcomes of the DS task showed that the memory span of the participants was at least eight items. Moreover, frontal theta power in response to a list of six to eight digits increased significantly. This pattern of results supports a hypothesis that additional mental effort is required for short-term retention of verbal items when the number of stimulus items exceeds the newly proposed limit of short-term memory capacity. Some strengths and limitations of the current EEG headset system are also discussed.

To characterize the cortical oscillations associated with performance of the sustained attention to response task (SART) and their disruptions in the neurodegenerative condition amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Approach. A randomised SART was undertaken by 24 ALS patients and 33 healthy controls during 128-channel electroencephalography (EEG). Complex Morlet wavelet transform was used to quantify non-phase-locked oscillatory activity in event-related spectral perturbations associated with performing the SART. We investigated the relationships between these perturbations and task performance, and associated motor and cognitive changes in ALS. Main results. SART induced theta-band event-related synchronization (ERS) and alpha- and beta-band event-related desynchronization (ERD), followed by rebound beta ERS, in both Go and NoGo trials across the frontoparietal axis, with NoGo trials eliciting greater theta ERS and lesser beta ERS. Controls with greater Go trial beta ERS performed with greater speed and less accuracy. ALS patients exhibited increased anticipation compared to controls but similar reaction times and accuracy. Prefrontal (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.8, Cohen's d = 0.97) and parietal (AUROC = 0.82, Cohen's d = 1.12) beta-band ERD was significantly reduced in ALS but did not relate to performance, while patients with higher Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen (ECAS) ALS-specific scores demonstrated greater ERS in beta (rho = 0.72) upon successful withholding. Significance. EEG measurement of task-related oscillation changes reveals variation in cortical network engagement in relation to speed versus accuracy strategies. Such measures can also capture cognitive and motor network pathophysiology in the absence of task performance decline, which may facilitate development of more sensitive early neurodegenerative disease biomarkers.

Recent studies indicated a correlation between the severity of encephalitis and some features of SBCs, such as location, amplitude and frequency of appearance. Moreover, EEG rhythms were found to vary before the onset of an SBC, as if the brain was preparing to the discharge (actually with a slowing down of the EEG oscillation). Here, we investigate possible variations of EEG functional connectivity (FC) in EEGs from pediatric patients with different levels of severity of encephalitis. FC was measured by the maximal crosscorrelation of EEG rhythms in different bipolar channels. Then, the indexes of network patterns (namely strength, clustering coefficient, efficiency and characteristic path length) were estimated to characterize the global behavior when they are measured during SBCs or far from them. EEG traces showed statistical differences in the two conditions: clustering coefficient, efficiency and strength are higher close to an SBC, whereas the characteristic path length is lower. Moreover, for more severe conditions, an increase in clustering coefficient, efficiency and strength and a decrease in characteristic path length were observed in the delta-theta band. These outcomes support the hypothesis that SBCs result from the anomalous coordination of neurons in different brain areas affected by the inflammation process and indicate FC as an additional key for interpreting the EEG in encephalitis patients.

Behavioral results showed faster responses for bilinguals on interference trials in the nonverbal condition, and electrophysiological results indicated greater attentional control for bilinguals. ROI analyses showed this pattern for bilinguals mainly in the verbal condition, whereas whole brain analyses found this association in both conditions. Frequency power analysis found activity related to interference trials was associated with recruitment of different neural resources for verbal and nonverbal conditions. Nonverbal results indicated beta activity for interference trials in bilinguals and the verbal condition showed this pattern in theta and gamma frequency bands as well, revealing more extensive brain activation in the verbal domain for bilinguals. For monolinguals, frequency power in beta, gamma, and theta were related to facilitation trials. These results suggest different strategies for allocating attention by monolingual and bilingual young adults.

J	Walker, CP; Buse, JB; Frohlich, F				Walker, Christopher P.; Buse, John B.; Frohlich, Flavio			Experimental increase of blood glucose alters resting state EEG measures of excitation-inhibition balance	EXPERIMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						blood glucose; electroencephalography; excitation&#8211; inhibition balance		New Findings What is the central question of this study? Glucose is the dominant energy source for the brain. However, little is known about how glucose metabolism impacts the coordination of network activity in the brain in healthy adults. What is the main finding and its importance? We demonstrate that both alpha oscillations and the aperiodic signal components of the resting EEG are modulated by experimentally elevated blood glucose concentrations. Our findings suggest that glucose increases measures associated with excitation-inhibition (E:I) balance, but that the effect on alpha oscillations might plateau. Understanding the relationship between glucose consumption and E:I balance is crucial to developing our understanding of how metabolism shapes human brain activity. Brain network oscillations can be divided broadly into periodic and aperiodic signal components, which are sensitive to state-dependent changes in network coordination and excitation-inhibition (E:I) balance. We sought to address whether the dominant energy source of the brain, glucose, is implicated in the regulation of network activity and excitability. We conducted an experimenter-blind, crossover study of the effect of blood glucose level (BGL) on the resting EEG frequency spectrum. Participants consumed a glucose drink (75 g glucose) or an equivalent volume of water on two separate visits. EEG data were sampled before and <= 3 h after the drink. We found that the experimentally induced changes in BGL exhibited an inverted U-shaped relationship, with changes in the individual alpha frequency peak, whereas the slope of the aperiodic signal component of the frequency spectrum showed a positive linear association suggestive of greater excitation. In contrast, peak alpha power, which is typically associated with top-down inhibitory processes, was negatively associated with changes in BGL. Collectively, these results suggest that high BGL alters brain network coordination in the form of alpha oscillations and measures associated with E:I balance.

Macrostructural changes such as sleep-stage transitions or phasic, brief cortical events elicit fluctuations in neural outflow to the cardiovascular system, but the causal relationships between cortical and cardiovascular activities underpinning the microstructure of sleep are largely unknown. Here, we investigate cortical-cardiovascular interactions during the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) of non-rapid eye movement sleep in a diverse set of overnight polysomnograms. We determine the Granger causality in both 507 CAP and 507 matched non-CAP sequences to assess the causal relationships between electroencephalography (EEG) frequency bands and respiratory and cardiovascular variables (heart period, respiratory period, pulse arrival time and pulse wave amplitude) during CAP. We observe a significantly stronger influence of delta activity on vascular variables during CAP sequences where slow, low-amplitude EEG activation phases (A1) dominate than during non-CAP sequences. We also show that rapid, high-amplitude EEG activation phases (A3) provoke a more pronounced change in autonomic activity than A1 and A2 phases. Our analysis provides the first evidence on the causal interplay between cortical and cardiovascular activities during CAP. Granger causality analysis may also be useful for probing the level of decoupling in sleep disorders.

Evidence for this is indirect, however. Furthermore, it is unclear whether pyramidal cells or interneurons (or both) are affected, or how these deficits relate to symptoms. METHODS: People with schizophrenia diagnoses (PScz) (n = 108), their relatives (n = 57), and control subjects (n = 107) underwent 3 electroencephalography (EEG) paradigms-resting, mismatch negativity, and 40-Hz auditory steady-state response-and resting functional magnetic resonance imaging. Dynamic causal modeling was used to quantify synaptic connectivity in cortical microcircuits. RESULTS: Classic group differences in EEG features between PScz and control subjects were replicated, including increased theta and other spectral changes (resting EEG), reduced mismatch negativity, and reduced 40-Hz power. Across all 4 paradigms, characteristic PScz data features were all best explained by models with greater selfinhibition (decreased synaptic gain) in pyramidal cells. Furthermore, disinhibition in auditory areas predicted abnormal auditory perception (and positive symptoms) in PScz in 3 paradigms. CONCLUSIONS: First, characteristic EEG changes in PScz in 3 classic paradigms are all attributable to the same underlying parameter change: greater self-inhibition in pyramidal cells. Second, psychotic symptoms in PScz relate to disinhibition in neural circuits. These findings are more commensurate with the hypothesis that in PScz, a primary loss of synaptic gain on pyramidal cells is then compensated by interneuron downregulation (rather than the converse). They further suggest that psychotic symptoms relate to this secondary downregulation.

Here we used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain signals in young drivers operating a driving simulator to detect mental states and predict accidents. We measured reaction times to unexpected hazardous events and correlated them with EEG signals measured from the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices as well as the central sulcus (corresponding to motor cortex). We found that EEG signals in the relative beta (power in beta (13-30 Hz) relative to total power of the EEG (0.5-30 Hz)), alpha/delta, alpha/theta, beta/delta, beta/theta frequency bands were higher for collisions than successful collision avoidance, and that the key decision-making period is the 2nd second before braking. Importantly, a decision tree classifier trained on these neural signals predicted collision avoidance outcomes. Then based on random forest model, we extracted three critical neural signals (beta/delta_frontal, relative beta_parietal and relative beta_central Sulcus) to classify collision avoidance outcomes. Our findings suggest measuring EEG during driving may provide useful signals for enhancing driver safety. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we describe a data-driven modal decomposition of a multivariate autoregressive model that simultaneously identifies oscillations by their peak frequency, damping time and network structure. We use this decomposition to define a set of Spatio-Spectral Eigenmodes (SSEs) providing a parsimonious description of oscillatory networks. We show that the multivariate system transfer function can be rewritten in these modal coordinates, and that the full transfer function is a linear superposition of all modes in the decomposition. The modal transfer function is a linear summation and therefore allows for single oscillatory signals to be isolated and analysed in terms of their spectral content, spatial distribution and network structure. We validate the method on simulated data and explore the structure of whole brain oscillatory networks in eyes-open resting state MEG data from the Human Connectome Project. We are able to show a wide between participant variability in peak frequency and network structure of alpha oscillations and show a distinction between occipital 'high-frequency alpha' and parietal 'low-frequency alpha'. The frequency difference between occipital and parietal alpha components is present within individual participants but is partially masked by larger between subject variability; a 10Hz oscillation may represent the high-frequency occipital component in one participant and the low-frequency parietal component in another. This rich characterisation of individual neural phenotypes has the potential to enhance analyses into the relationship between neural dynamics and a person's behavioural, cognitive or clinical state.

People vary in the way they make decisions, resulting in different levels of risk-taking behavior. These differences have been linked to prefrontal theta band activity. However, a direct functional relationship between prefrontal theta band activity and risk-taking has not yet been demonstrated. Objective: We used noninvasive brain stimulation to test the functional relevance of prefrontal oscillatory theta activity for the regulatory control of risk-taking behavior. Methods: In a within-subject experiment, 31 healthy participants received theta (6.5 Hertz [Hz]), gamma (40 Hz), and sham transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over the left prefrontal cortex (lPFC). During stimulation, participants completed a task assessing their risk-taking behavior as well as response times and sensitivity to value and outcome probabilities. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded before and immediately after stimulation to investigate possible long-lasting stimulation effects. Results: Theta band, but not gamma band or sham, tACS led to a significant reduction in risk-taking behavior, indicating a frequency-specific effect of prefrontal brain stimulation on the modulation of risk-taking behavior. Moreover, theta band stimulation led to increased response times and decreased sensitivity to reward values. EEG data analyses did not show an offline increase in power in the stimulated frequencies after the stimulation protocol. Conclusion: These findings provide direct empirical evidence for the effects of prefrontal theta band stimulation on behavioral risk-taking regulation.

Methods: The experiment was performed in two sections. In Section I, using event-related potential, event-related oscillation and spatial phase-synchronization, we explored neural dynamics in 24 volunteered healthy controls (HC) and 38 patients at least 6 months post-mTBI (19 with epidural hematoma, EDH; 19 with subdural hematoma, SDH) during a Go/NoGo task. In Section II, according to the neuropsychological scales, patients were divided into sub-groups to assess these electroencephalography (EEG) indicators in identifying different rehabilitation outcomes of mTBI. Results: In Section I, mean amplitudes of NoGo-P3 and P3d were decreased in mTBI patients relative to HC, and NoGo-theta power in the non-injured hemisphere was decreased in SDH patients only. In Section II, patients with chronic neuropsychological defects exhibited more serious impairments of intra-hemispheric connectivity, whereas inter-hemispheric centro-parietal and frontal connectivity were enhanced in response to lesions. Conclusions: EEG distinguished mTBI patients from healthy controls, and estimated different rehabilitation outcomes of mTBI. The centro-parietal and frontal connectivity are the main compensatory mechanism for the recovery of mTBI patients. Significance: EEG measurements and network connectivity can track recovery process and mechanism of mTBI. (c) 2021 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, to date, deep learning techniques in seizure detection have not been effectively harnessed due to sub-optimal classifier design and improper representation of the time-domain signal. Methods: In this study, we focused on designing and evaluating deep convolutional neural network-based classifiers for seizure detection. Signal-to-image conversion methods are proposed to convert time-domain EEG signal to a time-frequency represented image to prepare the input data for classification. We proposed and evaluated three classification methods comprising of five classifiers to determine which is more accurate for seizure detection. Accuracy data were then compared to previous studies of the same dataset. Results: We found our proposed model and signal-to-image conversion method outperformed all previous studies in the most cases. The proposed FT-VGG16 classifier achieved the highest average classification accuracy of 99.21%. In addition, the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis approach was employed to uncover the feature frequencies in the EEG that contribute most to improved classification accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compute the contribution of frequency components to target seizure classification; thus allowing the identification of distinct seizure-related EEG frequency components compared to normal EEG measures. Conclusion: Thus our developed deep convolutional neural network models are useful to detect seizures and characteristic frequencies using EEG data collected from the patients and this model could be clinically applicable for the automated seizures detection.

Indeed, prefrontal cortical activation and alpha frequency band modulation has been widely reported, but little is known about interbrain synchrony (IBS) changes occurring during social interaction such as collaboration or competition. In this study, we assess the dynamic of IBS variation in order to provide novel insights into the frequency band modulation underlying collaboration. To address this question, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to simultaneously record the brain activity of two individuals playing a computer-based game facing four different conditions: collaboration, competition, single participation, and passive observation. The computer-based game consisted of a fast button response task. Using data recorded in sensor space, we calculated an IBS value for each frequency band using both wavelet coherence transform and phase-locking value and performed single-subject analysis to compare each condition. We found significant IBS in frontal electrodes only present during collaboration associated with alpha frequency band modulation. In addition, we observed significant IBS in the theta frequency band for both collaboration and competition conditions, along with a significant single-subject cortical activity. Competition is distinguishable through single-subject activity in several regions and frequency bands of the brain. Performance is correlated with single-subject frontal activation during collaboration in the alpha and beta frequency band.

Above the age of 50 years, hypothesized pronounced alterations in alpha and theta-band power at resting or across different WM-functioning brain states may well be due to pre-dementia cognitive impairments, or increasing severity of age-related neurological disorders. Executive working memory (EWM) functioning was assessed in older-adult participants (54 to 83 years old) by obtaining their WM-related EEG oscillations and WM performance scores. WM performance and WM brain-state EEG were recorded during online-WM periods as well as during specific online WM events within EWM periods, and during resting offline-WM periods that preceded online-WM periods. Left-prefrontal alpha-power was enhanced during offline-WM periods versus online-WM periods and was significantly related to WM accuracy. Left-prefrontal alpha power and left prefrontal-parietal theta power anterior-posterior difference-gradient during online WM activity were related to reaction times (RT's). Importantly, during active-storage events, WM-offset offline-periods, and preparatory pre-retrieval events, excessive left-prefrontal alpha activity was related to poor EWM performance. The potential for developing targeted noninvasive cognition-enhancing interventions and developing clinical-monitoring EEG-based biomarkers of pathological cognitive-decline in elderly people is discussed.

Compared with single modal emotion recognition, the multimodal paradigm has an outperformance because of introducing complementary information for emotion recognition. However, current research is mainly focused on normal people, the deaf subjects need to understand emotional changes in real life. In this paper, we propose a multimodal continuous emotion recognition method for deaf subjects based on facial expression and electroencephalograph (EEG) signals. Twelve emotion movie clips as stimulus were selected and annotated by ten postgraduates who majored in psychology. The EEG signals and facial expressions of deaf subjects were collected when they watched the stimulus clips. The differential entropy (DE) features of EEG were extracted by time-frequency analysis and the six facial features were extracted by facial landmark. Long short-term memory networks (LSTM) were utilized to accomplish the feature level fusion and captured the temporal dynamics of emotions. The result shows that the EEG signal is better than the dynamic emotional capture of facial expressions and deaf subjects in continuous emotion recognition. Multi-modality can compensate for the information of a single modality, which achieves a better performance. Finally, from the neural activities of deaf subjects, the result reveals that the prefrontal lobe region may be strongly related to negative emotion processing, and the lateral temporal lobe region may be strongly related to positive emotion processing.

J	He, HL				He, Huili			Multiscale fuzzy entropy based on local mean decomposition and Fisher rule for EEG feature extraction in human motion analysis	EAI ENDORSED TRANSACTIONS ON SCALABLE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						EEG; feature extraction; product function; multiscale fuzzy entropy; Fisher rule.		Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a nonlinear, non-stationary, and random weak signal generated by a large number of neurons. It has great research value and practical significance in artificial intelligence, biomedical engineering and other fields. EEG feature extraction is an important step which directly affects the processing results. Currently, the commonly used methods for EEG feature extraction include frequency domain or time domain analysis and time-frequency combination. Due to the nonlinearity of EEG, the above methods have certain limitations. Therefore, this paper proposes a multiscale fuzzy entropy based on local mean decomposition and Fisher rule for EEG feature extraction in human motion analysis. Firstly, the EEG signal is decomposed adaptively into a series of product function (PF) components. Then the effective PF component is selected and the multiscale fuzzy entropy is calculated. Multi-scale fuzzy entropy is used for feature extraction. Fisher rule is used to rank the feature classification ability of fuzzy entropy at different scales, and the multi-scale fuzzy entropy with the highest ranking is selected to form the optimal feature vector to achieve feature dimension reduction. Experimental results show that this proposed method can extract the features of EEG signal effectively, which verifies the validity and feasibility of the new method.

Artifacts appear in both time and time-frequency as well as spatial (multi-channel) domains. New methods: Here, we introduce two novel methods for removing EEG artifacts. In the first method, the common components among EEG channels are extracted and eliminated as artifacts, called common component rejection (CCR). In the second method, wavelet decomposition is employed to decompose the EEG signals, then the CCR method is applied to remove artifacts in the time-frequency domain, referred to as automatic wavelet CCR (AWCCR). The proposed methods are evaluated using semi-simulated data as well as application in real EEG data for motor imaginary classification. Results: For semi-simulated data, the AWCCR showed higher performance in removing artifacts than CCR. Also, applying each of the proposed methods to the real EEG data to remove artifacts before motor imaginary classification increased the classification accuracy by about 10% compared to not removing artifacts. Comparison with existing methods: The proposed methods are compared with independent component analysis (ICA) and automatic wavelet ICA. AWCCR outperformed all methods in removing artifacts from semi-simulated data. The results also showed that both AWCCR and CCR methods outperformed the existing methods in removing artifacts from the real EEG data to improve the accuracy of motor imaginary classification. Conclusions: The findings show that in ordinary or motor imaginary EEG when signatures of artifacts are shared among EEG channels, AWCCR and CCR can identify and remove the artifacts.

Volitional learning promotes theta phase coding in the human hippocampus	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						active learning; intracranial EEG; theta oscillations; neural phase coding; hippocampus	WORKING-MEMORY; GAMMA-POWER; RHYTHM; OSCILLATIONS; REPRESENTATIONS; NAVIGATION; RETRIEVAL; MOVEMENT; DYNAMICS; TOOLBOX	Electrophysiological studies in rodents show that active navigation enhances hippocampal theta oscillations (4-12 Hz), providing a temporal framework for stimulus-related neural codes. Here we show that active learning promotes a similar phase coding regime in humans, although in a lower frequency range (3-8 Hz). We analyzed intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) from epilepsy patients who studied images under either volitional or passive learning conditions. Active learning increased memory performance and hippocampal theta oscillations and promoted a more accurate reactivation of stimulus-specific information during memory retrieval. Representational signals were clustered to opposite phases of the theta cycle during encoding and retrieval. Critically, during active but not passive learning, the temporal structure of intracycle reactivations in theta reflected the semantic similarity of stimuli, segregating conceptually similar items into more distant theta phases. Taken together, these results demonstrate a multilayered mechanism by which active learning improves memory via a phylogenetically old phase coding scheme.

Currently, there is no feasible volitional triggering method to adapt the prosthetic device to user's intention to accelerate during walking. Therefore, real-time prediction of human acceleration intention from the pre-acceleration electroencephalogram (EEG), and subsequent adaptation of the prosthetic device's control parameters for seamless transition remains a daunting research area. In that aspect, this study investigates the neural changes responsive to human intention to accelerate during walking. Furthermore, this study also explores whether the acceleration intention can be predicted from real-time EEG to subsequently enable parametric adaptation for an external prosthetic device. EEG, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and ground reaction force (GRF) signals were collected from one healthy subject during walking with self-paced speed changes. A set of classifiers were explored to classify between constant speed and acceleration. The classifiers showed promising classification performance well above chance level in offline, pseudo-online and real-time scenarios. An accuracy of 85.9 +/- 2.9% was achieved in offline scenario, while pseudo-online classification resulted in a true positive rate (TPR) of 81.9 +/- 7.4% with 7.7 +/- 0.8 false positives/ min and a detection latency of -844 +/- 572 ms. In real-time scenario, 9 out of 12 acceleration events were predicted successfully with only 3 false predictions at an average latency of -741 ms. Moreover, offline data analysis suggested suppression of mu and beta rhythms related to gait acceleration between 2 seconds before and 1.5 seconds after the onset of acceleration. A slow increase in negative amplitude was also observed in near DC frequencies of EEG data acquired from the sensorimotor cortex. The findings of this study portray inspiring results in retrieving gait acceleration-associated neural changes for facilitating natural control of assistive devices.	[Hasan, S. M.

Several approaches have been proposed to manage stroke patient rehabilitation such as robotic devices and virtual reality systems, and researchers have found that the brain-computer interfaces (BCI) approaches can provide better results. Therefore, the most challenging tasks with BCI applications involve identifying the best technique(s) that can reveal the neuron stimulus information from the patients' brains and extracting the most effective features from these signals as well. Accordingly, the main novelty of this paper is twofold: propose a new feature fusion method for motor imagery (MI)-based BCI and develop an automatic MI framework to detect the changes pre- and post-rehabilitation. This study investigated the electroencephalography (EEG) dataset from post-stroke patients with upper extremity hemiparesis. All patients performed 25 MI-based BCI sessions with follow up assessment visits to examine the functional changes before and after EEG neurorehabilitation. In the first stage, conventional filters and automatic independent component analysis with wavelet transform (AICAWT) denoising technique were used. Next, attributes from time, entropy and frequency domains were computed, and the effective features were combined into time-entropy-frequency (TEF) attributes. Consequently, the AICAWT and the TEF fusion set were utilised to develop an AICA-WT-TEF framework. Then, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbours (kNN) and random forest (RF) classification technique were tested for MI-based BCI rehabilitation. The proposed AICA-WT-TEF framework with RF classifier achieves the best results compared with other classifiers. Finally, the proposed framework and feature fusion set achieve a significant performance in terms of accuracy measures compared to the state-of-the-art. Therefore, the proposed methods could be crucial for improving the process of automatic MI rehabilitation and are recommended for implementation in real-time applications.

J	Chamanzar, A; Haigh, SM; Grover, P; Behrmann, M				Chamanzar, Alireza; Haigh, Sarah M.; Grover, Pulkit; Behrmann, Marlene			Abnormalities in cortical pattern of coherence in migraine detected using ultra high-density EEG	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						cortical coherence; high-density electroencephalography; migraine; resting state; sensory evoked potentials	VISUAL-EVOKED POTENTIALS; RESTING-STATE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; INCREASED AMPLITUDE; LATERAL INHIBITION; FLASH STIMULATION; BRAIN; CORTEX; ALPHA; HABITUATION	Individuals with migraine generally experience photophobia and/or phonophobia during and between migraine attacks. Many different mechanisms have been postulated to explain these migraine phenomena including abnormal patterns of connectivity across the cortex. The results, however, remain contradictory and there is no clear consensus on the nature of the cortical abnormalities in migraine. Here, we uncover alterations in cortical patterns of coherence (connectivity) in interictal migraineurs during the presentation of visual and auditory stimuli and during rest. We used a high-density EEG system, with 128 customized electrode locations, to compare inter- and intrahemispheric coherence in the interictal period from 17 individuals with migraine (12 female) and 18 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects. During presentations of visual (vertical grating pattern) and auditory (modulated tone) stimulation which varied in temporal frequency (4 and 6 Hz), and during rest, participants performed a colour detection task at fixation. Analyses included characterizing the inter- and intra-hemisphere coherence between the scalp EEG channels over 2-s time intervals and over different frequency bands at different spatial distances and spatial dusters. Pearson's correlation coefficients were estimated at zero-lag. Repeated measures analyses-of-variance revealed that, relative to controls, migraineurs exhibited significantly (i) faster colour detection performance, (ii) lower spatial coherence of alpha-band activity, for both inter- and intra-hemisphere connections, and (iii) the reduced coherence occurred predominantly in frontal clusters during both sensory conditions, regardless of the stimulation frequency, as well as during the resting-state. The abnormal patterns of EEG coherence in interictal migraineurs during visual and auditory stimuli, as well as at rest (eyes open), may be associated with the cortical hyper-responsivity that is characteristic of abnormal sensory processing in migraineurs.

Broadband desynchronization of EEG activity and disconnection in humans have been repeatedly shown; however, translational data from animals are completely lacking. Therefore, the main aim of our study was to assess the effects of tryptamine and phenethylamine psychedelics (psilocin 4 mg/kg, LSD 0.2 mg/kg, mescaline 100 mg/kg, and DOB 5 mg/kg) on EEG in freely moving rats. A system consisting of 14 cortical EEG electrodes, co-registration of behavioral activity of animals with subsequent analysis only in segments corresponding to behavioral inactivity (resting-state-like EEG) was used in order to reach a high level of translational validity. Analyses of the mean power, topographic brain-mapping, and functional connectivity revealed that all of the psychedelics irrespective of the structural family induced overall and time-dependent global decrease/desynchronization of EEG activity and disconnection within 1-40 Hz. Major changes in activity were localized on the large areas of the frontal and sensorimotor cortex showing some subtle spatial patterns characterizing each substance. A rebound of occipital theta (4-8 Hz) activity was detected at later stages after treatment with mescaline and LSD. Connectivity analyses showed an overall decrease in global connectivity for both the components of cross-spectral and phase-lagged coherence. Since our results show almost identical effects to those known from human EEG/MEG studies, we conclude that our method has robust translational validity.

Recently, the glutamate hypothesis and the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance hypothesis have been proposed as new pathological hypotheses for SCZ. Combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive novel method that enables us to investigate the cortical activity in humans, and this modality is a suitable approach to evaluate these hypotheses. In this study, we systematically reviewed TMS-EEG studies that investigated the cortical dysfunction of SCZ to examine the emerging hypotheses for SCZ. The following search terms were set in this systematic review: (TMS or 'transcranial magnetic stimulation') and (EEG or electroencephalog*) and (schizophrenia). We inspected the articles written in English that examined humans and were published by March 2020 via MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed. The initial search generated 379 studies, and 14 articles were finally identified. The current review noted that patients with SCZ demonstrated the E/I deficits in the prefrontal cortex, whose dysfunctions were also associated with cognitive impairment and clinical severity. Moreover, TMS-induced gamma activity in the prefrontal cortex was related to positive symptoms, while theta/delta band activities were associated with negative symptoms in SCZ. Thus, this systematic review discusses aspects of the pathophysiological neural basis of SCZ that are not explained by the traditional dopamine hypothesis exclusively, based on the findings of previous TMS-EEG research, mainly in terms of the E/I imbalance hypothesis. In conclusion, TMS-EEG neurophysiology can be applied to establish objective biomarkers for better diagnosis as well as to develop new therapeutic strategies for patients with SCZ.

This paper attempts to quantify the face perceptual ability of human subjects using their memory responses, acquired by an electroencephalographic (EEG) device, during engagement of the human subjects in a face recognition task. The entire experimental protocol is designed in the settings of pattern recognition, comprising five main steps, namely artifact removal, feature extraction, classifier training and testing, and face-perception ability measurement. The primary objective of the paper is to design a deep neural network model that utilizes both the temporal and spatial EEG features to categorize the familiar face (FF) and unfamiliar face (UF) responses of human subjects from their brain signals. To extract the spatial information, the acquired raw EEG data is transformed into multi-spectral 2-dimensional images by a deep learning approach. The spatial information, along with the EEG time-frequency domain (temporal) features are then utilized to train the proposed deep neural network, which can preserve the spatial as well as temporal EEG features that are more robust and less sensitive to the variations along each dimension. The proposed deep neural network paradigm demonstrates promising results in classifying the EEG responses for FF and UF recognition with high classification accuracy. Biological underpinning of the cortical mechanism using sLORETA and event related potential (ERP) analysis in perceiving FFs and UFs by both the healthy controls and prosopagnosic patients is also a significant inclusion in the paper. The first and foremost advantage of the proposed work is that it provides a technological means to assess the variations in face perceptual ability of individuals. It can also be used as a biomarker for early prosopagnosia diagnosis.

EEG was recorded for three patterns of sound motion produced by changes in interaural time differences. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) were computed from the time-frequency decomposition of EEG signals. The participants either read books of their choice (passive listening) or indicated the sound trajectories perceived using a graphic tablet (active listening). Our goal was to find out whether the lateralization of the motion-onset response (MOR) and oscillatory responses to sound motion were more consistent with the right-hemispheric dominance, contralateral or neglect model of interhemispheric asymmetry. Apparent dominance of the right hemisphere was found only in the ERSP responses. Stronger contralaterality of the left hemisphere corresponding to the neglect model of asymmetry was shown by the MOR components and by the phase coherence of the delta-alpha oscillations. Velocity and attention did not change consistently the interhemispheric asymmetry of both the MOR and the oscillatory responses. Our findings demonstrate how the lateralization pattern shown by the MOR potential was interrelated with that of the motion-related single-trial measures.

An Analysis of the External Validity of EEG Spectral Power in an Uncontrolled Outdoor Environment during Default and Complex Neurocognitive States	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						QEEG; mobile EEG; PASAT; resting state; external validity	CONSCIOUS RESTING STATE; HUMAN BRAIN ACTIVITY; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; WORKING-MEMORY; OCCIPITAL ALPHA; PERFORMANCE; THETA; TASK; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCIES	Traditionally, quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) studies collect data within controlled laboratory environments that limit the external validity of scientific conclusions. To probe these validity limits, we used a mobile EEG system to record electrophysiological signals from human participants while they were located within a controlled laboratory environment and an uncontrolled outdoor environment exhibiting several moderate background influences. Participants performed two tasks during these recordings, one engaging brain activity related to several complex cognitive functions (number sense, attention, memory, executive function) and the other engaging two default brain states. We computed EEG spectral power over three frequency bands (theta: 4-7 Hz, alpha: 8-13 Hz, low beta: 14-20 Hz) where EEG oscillatory activity is known to correlate with the neurocognitive states engaged by these tasks. Null hypothesis significance testing yielded significant EEG power effects typical of the neurocognitive states engaged by each task, but only a beta-band power difference between the two background recording environments during the default brain state. Bayesian analysis showed that the remaining environment null effects were unlikely to reflect measurement insensitivities. This overall pattern of results supports the external validity of laboratory EEG power findings for complex and default neurocognitive states engaged within moderately uncontrolled environments.

However, the choice of the most appropriate re-referencing for EEG data is still debated. Moreover, the role of EEG reference in the estimation of functional Brain-Heart Interplay (BHI), together with different multivariate modelling strategies, has not been investigated yet. Methods: This study identifies the best methodology combining a proper EEG electrical reference and signal processing methods for an effective functional BHI assessment. The effects of the EEG reference among common average, mastoids average, Laplacian reference, Cz reference, and the reference electrode standardization technique (REST) were explored throughout different BHI methods including synthetic data generation (SDG) model, heartbeat-evoked potentials, heartbeat-evoked oscillations, and maximal information coefficient. Results: The SDG model exhibited high robustness between EEG references, whereas the maximal information coefficient method exhibited a high sensitivity. The common average and REST references for EEG showed a good consistency in the between-method comparisons. Laplacian, and Cz references significantly bias a BHI measurement. Comparison with existing methods: The use of EEG reference based on a common average outperforms on the use of other references for consistency in estimating directed functional BHI. We do not recommend the use of EEG references based on analytical derivations as the experimental conditions may not meet the requirements of their optimal estimation, particularly in clinical settings. Conclusion: The use of a common average for EEG electrical reference is concluded to be the most appropriate choice for a quantitative, functional BHI assessment.

J	de Graaf, TA; Duecker, F				de Graaf, Tom A.; Duecker, Felix			No effects of rhythmic visual stimulation on target discrimination: An online alpha entrainment experiment	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; attention; entrainment; null results; oscillations	EEG ALPHA; LOCAL ENTRAINMENT; SPATIAL ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; FLUCTUATIONS; EXCITABILITY; BIAS	Previous research established that rhythmic sensory stimulation can affect subsequent stimulus perception, possibly through 'entrainment' of oscillations in the brain. Alpha frequency is a natural target for visual entrainment, because fluctuations in posterior alpha oscillations have been linked to visual target detection or discrimination. On the other hand, alpha oscillations also relate to attentional mechanisms, such as attentional orienting or selection. Previous visual alpha entrainment studies focused on differential processing of targets presented in-phase with the preceding rhythmic stimulation relative to out-of-phase targets (an 'SOA effect'), putatively related to the phase of entrained neuronal alpha oscillations. Fewer studies probed the consequences of rhythmic alpha stimulation for attention mechanisms related to alpha power. Here, we asked whether alpha stimulation of one hemifield has similar effects on reaction times as we see for increased alpha synchronization in magneto/electroencephalography (M/EEG) studies (i.e., more alpha means impaired processing and functional inhibition). We implemented a task inspired by attention studies, assessing reaction times to ipsilateral vs. contralateral visual targets, with and without concurrent presentation of distractors. Yet, in place of any attention cues, we presented a rhythmic, vs. arrhythmic, alpha-frequency train of visual flashes to one hemifield, in a large sample size (N = 115) in an online experiment. We found clear evidence that flash train rhythmicity did not impact task performance. We also found that the spatial congruence between the unilateral flash train and the subsequent visual target did impact response times but only in the presence of contralateral distractor stimuli. We discuss implications, limitations and future directions.

J	Li, MA; Han, JF; Yang, JF				Li, Ming-ai; Han, Jian-fu; Yang, Jin-fu			Automatic feature extraction and fusion recognition of motor imagery EEG using multilevel multiscale CNN	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Convolutional neural network; Wavelet transform; MI-EEG imaging method; Machine learning	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; SIGNALS; TASKS	A motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) signal is often selected as the driving signal in an active brain computer interface (BCI) system, and it has been a popular field to recognize MI-EEG images via convolutional neural network (CNN), which poses a potential problem for maintaining the integrity of the time-frequency-space information in MI-EEG images and exploring the feature fusion mechanism in the CNN. However, information is excessively compressed in the present MI-EEG image, and the sequential CNN is unfavorable for the comprehensive utilization of local features. In this paper, a multidimensional MI-EEG imaging method is proposed, which is based on time-frequency analysis and the Clough-Tocher (CT) interpolation algorithm. The time-frequency matrix of each electrode is generated via continuous wavelet transform (WT), and the relevant section of frequency is extracted and divided into nine submatrices, the longitudinal sums and lengths of which are calculated along the directions of frequency and time successively to produce a 3 x 3 feature matrix for each electrode. Then, feature matrix of each electrode is interpolated to coincide with their corresponding coordinates, thereby yielding a WT-based multidimensional image, called WTMI. Meanwhile, a multilevel and multiscale feature fusion convolutional neural network (MLMSFFCNN) is designed for WTMI, which has dense information, low signal-to-noise ratio, and strong spatial distribution. Extensive experiments are conducted on the BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets, and accuracies of 92.95% and 97.03% are yielded based on 10-fold cross-validation, respectively, which exceed those of the state-of-the-art imaging methods. The kappa values and p values demonstrate that our method has lower class skew and error costs. The experimental results demonstrate that WTMI can fully represent the time-frequency-space features of MI-EEG and that MLMSFFCNN is beneficial for improving the collection of multiscale features and the fusion recognition of general and abstract features for WTMI.

Transfer spectral entropy (TSE) method has been used to describe corticomuscular coupling within single scale. As an extension of TSE, multiscale transfer spectral entropy (MSTSE) is proposed in this paper to depict multi-layer of neural information transfer between two coupling signals. The reliability and effectiveness of MSTSE were verified on data generated by nonlinear numerical models and those of a force tracking task. Compared with TSE, MSTSE is more robust to the embedding dimension and performs optimally in the detection of the coupling properties. Further analysis of the physiological signals showed that the MSTSE provided more detailed band characteristics than the single scale TSE measurement. MSTSE indicates significant coupling scattered in alpha, beta and low gamma bands during the force tracking task. Besides, the coupling strength in the descending direction of the beta band was significantly higher than that in the ascending direction. This study constructs multi-scale coupling information to provide a new perspective for exploring corticomuscular interaction.

Yet, the role of binaural cues in auditory scene analysis (ASA) has received relatively little attention in recent neuroscientific studies employing novel, spectro-temporally complex stimuli. This may be because a stimulation paradigm that provides binaurally derived grouping cues of sufficient spectro-temporal complexity has not yet been established for neuroscientific ASA experiments. Random-chord stereograms (RCS) are a class of auditory stimuli that exploit spectro-temporal variations in the interaural envelope correlation of noise-like sounds with interaurally coherent fine structure; they evoke salient auditory percepts that emerge only under binaural listening. Here, our aim was to assess the usability of the RCS paradigm for indexing binaural processing in the human brain. To this end, we recorded EEG responses to RCS stimuli from 12 normal-hearing subjects. The stimuli consisted of an initial 3-s noise segment with interaurally uncorrelated envelopes, followed by another 3-s segment, where envelope correlation was modulated periodically according to the RCS paradigm. Modulations were applied either across the entire stimulus bandwidth (wideband stimuli) or in temporally shifting frequency bands (ripple stimulus). Event-related potentials and inter-trial phase coherence analyses of the EEG responses showed that the introduction of the 3- or 5-Hz wideband modulations produced a prominent change-onset complex and ongoing synchronized responses to the RCS modulations. In contrast, the ripple stimulus elicited a change-onset response but no response to ongoing RCS modulation. Frequency-domain analyses revealed increased spectral power at the fundamental frequency and the first harmonic of wideband RCS modulations. RCS stimulation yields robust EEG measures of binaurally driven auditory reorganization and has potential to provide a flexible stimulation paradigm suitable for isolating binaural effects in ASA experiments.

Here, we used electroencephalography to examine brain-wide cortical PPC networks at term-equivalent age, comparing human infants after early prematurity to a cohort of healthy controls. We found that prematurity affected these networks in a sleep state-specific manner, and the differences between groups were also frequency-selective, involving brain-wide connections. The strength of synchronization in these networks was predictive of clinical outcomes in the preterm infants. These findings show that prematurity affects PPC networks in a clinically significant manner, suggesting early functional biomarkers of later neurodevelopmental compromise that may be used in clinical or translational studies after early neonatal adversity.

Decoding visual colour from scalp electroencephalography measurements	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Color; EEG; Decoding; Supervised learning; Features; Vision	WORKING-MEMORY; INFORMATION; ATTENTION; EEG; RESPONSES; REPRESENTATIONS; MICROSACCADES; OSCILLATIONS; MEG	Recent advances have made it possible to decode various aspects of visually presented stimuli from patterns of scalp EEG measurements. As of recently, such multivariate methods have been commonly used to decode visual-spatial features such as location, orientation, or spatial frequency. In the current study, we show that it is also possible to track visual colour processing by using Linear Discriminant Analysis on patterns of EEG activity. Building on other recent demonstrations, we show that colour decoding: (1) reflects sensory qualities (as opposed to, for example, verbal labelling) with a prominent contribution from posterior electrodes contralateral to the stimulus, (2) conforms to a parametric coding space, (3) is possible in multi-item displays, and (4) is comparable in magnitude to the decoding of visual stimulus orientation. Through subsampling our data, we also provide an estimate of the approximate number of trials and participants required for robust decoding. Finally, we show that while colour decoding can be sensitive to subtle differences in luminance, our colour decoding results are primarily driven by measured colour differences between stimuli. Colour decoding opens a relevant new dimension in which to track visual processing using scalp EEG measurements, while bypassing potential confounds associated with decoding approaches that focus on spatial features.

Different frequency oscillations have different contributions to brain function, and cross-frequency coupling (CFC) has been found to exist within brain regions. Cross-channel and inter-channel analysis should be both focused because they help to analyze how epilepsy networks change and also localize the EZ. In this paper, we analyzed long-term stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) data from 17 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Single-channel and cross-channel CFC features were combined to establish functional brain networks, and the network characteristics under different periods and the localization of EZ were analyzed. It was observed that theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling (PAC) within the electrodes in the seizure region increased during the ictal (p < 0.05). Theta-gamma and delta-gamma PAC of cross-channel were enhanced in the early and mid-late ictal, respectively. It was also found that there was a strong cross-frequency coupling state between channels of EZ in the functional network during the ictal, along with a more regular network than interictal. The accuracy rate of EZ localization was 82.4%. Overall, the combination of single-channel and multi-channel cross-band coupling analysis can help identify seizures and localize EZ for temporal lobe epilepsy. Rhythmic coupling reveals a relationship between the functional network and the seizure status of epilepsy.

However, MSI algorithm is hard to fully exploit SSVEP-related harmonic components in the electroencephalogram (EEG), which limits the application of MSI algorithm in BCI systems. In this paper, we propose a novel filter bank-driven MSI algorithm (FBMSI) to overcome the limitation and further improve the accuracy of SSVEP recognition. We evaluate the efficacy of the FBMSI method by developing a 6-command SSVEP-NAO robot system with extensive experimental analyses. An offline experimental study is first performed with EEG collected from nine subjects to investigate the effects of varying parameters on the model performance. Offline results show that the proposed method has achieved a stable improvement effect. We further conduct an online experiment with six subjects to assess the efficacy of the developed FBMSI algorithm in a real-time BCI application. The online experimental results show that the FBMSI algorithm yields a promising average accuracy of 83.56% using a data length of even only one second, which was 12.26% higher than the standard MSI algorithm. These extensive experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the FBMSI algorithm in SSVEP recognition and demonstrated its potential application in the development of improved BCI systems.

Baseline corrected power of scalp current density transformed EEG was statistically assessed with cluster-based permutation testing. Delta and theta activities revealed differences in their spatial properties at the time of finger tapping execution. Theta synchronization showed a contralateral double activation in the parietal and fronto-central regions, while delta activity appeared in the central contralateral channels. Differences in the spatiotemporal topography between delta and theta activity in the course of movement execution were identified on high density EEG.

At any given moment, only one of several possible perceptual representations prevails in our conscious experience. Our hypothesis is that the competition between alternative representations induces a pattern of neural activation resembling cognitive conflict, eventually leading to fluctuations between different perceptual outcomes in the case of steep competition. To test this hypothesis, we probed changes in perceptual awareness between competing images using binocular rivalry. We drew our predictions from the conflict monitoring theory, which holds that cognitive control is invoked by the detection of conflict during information processing. Our results show that fronto-medial theta oscillations (5-7 Hz), an established electroencephalography (EEG) marker of conflict, increases right before perceptual alternations and decreases thereafter, suggesting that conflict monitoring occurs during perceptual competition. Furthermore, to investigate conflict resolution via attentional engagement, we looked for a neural marker of perceptual switches as by parieto-occipital alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz). The power of parieto-occipital alpha displayed an inverse pattern to that of fronto-medial theta, reflecting periods of high interocular inhibition during stable perception, and low inhibition around moments of perceptual change. Our findings aim to elucidate the relationship between conflict monitoring mechanisms and perceptual awareness.

J	Li, MA; Ruan, ZW				Li, Ming-ai; Ruan, Zi-wei			A novel decoding method for motor imagery tasks with 4D data representation and 3D convolutional neural networks	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						motor imagery EEG; EEG source imaging; convolutional neural network; data representation; time of interest; 4D dipole feature matrix	EEG; CLASSIFICATION	Objective. Motor imagery electroencephalography (MI-EEG) produces one of the most commonly used biosignals in intelligent rehabilitation systems. The newly developed 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN) is gaining increasing attention for its ability to recognize MI tasks. The key to successful identification of movement intention is dependent on whether the data representation can faithfully reflect the cortical activity induced by MI. However, the present data representation, which is often generated from partial source signals with time-frequency analysis, contains incomplete information. Therefore, it would be beneficial to explore a new type of data representation using raw spatiotemporal dipole information as well as the possible development of a matching 3DCNN. Approach. Based on EEG source imaging and 3DCNN, a novel decoding method for identifying MI tasks is proposed, called ESICNND. MI-EEG is mapped to the cerebral cortex by the standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography algorithm, and the optimal sampling points of the dipoles are selected as the time of interest to best reveal the difference between any two MI tasks. Then, the initial subject coordinate system is converted to a magnetic resonance imaging coordinate system, followed by dipole interpolation and volume down-sampling; the resulting 3D dipole amplitude matrices are merged at the selected sampling points to obtain 4D dipole feature matrices (4DDFMs). These matrices are augmented by sliding window technology and input into a 3DCNN with a cascading architecture of three modules (3M3DCNN) to perform the extraction and classification of comprehensive features. Main results. Experiments are carried out on two public datasets; the average ten-fold CV classification accuracies reach 88.73% and 96.25%, respectively, and the statistical analysis demonstrates outstanding consistency and stability. Significance. The 4DDFMs reveals the variation of cortical activation in a 3D spatial cube with a temporal dimension and matches the 3M3DCNN well, making full use of the high-resolution spatiotemporal information from all dipoles.

J	Schaworonkow, N; Voytek, B				Schaworonkow, Natalie; Voytek, Bradley			Enhancing oscillations in intracranial electrophysiological recordings with data-driven spatial filters	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; PHASE; POWER; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; MECHANISMS; EXTRACTION	Author summary Invasive electrophysiological recordings of human brain activity offer the unique ability to measure multiple, simultaneously active brain rhythms. Analyzing brain rhythms is complex due to the fact that different oscillations often overlap in space and time. Here we explore human resting state invasive electrophysiological recordings by using spatial filters, which combine information from all available recording electrodes to specifically extract oscillations with high signal to noise ratio. Using this technique, we explore variability in oscillation presence across subjects, the spatial spread and waveform shape of oscillations. We find that participants differ a lot in presence of oscillations, even when the recording electrodes have similar placement. We find that oscillations exhibit spatial spread exceeding the distance between electrodes and that the waveform shape of oscillations in different brain regions can be highly deviating from a sine wave. In invasive electrophysiological recordings, a variety of neural oscillations can be detected across the cortex, with overlap in space and time. This overlap complicates measurement of neural oscillations using standard referencing schemes, like common average or bipolar referencing. Here, we illustrate the effects of spatial mixing on measuring neural oscillations in invasive electrophysiological recordings and demonstrate the benefits of using data-driven referencing schemes in order to improve measurement of neural oscillations. We discuss referencing as the application of a spatial filter. Spatio-spectral decomposition is used to estimate data-driven spatial filters, a computationally fast method which specifically enhances signal-to-noise ratio for oscillations in a frequency band of interest. We show that application of these data-driven spatial filters has benefits for data exploration, investigation of temporal dynamics and assessment of peak frequencies of neural oscillations. We demonstrate multiple use cases, exploring between-participant variability in presence of oscillations, spatial spread and waveform shape of different rhythms as well as narrowband noise removal with the aid of spatial filters. We find high between-participant variability in the presence of neural oscillations, a large variation in spatial spread of individual rhythms and many non-sinusoidal rhythms across the cortex. Improved measurement of cortical rhythms will yield better conditions for establishing links between cortical activity and behavior, as well as bridging scales between the invasive intracranial measurements and noninvasive macroscale scalp measurements.

Surjo			A set of electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded during amplitude-modulated transcranial alternating current stimulation (AM-tACS) targeting 10-Hz steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP)	DATA IN BRIEF			English	Article; Data Paper						Stimulation artifact source separation; Brain oscillations; Single-trial traces; Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS); Stimulation artifact; Electroencephalography (EEG)		Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can affect perception, learning and cognition, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. A promising strategy to elucidate these mechanisms aims at applying tACS while electric or magnetic brain oscillations targeted by stimulation are recorded. However, reconstructing brain oscillations targeted by tACS remains a challenging problem due to stimulation artifacts. Besides lack of an established strategy to effectively supress such stimulation artifacts, there are also no resources available that allow for the development and testing of new and effective tACS artefact suppression algorithms, such as adaptive spatial filtering using beamforming or signal-space projection. Here, we provide a full dataset comprising encephalographic (EEG) recordings across six healthy human volunteers who underwent 10-Hz amplitude-modulated tACS (AM-tACS) during a 10-Hz steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) paradigm. Moreover, data and scripts are provided related to the validation of a novel stimulation artefact suppression strategy, Stimulation Artifact Source Separation (SASS), removing EEG signal components that are maximally different in the presence versus absence of stimulation. Besides including EEG single-trial data and comparisons of 10-Hz brain oscillatory phase and amplitude recorded across three conditions (condition 1: no stimulation, condition 2: stimulation with SASS, condition 3: stimulation without SASS), also power spectra and topographies of SSVEP amplitudes across all three conditions are presented. Moreover, data is provided for assessing nonlinear modulations of the stimulation artifact in both time and frequency domains due to heartbeats. Finally, the dataset includes eigenvalue spectra and spatial patterns of signal components that were identified and removed by SASS for stimulation artefact suppression at the target frequency. Besides providing a valuable resource to assess properties of AM-tACS artifacts in the EEG, this dataset allows for testing different artifact rejection methods and offers in-depth insights into the workings of SASS.

However, it is unclear how high-frequency oscillations are impacted by age in the paediatric population. We prospectively recorded whole-night scalp EEG in 30 children and adolescents with focal or generalized epilepsy. We used an automated and clinically validated high-frequency oscillation detector to determine ripple rates (80-250 Hz) in bipolar channels. Children < 7 years had higher high-frequency oscillation rates (P = 0.021) when compared with older children. The median test retest reliability of high-frequency oscillation rates reached 100% (iqr 50) for a data interval duration of 10 min. Scalp high-frequency oscillation frequency decreased with age (r = -0.558, P= 0.002), whereas scalp high-frequency oscillation duration and amplitude were unaffected. The signal-to-noise ratio improved with age (r = 0.37, P = 0.048), and the background tipple band activity decreased with age ( r = -0.463, P = 0.011). We characterize the relationship of scalp high-frequency oscillation features and age in paediatric patients. EEG intervals of >= 10 min duration are required for reliable measurements of high-frequency oscillation rates. This study is a further step towards establishing scalp high-frequency oscillations as a valid epileptogenicity biomarker in this vulnerable age group. [GRAPHICS] .

Methods: Participants received an EEG prior to starting CBD, after approximately 12 weeks of CBD (FU1) and after approximately one year of CBD therapy (FU2). Longitudinal changes in five EEG measures (background frequency, focal slowing, reactivity, frequency of interictal, and ictal discharges) were examined following CBD exposure. Data were compared between pediatric and adult groups at two follow-up time points and within groups over time. Population-averaged models with generalized estimation equations or linear mixed effects models were used to analyze data where appropriate. Correlation analysis was used to assess any association between changes in seizure frequency and changes in EEG interictal discharge (IED) frequency. An alpha level of 5% was used to assess statistical significance. Results: At FU1, the adult group showed significant decrease in IED/minute (IDR 0.07, 95% CI [0.04, 0.14], P < 0.001); a nonsignificant decrease was observed among children (IDR 0.87, 95% CI [0.47, 0.64], P = 0.67). The difference in changes over time between participant groups was significant after adjusting for last CBD dose (IDR 11.8, 95% CI [4.86, 28.65], P < 0.0001). At FU2 both groups showed significant reduction from baseline after controlling for last CBD dose. This decrease was more pronounced in children (IDR 15.38, 95% CI [4.93, 47.99], P < 0.001). There was no significant correlation between changes in seizure frequency and EEG IED frequency at each timepoint (P = 0.542, 0.917 and 0.989 from baseline to FU1, FU1 to FU2 and baseline to FU2, respectively). Significance: This longitudinal EEG study shows that highly-purified plant-derived CBD has positive effects on interictal epileptiform discharge frequency but no effects on other EEG measures. The effect of CBD does not appear to be dose or treatment-duration dependent. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Al-Shargie, F; Tariq, U; Babiloni, F; Al-Nashash, H				Al-Shargie, Fares; Tariq, Usman; Babiloni, Fabio; Al-Nashash, Hasan			Cognitive Vigilance Enhancement Using Audio Stimulation of Pure Tone at 250 Hz	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Entropy; Task analysis; Electroencephalography; Image color analysis; Support vector machines; Monitoring; Frequency measurement; Vigilance; enhancement; electroencephalogram (EEG); entropies; and SVM		In this paper, we propose a novel vigilance enhancement method based on audio stimulation of pure tone at 250 Hz. We induced two different levels of vigilance state; vigilance decrement (VD) and vigilance enhancement (VE). The VD state was induced by performing a modified version of the Stroop Color-Word Task (SCWT) for approximately 45 minutes. Likewise, the VE state was induced by incorporating audio stimulation of 250 Hz into the SCWT for 45 minutes. We assessed the levels of vigilance on 20 healthy subjects by utilizing Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and machine learning. The EEG signals were analyzed using four types of entropies; Approximate Entropy (AE), Sample Entropy (SE), Fuzzy Entropy (FE), and Differential Entropy (DE). We then quantified vigilance levels using statistical analysis and support vector machines (SVM) classifier. We found that the proposed VE method has significantly reduced the reaction time (RT) by 44% and improved the accuracy of target detection by 25%, (p < 0.001) compared to VD state. Besides, we found that 30 min of audio stimulation has reduced the RT by 32% from the beginning to the end of VE phase of the experiment. The entropy measures show that the temporal profile of the EEG signals has significantly increased with VE. The classification results showed that SVM technique with DE features across all frequency bands can detect VE levels with accuracy varying between (92.10 +/- 02.24)% to (98.32 +/- 01.14)%, sensitivity of (92.50 +/- 02.33)% to (98.66 +/- 01.00)%, and specificity of (91.70 +/- 02.32)% to (97.99 +/- 01.05)%. Results also showed that the classification performance using DE has outperformed the other entropy measures by an average of +8.07%. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 250 Hz audio stimulation method in improving vigilance level and suggest using it for future cognitive enhancement studies.

To verify, we investigated the interaction effect between multisensory quality (sensory enrichment) and semantic (in)congruency during L2 sentence comprehension. English words were selected for the subjects to learn according to the sensory-based emotioncy model. The words were embedded in an acceptability judgment task with 216 sentences under congruent and semantically incongruent conditions. Twenty-two subjects performed the task while their EEG was being recorded. Based on the time-frequency analysis results, in the 300-850 ms window, only lower delta power (1.7-2.2 Hz) showed an enhanced increase after sentences with semantic incongruency. This increase was more pronounced in the sentences with limited multisensory quality. To make up for the insufficient multisensory knowledge and maintain concentration, irrelevant cortical areas were deactivated as a result of lower delta wave synchronisation.

Here, we investigated whether altered large-scale couplings of brain oscillations could be linked to the balancing of cognitive decline in a longitudinal cohort of people with idiopathic rapid eye-movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). Methods: We analyzed 18 patients (17 males, 69.7 +/- 7.5 years) with iRBD undergoing high-density EEG (HD-EEG), presynaptic dopaminergic imaging, and clinical and neuropsychological (NPS) assessments at two time points (time interval 24.2 +/- 5.9 months). We thus quantified the HD-EEG power distribution, orthogonalized amplitude correlation, and weighted phase-lag index at both time points and correlated them with clinical, NPS, and imaging data. Results: Four patients phenoconverted at follow-up (three cases of parkinsonism and one of dementia). At the group level, NPS scores decreased over time, without reaching statistical significance. However, alpha phase synchronization increased and delta amplitude correlations decreased significantly at follow-up compared to baseline. Both large-scale network connectivity metrics were significantly correlated with NPS scores but not with sleep quality indices or presynaptic dopaminergic imaging data. Conclusions: These results suggest that increased alpha phase synchronization and reduced delta amplitude correlation may be considered electrophysiological signs of an active compensatory mechanism of cognitive impairment in people with iRBD. Large-scale functional modifications may be helpful biomarkers in the characterization of prodromal stages of alpha-synucleinopathies.

However, few studies have focused on distraction?s cognitive features and how to monitor it objectively in the construction workplace. To fill the research gap, the present study examined the correlation between distraction and brain activity using an Electroencephalography (EEG) device, intending to provide an approach for objectively monitoring worker distraction. In the simulated hazards identification activity, sustained attention to response task and dual-task paradigms have been employed to induce distraction combined with noise interference. Twenty-seven subjects participated in the experiment to identify whether a hazardous opening exists or not in the workplace in the shown images. The EEG waves were recorded and divided into two groups according to task performance: focused and distracted. Through feature calculation and extraction, it was found that beta and gamma powers in the left temporal and right pre-frontal cortex can distinguish these two statuses, particularly in channels T7 and AF4. The indicators can be considered as an objective evaluation of an individual?s sustained attention and attention failures. The developed indicators located in specified brain zones can also be used as a reference for attention training. By providing safety managers with attention status about the workers in high-risk workplaces, distraction detection contributes to control and regulate work error and improper operation, which can extend to apply in other attentive jobs like drivers, pilots, surgeons, and lifeguards.

To reveal how people monitor and control ongoing processing in the pursuit of original and valuable ideas, high-density electroencephalography (EEG) was used to record electrophysiological signals when participants were performing chunk decomposition tasks via novel-appropriate, novel-inappropriate, ordinary-appropriate and ordinary-inappropriate pathways. The results showed that approximately 100 ms after the problem was presented, novel pathways showed increased theta synchronization in the frontal sites compared to ordinary pathways. Novel pathways were associated with increased alpha desynchronization over the entire brain scale. These theta and alpha oscillations likely indicated rapid monitoring and effective control of novel processing in thinking. In the latter stages of problem solving, particularly during the 2000-2600-ms intervals, increased theta synchronization with decreased alpha desynchronization was found between novel-inappropriate and novel-appropriate pathways, which likely indicated slow monitoring and less control of inappropriate processing in novel thinking. The findings demonstrated the dynamic monitoring and control mechanism in the pursuit of original and valuable ideas.

This commentary reviews key themes and major developments in the field from the last several decades, and outlines open questions and future directions for the next phase of research. Two main areas of progress in recent years relate to (1) improvements in study design and psychometric approaches, and (2) increased integration with cognitive psychology and neuroscience. In turn, these advances have clarified several themes and pressing issues. These include: The need to establish the replicability and effect sizes of key effects, the need to explicitly attend to the distinction between trait- and task-related sources of variance in correlations between intelligence and EEG variables, the need to systematically identify and test moderators of those relationships, the need for greater use of formal modeling at the level of measurement and theory, and the need for continued integration of theoretical advances from related disciplines. We argue that an increased focus on these issues can yield rapid progress in this area over the coming years. The commentary concludes with suggestions for both immediate priorities and long-term directions in basic and applied EEG research on intelligence.

Neuroimaging studies have mainly investigated where the cortical activities during AO and MI of movements are activated and if they match those activated during execution of the movements. However, it remains unclear how cortical activity is modulated; in particular, whether activity depends on observed or imagined phases of movements. We have previously examined the neural mechanisms underlying AO and MI of walking, focusing on the combined effect of AO with MI (AO+MI) and phase dependent modulation of corticospinal and spinal reflex excitability. Here, as a continuation of our previous studies, we investigated cortical activity depending on gait phases during AO and AO+MI of walking by using electroencephalography (EEG); 64-channel EEG signals were recorded in which participants observed walking with or without imagining it, respectively. EEG source and spectral analyses showed that, in the sensorimotor cortex during AO+MI and AO, the alpha and beta power were decreased, and power spectral modulations depended on walking phases. The phase dependent modulations during AO+MI, but not during AO, were like those which occur during actual walking as reported by previous walking studies. These results suggest that combinatory effects of AO+MI could induce parts of the phase dependent activation of the sensorimotor cortex during walking even without any movements. These findings would extend understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying walking and cognitive motor processes and provide clinically beneficial information towards rehabilitation for patients with neurological gait dysfunctions.

However, a growing body of work suggests that they exhibit critical limitations on tasks beyond image categorization. Here, we study one such fundamental limitation, concerning the judgment of whether two simultaneously presented items are the same or different (SD) compared with a baseline assessment of their spatial relationship (SR). In both human subjects and artificial neural networks, we test the prediction that SD tasks recruit additional cortical mechanisms which underlie critical aspects of visual cognition that are not explained by current computational models. We thus recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals from human participants engaged in the same tasks as the computational models. Importantly, in humans the two tasks were matched in terms of difficulty by an adaptive psychometric procedure; yet, on top of a modulation of evoked potentials (EPs), our results revealed higher activity in the low beta (16-24 Hz) band in the SD compared with the SR conditions. We surmise that these oscillations reflect the crucial involvement of additional mechanisms, such as working memory and attention, which are missing in current feed-forward CNNs.

Here, we characterized how EEG complexity, as indexed by Multiscale Permutation Entropy (MSPE), changed progressively in the evening prior to light off and during the transition from wakefulness to sleep. We further explored whether MSPE was able to discriminate between wakefulness and sleep around sleep onset and whether MSPE changes were correlated with spectral measures of the EEG related to sleep need during concomitant wakefulness (theta power-P-theta: 4-8 Hz). To address these questions, we took advantage of large datasets of several hundred of ambulatory EEG recordings of individual of both sexes aged 25-101 years. Results show that MSPE significantly decreases before light off (i.e. before sleep time) and in the transition from wakefulness to sleep onset. Furthermore, MSPE allows for an excellent discrimination between pre-sleep wakefulness and early sleep. Finally, we show that MSPE is correlated with concomitant P-theta. Yet, the direction of the latter correlation changed from before light-off to the transition to sleep. Given the association between EEG complexity and consciousness, MSPE may track efficiently putative changes in consciousness preceding sleep onset. An MSPE stands as a comprehensive measure that is not limited to a given frequency band and reflects a progressive change brain state associated with sleep and wakefulness regulation. It may be an effective mean to detect when the brain is in a state close to sleep onset.

The apparatus (commercial EEG Muse headband) provided an opportunity to analyze states of calmness and alertness in n = 20 participants as they visited selected Informal Green Spaces in Warsaw, Poland. The article aims to test the hypothesis that passive recreation in Informal Green Spaces (IGSs) has a positive impact on emotional well-being and that there is a connection between the intensity of states of calmness and alertness and 1. the type of green space (IGS/GS), 2. the type of scenery and 3. the type of IGS. The preliminary experiment showed that there might be no substantial distinction in the users' levels of emotional states when considering existing typologies. On the other hand, data-driven analysis suggests that there might be a connection between the state of alertness and some characteristics of specific areas. After carrying out the multivariate analyses of variance in the repeated measurement scheme and finding significant differences between oscillations in different areas, we conclude that there might be three possible sources of lower alertness and increased calmness in some areas. These are 1. the presence of "desirable" human intervention such as paths and urban furniture, 2. a lack of "undesirable" users and signs of their presence and 3. the presence of other "desirable" users.

This study examined this process by using the time-frequency analysis of EEG signals and analyzed the obtained data by using the event-related oscillations method. This study aimed to examine the oscillatory brain responses and distinguish one's own body from other's body. In the present study, 17 young adults were included and the EEGs were recorded with 32 electrodes placed in different locations. Event-related power spectrum and phase-locking analyzes were performed. ITC and ERSP data were analyzed using 2 (condition) x 11 (location) x 2 (hemisphere) ANOVA Design. As we observed a prolonged response in the theta band in the grand averages, we included the time variable in the overall model. As a result, we found that the phase-locking and the event-related power spectrum of the theta response in recognizing one's own body were higher when compared to the phase-locking and the event-related power spectrum of the theta response in recognizing others' body (p < 0.05). When the time variable was included, the early theta response was more phase-locked and had a higher power spectrum compared to the late theta response (p < 0.05). As a result of the power spectrum analysis, the condition x hemisphere interaction effect in the beta band was higher in the left hemisphere regarding increased responses in recognizing one's own body (p < 0.05). As a result of ITC, the main effect of the condition was higher in the recognition of the stimulus of one's own body (p < 0.05). Finally, the theta oscillator response stood out in distinguishing one's own body from other's body. Similarly, the power spectrum in the beta response was higher in the left hemisphere, and this finding is consistent with the literature.

This study proposes a detection model of the coupling strength between the cortex and muscles. The detection model uses an adaptive selector to choose the optimal long short-term memory network, uses this network to extract the features of electroencephalography and electromyography, and finally transforms time characteristics into the frequency domain. The transfer entropy is used to represent the interaction intensity of signals in different frequency bands. Using this model, we analyze the coupling relationship between the cortex and muscles in the three movements of wrist flexion, wrist extension, and clench fist, and compare the model with traditional wavelet coherence analysis and deep canonical correlation analysis. The experimental results show that our model can not only express the bidirectional coupling relationship between different frequency bands but also suppress the possible false coupling that traditional methods may detect. Our research shows that the proposed model has great potential in medical rehabilitation, movement decoding, and other fields.

We evaluated the psychological and physiological adaptation and the functional cerebral changes using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to 6.5 min of dry static apnea performed by a world champion free diver. Compared to resting state at baseline, breath holding was characterized by increased EEG power and functional connectivity in the alpha band, along with decreased delta band connectivity. fMRI connectivity was increased within the default mode network (DMN) and visual areas but decreased in pre- and postcentral cortices. While these changes occurred in regions overlapping with cerebral signatures of several meditation practices, they also display some unique features that suggest an altered somatosensory integration. As suggested by self-reports, these findings could reflect the ability of elite free divers to create a state of sensory dissociation when performing prolonged apnea.

Biomarkers that predict clinical outcomes in depression are essential for increasing the precision of treatments and clinical outcomes. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a noninvasive neurophysiological test that is promising as a biomarker sensitive to treatment effects. The aim of our study was to investigate a novel nonlinear index of the resting state EEG activity as a predictor of clinical outcome and compare its predictive capacity to traditional frequency-based indices. EEG was recorded from 50 patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD) and 24 healthy comparison (HC) subjects. TRD patients were treated with excitatory rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 4-6 weeks. EEG signals were first decomposed using the ICA algorithm and the extracted components were then processed by time-frequency analysis. We then go on to compare the participants' depression severity before, after, and 2 months after finishing the last treatment session using the proposed rTMS therapy. Absolute powers (APs), band powers (BPs), and theta and beta band entropies (BAs), which were extracted from the EEG, are used as features for the classification of changes in patients and normal cases after applying rTMS. Accordingly, we can go beyond the Beck score and clinically classify the EEG signal into two classes: depression and normal. The results demonstrated 78.37%, 74.32%, and 82.43% accuracy for artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, respectively, indicating the superiority of the proposed method to those mentioned in similar studies. Also, the electrophysiological changes are shown to be evident in patients with major depression. Our data show that the time-frequency index yields superior outcome prediction performance compared to the traditional frequency band indices. Our findings warrant further investigation of EEG-based biomarkers in depression.

EEG signals are recorded as sinusoidal waves, containing spectral amplitudes across several frequency bands with high spatio-temporal resolution. Prior work on EEG signal analysis has been made mainly at individual electrodes. These signals can be evaluated from advanced aspects, including sub-regional and hemispheric analyses. Due to limitation of computational techniques, few studies in earlier work could conduct data analyses from these aspects. Therefore, EEG in patients with SUD is not fully understood. In the present retrospective study, spectral powers from a data house containing opioid (OUD), methamphetamine/stimulants (MUD), and alcohol use disorder (AUD) were extracted, and then converted into five distinct topographic data (i.e., electrode-based, cortical subregion-based, left-right hemispheric, anterior-posterior based, and total cortex-based analyses). We found that data conversion and reorganization in the topographic way had an impact on EEG spectral powers in patients with OUD significantly different from those with MUD or AUD. Differential changes were observed from multiple perspectives, including individual electrodes, subregions, hemispheres, anterior-posterior cortices, and across the cortex as a whole. Understanding the differential changes in EEG signals may be useful for future work with machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), not only for diagnostic but also for prognostic purposes in patients with SUD.

Electrophysiological Correlation Underlying the Effects of Music Preference on the Prefrontal Cortex Using a Brain-Computer Interface	SENSORS			English	Article						brain&#8211; computer interface; EEG; music preference; prefrontal cortex	EEG; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; ASYMMETRY; ATTENTION; ANTERIOR; EMOTION; IMPACT	This study aims to research the task of recognising brain activities in the prefrontal cortex that correspond to music at different preference levels. Since task performance regarding the effects of the subjects' favourite music can lead to better outcomes, we focus on the physical interpretation of electroencephalography (EEG) bands underlying the preference level for music. The experiment was implemented using a continuous response digital interface for the preference classification of three types of musical stimuli. The results showed that favourite songs more significantly evoked frontal theta than did the music of low and moderate preference levels. Additionally, correlations of frontal theta with cognitive state indicated that the frontal theta is associated not only with the cognitive state but also with emotional processing. These findings demonstrate that favourite songs can have more positive effects on listeners than less favourable music and suggest that theta and lower alpha in the frontal cortex are good indicators of both cognitive state and emotion.

However, few studies have used quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) index of ratios between slower and faster frequencies such as the delta/alpha ratio (DAR) and the power ratio index (PRI; delta+theta/alpha+beta) for investigating the difference between the affected and unaffected hemisphere poststroke. Here, we proposed a new perspective for analyzing DAR and PRI within each hemisphere and investigated the motor impairment-related interhemispheric frequency oscillations. Forty-seven poststroke subjects and twelve healthy controls were included in the study. Severity of upper limb motor impairment was classified according to the Fugl-Meyer assessment in mild/moderate (n=25) and severe (n=22). The qEEG indexes (PRI and DAR) were computed for each hemisphere (intrahemispheric index) and for both hemispheres (cerebral index). Considering the cerebral index (DAR and PRI), our results showed a slowing in brain activity in poststroke patients when compared to healthy controls. Only the intrahemispheric PRI index was able to find significant interhemispheric differences of frequency oscillations. Despite being unable to detect interhemispheric differences, the DAR index seems to be more sensitive to detect motor impairment-related frequency oscillations. The intrahemispheric PRI index may provide insights into therapeutic approaches for interhemispheric asymmetry after stroke.

Research has identified abnormal resting state electroencephalography (EEG) power and functional connectivity patterns in major depression. However, the entity of dysfunctional EEG dynamics in dysphoria is yet unknown. Methods: 32-channel EEG was recorded in 26 female individuals with dysphoria and in 38 age-matched, female healthy controls. EEG power spectra and alpha asymmetry in frontal and posterior channels were calculated in a 4-minute resting condition. An EEG functional connectivity analysis was conducted through phase locking values, particularly mean phase coherence. Results: While individuals with dysphoria did not differ from controls in EEG spectra and asymmetry, they exhibited dysfunctional brain connectivity. Particularly, in the theta band (4-8 Hz), participants with dysphoria showed increased connectivity between right frontal and central areas and right temporal and left occipital areas. Moreover, in the alpha band (8-12 Hz), dysphoria was associated with increased connectivity between right and left prefrontal cortex and between frontal and central-occipital areas bilaterally. Limitations: All participants belonged to the female gender and were relatively young. Mean phase coherence did not allow to compute the causal and directional relation between brain areas. Conclusions: An increased EEG functional connectivity in the theta and alpha bands characterizes dysphoria. These patterns may be associated with the excessive self-focus and ruminative thinking that typifies depressive symptoms. EEG connectivity patterns may represent a promising measure to identify individuals with a higher risk of developing depression.

Virtual reality (VR) is not a perfect copy of the real world, and individuals perceive time duration differently in the VRE than they do in reality. Though many researchers have found a connection between task complexity and time estimation under non-VR conditions, the influence of task complexity on time estimation in the VRE is yet unknown. In this study, twenty-nine participants performed a VR jigsaw puzzle task at two levels of task complexity. We observed that as task complexity increased, participants showed larger time estimation errors, reduced relative beta-band power at Fz and Pz, and higher NASA-Task Load Index scores. Our findings indicate the importance of controlling task complexity in the VRE and demonstrate the potential of using electroencephalography (EEG) as real-time indicators of complexity level.</p>	[Li, Jiaxin; Kim, Ji-Eun] Univ Washington, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA		Kim, JE (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.	rikka125@uw.edu; jikim@uw.edu							81	1	1	5	7	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		2076-3417		APPL SCI-BASEL	Appl.

Since previous studies have linked reduced complexity of electroencephalography (EEG) signal to the process of cognitive decline, we propose the use of non-linear methods to characterise changes in EEG complexity induced by NFT. In this study, we analyse the pre- and post-training EEG from 11 elderly subjects who performed an NFT based on motor imagery (MI-NFT). Spectral changes were studied using relative power (RP) from classical frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, and beta), whilst multiscale entropy (MSE) was applied to assess EEG-induced complexity changes. Furthermore, we analysed the subject's scores from Luria tests performed before and after MI-NFT. We found that MI-NFT induced a power shift towards rapid frequencies, as well as an increase of EEG complexity in all channels, except for C3. These improvements were most evident in frontal channels. Moreover, results from cognitive tests showed significant enhancement in intellectual and memory functions. Therefore, our findings suggest the usefulness of MI-NFT to improve cognitive functions in the elderly and encourage future studies to use MSE as a metric to characterise EEG changes induced by MI-NFT.

Texture complexity evaluation is important for relying not only on the mathematical properties of the digital image, but also on human perception. Human subjective perception verbally expressed is relative in time, since it can be influenced by a variety of internal or external factors, such as: Mood, tiredness, stress, noise surroundings, and so on, while closely capturing the thought processes would be more straightforward to human reasoning and perception. With the long-term goal of designing more reliable measures of perception which relate to the internal human neural processes taking place when an image is perceived, we firstly performed an electroencephalography experiment with eight healthy participants during color textural perception of natural and fractal images followed by reasoning on their complexity degree, against single color reference images. Aiming at more practical applications for easy use, we tested this entire setting with a WiFi 6 channels electroencephalography (EEG) system. The EEG responses are investigated in the temporal, spectral and spatial domains in order to assess human texture complexity perception, in comparison with both textural types. As an objective reference, the properties of the color textural images are expressed by two common image complexity metrics: Color entropy and color fractal dimension. We observed in the temporal domain, higher Event Related Potentials (ERPs) for fractal image perception, followed by the natural and one color images perception. We report good discriminations between perceptions in the parietal area over time and differences in the temporal area regarding the frequency domain, having good classification performance.

Characterizing the traveling properties of EEG is helpful for understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural oscillations. However, traveling EEG based on non-invasive approach has little been investigated, and the relationship with brain intrinsic connectivity is not well known. In this study, traveling EEG of different frequency bands on the scalp in terms of the center of mass (EEG-CM) was examined. Then, two quantitative indexes describing the spatiotemporal features of EEG-CM were proposed, i.e., the traveling lateralization and velocity of EEG-CM. Further, based on simultaneous EEG-MRI approach, the relationship between traveling EEG-CM and the resting-state functional networks, as well as the microstructural connectivity of white matter was investigated. The results showed that there was similar spatial distribution of EEG-CM under different frequency bands, while the velocity of rhythmic EEG-CM increased in higher frequency bands. The lateralization of EEG-CM in low frequency bands (< 30 Hz) demonstrated negative relationship with the basal ganglia network (BGN). In addition, the velocity of the traveling EEG-CM was associated with the fractional anisotropy (FA) in corpus callosum and corona radiate. These results provided valid quantitative EEG index for understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of the scalp EEG, and implied that the EEG dynamics were representations of functional and structural organization of cortical and subcortical structures.

To achieve this goal, researchers need to ensure estimated signal features of interest are robust. In electro-and magnetoencephalography (EEG, MEG) we are not aware of any studies of the minimal length of data required to yield a robust one-session snapshot of the frequency-spectrum derivatives that are typically used to characterize the complex dynamics of the brain's resting-state. We aimed to fill this knowledge gap by studying the stability of common spectral measures of resting-state MEG source time series obtained from large samples of single-session recordings from shared data repositories featuring different recording conditions and instrument technologies (OMEGA: N = 107; Cam-CAN: N = 50). We discovered that the rhythmic and arrhythmic spectral properties of intrinsic brain activity can be robustly estimated in most cortical regions when derived from relatively short segments of 30-s to 120-s of resting-state data, regardless of instrument technology and resting-state paradigm. Using an adapted leave one-out approach and Bayesian analysis, we also provide evidence that the stability of spectral features over time is unaffected by age, sex, handedness, and general cognitive function. In summary, short MEG sessions are sufficient to yield robust estimates of frequency-defined brain activity during resting-state. This study may help guide future empirical designs in the field, particularly when recording times need to be minimized, such as with patient or special populations.

The aim of this study was to develop a computerized platform that employs electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the effects of working-memory training. Methods The platform included two systems: (i) in the assessment system we designed n-back paradigms and estimated synchronization index between the theta and gamma bands with working memory index (WMI) verification, while (ii) in the improvement system we designed working-memory training tasks based on three categories-a numerical version of a complex-span task, a figure-based version of a task-switching task, and a matrix version of a pattern task. Twenty-eight healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to the passive control and experimental groups. Results Significant correlations between WMI and level of difficulty were found for the numerical complex-span task and the pattern-integration task which suggested that training can improve working memory performance. Furthermore, the EEG coupling analysis revealed significantly different in the theta-band phase and high-gamma-band power (i.e., 70-90 Hz) at FC1 which could be used to uncover relationships with the working memory. Conclusion The system estimating the brainwave responses provided a complementary way of quantifying the degree of working memory other than using a psychophysical questionnaire. Furthermore, it could be simply and rapidly modified for implementing different training tasks, with features of flexibility, low cost, and minimal development time.

Shafiul; Bai, Ou			VMD-WSST: A Combined BCI Algorithm to Predict Self-paced Gait Intention	2021 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 17-20, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE		Brain-Computer Interface; Gait intention prediction; Assistive technology; VMD; WSST; SVM		Prediction of movement intention is of paramount importance to enable volitional control of assistive devices. The performances of current Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) are yet to reach the desired degree of accuracy necessary for real-life assistive technologies. Therefore, the prediction of gait intention remains a critical topic of research. This paper proposes an algorithm by leveraging two powerful empirical time-frequency analysis tools: Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Wavelet Synchrosqueezed Transform (WSST). A combination of VMD and WSST was implemented to extract high-quality features in the time-frequency plane from Electroencephalography (EEG) data collected from six healthy individuals. The data were collected while they performed self-paced repetitions of gait initiations and terminations without any external audio or visual cue. The extracted features were later used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a radial basis kernel to predict the intention to start or stop the gait cycle from gait-related EEG data. The combined VMD-WSST approach reached 83.36 +/- 1.75% accuracy, 82.83 +/- 2.99% sensitivity, and 83.45 +/- 3.59% specificity in starting intention detection. While, in the case of stopping intention prediction, the classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 81.57 +/- 1.70%, 81.14 +/- 3.06%, and 82.06 +/- 3.28%, respectively. The performances obtained by the proposed methodology were better than or competitive with those obtained by numerous state-of-the-art BCI methodologies. The results of this study show promise in predicting intention to start or stop walking from EEG, which could potentially enable assistive devices to be controlled volitionally.	[Hasan, S. M.

But EEG signals generated during an epileptic seizure are highly nonstationary and dynamic in nature and contain very crucial information about the state of the brain. Due to this randomness, the accuracy of analysis of EEG data by conventional and visual methods is reduced drastically. This paper aims at enhancing epilepsy seizure detection using deep learning models with an FPGA implementation of the short-time Fourier transform block. Detection of seizure has been achieved in the following stages: (1) time-frequency analysis of EEG segments using STFT; (2) extraction of frequency bands and features of interest; and (3) seizure detection using convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). For this work, the Bonn EEG dataset has been used. The maximum error of similar to 0.13% was encountered while the comparison of STFT output generated via proposed hardware architecture vs the output generated via simulation was done. The average classification accuracy of 93.9% and 97.2% was achieved by CNN and Bi-LSTM models, respectively, considering all frequency bands for epileptic and non-epileptic patients.

This study explores extant electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in search of patterns that could differentiate subjects undertaking mental tasks and reveals insights on said data. We estimated the power spectral density of the signals and found that the subjects showed stronger gamma brain waves during activity while presenting alpha waves at rest. We also found that subjects who performed better in those tasks seemed to present less power density in high-frequency ranges, which could imply decreased brain activity during tasks. In a time-domain analysis, we used Hall-Wood and Robust-Genton estimators along with the Hurst exponent by means of a detrented fluctuation analysis and found that the first two fractal measures are capable of better differentiating signals between the rest and activity datasets. The statistical results indicated that the brain region corresponding to Fp channels might be more suitable for analysing EEG data from patients conducting arithmetic tasks. In summary, both frequency- and time-based methods employed in the study provided useful insights and should be preferably used together in EEG analysis.

New method: A dynamic box plot approach to the theta/beta ratio with various window durations is proposed to analyze EEG. Results: Spectral results during a resting state in AD patients demonstrate the effect of relatively greater power in the low-frequency bands (i.e. 'slowing down' of the EEG). A significant difference is observed in the dynamic distribution of the theta/beta ratio in the AD and HC groups, which is related to the effect of 'slowing down'. There is a more obvious visual separation between the theta/beta ratio results for the AD and HC groups with increasing window durations. Variability of the theta/beta ratio can be observed with shorter window durations with a dynamic functional box plot. This provides a better classification accuracy by using the dynamic theta/ beta ratio as a sensor to discriminate AD EEG from HC EEG by using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and the area under curve (AUC) with various window durations. Comparison with existing method(s): EEG spectral analysis and theta/beta ratio used to evaluate EEG typically rely on long time averaging. Conclusions: The dynamic box plot approach to the theta/beta ratio with various window durations provides the possibility of observing features of the EEG. The dynamic theta/beta ratio is a better sensor to discriminate AD EEG from HC EEG. Moreover, the reliability and accuracy of results can be increased by combining spectral analysis and the dynamic box plot approach to theta/beta ratio with various window durations.

We studied healthy human participants during active spatial learning of room-scale virtual reality (VR) mazes. In the invisible maze task, participants wearing a wireless electroencephalography (EEG) headset were free to explore their surroundings, only given the objective to build and foster a mental spatial representation of their environment. Spatial uncertainty was resolved by touching otherwise invisible walls that were briefly rendered visible inside VR, similar to finding your way in the dark. We showcase the capabilities of mobile brain/body imaging using VR, demonstrating several analysis approaches based on general linear models (GLMs) to reveal behavior-dependent brain dynamics. Confirming spatial learning via drawn sketch maps, we employed motion capture to image spatial exploration behavior describing a shift from initial exploration to subsequent exploitation of the mental representation. Using independent component analysis, the current work specifically targeted oscillations in response to wall touches reflecting isolated spatial learning events arising in deep posterior EEG sources located in the retrosplenial complex. Single-trial regression identified significant modulation of alpha oscillations by the immediate, egocentric, exploration behavior. When encountering novel walls, as well as with increasing walking distance between subsequent touches when encountering novel walls, alpha power decreased. We conclude that these oscillations play a prominent role during egocentric evidencing of allocentric spatial hypotheses.

However, extracting EEG features which are consistent in indicating MWL across different tasks is still one of the critical challenges. This study attempts to compare the cross-task consistency in indexing MWL variations between two commonly used EEG-based MWL indicators, power spectral density (PSD) of ongoing EEG and task-irrelevant auditory ERPs (tir-aERPs). The verbal N-back and the multi-attribute task battery (MATB), both with two difficulty levels, were employed in the experiment, along with task-irrelevant auditory probes. EEG was recorded from 17 subjects when they were performing the tasks. The tir-aERPs elicited by the auditory probes and the relative PSDs of ongoing EEG between two consecutive auditory probes were extracted and statistically analyzed to reveal the effects of MWL and task type. Discriminant analysis and support vector machine were employed to examine the generalization of tir-aERP and PSD features in indexing MWL variations across different tasks. The results showed that the amplitudes of tir-aERP components, N1, early P3a, late P3a, and the reorienting negativity, significantly decreased with the increasing MWL in both N-back and MATB. Task type had no obvious influence on the amplitudes and topological layout of the MWL-sensitive tir-aERP features. The relative PSDs in theta, alpha, and low beta bands were also sensitive to MWL variations. However, the MWL-sensitive PSD features and their topological patterns were significantly affected by task type. The cross-task classification results based on tir-aERP features also significantly outperformed the PSD features. These results suggest that the tir-aERPs should be potentially more consistent MWL indicators across very different task types when compared to PSD. The current study may provide new insights to our understanding of the common and distinctive neuropsychological essences of MWL across different tasks.

Disruptions of cortico-kinematic interactions in Parkinson?s disease	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Parkinson's disease (PD); Cortico-kinematic interactions; Complexity; Electroencephalography (EEG); beta Oscillations	SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; REPETITIVE MOVEMENT; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; OSCILLATIONS; GAIT; DESYNCHRONIZATION; STIMULATION; MECHANISMS; FREQUENCY; IMAGERY	The cortical role of the motor symptoms reflected by kinematic characteristics in Parkinson's disease (PD) is poorly understood. In this study, we aim to explore how PD affects cortico-kinematic interactions. Electroencephalographic (EEG) and kinematic data were recorded from seven healthy participants and eight participants diagnosed with PD during a set of self-paced finger tapping tasks. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) was compared between groups in the alpha (8-14 Hz), low-beta (14-20 Hz), and high-beta (20-35 Hz) frequency bands to investigate between-group differences in the cortical activities associated with movement. Average kinematic peak amplitudes and latencies were extracted alongside Sample Entropy (SaEn), a measure of signal complexity, as variables for comparison between groups. These variables were further correlated with average EEG power in each frequency band to establish within-group interactions between cortical motor functions and kinematic motor output. High beta-band power correlated with mean kinematic peak latency and signal complexity in the healthy group, while no correlation was found in the PD group. Also, the healthy group demonstrated stronger ERD in the broad beta-band than the PD participants. Our results suggest that cortical beta-band power in healthy populations is graded to finger tapping latency and complexity of movement, but this relationship is impaired in PD. These insights could help further enhance our understanding of the role of cortical beta-band oscillations in healthy movement and the possible disruption of that relationship in PD. These outcomes can provide further directions for treatment and therapeutic applications and potentially establish cortical biomarkers of Parkinson's disease.	[McLinden, J.; Deligani, R.

The synchronization of EEG signals is not only the key to the exchange of information between different brain regions, but also reflects the neural activity of the brain, which in turn can infer people's cognitive activities. Therefore, studying the phase synchronization of EEG signals after stroke is of great significance for understanding the communication and neuroplasticity of neurons after brain injury. In this paper, the changes of EEG phase synchronization in bilateral, cyclical ankle movements alternately after stroke were studied by Hilbert transform. Ten stroke patients and six healthy adults participated in the test. The results showed that the inter-hemisphere phase synchronization index (inter-PSI) and the global PSI of patients were significantly lower than that of the healthy subjects during the task. The PSI between Cz and the affected sensory cortex associated with lower limb movements was also significantly lower than that in the control group. There was a significant negative correlation between National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and cortical synchronization. The above results indicated that PSI under ankle alternating movements may be used as a new biomarker to evaluate the recovery of patients' brain neurons.

In contrast to most existing multivariate time-frequency decomposition techniques, the proposed MICMD can efficiently extract time-varying signals by solving a multivariate linear system. In this paper, we first define a multivariate intrinsic chirp mode (MICM) by assuming the presence of a joint or common instantaneous frequency (IF) among all channels. Then the IFs and instantaneous amplitudes (IAs) are modeled as Fourier series. IFs can be estimated using the framework of the general parameterized time-frequency transform and then the corresponding MICMs are reconstructed by solving multivariate linear equations through an extended least square method. MICMD can characterize a set of multivariate modes without requiring more user-defined parameters than the original ICMD. Its properties and advantages, including mode-alignment, computational complexity, filter bank structure, quasi-orthogonality, channel number and noise robustness, are investigated successively. MICMD outperforms both multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) and multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) in extracting time-varying components. The computational complexity of the proposed MICMD is proven to be O(N), thus much faster than MNCMD, which is of O(N-3) complexity. In the end, we highlight the utility and superiority of MICMD in three real-world cases, including the periodicity analysis in meteorology (three-channel), the alpha-rhythm separation in electroencephalogram (EEG) (four-channel), and the plant-wide oscillation detection in industrial control system (eleven-channel).

These social changes require new smart healthcare services for use in daily life, and COVID-19 has also led to a contactless trend necessitating more non-face-to-face health services. Due to the improvements that have been achieved in healthcare technologies, an increasing number of studies have attempted to predict and analyze certain diseases in advance. Research on stroke diseases is actively underway, particularly with the aging population. Stroke, which is fatal to the elderly, is a disease that requires continuous medical observation and monitoring, as its recurrence rate and mortality rate are very high. Most studies examining stroke disease to date have used MRI or CT images for simple classification. This clinical approach (imaging) is expensive and time-consuming while requiring bulky equipment. Recently, there has been increasing interest in using non-invasive measurable EEGs to compensate for these shortcomings. However, the prediction algorithms and processing procedures are both time-consuming because the raw data needs to be separated before the specific attributes can be obtained. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new methodology that allows for the immediate application of deep learning models on raw EEG data without using the frequency properties of EEG. This proposed deep learning-based stroke disease prediction model was developed and trained with data collected from real-time EEG sensors. We implemented and compared different deep-learning models (LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-Bidirectional LSTM) that are specialized in time series data classification and prediction. The experimental results confirmed that the raw EEG data, when wielded by the CNN-bidirectional LSTM model, can predict stroke with 94.0% accuracy with low FPR (6.0%) and FNR (5.7%), thus showing high confidence in our system. These experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of non-invasive methods that can easily measure brain waves alone to predict and monitor stroke diseases in real time during daily life. These findings are expected to lead to significant improvements for early stroke detection with reduced cost and discomfort compared to other measuring techniques.

The goal of this study was to investigate the electrophysiological correlates of a single guided mindfulness meditation session in subjects with no previous meditation experience. Materials and methods We analyzed electroencephalogram (EEG) changes in signal power, hemispheric asymmetry, and information flow between EEG channels, in 16 healthy subjects who were new to meditation practice. Results Our results show that information flow decreases in the theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha ranges (8-13 Hz) during mindfulness meditation exercise as compared to control: a passive listening condition. These changes are accompanied by a general trend in the decrease of alpha power over the whole scalp. One possible interpretation of these results is that there is an increased level of alertness/vigilance associated with the meditation task rather than reaching the target state. Conclusions Our study expands on the existing body of knowledge concerning neural oscillations during breathing meditation practice by showing that in participants with no previous meditation training, EEG correlates are different from the electrophysiological signatures of mindfulness meditation found in studies of more advanced practitioners.

Although cTBS has been reported to modulate neural oscillations and functional connectivity, it is still unclear how cTBS affects brain dynamics that could be captured by the resting-sate EEG microstate sequences. This study aims to investigate how cTBS over the left motor cortex affects brain dynamics. We applied 40 s-long cTBS over the left motor cortex of 28 healthy participants. Before and in multi-sessions up to 90 min after cTBS, their performance in a Nine-Hole Peg Test (NHPT), that measures the hand dexterity, and resting state EEG were recorded. Resting-sate EEG data were clustered into four microstates (namely A, B, C, and D) using k-means clustering algorithms. cTBS-induced changes in NHPT performance, microstate dynamics and functional connectivity networks were comprehensively assessed. As compared with baseline, the completion time of NHPT became shorter immediately after cTBS, suggesting cTBS-induced motor function improvement. After cTBS, the topography of microstate B revealed a greater change compared with other three topographies. Importantly, cTBS-induced decrease in completion time of NHPT correlated with cTBS-induced decrease of the mean occurrence of microstate B. Functional connectivity analysis further revealed that cTBS led to an increase of the node efficiency at C4 electrode in microstate B. These results indicated the specific modulation of cTBS over the motor cortex on the dynamics of microstate B. This work provided the evidence of the association between B and motor function, and it also implies the modulation of cTBS over the motor network.

Kappa rhythm is a type of electroencephalogram alpha band activity with maximum potential between contralateral temporal electrodes We report a case of preceding kappa activity before exploding head syndrome attacks. Case report A 57-year-old woman complained of explosive sounds for 2 months; a loud sound would transpire every day before sleep onset. She was diagnosed with exploding head syndrome. During polysomnography and the multiple sleep latency test, the exploding head syndrome attacks occurred six times. A kappa wave with activity disappearing a few seconds before most exploding head syndrome attacks was observed. The alpha band power in T3-T4 derivation gradually waxed followed by termination around the attacks. Conclusion This case demonstrated that the dynamics of kappa activity precede exploding head syndrome attacks. Finding ways to modulate electroencephalogram oscillation could elucidate their causality and lead to therapeutic intervention.

Seizure and Interictal Electroencephalographic (EEG) Changes with Cannabinoid Concentrate Use	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CASE REPORTS			English	Article						Cannabis; Electroencephalography; Marijuana Use; Seizures	OSCILLATIONS	Objective: Unusual clinical course Background: The electroencephalographic (EEG) findings associated with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) use, particularly in concentrated form, are not well-described, despite the current widespread availability of these products. There is a lack of prior research describing the EEG findings in adolescent cannabis users, and the effects of THC on the seizure threshold have been variably reported. Case Report: A 17-year-old girl with no prior history of seizures or known seizure risk factors presented to an Emergency Department with acutely abnormal behavior in the setting of daily vaping of highly concentrated THC marijuana ("wax"). On admission, she had a witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Urine toxicology was positive for THC, and an extensive evaluation for other etiologies of her encephalopathy was unrevealing. Extended EEG on admission showed mild diffuse background slowing with occasional bifronto-centrally predominant sharp and spike wave discharges. Seven days later, without interim antiseizure medications, a repeat extended EEG showed resolution of the previously seen interictal findings. Conclusions: The clinical and EEG findings were temporally associated with the patient's use of concentrated THC and may represent a constellation of symptoms of a THC wax toxidrome. In this case, THC was associated with lowering the seizure threshold and triggering a provoked seizure in an adolescent with no prior evidence of seizure tendency. This case also suggests the possibility of THC concentrate itself generating epileptiform discharges, as has previously been described with synthetic cannabinoid use.

This paper investigates the feasibility of using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify and analyze electroencephalogram (EEG) data with their time-frequency representations and class activation mapping (CAM) to detect epilepsy disease. Several types of pre-trained CNNs are employed for a multi-class classification task (AlexNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50) and their results are compared. Also, a novel convolutional neural network architecture comprised of two horizontally concatenated GoogLeNets is proposed with two inputs scalograms and spectrogram of the eplictic EEG signal. Four segment lengths (4097, 2048, 1024, and 512 sampling points) with three time-frequency representations (shorttime Fourier, Wavelet, and Hilbert-Huang transform) are statistically evaluated. The dataset used in this research is collected at the University of Bonn. The dataset is reorganized as normal, interictal, and ictal. The maximum achieved accuracies for 4097, 2048, 1024, and 512 sampling points are 100 %, 100 %, 100 %, and 99.5 % respectively. The CAM method is used to analyze discriminative regions of time-frequency representations of EEG segments and networks' decisions. This method showed CNN models used different time and frequency regions of input images for each class with correct and incorrect predictions.

However, it remains unclear whether CMC modulation would depend on the contribution of neural mechanisms acting at the spinal level. To this purpose, modulations of CMC were compared during submaximal isometric, shortening and lengthening contractions of the soleus (SOL) and the medial gastrocnemius (MG) with a concurrent analysis of changes in spinal excitability that may be reduced during lengthening contractions. Submaximal contractions intensity was set at 50% of the maximal SOL EMG activity. CMC was computed in the time-frequency domain between the Cz EEG electrode signal and the unrectified SOL or MG EMG signal. Spinal excitability was quantified through normalized Hoffmann (H) reflex amplitude. The results indicate that beta-band CMC and normalized H-reflex were significantly lower in SOL during lengthening compared with isometric contractions, but were similar in MG for all three muscle contraction types. Collectively, these results highlight an effect of contraction type on beta-band CMC, although it may differ between agonist synergist muscles. These novel findings also provide new evidence that beta-band CMC modulation may involve spinal regulatory mechanisms.

In this study, 23 college students underwent three sessions of a Clock task test before a 30-day high-altitude exposure (Test 1) and 1 week (Test 2) and 3 months (Test 3) after they returned to lowlands. The Clock task consists of a visual spatial angle and a visual non-spatial color discrimination subtask. Simultaneously, electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during the Clock task. The behavioral results showed that, compared with Test 1, accuracy in Test 2 was significantly decreased in both the Angle and Color tasks, and reaction time (RT) was significantly increased in the Angle task. The event-related potentials results showed that, during both tasks amplitudes of the occipital N1 and P3 components during both tasks were significantly decreased in Test 2, compared with Test 1. Moreover, N1 amplitude was negatively correlated with RT and positively correlated with accuracy. Further time-frequency EEG analysis showed that theta power at occipital sites was significantly decreased in both tasks in Test 2, compared with Test 1, and was negatively correlated with RT in the Angle task. In Test 3, both the behavioral performance and EEG activity recovered to the baseline level in Test 1. These findings suggested that hypoxia impairs both visual spatial and visual non-spatial discriminations, and these impairments can recover after subjects return to lowlands. Inhibition of brain electrophysiological activity in the visual cortex may explain the deficits in visual cognition.

However, non-invasively modulating oscillatory activity remains technically challenging, due to limited strength, duration, or non-synchronization of stimulation waveforms with endogenous rhythms. Objective: We hypothesized that applying controllable phase-synchronized repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses (rTMS) with alternating currents (tACS) may induce and stabilize neurooscillatory resting-state activity at targeted frequencies. Methods: Using a novel circuit to precisely synchronize rTMS pulses with phase of tACS, we empirically tested whether combined, 10-Hz prefrontal bilateral stimulation could induce and stabilize 10-Hz oscillations in the bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). 25 healthy participants took part in a repeated measures design. Whole-brain resting-state EEG in eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) was recorded before (baseline), immediately (1-min), and 15-and 30-min after stimulation. Bilateral, phase synchronized rTMS aligned to the positive tACS peak was compared with rTMS at tACS trough, with bilateral tACS or rTMS on its own, and to sham. Results: 10-Hz resting-state PFC power increased significantly with peak-synchronized rTMS & thorn; tACS (EO: 44.64%, EC: 46.30%, p < 0.05) compared to each stimulation protocol on its own, and sham, with effects spanning between prefrontal and parietal regions and sustaining throughout 30-min. No effects were observed with the sham protocol. Moreover, rTMS timed to the negative tACS trough did not induce local or global changes in oscillations. Conclusion: Phase-synchronizing rTMS with tACS may be a viable approach for inducing and stabilizing neuro-oscillatory activity, particularly in scenarios where endogenous oscillatory tone is attenuated, such as disorders of consciousness or major depression.

Conversation partners often pause between conversational turns, and musical co-performers often pause between musical phrases. How do humans coordinate the duration of pauses to ensure seamless interaction? A total of 40 trained pianists performed a simple melody containing fermatas (notated expressive pauses of unspecified duration) first alone (Solo) and then with a partner (Duet) while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. As predicted, Duet partners' tone onset synchrony was reduced for tones following pauses. Pauses were shorter in Duet relative to Solo performance, and synchrony of partners' Duet tone onsets was enhanced for tones following shorter pauses. EEG analysis revealed classic signatures of action preparation during pauses, namely decreases in the power of cortical beta oscillations (13-30 Hz, event-related desynchronization ERD). Beta ERD did not differ between pauses in Solo and Duet performance, but was enhanced for shorter relative to longer pauses, suggesting that reduced pause durations in Duet performance facilitated a neural state of enhanced action readiness. Together these findings provide novel insight into behavioural strategies by which musical partners resolve coordination challenges posed by expressive silence, and capture a clear neural signature of action planning during time-varying silences in natural music performance.

Meanwhile, machine learning is a promising approach for trial-based EEG data analysis. This work presents a model that can distinguish between passive and active kinesthetic interactions based on a single trial EEG data. An interactive task that involves hitting a ball using a racket is developed under passive and active kinesthetic settings using a haptic device and a computer screen. Temporal and frequency domain features are extracted from the motor and somatosensory cortices, and a proposed 2-D CNN model is trained on data extracted from 19 participants. The model achieves a mean accuracy of 84.56%, 93.96%, and 95.89% across 5-fold validation when using one, four, or six electrodes, respectively. The model mechanism is assessed using an explainable machine learning algorithm, LIME, which shows that the model utilizes sensible features from a neuroscience perspective towards its prediction. This work paves the way for a better understanding of the neural mechanisms associated with kinesthetic haptic interaction, which proves helpful in many applications such as motor rehabilitation and brain-computer interactions, in addition to modeling the haptic quality of experience objectively.

Since these tasks often conflate cognitive control and cognitive effort, it remains unknown if FMT amplitude maps onto cognitive control or effort. To address this gap, we utilized the glucose facilitation effect to manipulate cognitive effort without changing cognitive control demands. We performed a single-blind, crossover human study in which we provided participants with a glucose drink (control session: volume-matched water) to reduce cognitive effort and improve performance on a visuospatial working memory task. Following glucose consumption, participants performed the working memory task at multiple time points of a 3-h window to sample across the rise and fall of blood glucose. Using high-density electroencephalography (EEG), we calculated FMT amplitude during the delay period of the working memory task. Source localization analysis revealed that FMT oscillations originated from bilateral prefrontal cortex. We found that glucose increased working memory accuracy during the high working memory load condition but decreased FMT amplitude. The decrease in FMT amplitude coincided with both peak blood glucose elevation and peak performance enhancement for glucose relative to water. Therefore, the positive association between glucose consumption and task performance provided causal evidence that the amplitude of FMT oscillations may correspond to cognitive effort, rather than cognitive control. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, data collection was terminated prematurely; the preliminary nature of these findings due to small sample size should be contextualized by rigorous experimental design and use of a novel causal perturbation to dissociate cognitive effort and cognitive control. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We investigated whether frontal-midline theta (FMT) oscillations tracked with cognitive control or cognitive effort by simultaneous manipulation of cognitive control demands in a working memory task and causal perturbation of cognitive effort using glucose consumption. Facilitation of performance from glucose consumption corresponded with decreased FMT amplitude, which provided preliminary causal evidence for a relationship between FMT amplitude with cognitive effort.

Machine learning combined with non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) has recently been shown to have the potential to diagnose MDD. However, most of these studies analyzed small samples of participants recruited from a single source, raising serious concerns about the generalizability of these results in clinical practice. Thus, it has become critical to re-evaluate the efficacy of various common EEG features for MDD detection across large and diverse datasets. To address this issue, we collected resting-state EEG data from 400 participants across four medical centers and tested classification performance of four common EEG features: band power (BP), coherence, Higuchi's fractal dimension, and Katz's fractal dimension. Then, a sequential backward selection (SBS) method was used to determine the optimal subset. To overcome the large data variability due to an increased data size and multi-site EEG recordings, we introduced the conformal kernel (CK) transformation to further improve the MDD as compared with the healthy control (HC) classification performance of support vector machine (SVM). The results show that (1) coherence features account for 98% of the optimal feature subset; (2) the CK-SVM outperforms other classifiers such as K-nearest neighbors (K-NN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and SVM; (3) the combination of the optimal feature subset and CK-SVM achieves a high five-fold cross-validation accuracy of 91.07% on the training set (140 MDD and 140 HC) and 84.16% on the independent test set (60 MDD and 60 HC). The current results suggest that the coherence-based connectivity is a more reliable feature for achieving high and generalizable MDD detection performance in real-life clinical practice.

Despite the long history of vection research, the neuro-cognitive processes underlying vection have only recently gained increasing attention. Various neuropsyYchological techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) have been used to investigate the temporal and spatial characteristics of the neuro-cognitive processing during vection in healthy participants. These neuropsychological studies allow for the identification of different neuro-cognitive correlates of vection, which (a) will help to unravel the neural basis of vection and (b) offer opportunities for applying vection as a tool in other research areas. The purpose of the current review is to evaluate these studies in order to show the advances in neuropsychological vection research and the challenges that lie ahead. The overview of the literature will also demonstrate the large methodological variability within this research domain, limiting the integration of results. Next, we will summarize methodological considerations and suggest helpful recommendations for future vection research, which may help to enhance the comparability across neuropsychological vection studies.

This study proposes a novel automated computerized framework for proficient identification of motor and mental imagery (MeI) EEG tasks by employing empirical Fourier decomposition (EFD) and improved EFD (IEFD) methods. Specifically, the multiscale principal component analysis (MSPCA) is rendered to denoise EEG data first, and then, EFD is utilized to decompose nonstationary EEG into subsequent modes, while the IEFD criterion is proposed for a single conspicuous mode selection. Finally, the time- and frequency-domain features are extracted and classified with a feedforward neural network (FFNN) classifier. Extensive experiments are conducted on four multichannel motor and MeI data sets from BCI competitions II and III using a tenfold cross-validation strategy. Results compared with the other existing methods demonstrated that the highest classification accuracies of 99.82% (data set IV-a), 93.33% (data set IV-b), 91.96% (data set III), and 88.08% (data set V) in subject-specific scenarios, while 82.70% (data set IV-a) in the subject-independent framework are achieved for IEFD with FFNN classifiers collectively. The overall exploratory results authenticate that the proposed IEFD-based automated computerized framework not only outperforms the conventional SD methods but is also robust and computationally efficient for the development of subject-dependent and subject-independent BCI systems.

One of the most popular approaches to BCI is motor imagery (MI). In BCI applications, the electroencephalography (EEG) is a very popular measurement for brain dynamics because of its noninvasive nature. Although there is a high interest in the BCI topic, the performance of existing systems is still far from ideal, due to the difficulty of performing pattern recognition tasks in EEG signals. This difficulty lies in the selection of the correct EEG channels, the signal-to-noise ratio of these signals, and how to discern the redundant information among them. BCI systems are composed of a wide range of components that perform signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and decision making. In this article, we define a new BCI framework, called enhanced fusion framework, where we propose three different ideas to improve the existing MI-based BCI frameworks. First, we include an additional preprocessing step of the signal: a differentiation of the EEG signal that makes it time invariant. Second, we add an additional frequency band as a feature for the system: the sensorimotor rhythm band, and we show its effect on the performance of the system. Finally, we make a profound study of how to make the final decision in the system. We propose the usage of both up to six types of different classifiers and a wide range of aggregation functions (including classical aggregations, Choquet and Sugeno integrals, and their extensions and overlap functions) to fuse the information given by the considered classifiers. We have tested this new system on a dataset of 20 volunteers performing MI-based brain-computer interface experiments. On this dataset, the new system achieved 88.80% accuracy. We also propose an optimized version of our system that is able to obtain up to 90.76%. Furthermore, we find that the pair Choquet/Sugeno integrals and overlap functions are the ones providing the best results.

One-third of stroke patients may suffer partial visual field loss in both eyes. The relationship between brain oscillation after a unilateral occipital stroke and visual field defect is worth investigating. Decoding resting-state Electroencephalography (EEG) to predict patients' visual field distribution could be an essential reference for a better understanding of the compensation of visual functions after a stroke. The result could be beneficial for clinical diagnostics and treatment. This paper proposed a frequency spectrum-based 2D convolutional neural network(CNN) and brain connectivity-based 3DCNN model to predict the visual field defect. The results show that the frequency spectrum-based 2DCNN achieved a higher accuracy on visual field location than the connectivity-based 3DCNN model.

Importantly, no investigations to date have directly explored the potential impact of NFB on the brain's key neuromodulatory systems. Our study's objective was to assess the capacity of NFB to induce dopamine release as revealed by positron emission tomography (PET). Thirty-two healthy volunteers were randomized to either EEG-neurofeedback (NFB) or EEG-electromyography (EMG), and scanned while performing self-regulation during a single session of dynamic PET brain imaging using the high affinity D-2/3 receptor radiotracer, [F-18]Fallypride. NFB and EMG groups down-regulated cortical alpha power and facial muscle tone, respectively. Task-induced effects on endogenous dopamine release were estimated in the frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus, using the linearized simplified reference region model (LSRRM), which accounts for time-dependent changes in radiotracer binding following task initiation. Contrary to our hypothesis of a differential effect for NFB vs. EMG training, significant dopamine release was observed in both training groups in the frontal and anterior cingulate cortex, but not in thalamus. Interestingly, a significant negative correlation was observed between dopamine release in frontal cortex and pre-to-post NFB change in spontaneous alpha power, suggesting that intra-individual changes in brain state (i.e., alpha power) could partly result from changes in neuromodulatory tone. Overall, our findings constitute the first direct investigation of neurofeedback's effect on the endogenous release of a key neuromodulator, demonstrating its feasibility and paving the way for future studies using this methodology.

Associations of socioeconomic and other environmental factors with early brain development in Bangladeshi infants and children	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Poverty; EEG; Development; Stress; Caregiving; Bangladesh; Low and middle income country	EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; EEG POWER; POVERTY; DEPRESSION; CORTISOL; BALANCE	Studies of infants growing up in high-income countries reveal developmental changes in electroencephalography (EEG) power whereby socioeconomic factors - specifically, low SES and low income - are associated with lower EEG power in infants aged newborn to nine months. In the current paper we explore relationships of spectral EEG power across three regions (frontal, central, and parietal) and four frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) with socioeconomic and psychosocial factors in a cohort of n = 160 6-month-old infants and n = 187 36month-old children living in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Household wealth is assessed as a multi-dimensional composite score encompassing income, assets, and housing materials. Psychosocial factors include maternal perceived stress and family caregiving activities. Among the 6-month-old infants we do not observe any association of household wealth or psychosocial factors with EEG power. Among the 36-month-old children, we find that household wealth is negatively associated absolute power in the beta and gamma bands across frontal, central, and parietal electrodes. We also find that higher reports of maternal perceived stress are associated with more absolute theta power in frontal and central regions in the 36-month-old children. The finding of a negative relationship of household wealth with beta and gamma power in 36-month-old children differs from findings previously observed in infants in high-income countries. Overall, findings suggest that children's environment continues to influence the development of EEG oscillations and provide support for the utility of EEG to quantify developmental effects of early life experiences on neural functional outcomes in low income countries.

To further mine the emotion-relevant information of EEG signals, a kind of innovative and effective feature named mean differential entropy (MDE) is proposed for EEG emotion recognition (EER). The MDE feature extracted from EEG signals supplements the additional potential information of each EEG frame on the basis of time-frequency information. To verify its effectiveness, extensive experiments are conducted on DEAP (database for emotion analysis using physiological signals) dataset. The experiment results of the proposed methods on public EEG emotion dataset DEAP reached accuracies of 94.56% and 91.84% in valence dimension and four emotion labels with gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and 95.15% in arousal dimension with Random Forest (RF), which proved that the MDE feature is helpful to improve the performance of EER.

Processing of temporally structured events in one sensory modality can guide both behavioral and neural processing of events in other sensory modalities, but whether this occurs remains unclear. Here, we used human electroencephalography (EEG) to test the cross modal influences of a continuous auditory frequency-modulated (FM) sound on visual perception and visual cortical activity. We report systematic fluctuations in perceptual discrimination of brief visual stimuli in line with the phase of the FM-sound. We further show that this rhythmic modulation in visual perception is related to an accompanying rhythmic modulation of neural activity recorded over visual areas. Importantly, in our task, perceptual and neural visual modulations occurred without any abrupt and salient onsets in the energy of the auditory stimulation and without any rhythmic structure in the visual stimulus. As such, the results provide a critical validation for the existence and functional role of cross-modal entrainment and demonstrates its utility for organizing the perception of multisensory stimulation in the natural environment.

Since each and every function is controlled by our brain, the study of EEG makes sense for the analysis of sleep issues. In sleep, everyone go past at max of six stages. Sleep stage classification (SSC) is the golden technique for evaluation of human sleep. The objective of this undertaking is to classify the sleep stages as a way to allow/help physicians to come across the sleep issues. We consider only the single EEG instead of multiple/multi-channel signals consider by the earlier works. Hence we name our method as single channel-SSC (SC-SSC). In this approach, we consider time domain as well as frequency domain features and the experimental machine learning classification - support vector machine (SVM) which results better performs to earlier methods. The proposed method of SC-SSC tested on sleep-EDF database and achieves an accuracy of 97.4%.

J	Aung, ST; Wongsawat, Y				Aung, Si Thu; Wongsawat, Yodchanan			Analysis of EEG Signals Contaminated With Motion Artifacts Using Multiscale Modified-Distribution Entropy	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Complexity; distribution entropy; EEG; motion artifact; multiscale entropy		The detection of motion artifacts in electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis is a high priority, especially for wearable, portable, or wireless EEG monitoring systems. Recently, many scholars have proposed numerous promising techniques to address this issue, e.g., blind source separation (BSS) and independent component analysis (ICA). However, real-time detection with low processing time and friendly use for embedded systems in wearable devices still needs more investigation. Therefore, in this paper, we considered an alternative method for approaching the motion artifact detection problem in EEG signals and proposed a new method called multiscale modified-distribution entropy (M-mDistEn). An efficient coarse-grained procedure was added into the modified-distribution entropy (mDistEn) to consider the various scales (frequencies) of the signals. The results showed that this method is suitable for distinguishing between noisy and normal portions of the signal with a maximum accuracy of approximately 93%. In addition, the M-mDistEn method led to p-values of less than 0.05, indicating statistically significant results of differentiating the motion artifact EEG signals from the clean EEG signals. By comparing the different multiscale entropies, our proposed multiscale entropy was more accurate and robust. Thus, the proposed M-mDistEn method is an effective and efficient entropy method for the analysis of EEG signals corrupted by motion artifacts.

Combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings (EEG-fMRI) can assess the interplay between complementary measures of brain activity and EEG changes to be localized to specific brain regions. We used a two-step approach, where we first examined changes related to a syndrome of mild cognitive impairment irrespective of pathology and then studied the specific impact of amyloid pathology. After detailed clinical and neuropsychological characterization as well as a positron emission tomography (PET) scans with the tracer 11-[C]-Pittsburgh Compound B to estimate cerebral amyloid deposition, 14 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (mean age 75.6 SD: 8.9) according to standard criteria and 21 cognitively healthy controls (HCS) (mean age 71.8 SD: 4.2) were assessed with EEG-fMRI. Thalamo-cortical alpha-fMRI signal coupling was only observed in HCS. Additional EEG-fMRI signal coupling differences between HCS and MCI were observed in parts of the default mode network, salience network, fronto-parietal network, and thalamus. Individuals with significant cerebral amyloid deposition (amyloid-positive MCI and HCS combined compared to amyloid-negative HCS) displayed abnormal EEG-fMRI signal coupling in visual, fronto-parietal regions but also in the parahippocampus, brain stem, and cerebellum. This finding was paralleled by stronger absolute fMRI signal in the parahippocampus and weaker absolute fMRI signal in the inferior frontal gyrus in amyloid-positive subjects. We conclude that the thalamocortical coupling in the alpha band in HCS more closely reflects previous findings observed in younger adults, while in MCI there is a clearly aberrant coupling in several networks dominated by an anticorrelation in the posterior cingulate cortex. While these findings may broadly indicate physiological changes in MCI, amyloid pathology was specifically associated with abnormal fMRI signal responses and disrupted coupling between brain oscillations and fMRI signal responses, which especially involve core regions of memory: the hippocampus, para-hippocampus, and lateral prefrontal cortex.

Time series analysis has been used here for the first time to study brain connectivity changes during motor activation in PD. Methods: A 64-channel EEG signal was registered during unilateral motor activation and resting-state in 6 non-demented PD patients before and after the administration of levodopa and in 6 matched healthy controls. Spectral entropy correlation, coherence, and interhemispheric divergence differences among PD patients and controls were analyzed under the assumption of stationarity of the time series. Results: During the motor activation test, PD patients showed an increased correlation coefficient (both hands p < 0.001) and a remarkable increase in coherence in all frequency range compared to the generalized reduction observed in controls (both hands p < 0.001). The Kullback--Leibler Divergence (KLD) of the Spectral Entropy between brain hemispheres was observed to increase in controls (right hand p = 0.01; left hand p = 0.015) and to decrease in PD patients (right hand p = 0.02; left hand p = 0.002) with motor activation. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the oscillatory activity of the different cortex areas within healthy brains is relatively independent of the rest. PD brains exhibit a stronger connectivity which grows during motor activation. The levodopa mitigates this anomalous performance.

Exploring the reliability and sensitivity of the EEG power spectrum as a biomarker	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Power spectrum; Spectral slope; Reliability; 1/f noise	HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; DIFFICULTY; THETA	Introduction: The slope of the electroencephalography (EEG) power spectrum (also referred to as 1/f noise) is an important consideration when calculating narrow-band power. However, psychophysiological data also suggest this slope is a meaningful signal itself, not merely background activity or noise. We present two different methods for quantifying the slope of the power spectrum and assess their reliability and sensitivity. Methods: We used data from N = 60 participants who had EEG collected during rest, a videogame task, and a second period of rest. At all phases of the experiment, we calculated the "spectral slope" (a regression-based method fit to all datapoints) and the "aperiodic slope" (estimated with the fitting oscillations with 1/f algorithm FOOOF). For both methods we assessed: their reliability, their sensitivity to the transition from rest to task, their sensitivity to changes during the videogame task itself, and the agreement between the two measures. Results: Across resting phases, both spectral and aperiodic slopes showed a high degree of reliability. Both methods also showed a steepening of the power spectrum on-task compared to rest. There was also a high degree of consistency between the two methods in their estimate of the underlying slope, but FOOOF explained more variance in the power spectra across regions and type of activity (rest versus task). Conclusion: The slope of the power spectrum is a highly reliable individual difference and sensitive to within-subject changes across two different methods of estimation. Moving forward, we generally recommend the use of the FOOOF algorithm for its ability to account for narrow-band signals, but these data show how regression-based approaches produce similar estimates of the spectral slope, which may be useful in some applications.

However, it is not only laborious, but also not very cost effective for medical experts to manually identify the features on EEG. Therefore, automatic seizure detection in accordance with the EEG recordings is significant for the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. Here, a new method for detecting seizures using tensor distance (TD) is proposed. First, the time-frequency characteristics of EEG signals are obtained by wavelet transformation, and the tensor representation of EEG signals is then obtained. Tucker decomposition is used to obtain the principal components of the EEG tensor. After, the distances between different categories of EEG tensors are calculated as the EEG features. Finally, the TD features are classified through the Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis (Bayesian LDA) classifier. The performance of this method is measured by the sensitivity, specificity, and recognition accuracy. Results indicate 95.12% sensitivity, 97.60% specificity, 97.60% recognition accuracy, and a false detection rate of 0.76 per hour in the invasive EEG dataset, which included 566.57h of EEG recording data from 21 patients. Taken together, the results show that TD has a good detection effect for seizure classification and that this method has high computational speed and great potential for real-time diagnosis.

However, it is laborious and time-consuming, therefore, computer assisted sleep staging is necessary. Most of the existing sleep staging researches using hand-engineered features rely on prior knowledges of sleep analysis, and usually single channel electroencephalogram (EEG) is used for sleep staging task. Prior knowledge is not always available, and single channel EEG signal cannot fully represent the patient's sleeping physiological states. To tackle the above two problems, we propose an automatic sleep staging network model based on data adaptation and multimodal feature fusion using EEG and electrooculogram (EOG) signals. 3D-CNN is used to extract the time-frequency features of EEG at different time scales, and LSTM is used to learn the frequency evolution of EOG. The nonlinear relationship between the High-layer features of EEG and EOG is fitted by deep probabilistic network. Experiments on SLEEP-EDF and a private dataset show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, the prediction result is in accordance with that from the expert diagnosis.

The hippocampus as the switchboard between perception and memory	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						memory; recall; intracranial EEG; hippocampus; gamma power	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; HIGH-FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; EPISODIC MEMORY; ASSOCIATIVE MEMORIES; PARIETAL CORTEX; SINGLE NEURONS; OSCILLATIONS; NETWORK; SYSTEMS; RECALL	Adaptive memory recall requires a rapid and flexible switch from external perceptual reminders to internal mnemonic representations. However, owing to the limited temporal or spatial resolution of brain imaging modalities used in isolation, the hippocampal-cortical dynamics supporting this process remain unknown. We thus employed an object-scene cued recall paradigm across two studies, including intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) and high-density scalp EEG. First, a sustained increase in hippocampal high gamma power (55 to 110 Hz) emerged 500 ms after cue onset and distinguished successful vs. unsuccessful recall. This increase in gamma power for successful recall was followed by a decrease in hippocampal alpha power (8 to 12 Hz). Intriguingly, the hippocampal gamma power increase marked the moment at which extrahippocampal activation patterns shifted from perceptual cue toward mnemonic target representations. In parallel, source-localized EEG alpha power revealed that the recall signal progresses from hippocampus to posterior parietal cortex and then to medial prefrontal cortex. Together, these results identify the hippocampus as the switchboard between perception and memory and elucidate the ensuing hippocampal-cortical dynamics supporting the recall process.

This proposed method is an advanced version of the existing Fourier decomposition method (FDM). The proposed method decomposes the non-stationary signal into a finite number of Fourier-Bessel intrinsic band functions (FBIBFs). The FBIBFs are the real parts of analytic FBIBFs (AFBIBFs) which are obtained from an analytic signal during frequency scanning (FS) operations. The Hilbert transform (HT) is used to generate an analytic signal from the Fourier-Bessel series (FBS) expansion of an arbitrary signal. In addition to FBDM, we have also proposed zero-phase filter-bank based FBDM in order to get fix number of FBIBFs in this work. The performance of the proposed FBDM has been evaluated with the help of Poverall measure and TFR analysis of synthesized signals. The experimental results and performance measures show that the proposed FBDM is more capable for analysis of non-stationary multi-component signals such as linear frequency modulated and nonlinear frequency modulated signals as compared to the existing methods. The developed FBDM has also been used for the classification of six different sleep stages using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier has been utilized for the classification of TFR images, which were obtained with the application of FBDM on a publicly available sleep EEG signals database. The developed classification system has achieved 91.90% classification accuracy for the classification of six different sleep stages using EEG signals.

CNN based classification of motor imaginary using variational mode decomposed EEG-spectrum image	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING LETTERS			English	Article							CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; BCI; DATASET	A novel approach of preprocessing EEG signals by generating spectrum image for effective Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based classification for Motor Imaginary (MI) recognition is proposed. The approach involves extracting the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) modes of EEG signals, from which the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of all the modes are arranged to form EEG spectrum images. The EEG spectrum images generated are provided as input image to CNN. The two generic CNN architectures for MI classification (EEGNet and DeepConvNet) and the architectures for pattern recognition (AlexNet and LeNet) are used in this study. Among the four architectures, EEGNet provides average accuracies of 91.37%, 94.41%, 85.67% and 90.21% for the four datasets used to validate the proposed approach. Consistently better results in comparison with results in recent literature demonstrate that the EEG spectrum image generation using VMD-STFT is a promising method for the time frequency analysis of EEG signals.

This study aimed to investigate qEEG of SSD patients compared with those of normal controls (NCs), and changes therein after treatment. Methods: SSD patients currently without treatment and age- and sex-matched NCs were recruited. Spectral analysis of 64-channel EEG recording was performed and somatization, anxiety, and depression were evaluated via self-rating scales at baseline. After six months of treatment as usual, SSD patients were longitudinally followed up for assessments. Results: At baseline, the SSD group (n = 44) had higher alpha (p = 0.047) and lower beta 2 (p = 0.027) and gamma power (p = 0.001) compared with NCs (n = 29). After 6-month treatment, SSD patients showed improvement in symptoms, as well as increased beta 1 (p = 0.032), beta 2 (p = 0.012), and gamma power (p = 0.009) compared with baseline. A significant correlation was observed between the change in somatization score and temporal gamma power (r = -0.424, p = 0.031), and between the change in anxiety score and beta 2 power in the frontal (r = -0.420, p = 0.033) and central (r = -0.484, p = 0.012) regions. Conclusions: EEG findings in this study may provide neurophysiological features of SSD. The alpha enhancement and reduced fast wave activity may reflect attentional dysfunction in patients with SSD. Decreased fast wave activity is reversible and may serve as a state marker of SSD.

J	Schaworonkow, N; Voytek, B				Schaworonkow, Natalie; Voytek, Bradley			Longitudinal changes in aperiodic and periodic activity in electrophysiological recordings in the first seven months of life	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; Infants; Aperiodic exponent; Neuronal oscillations	HEALTHY INFANTS; EEG; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; MATURATION; ALPHA; SYNCHRONIZATION; COMMUNICATION; MECHANISMS; PATTERNS	Neuronal oscillations emerge in early human development. These periodic oscillations are thought to rapidly change in infancy and stabilize during maturity. Given their numerous connections to physiological and cognitive processes, understanding the trajectory of oscillatory development is important for understanding healthy human brain development. This understanding is complicated by recent evidence that assessment of periodic neuronal oscillations is confounded by aperiodic neuronal activity, an inherent feature of electrophysiological recordings. Recent cross-sectional evidence shows that this aperiodic signal progressively shifts from childhood through early adulthood, and from early adulthood into later life. None of these studies, however, have been performed in infants, nor have they been examined longitudinally. Here, we analyzed longitudinal non-invasive EEG data from 22 typically developing infants, ranging between 38 and 203 days old. We show that the progressive flattening of the EEG power spectrum begins in very early development, continuing through the first months of life. These results highlight the importance of separating the periodic and aperiodic neuronal signals, because the aperiodic signal can bias measurement of neuronal oscillations. Given the infrequent, bursting nature of oscillations in infants, we recommend using quantitative time domain approaches that isolate bursts and uncover changes in waveform properties of oscillatory bursts.

Here, we aimed to review the studies that have investigated this phenomenon by means of neurophysiological techniques. Methods The MEDLINE, accessed by Pubmed and EMBASE electronic databases, was searched using the medical subject headings: "Rubber hand illusion" AND "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)" OR "Evoked potentials (EP)" OR "Event related potentials (ERP)" OR "Electroencephalography (EEG)". Results Transcranial magnetic stimulation studies revealed a significant excitability drop in primary motor cortex hand circuits accompanying the disembodiment of the real hand during the RHI experience and that the perceived ownership over the rubber hand is associated with normal parietal-motor communication. Moreover, TMS provided causal evidence that the extrastriate body area is involved in the RHI and subsequently in body representation, while neuromodulation of ventral premotor area and the inferior parietal lobe did not result in an enhancement of embodiment. EP and ERP studies suggest that pre-existing body representations may affect larger stages of tactile processing and support predictive coding models of the functional architecture of multisensory integration in bodily perceptual experience. High-frequency oscillations on EEG play a role in the integrative processing of stimuli across modalities, and EEG activity in gamma band activity in the parietal area reflects the visuotactile integration process. EEG studies also revealed that RHI is associated with the neural circuits underlying motor control and that premotor areas play a crucial role in mediating illusory body ownership. Conclusion Neurophysiological studies shed new light on our understanding of the different aspects that contribute to the formation of a coherent self-awareness in humans.

Moreover, brain networks are intrinsically multilayer since their attributes can vary across time, subjects, frequency, or other domains. Identifying the modular structure in multilayer brain networks represents a gateway toward a deeper understanding of neural processes underlying cognition. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, thanks to their high temporal resolution, can give rise to multilayer networks able to follow the dynamics of brain activity. Despite this potential, the community organization has not yet been thoroughly investigated in brain networks estimated from EEG. Furthermore, at the state of the art, there is still no agreement about which algorithm is the most suitable to detect communities in multilayer brain networks, and a way to test and compare them all under a variety of conditions is lacking. In this work, we perform a comprehensive analysis of three algorithms at the state of the art for multilayer community detection (namely, genLouvain, DynMoga, and FacetNet) as compared with an approach based on the application of a single-layer clustering algorithm to each slice of the multilayer network. We test their ability to identify both steady and dynamic modular structures. We statistically evaluate their performances by means of ad hoc benchmark graphs characterized by properties covering a broad range of conditions in terms of graph density, number of clusters, noise level, and number of layers. The results of this simulation study aim to provide guidelines about the choice of the more appropriate algorithm according to the different properties of the brain network under examination. Finally, as a proof of concept, we show an application of the algorithms to real functional brain networks derived from EEG signals collected at rest with closed and open eyes. The test on real data provided results in agreement with the conclusions of the simulation study and confirmed the feasibility of multilayer analysis of EEG-based brain networks in both steady and dynamic conditions.

We examined the effectiveness of home-based CES with novel, headphone-like, in-ear electrodes on anxiety-related symptoms and resting-state brain activity. Methods: This study spanned 3-weeks, with randomized, double blind, and active-controlled design. Nonclinical volunteers experiencing daily anxiety were randomly assigned to either the active or the sham groups. CES provides an alternating current (10 Hz frequency, 500 mu A intensity), connected to smartphone recording treatment logs. Participants treated themselves with 20 trials of CES at home. We evaluated the effectiveness using State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Wisconsin Card Sort Test (WCST), and resting-state electroencephalography (EEG). Results: The active group showed a significant improvement in state-anxiety compared to sham, while there was a statistical trend in the WCST-Category Completed (p =.061) and no change in depression. In EEG analysis, the active group showed significantly increased relative power for theta in the left frontal region compared with the sham, and this significantly correlated with the changes in state-anxiety. The active group exhibited significantly increased high-beta source activity in cuneus and middle occipital gyrus after intervention compared with the baseline. Limitations: This study had a relatively short treatment period and small sample size. Conclusions: Our findings provide the first electrophysiological evidence for CES for novel in-ear electrodes to improve anxiety. The modulatory effects of CES on resting-state oscillations of EEG imply that CES could beneficially affect functional brain activity.

Studies in the area have shown the usefulness of mindfulness meditation to increase psychological and physical well-being in general terms, but the neurophysiological mechanisms associated with these changes remain to be elucidated. In this review, information is collected from studies that have used neuroimaging and electroencephalography to assess them, with emphasis on those studies that allow discussing the proposal of mindfulness meditation as a stimulus that decreases the processing of self-referential tasks and favors states of cognitive tasks and sensory associative tasks, including interoception. These studies show structural and functional changes in sectors such as prefrontal cortex, insula, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, primary visual cortex and striatum, which are discussed in this article in the light of current knowledge.

Although different neuroimaging tools suggested the capability of NMES to regulate the excitability of sensorimotor cortex and corticospinal circuits, how the intensity and dose of NMES can neuromodulate the brain oscillatory activity measured with electroencephalography (EEG) is still unknown to date. We quantified the effect of NMES parameters on brain oscillatory activity of 12 healthy participants who underwent stimulation of wrist extensors during rest. Three different NMES intensities were included, two below and one above the individual motor threshold, fixing the stimulation frequency to 35 Hz and the pulse width to 300 mu s. Firstly, we efficiently removed stimulation artifacts from the EEG recordings. Secondly, we analyzed the effect of amplitude and dose on the sensorimotor oscillatory activity. On the one hand, we observed a significant NMES intensity-dependent modulation of brain activity, demonstrating the direct effect of afferent receptor recruitment. On the other hand, we described a significant NMES intensity-dependent dose-effect on sensorimotor activity modulation over time, with below-motor-threshold intensities causing cortical inhibition and above-motor-threshold intensities causing cortical facilitation. Our results highlight the relevance of intensity and dose of NMES, and show that these parameters can influence the recruitment of the sensorimotor pathways from the muscle to the brain, which should be carefully considered for the design of novel neuromodulation interventions based on NMES.

At the clinical level, one of the most common physiological alterations is the slowing of oscillatory brain activity, measurable by electroencephalography (EEG). Relative power (RP) at the conventional frequency bands (i.e., delta, theta, alpha, beta-1, and beta-2) can be considered as AD endophenotypes. Objective: The aim of this work is to analyze the association between sixteen genes previously related with AD: APOE, PICALM, CLU, BCHE, CETP, CR1, SLC6A3, GRIN2 beta, SORL1, TOMM40, GSK3 beta, UNC5C, OPRD1, NAV2, HOMER2, and IL1RAP, and the slowing of the brain activity, assessed by means of RP at the aforementioned frequency bands. Methods: An Iberian cohort of 45 elderly controls, 45 individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and 109 AD patients in the three stages of the disease was considered. Genomic information and brain activity of each subject were analyzed. Results: The slowing of brain activitywas observed in carriers of risk alleles in IL1RAP (rs10212109, rs9823517, rs4687150), UNC5C (rs17024131), and NAV2 (rs1425227, rs862785) genes, regardless of the disease status and situation towards the strongest risk factors: age, sex, and APOE epsilon 4 presence. Conclusion: Endophenotypes reduce the complexity of the general phenotype and genetic variants with a major effect on those specific traits may be then identified. The found associations in this work are novel and may contribute to the comprehension of AD pathogenesis, each with a different biological role, and influencing multiple factors involved in brain physiology.

Changes in the high-dimensional ERP signal throughout the duration of an experiment (longitudinally) is the main quantity of interest in learning paradigms, where they represent the learning dynamics. Typical analysis, which can be performed in the time or the frequency domain, average the ERP waveform across all trials, leading to the loss of the potentially valuable longitudinal information in the data. Longitudinal time-frequency transformation of ERP (LTFT-ERP) is proposed to retain information from both the time and frequency domains, offering distinct but complementary information on the underlying cognitive processes evoked, while still retaining the longitudinal dynamics in the ERP waveforms. LTFT-ERP begins by time-frequency transformations of the ERP data, collected across subjects, electrodes, conditions and trials throughout the duration of the experiment, followed by a data driven multidimensional principal components analysis (PCA) approach for dimension reduction. Following projection of the data onto leading directions of variation in the time and frequency domains, longitudinal learning dynamics are modeled within a mixed effects modeling framework. Applications to a learning paradigm in autism depict distinct learning patterns throughout the experiment among children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder and their typically developing peers. LTFT-ERP time-frequency joint transformations are shown to bring an additional level of specificity to interpretations of the longitudinal learning patterns related to underlying cognitive processes, which is lacking in single domain analysis (in the time or the frequency domain only). Simulation studies show the efficacy of the proposed methodology. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DelIrium VULnerability in GEriatrics (DIVULGE) study: a protocol for a prospective observational study of electroencephalogram associations with incident postoperative delirium	BMJ NEUROLOGY OPEN			English	Article						event-related potentials; cognitive electrophysiology; EEG; geriatrics; neurophysiology	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; HIGH-RISK; NETWORK; BRAIN; EEG; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; HYPOTHESIS	Introduction Delirium is a neurocognitive disorder common in older adults in acute care settings. Those who develop delirium are at an increased risk of dementia, cognitive decline and death. Electroencephalography (EEG) during delirium in older adults is characterised by slowing and reduced functional connectivity, but markers of vulnerability are poorly described. We aim to identify EEG spectral power and event-related potential (ERP) markers of incident delirium in older adults to understand neural mechanisms of delirium vulnerability. Characterising delirium vulnerability will provide substantial theoretical advances and outcomes have the potential to be translated into delirium risk assessment tools. Methods and analysis We will record EEG in 90 participants over 65 years of age prior to elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We will record 4-minutes of resting state (eyes open and eyes closed) and a 5-minute frequency auditory oddball paradigm. Outcome measures will include frequency band power, 1/f offset and slope, and ERP amplitude measures. Participants will undergo cognitive and EEG testing before their elective procedures and daily postoperative delirium assessments. Group allocation will be done retrospectively by linking preoperative EEG data according to postoperative delirium status (presence, severity, duration and subtype). Ethics and dissemination This study is approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Royal Adelaide Hospital, Central Adelaide Local Health Network and the University of South Australia Human Ethics Committee. Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal articles and presentations at national and international conferences.	[Boord, Monique S.; Coussens, Scott W.; Keage, Hannah A.

While measures of resting-state EEG oscillations and their network properties, derived from graph theory, have been shown to provide clinically useful information regarding diagnosis and recovery in patients with chronic disorders of consciousness, little is known about the value of these network measures when calculated from a standard clinical low-density EEG in the acute phase post-injury. To investigate this link, we first validated a set of measures of oscillatory network features between high-density and low-density resting-state EEG in healthy individuals, thus ensuring accurate estimation of underlying cortical function in clinical recordings from patients. Next, we investigated the relationship between these features and the clinical picture and outcome of a group of 18 patients in acute post-traumatic unresponsive states who were not following commands 2 days+ after sedation hold. While the complexity of the alpha network, as indexed by the standard deviation of the participation coefficients, was significantly related to the patients' clinical picture at the time of EEG, no network features were significantly related to outcome at 3 or 6 months post-injury. Rather, mean relative alpha power across all electrodes improved the accuracy of outcome prediction at 3 months relative to clinical features alone. These results highlight the link between the alpha rhythm and clinical signs of consciousness and suggest the potential for simple measures of resting-state EEG band power to provide a coarse snapshot of brain health for stratification of patients for rehabilitation, therapy and assessments of both covert and overt cognition.

The majority of previous reports of the brain correlates of this illusion are based on func-tional neuroimaging. Contrary to the electroencephalogram (EEG) however, such technologies are not suitable for bedside or ambulant use. While a handful of studies have shown EEG changes during FPS, it remains underin-vestigated whether these changes were due to the perceived illusion or the perceived vibration. Here, we aimed at disentangling the neural correlates of the illusory movement from those produced by the vibration sensation by comparing the neural responses to two vibration types, one that did and one that did not elicit an illusion. We recruited 40 nave participants, 20 for the EEG experiment and 20 for a supporting behavioral study, who received functional tendon co-vibration on the biceps and triceps tendon at their left elbow, pseudo-randomly switching between the illusion and non-illusion trials. Time-frequency decomposition uncovered a strong and lasting event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the mu and beta band in both conditions, suggesting a strong somatosensory response to the vibration. Additionally, the analysis of the evoked potentials revealed a significant difference between the two experimental conditions from 310 to 990ms post stimulus onset. Training classifiers on the frequency-based and voltage-based correlates of illusion perception yielded above chance accuracies for 17 and 13 out of the 20 subjects respectively. Our findings show that FPS-induced illusions produce EEG corre-lates that are distinct from a vibration-based control and which can be classified reliably in a large number of participants. These results encourage pursuing EEG-based detection of kinesthetic illusions as a tool for clinical use, e.g., to uncover aspects of cognitive perception in unresponsive patients.

Development and recovery time of mental fatigue and its impact on motor function	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Event related potentials; Frequency; Mental fatigue; motor function	EEG ALPHA; ATTENTION; INHIBITION; POTENTIALS; REFLECTS; ERP; OSCILLATIONS; COMPONENT; TASK; N2	Mental fatigue is commonplace but there is limited understanding of the neural underpinnings of its development, the time course of its recovery, and its impact on motor function. Hence, this study used neural (electroencephalography) and motor measures to investigate the development and recovery of mental fatigue. Twenty participants performed a 60-min N-back task, with neural activity compared within the task. Additionally, pretask neural and motor measures were compared to assessments beginning at 0, 30 and 60 min post-task. Alpha power increased during the task and was greater than baseline at 30 and 60 min post-task. Motor skills were impaired at similar to 10-17 min post-task but recovered at similar to 40-47 min. Using a unique combination of neural and motor measures, our results suggest that attentiveness and, possibly, selectiveness in inhibiting irrelevant information are impaired after an acute mentally-fatiguing task. Notably, recovery time differed for neural and motor measures.

Until recently, there has been little information about EEG data quality and safety when used with newer multi-band (MB) fMRI sequences. Here, we measure the relative heating of a MB protocol compared with a standard single-band (SB) protocol considered to be safe. We also evaluated EEG quality recorded concurrently with the MB protocol on humans. Materials and methods We compared radiofrequency (RF)-related heating at multiple electrodes and magnetic field magnitude, B1+RMS, of a MB fMRI sequence with whole-brain coverage (TR = 440 ms, MB factor = 4) against a previously recommended, safe SB sequence using a phantom outfitted with a 64-channel EEG cap. Next, 9 human subjects underwent eyes-closed resting state EEG-fMRI using the MB sequence. Additionally, in three of the subjects resting state EEG was recorded also during the SB sequence and in an fMRI-free condition to directly compare EEG data quality across scanning conditions. EEG data quality was assessed by the ability to remove gradient and cardioballistic artifacts along with a clean spectrogram. Results The heating induced by the MB sequence was lower than that of the SB sequence by a factor of 0.73 +/- 0.38. This is consistent with an expected heating ratio of 0.64, calculated from the square of the ratio of B1+RMS values of the sequences. In the resting state EEG data, gradient and cardioballistic artifacts were successfully removed using traditional template subtraction. All subjects showed an individual alpha peak in the spectrogram with a posterior topography characteristic of eyes-closed EEG. The success of artifact rejection for the MB sequence was comparable to that in traditional SB sequences. Conclusions Our study shows that B1+RMS is a useful indication of the relative heating of fMRI protocols. This observation indicates that simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings using this MB sequence can be safe in terms of RF-related heating, and that EEG data recorded using this sequence is of acceptable quality after traditional artifact removal techniques.

Understanding the neurophysiological difference between "voluntary stopping" and "involuntary stopping" caused by FOG is vital for the detection of and potential intervention for FOG in the daily lives of patients. This study characterised the electroencephalographic (EEG) signature associated with FOG in contrast to voluntary stopping. The protocol consisted of a timed up-and-go (TUG) task and an additional TUG task with a voluntary stopping component, where participants reacted to verbal "stop" and "walk" instructions by voluntarily stopping or walking. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analysis was performed to study the dynamics of the EEG spectra induced by different walking phases, including normal walking, voluntary stopping and episodes of involuntary stopping (FOG), as well as the transition windows between normal walking and voluntary stopping or FOG. These results demonstrate for the first time that the EEG signal during the transition from walking to voluntary stopping is distinguishable from that during the transition to involuntary stopping caused by FOG. The EEG signature of voluntary stopping exhibits a significantly decreased power spectrum compared with that of FOG episodes, with distinctly different patterns in the delta and low-beta power in the central area. These findings suggest the possibility of a practical EEG-based tool that can accurately predict FOG episodes, excluding the potential confounding of voluntary stopping.

However, low reliability and concentration difficulty for some patients during most MI-BCIs involving visual tasks affect the performance of MI-BCI. The integration of vibrotactile stimulation (VibraoStim) with MI-based BCI can solve those issues. Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore the different effects between eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) during VibroStim on the cerebral activity and network. We designed and conducted an experiment, in which VibroStim (75 Hz) was applied over the belly of the biceps muscle in the left arm for 15 healthy subjects during EC or EO. The resting-state and VibroStim brain activity with EC or EO were recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). The EEG analysis showed a significant increase in the delta and theta power at C4, and a significant decrease in the alpha power at C4 during EC VibroStim compared to the resting-state. No significant difference was identified in event-related desynchronization (ERD) following VibroStim during EC or EO. A significant increase in the global efficiency and a significant decrease in the characteristic path length during EC VibroStim were observed in the beta band, whereas no significant differ-ences were found during EO VibroStim. These findings indicate, VibroStim feedback, which is suitable for pa-tients with poor vision or those who have difficulty focusing on objects, may improve BCI decoding accuracy by increasing ERD lateralization whether subjects keep EO or EC.

Interestingly, previous studies reported that different electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of resting-state brain activity may correlate with working memory performance at different ages. Here, we recorded resting-state EEG activity and tested allocentric spatial working memory in healthy young (20-30 years) and older (65-75 years) adults. We adapted standard EEG methods to record brain activity in mobile participants in a non-shielded environment, in both eyes closed and eyes open conditions. Our study revealed some age-group differences in resting-state brain activity that were consistent with previous results obtained in different recording conditions. We confirmed that age-group differences in resting-state EEG activity depend on the recording conditions and the specific parameters considered. Nevertheless, lower theta-band and alpha-band frequencies and absolute powers, and higher beta-band and gamma-band relative powers were overall observed in healthy older adults, as compared to healthy young adults. In addition, using principal component and regression analyses, we found that the first extracted EEG component, which represented mainly theta, alpha and beta powers, correlated with spatial working memory performance in older adults, but not in young adults. These findings are consistent with the theory that the neurobiological bases of working memory performance may differ between young and older adults. However, individual measures of resting-state EEG activity could not be used as reliable biomarkers to predict individual allocentric spatial working memory performance in young or older adults.

Since brain functional organization in sleep shows different synchrony and network properties compared to wakefulness, we aimed to explore the effects of acute VNS on EEG-derived measures in the two different states of vigilance. EEG epochs were retrospectively analyzed from twenty-four VNS-treated epileptic patients (11 responders, 13 non-responders) in calm wakefulness and stage N2 sleep. Weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI) was computed as connectivity measure of synchronization, for VNS OFF and VNS ON conditions. Global efficiency (GE) was computed as a network measure of integration. Ratios OFF/ON were obtained as desynchronization/de-integration index. Values were compared between responders and non-responders, and between EEG states. ROC curve and area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis was performed for response classification. In responders, stronger VNS-induced theta desynchronization (p < 0.05) and decreased GE (p < 0.05) were found in sleep, but not in wakefulness. Theta sleep wPLI Ratio OFF/ON yielded an AUC of 0.825, and 79% accuracy as a response biomarker if a cut-off value is set at 1.05. Considering all patients, the VNS-induced GE decrease was significantly more important in sleep compared to awake EEG state (p < 0.01). In conclusion, stronger sleep EEG desynchronization in theta band distinguishes responders to VNS therapy from non-responders. VNS-induced reduction of network integration occurs significantly more in sleep than in wakefulness.

Despite the recent progress, exactly which aspects of neural activities are characterizing the decoding process is still unclear. Neural oscillations have been associated with playing a key functional role in neural information processing and thus might provide significant insight into the decoding process. Previous research has investigated a limited range of neural frequencies for decoding, usually the high-gamma oscillations (70 - 200 Hz) in electrocorticography (ECoG) and lower-frequency waves (1 - 70 Hz) in electroencephalography (EEG). Hence, the exact contribution of specific frequency bands is still unclear. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a non-invasive method for directly measuring underlying brain activity and has the temporal resolution needed to investigate the role of cortical oscillations in speech decoding, which we attempted in this study. We used three machine learning classifiers (linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) to classify different imagined and spoken phrases for finding the role of brainwaves in speech decoding. The experimental results showed a significant contribution of low-frequency Delta oscillations (0.1 - 4 Hz) in decoding and the best performance was achieved when all the brainwaves were combined.

However, some studies reported an increase or a decrease of the PSD, while others showed no effect. It has been suggested that these differences might partly be due to a variability of the physiological state of the brain between subjects. So, the aim of this study was to investigate the alpha band modulation, exploring the impact of the alpha band frequency ranges applied in the PSD analysis. Materials and Methods Twenty-one healthy volunteers took part to the study with a double-blind, randomized and counterbalanced crossover design, during which eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) resting-state EEG was recorded. The exposure system was a sham or a real GSM (global system for mobile) 900 MHz MP (pulse modulated at 217 Hz, mean power of 250 mW and 2 W peak, with a maximum specific absorption rate of 0.70 W/kg on 1 g tissue). The experimental protocol presented a baseline recording phase without MP exposure, an exposure phase during which the exposure system was placed against the left ear, and the post-exposure phase without MP. EEG data from baseline and exposure phases were analyzed and PSD was computed for the alpha band in the fixed range of 8-12 Hz and for the individual alpha band frequency range (IAF). Results Results showed a trend in decrease or increase of EEG power of both alpha oscillations during exposure in relation to EC and EO recording conditions, respectively, but not reaching statistical significance. Findings did not provide evidence for a different sensitivity to RF-EMF MP related to individual variability in the frequency of the alpha band. Conclusion In conclusion, these results did not show alpha band activity modulation during resting-state under RF-EMF. It might be argued the need of a delay after the exposure in order to appreciate an EEG spectral power modulation related to RF-EMF exposure.

However, the neurophysiologic mechanisms underlying its traditional form remain unclear. In this study, we recruited a large sample of monks (n = 73) who practice Tibetan Buddhist meditation and compared with meditation-naive local controls (n = 30). Their electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiogram signals were simultaneously recorded and blood samples were collected to investigate the integrative effects of Tibetan Buddhist on brain, heart, and proteomics. We found that the EEG activities in monks shifted to a higher frequency from resting to meditation. Meditation starts with decrease of the (pre)frontal delta activity and increase of the (pre)frontal high beta and gamma activity; while at the deep meditative state, the posterior high-frequency activity was also increased, and could be specified as a biomarker for the deep meditation. The state increase of posterior high-frequency EEG activity was significantly correlated with the trait effects on heart rate and nueropilin-1 in monks, with the source of brain-heart correlation mainly locating in the attention and emotion networks. Our study revealed that the effects of Tibetan Buddhist meditation on brain, heart, and proteomics were highly correlated, demonstrating meditation as an integrative body-mind training.

Here, we investigated the behavioral and neural correlates of MR and vsWM training combined with number line (NL) training. Fifty-seven children, aged 6-7, performed 25 days of NL training combined with either vsWM or MR and participated in an Electroencephalography (EEG)-session in school to measure resting state activity and steady-state visual evoked potentials during a vsWM task before and after training. Fifty children, aged 6-7, received usual teaching and acted as a control group. Compared to the control group, both training groups improved on a combined measure of mathematics. Cognitive improvement was specific to the training. Significant pre-post changes in resting state-EEG (rs-EEG), common to both training groups, were found for power as well as for coherence, with no significant differences in rs-EEG-changes between the vsWM and MR groups. Two of the common rs-EEG changes were correlated with mathematical improvement: (1) an increase in coherence between the central frontal lobe and the right parietal lobe in frequencies ranging from 16 to 25 Hz, and (2) an increase in coherence between the left frontal lobe and the right parietal lobe ranging from 23 to 25 Hz. These results indicate that changes in fronto-parietal coherence are related to an increase in mathematical performance, which thus might be a useful measure in further investigations of mathematical interventions in children.

In this study, the slope sign change (SSC) and mean power frequency (MPF) features of EEG and sEMG were used to recognize the seven gait phases [loading response (LR), mid-stance (MST), terminal stance (TST), pre-swing (PSW), initial swing (ISW), mid-swing (MSW), and terminal swing (TSW)]. Previous researchers have found that the cortex is involved in the regulation of treadmill walking. However, corticomuscular interaction analysis in a high level of gait phase granularity remains lacking in the time-frequency domain, and the feasibility of gait phase recognition based on EEG combined with sEMG is unknown. Therefore, the time-frequency cross mutual information (TFCMI) method was applied to research the theoretical basis of gait control in seven gait phases using beta-band EEG and sEMG data. We firstly found that the feature set comprising SSC of EEG as well as SSC and MPF of sEMG was robust for the recognition of seven gait phases under three different walking speeds. Secondly, the distribution of TFCMI values in eight topographies (eight muscles) was different at PSW and TSW phases. Thirdly, the differences of corticomuscular interaction between LR and MST and between TST and PSW of eight muscles were not significant. These insights enrich previous findings of the authors who have carried out gait phase recognition and provide a theoretical basis for gait recognition based on EEG and sEMG.

We hypothesized that DBS-related changes in cortical network organization are related to the clinical effect. Network analysis based on graph theory was used to evaluate the high-density electroencephalography (HDEEG) recorded during a visual three-stimuli paradigm in 32 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients treated by STN-DBS in stimulation "off" and "on" states. Preprocessed scalp data were reconstructed into the source space and correlated to the behavioral parameters. In the majority of patients (n = 26), STN-DBS did not lead to changes in global network organization in large-scale brain networks. In a subgroup of suboptimal responders (n = 6), identified according to reaction times (RT) and clinical parameters (lower Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS] score improvement after DBS and worse performance in memory tests), decreased global connectivity in the 1-8 Hz frequency range and regional node strength in frontal areas were detected. The important role of the supplementary motor area for the optimal DBS response was demonstrated by the increased node strength and eigenvector centrality in good responders. This response was missing in the suboptimal responders. Cortical topologic architecture is modified by the response to STN-DBS leading to a dysfunction of the large-scale networks in suboptimal responders.

There are various information sources that can be used for recognizing emotions, such as speech, facial expressions, body movements, and physiological signals. Among those physiological signals are more reliable for better affective communication with machines since they are almost impossible to control. Therefore, automatic emotion recognition from EEG signals has been a topic intensely investigated. Emotions are experiences that arise various cognitive functions observed in different frequency bands involving multiple brain areas and recognition from EEG with high accuracies is only possible with a large number of features extracted from the whole brain in various bands. Emotion regulation also requires integration of cognitive functions and thus functional connectivity between regions should also be considered. In this paper, we extract 736 features based on spectral power and phase-locking values. We particularly focus on finding salient features for emotion recognition using swarm-intelligence (SI) algorithms. We applied well-known classification algorithms for recognizing positive and negative emotions using the feature sets that are selected by these algorithms. Besides, features that are selected by all of them commonly are used as a new feature set. We report accuracies between 56.27% and 60.29% on the average; noting that by decreasing the feature size by 87.17% (from 736 to 94.40) an average accuracy of 60.01 +/- 8.93 was obtained with the random forest classifier. We also highlight the efficient electrode locations for emotion recognition. As a result, we define 11 channels as dominant and promising classification results are obtained.

Sex-Specific Brain Responses to Imaginary Dance but Not Physical Dance: An Electroencephalography Study of Functional Connectivity and Electrical Brain Activity	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; sex differences; dance; physical activity; coherence; power spectrum; connectivity	EEG COHERENCE; YOUNG-ADULTS; OSCILLATIONS; AMPLITUDE; EXERCISE; DISEASE; TRIAL; AGE	To date, most neurophysiological dance research has been conducted exclusively with female participants in observational studies (i.e., participants observe or imagine a dance choreography). In this regard, the sex-specific acute neurophysiological effect of physically executed dance can be considered a widely unexplored field of research. This study examines the acute impact of a modern jazz dance choreography on brain activity and functional connectivity using electroencephalography (EEG). In a within-subject design, 11 female and 11 male participants were examined under four test conditions: physically dancing the choreography with and without music and imagining the choreography with and without music. Prior to the EEG measurements, the participants acquired the choreography over 3 weeks with one session per week. Subsequently, the participants conducted all four test conditions in a randomized order on a single day, with the EEG measurements taken before and after each condition. Differences between the male and female participants were established in brain activity and functional connectivity analyses under the condition of imagined dance without music. No statistical differences between sexes were found in the other three conditions (physically executed dance with and without music as well as imagined dance with music). Physically dancing and music seem to have sex-independent effects on the human brain. However, thinking of dance without music seems to be rather sex-specific. The results point to a promising approach to decipher sex-specific differences in the use of dance or music. This approach could further be used to achieve a more group-specific or even more individualized and situationally adapted use of dance interventions, e.g., in the context of sports, physical education, or therapy. The extent to which the identified differences are due to culturally specific attitudes in the sex-specific contact with dance and music needs to be clarified in future research.

An advancement that is increasingly relevant in the BCI is communicating with a speech in mind. Thus, the paper aims to develop a direct speech BCI (DS-BCI) system using short time-based features and an ANN classifier. Signal processing methods like Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), Linear predictive cepstral coefficients (LPCC) and Sequency mapped real transform (SMRT) are utilized on a short time bases to extract base level features. Statistical parameters are then determined based on the ensemble average (EA) and time average (TA) to extract two reduced vectors in each method. Hybrid feature vectors like MLC, SMC and SLC are prepared by fusion of features from MFCC & LPCC, SMRT & MFCC and SMRT & LPCC, respectively, in both EA & TA analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) is performed on hybrid feature vectors to derive uncorrelated components. The proposed method is evaluated on imagined EEG (EEG-i) & vocalized EEG (EEG-v) signals from the 'Kara one' database and presented classification accuracy of individual methods & hybrid methods. The results show that hybrid features SMC & SLC enhance the classification accuracy compared to the unique features. PCA analysis helps improve accuracy and reduce feature dimension. TA-based SMC features with PCA provide maximum accuracy as 77.37% and 62.52% for EEG-i and EEG-v signals, respectively. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms discussed in the paper.	[Mini, P.

Participants passively listened to instrumental music of their preferred genre for 2 min (Argentine tango for dancers, classical, or jazz for non-dancers), alternate genres, and silence. Both groups showed increased activity for their preferred music compared to non-preferred music in the gamma, beta, and alpha frequency bands. The results suggest all participants' conscious recognition of and affective responses to their familiar music (gamma), appreciation of the tempo embedded in their preferred music and emotional arousal (beta), and enhanced attention mechanism for cognitive operations such as memory retrieval (alpha). The observed alpha activity is considered in the framework of the alpha functional inhibition hypothesis, in that years of experience listening to their favorite type of music may have honed the cerebral responses to achieve efficient cortical processes. Analyses of the electroencephalogram (EEG) activity over 100s-long music pieces revealed a difference between dancers and non-dancers in the magnitude of an initial alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) and the later development of an alpha event-related synchronization (ERS) for their preferred music. Dancers exhibited augmented alpha ERD, as well as augmented and uninterrupted alpha ERS over the remaining 80s. This augmentation in dancers is hypothesized to be derived from creative cognition or motor imagery operations developed through their dance experiences.

Steady state-evoked potentials of subjective beat perception in musical rhythms	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						beat perception; EEG; music; rhythm; steady state-evoked potentials	NEURONAL ENTRAINMENT; PULSE; METER; BETA; RESONANCE; RESPONSES; TEMPO; TIME; CUES	Synchronization of movement to music is a seemingly universal human capacity that depends on sustained beat perception. Previous research has suggested that listener's conscious perception of the musical structure (e.g., beat and meter) might be reflected in neural responses that follow the frequency of the beat. However, the extent to which these neural responses directly reflect concurrent, listener-reported perception of musical beat versus stimulus-driven activity is understudied. We investigated whether steady state-evoked potentials (SSEPs), measured using electroencephalography (EEG), reflect conscious perception of beat by holding the stimulus constant while contextually manipulating listeners' perception and measuring perceptual responses on every trial. Listeners with minimal music training heard a musical excerpt that strongly supported one of two beat patterns (context phase), followed by a rhythm consistent with either beat pattern (ambiguous phase). During the final phase, listeners indicated whether or not a superimposed drum matched the perceived beat (probe phase). Participants were more likely to indicate that the probe matched the music when that probe matched the original context, suggesting an ability to maintain the beat percept through the ambiguous phase. Likewise, we observed that the spectral amplitude during the ambiguous phase was higher at frequencies that matched the beat of the preceding context. Exploratory analyses investigated whether EEG amplitude at the beat-related SSEPs (steady state-evoked potentials) predicted performance on the beat induction task on a single-trial basis, but were inconclusive. Our findings substantiate the claim that auditory SSEPs reflect conscious perception of musical beat and not just stimulus features.

After acute catabolic states, patients usually develop striatal degeneration, but the mechanisms behind this damage are still unknown. Quinolinic acid (QA), a metabolite of the kynurenine pathway, increases especially during infections/inflammatory processes, and could act synergically with organic acids, contributing to the neurological features of GA-I. The aim of this study was to investigate whether QA increases seizure susceptibility and modifies brain oscillation patterns in an animal model of GA-I, the Gcdh(-/-) mice taking high-lysine diet (Gcdh(-/-)-Lys). Therefore, the characteristics of QA-induced seizures and changes in brain oscillatory patterns were evaluated by video-electroencephalography (EEG) analysis recorded in Gcdh(-/-)-Lys, Gcdh(+/+)-Lys, and Gcdh(-/-)-N (normal diet) animals. We found that the number of seizures per animal was similar for all groups receiving QA, Gcdh(-/-)-Lys-QA, Gcdh(+/+)-Lys-QA, and Gcdh(-/-)-N-QA. However, severe seizures were observed in the majority of Gcdh(-/-)-Lys-QA mice (82%), and only in 25% of Gcdh(+/+)-Lys-QA and 44% of Gcdh(-/-)-N-QA mice. All Gcdh(-/-)-Lys animals developed spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS), but Gcdh(-/-)-Lys-QA animals had increased number of SRS, higher mortality rate, and significant predominance of lower frequency oscillations on EEG. Our results suggest that QA plays an important role in the neurological features of GA-I, as Gcdh(-/-)-Lys mice exhibit increased susceptibility to intrastriatal QA-induced seizures and long-term changes in brain oscillations.

The goal of this study was to investigate the development of theta (4-8 Hertz) and alpha (8-12 Hertz) oscillations from early childhood to adulthood (years 3-24), as these oscillations play a fundamental role in cognitive function. We analyzed eyes-open, resting-state EEG data from 96 participants to estimate genuine oscillations separately from the aperiodic (1/f) signal. We examined age-related differences in the aperiodic signal (slope and offset), as well as the peak frequency and power of the dominant posterior oscillation. For the aperiodic signal, we found that both the aperiodic slope and offset decreased with age. For the dominant oscillation, we found that peak frequency, but not power, increased with age. Critically, early childhood (ages 3-7) was characterized by a dominance of theta oscillations in posterior electrodes, whereas peak frequency of the dominant oscillation in the alpha range increased between ages 7 and 24. Furthermore, theta oscillations displayed a topographical transition from dominance in posterior electrodes in early childhood to anterior electrodes in adulthood. Our results provide a quantitative description of the development of theta and alpha oscillations.

A major difficulty with interpreting iEEG results at the group level is inconsistent placement of electrodes between subjects making it difficult to select contacts that correspond to the same functional areas. Recent work using time delay embedded hidden Markov model (HMM) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) resting data revealed a distinct set of brain states with each state engaging a specific set of cortical regions. Here we use a rare group dataset with simultaneously acquired resting iEEG and MEG to test whether there is correspondence between HMM states and iEEG power changes that would allow classifying iEEG contacts into functional clusters. Methods: Simultaneous MEG-iEEG recordings were performed at rest on 11 patients with epilepsy whose intracranial electrodes were implanted for pre-surgical evaluation. Pre-processed MEG sensor data was projected to source space. Time delay embedded HMM was then applied to MEG time series. At the same time, iEEG time series were analyzed with time-frequency decomposition to obtain spectral power changes with time. To relate MEG and iEEG results, correlations were computed between HMM probability time courses of state activation and iEEG power time course from the mid contact pair for each electrode in equally spaced frequency bins and presented as correlation spectra for the respective states and iEEG channels. Association of iEEG electrodes with HMM states based on significant correlations was compared to that based on the distance to peaks in subject-specific state topographies. Results: Five HMM states were inferred from MEG. Two of them corresponded to the left and the right temporal activations and had a spectral signature primarily in the theta/alpha frequency band. All the electrodes had significant correlations with at least one of the states (p < 0.05 uncorrected) and for 27/50 electrodes these survived within-subject FDR correction (q < 0.05). These correlations peaked in the theta/alpha band. There was a highly significant dependence between the association of states and electrodes based on functional correlations and that based on spatial proximity (p = 5.6e(-6), chi(2) test for independence). Despite the potentially atypical functional anatomy and physiological abnormalities related to epilepsy, HMM model estimated from the patient group was very similar to that estimated from healthy subjects. Conclusion: Epilepsy does not preclude HMM analysis of interictal data. The resulting group functional states are highly similar to those reported for healthy controls. Power changes recorded with iEEG correlate with HMM state time courses in the alpha-theta band and the presence of this correlation can be related to the spatial location of electrode contacts close to the individual peaks of the corresponding state topographies. Thus, the hypothesized relation between iEEG contacts and HMM states exists and HMM could be further explored as a method for identifying comparable iEEG channels across subjects for the purposes of group analysis.

Dev Synaptopathies Consortium	Shifted phase of EEG cross-frequency coupling in individuals with Phelan-McDermid syndrome	MOLECULAR AUTISM			English	Article						Phelan-McDermid syndrome; EEG; Power; Cross-frequency coupling; Phase bias	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; AUTISM; SHANK3; SPECTRUM; ALPHA; ABNORMALITIES; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; PHENOTYPES; EPILEPSY	Background Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMS) is a rare condition caused by deletion or mutation of the SHANK3 gene. Individuals with PMS frequently present with intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and other neurodevelopmental challenges. Electroencephalography (EEG) can provide a window into network-level function in PMS. Methods Here, we analyze EEG data collected across multiple sites in individuals with PMS (n = 26) and typically developing individuals (n = 15). We quantify oscillatory power, alpha-gamma phase-amplitude coupling strength, and phase bias, a measure of the phase of cross frequency coupling thought to reflect the balance of feedforward (bottom-up) and feedback (top-down) activity. Results We find individuals with PMS display increased alpha-gamma phase bias (U = 3.841, p < 0.0005), predominantly over posterior electrodes. Most individuals with PMS demonstrate positive overall phase bias while most typically developing individuals demonstrate negative overall phase bias. Among individuals with PMS, strength of alpha-gamma phase-amplitude coupling was associated with Sameness, Ritualistic, and Compulsive behaviors as measured by the Repetitive Behavior Scales-Revised (Beta = 0.545, p = 0.011). Conclusions Increased phase bias suggests potential circuit-level mechanisms underlying phenotype in PMS, offering opportunities for back-translation of findings into animal models and targeting in clinical trials.

This research used questionnaire and physiological approaches in determine stress. EEG signal is an electrophysiological signal to analyze the signal features. The standard features used are peak-to-peak values, mean, standard deviation and root means square (RMS). The unique features in this research are Matthew Correlation Coefficient Advanced (MCCA) and multimodal capabilities in the area of frequency and time-frequency analysis are proposed. In the frequency domain, Power Spectral Density (PSD) techniques were applied while Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) were utilized to extract seven features based on time-frequency domain. Various methods applied from previous works are still limited by the stress indices. The merged works between quantities score and physiological measurements were enhanced the stress level from three-levels to six stress levels based on music application will be the second contribution. To validate the proposed method and enhance performance between electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and stress score, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier is needed. From the finding, RF gained the best performance average accuracy 85% +/- 10% in Ten-fold and K-fold techniques compared with SVM and KNN.

A total of 58 participants aged 65 or older (29 men and 29 women; average age, 74.0 +/- 4.7) whose cognitive function was within the normal range were included in this study. Participants performed four horticultural and four nonhorticultural activities for 2 min, respectively. The study had a cross-over experimental design. Electroencephalography was performed during all the activities. Subjective evaluation of emotions was performed using the Profile of Mood States immediately after each activity. The collected statistical data were analyzed using Duncan's test as a post-analysis of variance test to verify the differences in the results of electroencephalography and the Profile of Mood States according to the different activities. In the results of the electroencephalography, the relative beta, gamma, low-beta, and ratio of sensorimotor rhythm to theta indices indicate that the degree of brain activity in the prefrontal lobe was high during activities such as washing leaves, transplanting plants, and reading news. The results of the Profile of Mood States showed that during activities such as arranging flowers, transplanting, and washing leaves, the total mood disorder score was lowered, indicating a positive effect on the mood of the participants. This study shows that activities such as washing leaves, transplanting, and reading news have a positive effect on the cognitive function of elderly people by increasing brain activity.

Automatic detection of epileptic seizure events using the time-frequency features and machine learning	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Epileptic seizure detection; Time-frequency feature extraction; Empirical wavelet transform; Discrete wavelet transform; Machine learning	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM; EEG RECORDS; CLASSIFICATION	Computer-aided seizure detection from the long-term EEG has shown great potential in improving the epilepsy diagnosis accuracy and efficiency. This study was aimed to utilize prior knowledge about the epileptic EEG signals in choosing the algorithms and parameters in order to improve the performance and robustness for seizure detection. Our choices included the kurtosis-based channel selection, five-level empirical wavelet transform (EWT) for EEG signal decomposition adaptive to the power spectra of individual channels, the direct use of the instantaneous time-frequency features, and post-processing of classification outcomes. Using the publicly available CHB-MIT epileptic EEG database, we tested our algorithm against the high performance ones published in the recent literature and the high potential alternatives. Our algorithm achieved the mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 99.77%, 99.88%, and 99.88%, respectively, surpassing the best results in the literature in terms of mean performance. More importantly, the performance was highly consistent across all the tested patient cases. Statistical analysis showed that the levels of EWT and the direct use of time-frequency features had the greatest impacts on the final seizure detection performance. In addition, our results showed that k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) outperformed random forest (RF) classifier, contrary to the finding the RF being the best for seizure detection task in the literature. Our findings demonstrate the value of prior-knowledge-based feature extraction and suggest the equal importance of feature extraction and classifier in the seizure detection algorithm.

However, the spatiotemporal EEG pattern of the wake-sleep transition has never been described in the elderly. The present study aimed to assess the topographical and temporal features of the EEG during the sleep onset (SO) in a group of 36 older participants (59-81 years). The topography of the 1 Hz bins' EEG power and the time course of the EEG frequency bands were assessed. Moreover, we compared the delta activity and delta/beta ratio between the older participants and a group of young adults. The results point to several peculiarities in the elderly: (a) the generalized post-SO power increase in the slowest frequencies did not include the 7 Hz bin; (b) the alpha power revealed a frequency-specific pattern of post-SO modifications; (c) the sigma activity exhibited only a slight post-SO increase, and its highest bins showed a frontotemporal power decrease. Older adults showed a generalized reduction of delta power and delta/beta ratio in both pre- and post-SO intervals compared to young adults. From a clinical standpoint, the regional EEG activity may represent a target for brain stimulation techniques to reduce SO latency and sleep fragmentation.</p>	[Gorgoni, Maurizio; Scarpelli, Serena; Alfonsi, Valentina; De Gennaro, Luigi] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Psychol, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Annarumma, Ludovica; De Gennaro, Luigi] IRCCS Fdn Santa Lucia, Body & Act Lab, I-00179 Rome, Italy; [D'Atri, Aurora; Ferrara, Michele] Univ LAquila, Dept Biotechnol & Appl Clin Sci, I-67100 Laquila, Italy		Gorgoni, M (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Psychol, I-00185 Rome, Italy.	maurizio.gorgoni@uniroma1.it; serena.scarpelli@uniroma1.it; ludovica.annarumma@uniroma1.it; aurora.datri@univaq.it; valentina.alfonsi@uniroma1.it; michele.ferrara@univaq.it; luigi.degennaro@uniroma1.it	D'Atri, Aurora/K-6424-2016; Scarpelli, Serena/I-9988-2018; De Gennaro, Luigi/L-8711-2015; Ferrara, Michele/AAB-7574-2022; Gorgoni, Maurizio/K-5394-2016	D'Atri, Aurora/0000-0003-3650-0683; Scarpelli, Serena/0000-0002-9260-7111; De Gennaro, Luigi/0000-0003-3613-6631; Ferrara, Michele/0000-0003-2304-7576; Gorgoni, Maurizio/0000-0002-5544-5483; Alfonsi, Valentina/0000-0002-9929-0399	'Sapienza' University of Rome, "Progetti di Ricerca Medi di Ateneo 2020" [RM120172A2809FFB]; Italian Ministry of Health [RF-2018-12365682]	'Sapienza' University of Rome, "Progetti di Ricerca Medi di Ateneo 2020"; Italian Ministry of Health(Ministry of Health, Italy)	This research was supported by a grant from 'Sapienza' University of Rome, "Progetti di Ricerca Medi di Ateneo 2020" (grant number: RM120172A2809FFB).

EEG Phase Amplitude Coupling Strength and Phase Preference: Association with Age over the First Three Years After Birth	ENEURO			English	Article							GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; TOOLBOX; POWER	Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), the coupling of the phase of slower electrophysiological oscillations with the amplitude of faster oscillations, is thought to facilitate dynamic integration of neural activity in the brain. Though the brain undergoes dramatic change and development during the first few years of life, how PAC changes through this developmental period has not been extensively studied. Here, we examined PAC through electroencephalography (EEG) data collected during an awake, eyes-open EEG collection paradigm in 98 children between the ages of 3 months and 3 years. We employed non-parametric clustering methods to identify areas of significant PAC across a range of frequency pairs and electrode locations, and examined how PAC strength and phase preference develops in these areas. We found that PAC, primarily between the alpha-beta and gamma frequencies, was positively correlated with age from early infancy to early childhood (p = 2.035 x 10(-6)). Additionally, we found gamma over anterior electrodes coupled with the rising phase of the alpha-beta waveform, while gamma over posterior electrodes coupled with the falling phase of the alpha-beta waveform; this regionalized phase preference became more prominent with age. This opposing trend may reflect each region's specialization towards feedback or feedforward processing, respectively, suggesting opportunities for back translation in future studies. Significance Statement The brain undergoes significant development during infancy and early childhood, enabling the emergence of higher-level cognition. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is thought to support the integration of information within the brain. Our data suggest PAC increases from 3 months to 3 years of age. We additionally report the anterior and posterior electrodes show opposing forms of PAC; this regional phase preference also increases with age of EEG collection. These findings help set the stage for future analyses of PAC in young children with neurodevelopmental disorders, in which development of biomarkers during early life is a burgeoning field and measures of cross-frequency coupling may offer new promise.

Efforts have included exploration of resting state encephalography (EEG), which has a variety of relevant neurodevelopmental correlates and can be collected with minimal burden. However, EEG biomarkers may not be equally valid across the autism spectrum, as ASD is strikingly heterogeneous and individual differences may moderate EEG-behavior associations. Biological sex is a particularly important potential moderator, as females with ASD appear to differ from males with ASD in important ways that may influence biomarker accuracy. Methods We examined effects of biological sex, age, and ASD diagnosis on resting state EEG among a large, sex-balanced sample of youth with (N = 142, 43% female) and without (N = 138, 49% female) ASD collected across four research sites. Absolute power was extracted across five frequency bands and nine brain regions, and effects of sex, age, and diagnosis were analyzed using mixed-effects linear regression models. Exploratory partial correlations were computed to examine EEG-behavior associations in ASD, with emphasis on possible sex differences in associations. Results Decreased EEG power across multiple frequencies was associated with female sex and older age. Youth with ASD displayed decreased alpha power relative to peers without ASD, suggesting increased neural activation during rest. Associations between EEG and behavior varied by sex. Whereas power across various frequencies correlated with social skills, nonverbal IQ, and repetitive behavior for males with ASD, no such associations were observed for females with ASD. Conclusions Research using EEG as a possible ASD biomarker must consider individual differences among participants, as these features influence baseline EEG measures and moderate associations between EEG and important behavioral outcomes. Failure to consider factors such as biological sex in such research risks defining biomarkers that misrepresent females with ASD, hindering understanding of the neurobiology, development, and intervention response of this important population.

Behavioural and neurophysiological differences in working memory function of depressed patients and healthy controls	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Depression; Working memory; Electroencephalography; Event-related potentials; Frontal theta	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; N-BACK; PSYCHOMOTOR RETARDATION; MAJOR DEPRESSION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; UNIPOLAR DEPRESSION; THETA OSCILLATIONS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; GENDER-DIFFERENCES; SIMULTANEOUS EEG	Objective: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with deficits in working memory. Several cognitive subprocesses interact to produce working memory, including attention, encoding, maintenance and manipulation. We sought to clarify the contribution of functional deficits in these subprocesses in MDD by varying cognitive load during a working memory task. Methods: 41 depressed participants and 41 age and gender-matched healthy controls performed the n-back working memory task at three levels of difficulty (0-, 1-, and 2-back) in a pregistered study. We assessed response times, accuracy, and event-related electroencephalography (EEG), including P2 and P3 amplitudes, and frontal theta power (4-8 Hz). Results: MDD participants had prolonged response times and more positive frontal P3 amplitudes (i.e., Fz) relative to controls, mainly in the most difficult 2-back condition. Working memory accuracy, P2 amplitudes and frontal theta event-related synchronisation did not differ between groups at any level of task difficulty. Conclusions: Depression is associated with generalized psychomotor slowing of working memory processes, and may involve compensatory hyperactivity in frontal and parietal regions. Significance: These findings provide insights into MDD working memory deficits, indicating that depressed individuals dedicate greater levels of cortical processing and cognitive resources to achieve comparable working memory performance to controls.

Spike-timing-dependent plasticity can account for connectivity aftereffects of dual-site transcranial alternating current stimulation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Transcranial alternating current stimulation; Spike-timing-dependent plasticity; Electroencephalogram; Functional connectivity; Entrainment		Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), applied to two brain sites with different phase lags, has been shown to modulate stimulation-outlasting functional EEG connectivity between the targeted regions. Given the lack of knowledge on mechanisms of tACS aftereffects, it is difficult to further enhance effect sizes and reduce variability in experiments. In this computational study, we tested if spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) can explain stimulation-outlasting connectivity modulation by dual-site tACS and explored the effects of tACS parameter choices. Two populations of spiking neurons were coupled with synapses subject to STDP, and results were validated via a re-analysis of EEG data. Our simulations showed stimulation-outlasting connectivity changes between in-and anti-phase tACS, dependent on both tACS frequency and synaptic conduction delays. Importantly, both a simple network entraining to a wide range of tACS frequencies as well as a more realistic network that spontaneously oscillated at alpha frequency predicted that the largest effects would occur for short conduction delays between the stimulated regions. This finding agreed with experimental EEG connectivity modulation by 10 Hz tACS, showing a clear negative correlation of tACS effects with estimated conduction delays between regions. In conclusion, STDP can explain connectivity aftereffects of dual-site tACS. However, not all combinations of tACS frequency and application sites are expected to effectively modulate connectivity via STDP. We therefore suggest using appropriate computational models and/or EEG analysis for planning and interpretation of dual-site tACS studies relying on aftereffects.

PACt-MD Study Grp	Assessing the Longitudinal Relationship between Theta-Gamma Coupling and Working Memory Performance in Older Adults	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						cross-frequency coupling; electroencephalography; event-related desynchronization; event-related synchronization; N-back task	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG-ALPHA; FUNCTIONAL-ROLE; FRONTAL-THETA; OSCILLATIONS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; RESPONSES; SCALE; POWER; TASK	Theta-gamma coupling (TGC) is a neurophysiologic mechanism that supports working memory (WM). TGC is associated with N-back performance, a WM task. Similar to TGC, theta and alpha event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) are also associated with WM. Few studies have examined the longitudinal relationship between WM performance and TGC, ERS, or ERD. This study aimed to determine if changes in WM performance are associated with changes in TGC (primary aim), as well as theta and alpha ERS or ERD over 6 to 12 weeks. Participants included 62 individuals aged 60 and older with no neuropsychiatric conditions or with remitted Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and no cognitive disorders. TGC, ERS, and ERD were assessed using electroencephalography (EEG) during the N-back task (3-back condition). There was an association between changes in 3-back performance and changes in TGC, alpha ERD and ERS, and theta ERS in the control group. In contrast, there was only a significant association between changes in 3-back performance and changes in TGC in the subgroup with remitted MDD. Our results suggest that the relationship between WM performance and TGC is stable over time, while this is not the case for changes in theta and alpha ERS and ERD.

It is key to understand the link between human brain and behavior, especially for brain computer interface (BCI) applications and rehabilitation of patients suffering with neurological disorders. In this research, we conducted an experiment comparing two stages of visual processing, determined distinct EEG signals associated with them, and subsequently used a classifier to distinguish the two stages. EEG data was collected using a feature-binding experiment that required subjects to detect changes in color and shape binding after 100 ms and after 1500 ms. The two stages denoted by these study-test intervals were determined using features extracted from both time and frequency domains. These were used to separately train various machine learning classifiers. The time-frequency domain representation of the signal was used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN). Promising results were obtained. Thus, the contribution of the paper is two-fold. Firstly, we carry out EEG data analysis using deep learning to classify whether the EEG trial belongs to 100 ms class or 1500 ms class. Secondly, we connect these results to predict different stages of visual processing in human brain and visual feature binding. Thus, deep learning can help us predict the stages of visual processing and, hence, unlock important insights regarding the temporal dynamics of brain functioning. This can help in building relevant tools for BCI applications such as neuro-rehabilitation of subjects suffering impairments in visual feature binding.

Method: We present a new metric to evaluate trial-by-trial covariations of successive ERP components. Our main assumption is that if two successive ERP components are generated by phase-resetting of a unitary oscillation, they should be time-locked to each other and their single-trial latencies should covary. In contrast, if the components are generated by independent additive components, single-trial latency covariations should not be observed. To quantify the covariance between the single-trial latencies, we define a metric based on latencycorrected averages, which we applied to both simulated and real ERPs. Results: For the simulated data, there was a clear distinction in latency covariation between the ERPs generated with unitary phase-resetting versus additive models. For real visual and auditory ERPs, we observed a lack of latency covariation of successive components. Comparison with existing methods: The new metric is complementary to other approaches to study the mechanisms underlying ERP generation, and does not suffer from potential caveats due to filtering artifacts. Moreover, the method proved to be more sensitive than another estimation of single-trial latency covariations using the crosscorrelation function. Conclusion: The observed lack of latency covariation shows the presence of parallel, independent processing within each cortical sensory pathway.

Multisine frequency modulation of intra-epidermal electric pulse sequences: A novel tool to study nociceptive processing	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Intra-epidermal stimulation; Electroencephalography; Steady-state evoked potentials; Nociceptive processing; Time-delay; Nonlinearity; System identification		A sustained sensory stimulus with a periodic variation of intensity creates an electrophysiological brain response at associated frequencies, referred to as the steady-state evoked potential (SSEP). The SSEPs elicited by the periodic stimulation of nociceptors in the skin may represent activity of a brain network that is primarily involved in nociceptive processing. Exploring the behavior of this network could lead to valuable insights regarding the pathway from nociceptive stimulus to pain perception. We present a method to directly modulate the pulse rate of nociceptive afferents in the skin with a multisine waveform through intra-epidermal electric stimulation. The technique was demonstrated in healthy volunteers. Each subject was stimulated using a pulse sequence modulated by a multisine waveform of 3, 7 and 13 Hz. The EEG was analyzed for the presence of the base frequencies and associated (sub)harmonics. Topographies showed significant central and contralateral SSEP responses at 3, 7 and 13 Hz in respectively 7, 4 and 3 out of the 9 participants included for analysis. As such, we found that intra-epidermal stimulation with a multisine frequency modulated pulse sequence can generate nociceptive SSEPs. The possibility to stimulate the nociceptive system using multisine frequency modulated pulses offers novel opportunities to study the temporal dynamics of nociceptive processing.

It involves implantation of stimulating electrodes in a precisely guided fashion into subcortical structures and, at a later stage, chronic stimulation of these structures with an implantable pulse generator. While the DBS surgery makes it possible to both record brain activity and stimulate parts of the brain that are difficult to reach with non-invasive techniques, electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) provide complementary information from other brain areas, which can be used to characterize brain networks targeted through DBS. This requires, however, the careful consideration of different types of artifacts in the data acquisition and the subsequent analyses. Here, we review both the technical issues associated with EEG/MEG recordings in DBS patients and the experimental findings to date. One major line of research is simultaneous recording of local field potentials (LFPs) from DBS targets and EEG/MEG. These studies revealed a set of cortico-subcortical coherent networks functioning at distinguishable physiological frequencies. Specific network responses were linked to clinical state, task or stimulation parameters. Another experimental approach is mapping of DBS-targeted networks in chronically implanted patients by recording EEG/MEG responses during stimulation. One can track responses evoked by single stimulation pulses or bursts as well as brain state shifts caused by DBS. These studies have the potential to provide biomarkers for network responses that can be adapted to guide stereotactic implantation or optimization of stimulation parameters. This is especially important for diseases where the clinical effect of DBS is delayed or develops slowly over time. The same biomarkers could also potentially be utilized for the online control of DBS network effects in the new generation of closed-loop stimulators that are currently entering clinical use. Through future studies, the use of network biomarkers may facilitate the integration of circuit physiology into clinical decision making.

In healthy volunteers, it induces well-being and tranquility senses, and facilitates superficial stages of sleep. However, anxiolytic, and antidepressant-like effects and changes on the sleep-waking stages have not been explored. Aim: To determine anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects of an aqueous extract of C. zacatechichi (CZ) in rodents and to analyze their effects on hippocampal activity in the rat sleep-waking cycle. Material and methods: CZ anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects were evaluated in several mice and rat behavioral paradigms. CZ effects on temporal distribution of sleep were described, and hippocampus EEG frequency patterns were analyzed during the sleep-waking cycle; absolute and relative powers were analyzed during Rapid Eye Movements (REM) and non-REM sleep stages. CZ chemical analysis was performed by UPLC-ESI-MS. Results: CZ produced specific and robust anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects in mice and rats, similar to those of prototypical drugs, at doses ranging from 0.5 to 50 mg/kg. CZ at 100 mg/kg produced visible mild sedative effects in rats, associated with a significant increase in Slow Wave Sleep episodes during a 6 h recording, and enhanced fast frequencies of hippocampus (gamma-band:31-50 Hz) during REM sleep. Conclusion: Results could support the well-being and tranquility senses reported by healthy consumers, and to explain the oneiric content during dreams and some improvements in cognitive processes described by consumers. Anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects of this species, reported for first time in this study could improve some aspects of mental health.

J	Singh, K; Singh, S; Malhotra, J				Singh, Kuldeep; Singh, Sukhjeet; Malhotra, Jyoteesh			Spectral features based convolutional neural network for accurate and prompt identification of schizophrenic patients	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART H-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Schizophrenia; convolutional neural network; EEG; internet of things; healthcare; spectral analysis		Schizophrenia is a fatal mental disorder, which affects millions of people globally by the disturbance in their thinking, feeling and behaviour. In the age of the internet of things assisted with cloud computing and machine learning techniques, the computer-aided diagnosis of schizophrenia is essentially required to provide its patients with an opportunity to own a better quality of life. In this context, the present paper proposes a spectral features based convolutional neural network (CNN) model for accurate identification of schizophrenic patients using spectral analysis of multichannel EEG signals in real-time. This model processes acquired EEG signals with filtering, segmentation and conversion into frequency domain. Then, given frequency domain segments are divided into six distinct spectral bands like delta, theta-1, theta-2, alpha, beta and gamma. The spectral features including mean spectral amplitude, spectral power and Hjorth descriptors (Activity, Mobility and Complexity) are extracted from each band. These features are independently fed to the proposed spectral features-based CNN and long short-term memory network (LSTM) models for classification. This work also makes use of raw time-domain and frequency-domain EEG segments for classification using temporal CNN and spectral CNN models of same architectures respectively. The overall analysis of simulation results of all models exhibits that the proposed spectral features based CNN model is an efficient technique for accurate and prompt identification of schizophrenic patients among healthy individuals with average classification accuracies of 94.08% and 98.56% for two different datasets with optimally small classification time.

The process of analyzing EEG is time consuming leading to the development of seizure detection algorithms to aid its analysis. This approach is limited since it requires seizures to occur during monitoring periods and can often lead to misdiagnosis in cases where seizure occurrence is rare. For such cases, it has been shown that the interictal periods in EEG signals, which is the predominant state in long-term monitoring, can be useful for the diagnosis of epilepsy. This paper presents an algorithm, using the information in interictal periods, to discriminate between long-term EEG recordings of epilepsy patients and healthy subjects. It extracts several time and frequency-time domain features from the signals and classifies them using an ensemble classifier, achieving 100% sensitivity and 98.7% specificity in classifying 267 recordings from 105 subjects. The results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to reliably identify EEG recordings of epilepsy subjects automatically which can be highly useful to facilitate screening and diagnosis of epilepsy, especially in those parts of the world where there is a lack of trained personnel for interpreting EEG signals.

Distinguishing physiologic from epileptic ripples has been particularly challenging because usually, invasive recordings are only performed in patients with refractory epilepsy. Here, we identified 'healthy' brain areas based on electrical stimulation and hypothesized that these regions specifically generate 'pure' ripples not coupled to spikes. Intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recorded with subdural grid electrodes was retrospectively analyzed in 19 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Interictal spikes and ripples were automatically detected in slow-wave sleep using the publicly available Delphos software. We found that rates of spikes, ripples and ripples coupled to spikes ('spike-ripples') were higher inside the seizure-onset zone (p < 0.001). A comparison of receiver operating characteristic curves revealed that spike-ripples slightly delineated the seizure-onset zone channels, but did this significantly better than spikes (p < 0.001). Ripples were more frequent in the eloquent neocortex than in the remaining non-seizure onset zone areas (p < 0.001). This was due to the higher rates of 'pure' ripples (p < 0.001; median rates 3.3/min vs. 1.4/min), whereas spike-ripple rates were not significantly different (p = 0.87). 'Pure' ripples identified 'healthy' channels significantly better than chance (p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that, in contrast to epileptic spike-ripples, 'pure' ripples are mainly physiological. They may be considered, in addition to electrical stimulation, to delineate eloquent cortex in pre-surgical patients. Since we applied open source software for detection, our approach may be generally suited to tackle a variety of research questions in epilepsy and cognitive science.

J	Nijhuis, P; Keller, PE; Nozaradan, S; Varlet, M				Nijhuis, Patti; Keller, Peter E.; Nozaradan, Sylvie; Varlet, Manuel			Dynamic modulation of cortico-muscular coupling during real and imagined sensorimotor synchronisation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Cortico-muscular coherence; Sensorimotor synchronisation; Beta oscillations; Environmental rhythms; Motor imagery; Electroencephalography	BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; MOTOR IMAGERY; AUDITORY DOMINANCE; RHYTHMIC MOVEMENT; BEAT PERCEPTION; MENTAL-IMAGERY; CORTEX; TIME; EMG	People have a natural and intrinsic ability to coordinate body movements with rhythms surrounding them, known as sensorimotor synchronisation. This can be observed in daily environments, when dancing or singing along with music, or spontaneously walking, talking or applauding in synchrony with one another. However, the neurophys-iological mechanisms underlying accurately synchronised movement with selected rhythms in the environment remain unclear. Here we studied real and imagined sensorimotor synchronisation with interleaved auditory and visual rhythms using cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) to better understand the processes underlying the prepa-ration and execution of synchronised movement. Electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG) from the finger flexors, and continuous force signals were recorded in 20 participants during tapping and imagined tapping with discrete stimulus sequences consisting of alternating auditory beeps and visual flashes. The results show that the synchronisation between cortical and muscular activity in the beta (14-38 Hz) frequency band be-comes time-locked to the taps executed in synchrony with the visual and auditory stimuli. Dynamic modulation in CMC also occurred when participants imagined tapping with the visual stimuli, but with lower amplitude and a different temporal profile compared to real tapping. These results suggest that CMC does not only reflect changes related to the production of the synchronised movement, but also to its preparation, which appears heightened under higher attentional demands imposed when synchronising with the visual stimuli. These findings high -light a critical role of beta band neural oscillations in the cortical-muscular coupling underlying sensorimotor synchronisation.

Unfortunately, phase II EEG approach has high risk due to invasiveness like infection and bleeding. Therefore, alternative approach with attention to non-invasiveness, real-time measurement and mobility is urgently needed. Brain ECVT is believed to be one of the promising neuro-imaging techniques to record human's brain activities. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of integrated EEG and brain ECVT system. A two-electrode Brain ECVT sensor was designed to facilitate a simultaneous measurement with EEG by using COMSOL software, phantom experiment and measurement with real human in resting-state condition. Visual and power spectral density (PSD) analysis showed that ECVT excitation at 100 Hz frequency or higher does not interfere with EEG measurement. Arithmetic task was performed in human subject experiment which shows that the signal PSD during the task is higher than during relax condition in both Brain ECVT and EEG measurements. ECVT excitation at 100 Hz or higher does not interfere with EEG measurement. Brain ECVT and EEG simultaneous measurement can give similar results based on the signal power spectral density analysis.

Sleep spindles comprise a subset of a broader class of electroencephalogram events	SLEEP			English	Article						sleep spindles; multitaper spectral estimation; EEG; memory consolidation; NREM	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EEG; RELIABILITY; FINGERPRINT; SYNCHRONY	Study Objectives Sleep spindles are defined based on expert observations of waveform features in the electroencephalogram (EEG) traces. This is a potentially limiting characterization, as transient oscillatory bursts like spindles are easily obscured in the time domain by higher amplitude activity at other frequencies or by noise. It is therefore highly plausible that many relevant events are missed by current approaches based on traditionally defined spindles. Given their oscillatory structure, we reexamine spindle activity from first principles, using time-frequency activity in comparison to scored spindles. Methods Using multitaper spectral analysis, we observe clear time-frequency peaks in the sigma (10-16 Hz) range (TF sigma peaks). While nearly every scored spindle coincides with a TF sigma peak, numerous similar TF sigma peaks remain undetected. We therefore perform statistical analyses of spindles and TF sigma peaks using manual and automated detection methods, comparing event cooccurrence, morphological similarities, and night-to-night consistency across multiple datasets. Results On average, TF sigma peaks have more than three times the rate of spindles (mean rate: 9.8 vs. 3.1 events/minute). Moreover, spindles subsample the most prominent TF sigma peaks with otherwise identical spectral morphology. We further demonstrate that detected TF sigma peaks have stronger night-to-night rate stability (rho = 0.98) than spindles (rho = 0.67), while covarying with spindle rates across subjects (rho = 0.72). Conclusions These results provide compelling evidence that traditionally defined spindles constitute a subset of a more generalized class of EEG events. TF sigma peaks are therefore a more complete representation of the underlying phenomenon, providing a more consistent and robust basis for future experiments and analyses.

Atypical beta power fluctuation while listening to an isochronous sequence in dyslexia	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Dyslexia; Electroencephalography (EEG); Beta oscillation; Auditory perception; Entrainment	DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; RHYTHM DISCRIMINATION; RISE-TIME; EEG-DATA; PERCEPTION; CHILDREN; BEAT; SPEECH; ADULTS; ENTRAINMENT	Objective: Developmental dyslexia is a reading disorder that features difficulties in perceiving and track-ing rhythmic regularities in auditory streams, such as speech and music. Studies on typical healthy par-ticipants have shown that power fluctuations of neural oscillations in beta band (15-25 Hz) reflect an essential mechanism for tracking rhythm or entrainment and relate to predictive timing and attentional processes. Here we investigated whether adults with dyslexia have atypical beta power fluctuation. Methods: The electroencephalographic activities of individuals with dyslexia (n = 13) and typical control participants (n = 13) were measured while they passively listened to an isochronous tone sequence (2 Hz presentation rate). The time-frequency neural activities generated from auditory cortices were analyzed. Results: The phase of beta power fluctuation at the 2 Hz stimulus presentation rate differed and appeared opposite between individuals with dyslexia and controls. Conclusions: Atypical beta power fluctuation might reflect deficits in perceiving and tracking auditory rhythm in dyslexia. Significance: These findings extend our understanding of atypical neural activities for tracking rhythm in dyslexia and could inspire novel methods to objectively measure the benefits of training, and predict potential benefit of auditory rhythmic rehabilitation programs on an individual basis.

In this study, we evaluated the performance of commonly used supervised machine learning algorithms in the classification of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) history from those with stroke history and/or normal EEG. Methods: Support vector machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) models were generated with a diverse feature set from Temple EEG Corpus for both two-class classification of patients with TBI history from normal subjects and three-class classification of TBI, stroke and normal subjects. Results: For two-class classification, an accuracy of 0.94 was achieved in 10-fold cross validation (CV), and 0.76 in independent validation (IV). For three-class classification, 0.85 and 0.71 accuracy were reached in CV and IV respectively. Overall, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) feature selection and SVM models consistently performed well in both CV and IV and for both two-class and three-class classification. Compared to normal control, both TBI and stroke patients showed an overall reduction in coherence and relative PSD in delta frequency, and an increase in higher frequency (alpha, mu, beta and gamma) power. But stroke patients showed a greater degree of change and had additional global decrease in theta power. Conclusions: Our study suggests that EEG data-driven machine learning can be a useful tool for TBI classification. Significance: Our study provides preliminary evidence that EEG ML algorithm can potentially provide specificity to separate different neurological conditions.

In the present study, we investigate peak-to-peak amplitude of task event-related oscillations of healthy subjects during delay discounting task. The study included forty-seven consecutive volunteers with mean 22 age- and matched education and socioeconomic condition. We used two temporal discounting (TD) tasks: the first was used to find individual indifference points for a set of delays and in the second, we recorded EEG as the participants made now vs delay decisions for the indifferent options. The EEG activity were recorded from 24 electrodes placed on the head surface according to the international 10-20 system. EEG activity for each choice (now and future) was averaged separately. The ERO responses were calculated for delta, theta, alpha and beta bands by the peak-to-peak measures. After Bonferroni correction, we found a significant effect of the decision process on the left frontal theta, left centroparietal delta, and frontoparietal beta oscillations. These were significantly greater during future decisions compared to now condition. These results indicate that a widespread frontoparietal network is implicated during delay discounting.

Detection and diagnosis of SZ by visual inspection is subjective, difficult, and timeconsuming. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are widely used to detect the SZ as they reflect the conditions of the brain. Conventional machine learning methods involve many lengthy manual steps, such as decomposition, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. In this article, automated identification of SZ is proposed using a combination of time-frequency analysis and convolutional neural network (CNN) to overcome the limitations of feature extraction-based methods. Three press button tasks are analyzed to segregate normal subjects and SZ patients. The EEG signals are subjected to continuous wavelet transform, short-time Fourier transform, and smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution (SPWVD) techniques to obtain scalogram, spectrogram, and SPWVD-based time-frequency representation (TFR) plots, respectively. These 2-D plots are fed to pretrained AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet50, and CNN. We have obtained an accuracy of 93.36% using the SPWVD-based TFR and CNN model. In comparison to the benchmark AlexNet, ResNet50, and VGG16 networks, the developed CNN model with four convolutional layers not only requires fewer learnable parameters but also is computationally efficient and fast. This clearly indicates that our proposed method combining the SPWVD-CNN model has performed better than the state-of-the-art transfer learning techniques. Our developed model is ready to be tested with more EEG data and can aid psychiatrists in their diagnosis.

Non-invasive brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) offer an alternative, safe and accessible way to interact with the environment. To enable meaningful and stable physical interactions, BMIs need to decode forces. Although previously addressed in the unimanual case, controlling forces from both hands would enable BMI-users to perform a greater range of interactions. We here investigate the decoding of hand-specific forces. Approach. We maximise cortical information by using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and developing a deep-learning architecture with attention and residual layers (cnnatt) to improve their fusion. Our task required participants to generate hand-specific force profiles on which we trained and tested our deep-learning and linear decoders. Main results. The use of EEG and fNIRS improved the decoding of bimanual force and the deep-learning models outperformed the linear model. In both cases, the greatest gain in performance was due to the detection of force generation. In particular, the detection of forces was hand-specific and better for the right dominant hand and cnnatt was better at fusing EEG and fNIRS. Consequently, the study of cnnatt revealed that forces from each hand were differently encoded at the cortical level. Cnnatt also revealed traces of the cortical activity being modulated by the level of force which was not previously found using linear models. Significance. Our results can be applied to avoid hand-cross talk during hand force decoding to improve the robustness of BMI robotic devices. In particular, we improve the fusion of EEG and fNIRS signals and offer hand-specific interpretability of the encoded forces which are valuable during motor rehabilitation assessment.

However, the time-consuming calibration sessions limit the number of training trials and may give rise to visual fatigue, which weakens the effectiveness of the individual training data. For addressing this issue, this study proposes a novel inter- and intra-subject maximal correlation (IISMC) method to enhance the robustness of SSVEP recognition via employing the inter- and intra-subject similarity and variability. Through efficient transfer learning, similar experience under the same task is shared across subjects. Methods: IISMC extracts subject-specific information and similar task-related information from oneself and other subjects performing the same task by maximizing the inter- and intra-subject correlation. Multiple weak classifiers are built from several existing subjects and then integrated to construct the strong classifiers by the average weighting. Finally, a powerful fusion predictor is obtained for target recognition. Results: The proposed framework is validated on a benchmark data set of 35 subjects, and the experimental results demonstrate that IISMC obtains better performance than the state of the art task-related component analysis (TRCA). Significance: The proposed method has great potential for developing high-speed BCIs.

Theta but not beta power is positively associated with better explicit motor task learning	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Motor learning; Independent component analysis	HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; CINGULATE CORTEX; BRAIN ACTIVITY; BASAL GANGLIA; OSCILLATIONS; MOVEMENT; STIMULATION; MEMORY; ALPHA; SYNCHRONIZATION	Neurophysiologic correlates of motor learning that can be monitored during neurorehabilitation interventions can facilitate the development of more effective learning methods. Previous studies have focused on the role of the beta band (14-30 Hz) because of its clear response during motor activity. However, it is difficult to discriminate between beta activity related to learning a movement and performing the movement. In this study, we analysed differences in the electroencephalography (EEG) power spectra of complex and simple explicit sequential motor tasks in healthy young subjects. The complex motor task (CMT) allowed EEG measurement related to motor learning. In contrast, the simple motor task (SMT) made it possible to control for EEG activity associated with performing the movement without significant motor learning. Source reconstruction of the EEG revealed task-related activity from 5 clusters covering both primary motor cortices (M1) and 3 clusters localised to different parts of the cingulate cortex (CC). We found no association between M1 beta power and learning, but the CMT produced stronger bilateral beta suppression compared to the SMT. However, there was a positive association between contralateral M1 theta (5-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) power and motor learning, and theta and alpha power in the posterior mid-CC and posterior CC were positively associated with greater motor learning. These findings suggest that the theta and alpha bands are more related to motor learning than the beta band, which might merely relate to the level of perceived difficulty during learning.

However, their association with the balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition (E/I-B), which is closely related to the activities of glutamate and gamma -aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the receptor availability (RA) of GABA(A) and mGluR5, remains unexplored. This research investigates these associations during the resting state (RS) condition using simultaneously recorded PET/MR/EEG (trimodal) data. The trimodal data were acquired from three studies using different radio-tracers such as, [C-11]ABP688 (ABP) (N=9), [C-11]Flumazenil (FMZ) (N=10) and 2-[F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) (N=10) targeted to study the mGluR5, GABA(A) receptors and glucose metabolism respectively. Glucose metabolism and neuroreceptor binding availability (non-displaceable binding potential (BPND)) of GABA(A) and mGluR5 were found to be significantly higher and closely linked within core resting-state networks (RSNs). The neuronal generators of EEG microstates and the fMRI measures were most tightly associated with the BPND of GABA(A) relative to mGluR5 BPND and the glucose metabolism, emphasising a predominance of inhibitory processes within in the core RSNs at rest. Changes in the neuroreceptors leading to an altered coupling with glucose metabolism may render the RSNs vulnerable to psychiatric conditions. The paradigm employed here will likely help identify the precise neurobiological mechanisms behind these alterations in fMRI functional connectivity and EEG oscillations, potentially benefitting individualised healthcare treatment measures.

Human EEG and Recurrent Neural Networks Exhibit Common Temporal Dynamics During Speech Recognition	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; artificial neural network; speech tracking; auditory; theta; recurrent; RNN	PHASE PATTERNS; OSCILLATIONS; COMPREHENSION; ENTRAINMENT; RESPONSES; DEPENDS; DELTA; THETA	Recent deep-learning artificial neural networks have shown remarkable success in recognizing natural human speech, however the reasons for their success are not entirely understood. Success of these methods might be because state-of-the-art networks use recurrent layers or dilated convolutional layers that enable the network to use a time-dependent feature space. The importance of time-dependent features in human cortical mechanisms of speech perception, measured by electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), have also been of particular recent interest. It is possible that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) achieve their success by emulating aspects of cortical dynamics, albeit through very different computational mechanisms. In that case, we should observe commonalities in the temporal dynamics of deep-learning models, particularly in recurrent layers, and brain electrical activity (EEG) during speech perception. We explored this prediction by presenting the same sentences to both human listeners and the Deep Speech RNN and considered the temporal dynamics of the EEG and RNN units for identical sentences. We tested whether the recently discovered phenomenon of envelope phase tracking in the human EEG is also evident in RNN hidden layers. We furthermore predicted that the clustering of dissimilarity between model representations of pairs of stimuli would be similar in both RNN and EEG dynamics. We found that the dynamics of both the recurrent layer of the network and human EEG signals exhibit envelope phase tracking with similar time lags. We also computed the representational distance matrices (RDMs) of brain and network responses to speech stimuli. The model RDMs became more similar to the brain RDM when going from early network layers to later ones, and eventually peaked at the recurrent layer. These results suggest that the Deep Speech RNN captures a representation of temporal features of speech in a manner similar to human brain.

Methods: Retrospective data on 151 patients were collected and divided into three groups: primary snoring group (AHI < 5/h), mild-moderate OSA group (6 <= AHI < 30/h), and severe OSA group (AHI >= 30/h). EEG recordings in the frontal, central, and occipital regions were extracted from both REM and NREM sleep, to compute the normalized spectral power densities in the delta, theta, alpha, sigma, beta, and gamma frequency bands, using Fast Fourier Transform. Correlations between the computed EEG power and PSG parameters were analyzed. Results: In NREM sleep, elevated normalized power spectral density (PSD) in the delta band was observed in the severe OSA group compared to the other two groups. In contrast, the PSD of the other frequency bands showed a corresponding decrease in the severe OSA group. In REM sleep, similar changes were observed in the frontal region. Delta band PSD was positively correlated with Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) (r = 0.33), longest time of apnea, oxygen desaturation index (ODI) (r = 0.34), percent sleep time below 90% SaO(2) (T90%) (r = 0.30), Arousal Index (ArI) (r = 0.29), and negatively correlated with N3%, minimum oxygen saturation (minSaO(2)). Conclusion: Our findings provide neurophysiological evidence for pathological cortical activation during REM/NREM sleep, which may be associated with the arousals and cognitive impairments in OSA. The technique of power spectral analysis could prove a potentially useful tool in complementing traditional PSG parameters in assessing disease burden to guide therapeutic decisions.

Temporal EigenPAC for Dyslexia Diagnosis	ADVANCES IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (IWANN 2021), PT II	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	18th International Conference on Quantitative Evaluation Systems (QEST)	AUG 23-27, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK			Dyslexia diagnosis; Phase-amplitude coupling; EigenPAC; Classification	OSCILLATIONS	Electroencephalography (EEG) signals allow to explore the functional activity of the brain cortex in a non-invasive way. However, the analysis of these signals is not straightforward due to the presence of different artifacts and the very low signal-to-noise ratio. Cross-Frequency Coupling (CFC) methods provide a way to extract information from EEG, related to the synchronization among frequency bands. CFC methods are usually applied in a local way, computing the interaction between phase and amplitude at the same electrode. In this work we show a method to compute Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) features among electrodes to study the functional connectivity. Moreover, this has been applied jointly with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to explore patterns related to Dyslexia in 7-years-old children. The developed methodology reveals the temporal evolution of PAC-based connectivity. Directions of greatest variance computed by PCA are called eigenPACs here, since they resemble the classical eigenfaces representation. The projection of PAC data onto the eigenPACs provide a set of features that has demonstrates their discriminative capability, specifically in the Beta-Gamma bands.

Building on classic theories of feature binding, we first define the oscillatory signatures of integrating 'where' and 'when' information in working memory (WM) and then investigate the role of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in spatiotemporal integration. Fourteen individuals with lateral PFC damage and 20 healthy controls completed a visuospatial WM task while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. On each trial, two shapes were presented sequentially in a top/bottom spatial orientation. We defined EEG signatures of spatiotemporal integration by comparing the maintenance of two possible where-when configurations: the first shape presented on top and the reverse. Frontal deltatheta (delta theta; 2-7 Hz) activity, frontal-posterior dq functional connectivity, lateral posterior event-related potentials, and mesial posterior alpha phase-to-gamma amplitude coupling dissociated the two configurations in controls. WM performance and frontal and mesial posterior signatures of spatiotemporal integration were diminished in PFC lesion patients, whereas lateral posterior signatures were intact. These findings reveal both PFC-dependent and independent substrates of spatiotemporal integration and link optimal performance to PFC. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This evidence points to the existence of converging physiological pathways across memory systems. Here, we examined whether the coupling between slow oscillations (SO) and spindles, a mechanism well established in the consolidation of declarative memories, is relevant for the stabilization of human motor memories. To this aim, we conducted an electroencephalography study in which we quantified various parameters of these oscillations during a night of sleep that took place immediately after learning a visuomotor adaptation (VMA) task. We found that VMA increased the overall density of fast (>= 12 Hz), but not slow (<12 Hz), spindles during nonrapid eye movement sleep, stage 3 (NREM3). This modulation occurred rather locally over the hemisphere contralateral to the trained hand. Although adaptation learning did not affect the density of SOs, it substantially enhanced the number of fast spindles locked to the active phase of SOs. The fact that only coupled spindles predicted overnight memory retention points to the relevance of this association in motor memory consolidation. Our work provides evidence in favor of a common mechanism at the basis of the stabilization of declarative and motor memories.

Sleep spectral power correlates of prospective memory maintenance	LEARNING & MEMORY			English	Article							SPONTANEOUS RETRIEVAL; OSCILLATIONS; VALIDATION; DEPRIVATION; PERFORMANCE; ANXIETY	Prospective memory involves setting an intention to act that is maintained over time and executed when appropriate. Slow wave sleep (SWS) has been implicated in maintaining prospective memories, although which SWS oscillations most benefit this memory type remains unclear. Here, we investigated SWS spectral power correlates of prospective memory. Healthy young adult participants completed three ongoing tasks in the morning or evening. They were then given the prospective memory instruction to remember to press "Q" when viewing the words "horse" or "table" when repeating the ongoing task after a 12-h delay including overnight, polysomnographically recorded sleep or continued daytime wakefulness. Spectral power analysis was performed on recorded sleep EEG. Two additional groups were tested in the morning or evening only, serving as time-of-day controls. Participants who slept demonstrated superior prospective memory compared with those who remained awake, an effect not attributable to time-of-day of testing. Contrary to prior work, prospective memory was negatively associated with SWS. Furthermore, significant increases in spectral power in the delta-theta frequency range (1.56 Hz-6.84 Hz) during SWS was observed in participants who failed to execute the prospective memory instructions. Although sleep benefits prospective memory maintenance, this benefit may be compromised if SWS is enriched with delta-theta activity.

Does the human auditory system adapt to the speech long-term modulation spectrum and efficiently extract critical information from speech signals? To answer this question, we tested whether neural responses to speech signals can be captured by specific modulation spectra of non-speech acoustic stimuli. We generated amplitude modulated (AM) noise with the speech modulation spectrum and 1/f modulation spectra of different exponents to imitate temporal dynamics of different natural sounds. We presented these AM stimuli and a 10-min piece of natural speech to 19 human participants undergoing electroencephalography (EEG) recording. We derived temporal response functions (TRFs) to the AM stimuli of different spectrum shapes and found distinct neural dynamics for each type of TRFs. We then used the TRFs of AM stimuli to predict neural responses to the speech signals, and found that (1) the TRFs of AM modulation spectra of exponents 1, 1.5, and 2 preferably captured EEG responses to speech signals in the d band and (2) the u neural band of speech neural responses can be captured by the AM stimuli of an exponent of 0.75. Our results suggest that the human auditory system shows specificity to the long-term modulation spectrum and is equipped with characteristic neural algorithms tailored to extract critical acoustic information from speech signals.

Focal limbic sources create the large slow oscillations of the EEG in human deep sleep	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						Sleep; Memory; Slow oscillations; N3 Sleep; Limbic cortex; Dense-array EEG	IN-VIVO; WAVES; CONDUCTIVITY; MEMORY; BRAIN; SKULL	Background: Initial observations with the human electroencephalogram (EEG) have interpreted slow oscillations (SOs) of the EEG during deep sleep (N3) as reflecting widespread surface-negative traveling waves that originate in frontal regions and propagate across the neocortex. However, mapping SOs with a high-density array shows the simultaneous appearance of posterior positive voltage fields in the EEG at the time of the frontal-negative fields, with the typical inversion point (apparent source) around the temporal lobe. Methods: Overnight 256-channel EEG recordings were gathered from 10 healthy young adults. Individual head conductivity models were created using each participant's own structural MRI. Source localization of SOs during N3 was then performed. Results: Electrical source localization models confirmed that these large waves were created by focal discharges within the ventral limbic cortex, including medial temporal and caudal orbitofrontal cortex. Conclusions: Although the functional neurophysiology of deep sleep involves interactions between limbic and neocortical networks, the large EEG deflections of deep sleep are not created by distributed traveling waves in lateral neocortex but instead by relatively focal limbic discharges.

In recent years, the detection of epilepsy electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for clinical application has attracted extensive attention from many researchers. In this paper, a novel epilepsy classification model is proposed based on the time-frequency (TF) analysis method named synchroextracting chirplet transform (SECT). The energy concentrated TF representation of the signal is first obtained benefit by the introduced parameter chirp rate. Then the instantaneous frequency (IF) trajectory is estimated by extracting the TF coefficients most relevant to the signal through the synchroextracting chirplet operator (SECO). The original signal can be simple and effectively reconstructed using the accurate IF trajectory with anti-noise interference ability. Singular value decomposition is performed on the TF matrix to obtain the feature vectors with strong characterization capacity for different epilepsy behaviors, and the multiple classification tasks are finally completed with support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Two authoritative epilepsy datasets are employed in our work to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. No less than 99.17 % accuracy, 99.33 % specificity, and 99.28 % sensitivity are achieved on a total of ten classification tasks that are closely related to the actual clinical applications in the Bonn dataset; an average of 99.29 % accuracy and 0.97 matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) are obtained among all subjects in the long-term EEG database CHB-MIT. The noise robustness and portability of our proposal are verified through the stable experimental results. The superior detection accuracy also provides clinicians with auxiliary diagnosis.

J	Zuure, MB; Cohen, MX				Zuure, Marrit B.; Cohen, Michael X.			Narrowband multivariate source separation for semi-blind discovery of experiment contrasts	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Source separation; Multivariate analysis; Oscillations	EEG; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; TUTORIAL; TIME	Background: Electrophysiological recordings contain mixtures of signals from distinct neural sources, impeding a straightforward interpretation of the sensor-level data. This mixing is particularly detrimental when distinct sources resonate in overlapping frequencies. Fortunately, the mixing is linear and instantaneous. Multivariate source separation methods may therefore successfully separate statistical sources, even with overlapping spatial distributions. N ew Method: We demonstrate a feature-guided multivariate source separation method that is tuned to narrowband frequency content as well as binary condition differences. This method - comparison scanning generalized eigendecomposition, csGED - harnesses the covariance structure of multichannel data to find directions (i.e., eigenvectors) that maximally separate two subsets of data. To drive condition specificity and frequency specificity, our data subsets were taken from different task conditions and narrowband-filtered prior to applying GED. Results: To validate the method, we simulated MEG data in two conditions with shared noise characteristics and unique signal. csGED outperformed the best sensor at reconstructing the ground truth signals, even in the presence of large amounts of noise. We next applied csGED to a published empirical MEG dataset on visual perception vs. imagery. csGED identified sources in alpha, beta, and gamma bands, and successfully separated distinct networks in the same frequency band. Comparison with Existing Method(s): GED is a flexible feature-guided decomposition method that has previously successfully been applied. Our combined frequency- and condition-tuning is a novel adaptation that extends the power of GED in cognitive electrophysiology. Conclusions: We demonstrate successful condition-specific source separation by applying csGED to simulated and empirical data.

Although adaptation operates within individual movements on a trial-to trial basis, it can also undergo learning when adaptive responses improve over the course of many trials. Brain oscillatory activities related to these "adaptation " and "learning " processes remain unclear. The main reason for this is that previous studies principally focused on the beta band, which confined the outcome message to trial-to-trial adaptation. To provide a wider understanding of adaptive learning, we decoded visuomotor tasks with constant, random or no perturbation from EEG recordings in different bandwidths and brain regions using a multiple kernel learning approach. These different experimental tasks were intended to separate trial-to-trial adaptation from the formation of the new visuomotor mapping across trials. We found changes in EEG power in the post-movement period during the course of the visuomotor-constant rotation task, in particular an increased (i) theta power in prefrontal region, (ii) beta power in supplementary motor area, and (iii) gamma power in motor regions. Classifying the visuomotor task with constant rotation versus those with random or no rotation, we were able to relate power changes in beta band mainly to trial-to-trial adaptation to error while changes in theta band would relate rather to the learning of the new mapping. Altogether, this suggested that there is a tight relationship between modulation of the synchronization of low (theta) and higher (essentially beta) frequency oscillations in prefrontal and sensorimotor regions, respectively, and adaptive learning.

Switch and mixing effects are associated with increased power in broad frontoparietal networks, typically stronger in the theta band (similar to 4-8 Hz). However, it is not yet known whether mixing and switch costs rely upon common or distinct networks. In this study, we examine proactive and reactive control networks linked to task switching and mixing effects, and whether strength of connectivity in these networks is associated with behavioural outcomes. Participants (n = 197) completed a cued-trials task-switching paradigm with concurrent electroencephalography, after substantial task practice to establish strong cue-stimulus-response representations. We used inter-site phase clustering, a measure of functional connectivity across electrode sites, to establish cross-site connectivity from a frontal and a parietal seed. Distinct theta networks were activated during proactive and reactive control periods. During the preparation interval, mixing effects were associated with connectivity from the frontal seed to parietal sites, and switch effects with connectivity from the parietal seed to occipital sites. Lateralised occipital connectivity was common to both switch and mixing effects. After target onset, frontal and parietal seeds showed a similar pattern of connectivity across trial types. These findings are consistent with distinct and common proactive control networks and common reactive networks in highly practised task-switching performers.

We sought to determine (1) whether the sensorimotor network shows peculiar alterations in patients with aMCI and (2) if sensorimotor network alterations predict long-term disease progression at the individual level.Methods: We studied several transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters of the sensorimotor cortex in a group of patients with aMCI and followed them for 6 years. We then identified aMCI who clinically converted to AD [prodromal to AD-MCI (pAD-MCI)] and those who remained cognitively stable [non-prodromal to AD-MCI (npAD-MCI)].Results: Patients with aMCI showed reduced motor cortex (M1) excitability and disrupted EEG synchronization [decreased intertrial coherence (ITC)] in alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands compared to the control subjects. The degree of alteration in M1 excitability and alpha ITC was comparable between pAD-MCI and npAD-MCI. Importantly, beta and gamma ITC impairment in the stimulated M1 was greater in pAD-MCI than npAD-MCI. Furthermore, an additional parameter related to the waveform shape of scalp signals, reflecting time-specific alterations in global TMS-induced activity [stability of the dipolar activity (sDA)], discriminated npAD-MCI from MCI who will convert to AD.Discussion: The above mentioned specific cortical changes, reflecting deficit of synchronization within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop in aMCI, may reflect the pathological processes underlying AD. These changes could be tested in larger cohorts as neurophysiological biomarkers of AD.

A standard approach for their quantification are power spectral analyses methods that reflect the global distribution of signal power over frequency. However, these methods incorporate analysis windows to achieve locality and therefore, are limited by the inherent trade-off between time and frequency resolutions. In this paper, we present a novel approach to estimate local power more precisely at a resolution as high as the sampling frequency. Our methods are well grounded on established neurophysiology of the bio-signals where we model EEPs as comprising of two components: neuromodulations and background activity. A local measure of power, we call Marked Point Process (MPP) spectrogram, is then derived as a power-weighted intensity function of the point process for neuromodulations. We demonstrate our results on two datasets: 1) local field potentials recorded from the prefrontal cortex of 3 rats performing a working memory task and 2) EEPs recorded via electroencephalography from the visual cortex of human subjects performing a conditioned stimulus task. A detailed analysis of the power-specific marked features of neuromodulations confirm high correlation between power spectral density and power in neuromodulations establishing the aptness of MPP spectrogram as a finer measure of power where it is able to track local variations in power while preserving the global structure of signal power distribution.

Transcranial Electrical Stimulation targeting limbic cortex increases the duration of human deep sleep	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; Sleep; Memory; Slow oscillations; Deep sleep; Slow wave sleep		Background: Researchers have proposed that impaired sleep may be a causal link in the progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Several recent findings suggest that enhancing deep sleep (N3) may improve neurological health in persons with MCI, and buffer the risk for AD. Specifically, Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (TES) of frontal brain areas, the inferred source of the Slow Oscillations (SOs) of N3 sleep, can extend N3 sleep duration and improve declarative memory for recently learned information. Recent work in our laboratory using dense array Electroencephalography (dEEG) localized the sources of SOs to anterior limbic sites - suggesting that targeting these sites with TES may be more effective for enhancing N3. Methods: For the present study, we recruited 13 healthy adults (M = 42 years) to participate in three allnight sleep EEG recordings where they received low level (0.5 mA) TES designed to target anterior limbic areas and a sham stimulation (placebo). We used a convolutional neural network, trained and tested on professionally scored EEG sleep staging, to predict sleep stages for each recording. Results: When compared to the sham session, limbic-targeted TES significantly increased the duration of N3 sleep. TES also significantly increased spectral power in the 0.5-1 Hz frequency band (relative to pre TES epochs) in left temporoparietal and left occipital scalp regions compared to sham. Conclusion: These results suggest that even low-level TES, when specifically targeting anterior limbic sites, can increase deep (N3) sleep and thereby contribute to healthy sleep quality.

Long short-term memory units and convolutional neural networks are integrated within a multimodal sequence-to-sequence autoencoder. The trained neural network predicts fNIRS signals from EEG, sans a priori, by hierarchically extracting deep features from EEG full spectra and specific EEG frequency bands. Results show that higher frequency EEG ranges are predictive of fNIRS signals with the gamma band inputs dominating fNIRS prediction as compared to other frequency envelopes. Seed based functional connectivity validates similar patterns between experimental fNIRS and our model's fNIRS reconstructions. This is the first study that shows it is possible to predict brain hemodynamics (fNIRS) from encoded neural data (EEG) in the resting human epileptic brain based on power spectrum amplitude modulation of frequency oscillations in the context of specific hypotheses about how EEG frequency bands decode fNIRS signals.

We provide all the raw stimulus files used in developing the experimental paradigm of the linked research article "Organization of directed functional connectivity among nodes of ventral attention network reveals the common network mechanisms underlying saliency processing across distinct spatial and spatio-temporal scales"[1] for replication and use by researchers across various cohorts of the population. Pre-processed EEG time-series segmented into epochs corresponding to three experimental trial conditions, across two visual attention tasks testing the effect of salient distractors on goal-driven tasks are provided. The dataset also includes reaction times corresponding to individual trials. Additionally, structural MRI files corresponding to each individual and 3D EEG sensor locations of all volunteers are provided to assist in accurate source localization. Therefore, the presented dataset will not only facilitate the conventional time resolved EEG analysis like evoked activity and time-frequency analysis at the sensor level but will also facilitate the investigation of source level analysis like global coherence or phase-amplitude coupling within selected regions of the brain.

Recent evidence has suggested a strong relationship between gait abnormalities and cognitive dysfunction in PD patients and impaired cognitive control could be one of the causes for abnormal gait patterns. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction in PD patients with gait problems are unclear. Here, we collected scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals during a 7-s interval timing task to investigate the cortical mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction in PD patients with (PDFOG +, n = 34) and without (PDFOG-, n = 37) freezing of gait, as well as control subjects (n = 37). Results showed that the PDFOG + group exhibited the lowest maximum response density at around 7 s compared to PDFOG- and control groups, and this response density peak correlated with gait abnormalities as measured by FOG scores. EEG data demonstrated that PDFOG + had decreased midfrontal delta-band power at the onset of the target cue, which was also correlated with maximum response density and FOG scores. In addition, our classifier performed better at discriminating PDFOG + from PDFOG- and controls with an area under the curve of 0.93 when midfrontal delta power was chosen as a feature. These findings suggest that abnormal midfrontal activity in PDFOG + is related to cognitive dysfunction and describe the mechanistic relationship between cognitive and gait functions in PDFOG + . Overall, these results could advance the development of novel biosignatures and brain stimulation approaches for PDFOG + .

We aimed to reveal the underlying neural mechanisms that may cause different visual experiences from a brain network perspective. The EEG activities of 40 healthy participants were recorded while watching 2D and 3D videos. By constructing multiband functional brain networks, we analyzed the network efficiencies from both macro- and micro-scales. We observed: 1) at the macro-scale, higher global efficiency in beta (16-32 Hz) and gamma (32-63 Hz) networks in the 3D group, and 2) at the micro-scale, higher occipital and parietal efficiencies in beta and gamma networks in the 3D group, and higher frontal efficiency in the alpha (8-16 Hz) network in the 2D group. Furthermore, using a small subset of functional connectivity features as inputs, a support vector machine classifier was used to classify the brain states induced by watching 2D and 3D videos. We achieved a satisfactory classification accuracy of 0.908 with an area of 0.96 under the receiver operating characteristic curve, using the top 18 features extracted from the beta band. Our findings are expected to uncover the underlying neural mechanisms related to different visual experiences during 2D and 3D video viewing from a brain network perspective.

J	Savolainen, OW				Savolainen, Oscar W.			The significance of neural inter-frequency power correlations	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; PRIMATE MOTOR CORTEX; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; CAT CEREBRAL-CORTEX; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; WAVELET ANALYSIS; ASYMPTOTIC DECORRELATION; SURROGATE DATA; TIME-SERIES; EEG	It is of great interest in neuroscience to determine what frequency bands in the brain have covarying power. This would help us robustly identify the frequency signatures of neural processes. However to date, to the best of the author's knowledge, a comprehensive statistical approach to this question that accounts for intra-frequency autocorrelation, frequency-domain oversampling, and multiple testing under dependency has not been undertaken. As such, this work presents a novel statistical significance test for correlated power across frequency bands for a broad class of non-stationary time series. It is validated on synthetic data. It is then used to test all of the inter-frequency power correlations between 0.2 and 8500 Hz in continuous intracortical extracellular neural recordings in Macaque M1, using a very large, publicly available dataset. The recordings were Current Source Density referenced and were recorded with a Utah array. The results support previous results in the literature that show that neural processes in M1 have power signatures across a very broad range of frequency bands. In particular, the power in LFP frequency bands as low as 20 Hz was found to almost always be statistically significantly correlated to the power in kHz frequency ranges. It is proposed that this test can also be used to discover the superimposed frequency domain signatures of all the neural processes in a neural signal, allowing us to identify every interesting neural frequency band.

Though it has been suggested that auditory cortex is the origin of ASSR, how the laminar architecture of the neocortex contributes to the ASSR recorded from the brain surface remains unclear. Methods We used a 16-channel silicon probe to record the local field potential and the single-unit spike activity in the different layers of the auditory cortex of unanesthetized mice. Click-trains with a repetition rate at 40-Hz were present as sound stimuli to evoke ASSR. Results We found that the LFPs of all cortical layers showed a stable ASSR synchronizing to the 40-Hz click stimuli, while the ASSR was strongest in the granular (thalamorecipient) layer. Furthermore, time-frequency analyses also revealed the strongest coherence between the signals recorded from the granular layer and pial surface. Conclusion Our results reveal that the 40-Hz ASSR primarily shows the evoked gamma oscillation of thalamorecipient layers in the neocortex, and that the ASSR may be a biomarker to detect the cognitive deficits associated with impaired thalamo-cortical connection.

Here, we proposed an updated paradigm utilizing motor coordination imagery involving the lower limbs (normal gait imagery and hemiplegic gait imagery after stroke) and decoded such imagery via an electroencephalogram- (EEG-) based brain network. Thirty subjects were recruited to collect EEGs during motor coordination imagery involving the lower limbs. Time-domain analysis, power spectrum analysis, time-frequency analysis, brain network analysis, and statistical analysis were used to explore the neural mechanisms of motor coordination imagery involving the lower limbs. Then, EEG-based brain network features were extracted, and a support vector machine was used for decoding. The results showed that the two employed motor coordination imageries mainly activated sensorimotor areas; the frequency band power was mainly concentrated within theta and alpha bands, and brain functional connections mainly occurred in the right forehead. The combination of the network attributes of the EEG-based brain network and the spatial features of the adjacency matrix had good separability for the two kinds of gait imagery (p < 0.05), and the average classification accuracy of the combination feature was 92.96% +/- 7.54%. Taken together, our findings suggest that brain network features can be used to identify normal gait imagery and hemiplegic gait imagery after stroke.

Sleep spindles comprise a subset of a broader class of electroencephalogram events	SLEEP			English	Article						sleep spindles; multitaper spectral estimation; EEG; memory consolidation; NREM	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; EEG; RELIABILITY; FINGERPRINT; SYNCHRONY	Study Objectives: Sleep spindles are defined based on expert observations of waveform features in the electroencephalogram (EEG) traces. This is a potentially limiting characterization, as transient oscillatory bursts like spindles are easily obscured in the time domain by higher amplitude activity at other frequencies or by noise. It is therefore highly plausible that many relevant events are missed by current approaches based on traditionally defined spindles. Given their oscillatory structure, we reexamine spindle activity from first principles, using time-frequency activity in comparison to scored spindles. Methods: Using multitaper spectral analysis, we observe clear time-frequency peaks in the sigma (10-16 Hz) range (TF sigma peaks). While nearly every scored spindle coincides with a TF sigma peak, numerous similar TF sigma peaks remain undetected. We therefore perform statistical analyses of spindles and TF sigma peaks using manual and automated detection methods, comparing event cooccurrence, morphological similarities, and night-to-night consistency across multiple datasets. Results: On average, TF sigma peaks have more than three times the rate of spindles (mean rate: 9.8 vs. 3.1 events/minute). Moreover, spindles subsample the most prominent TF sigma peaks with otherwise identical spectral morphology. We further demonstrate that detected TF sigma peaks have stronger night-to-night rate stability (rho = 0.98) than spindles (rho = 0.67), while covarying with spindle rates across subjects (rho = 0.72). Conclusions: These results provide compelling evidence that traditionally defined spindles constitute a subset of a more generalized class of EEG events. TF sigma peaks are therefore a more complete representation of the underlying phenomenon, providing a more consistent and robust basis for future experiments and analyses. Statement of Significance In this paper, we demonstrate that the current definition of spindle activity, which is based on historical observations electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms, greatly undersamples from the oscillatory events underlying the phenomenon. This study is the first to systematically reexamine spindle activity from first principles using time-frequency events as the basis of observation, employing both manual and automatic detection methods. In doing so, we show that TFs peaks, time-frequency peaks in the 10-16 Hz range, provide a more comprehensive, robust, and stable characterization of the spindle phenomenon. The high intra-individual stability and increased statistical power of TFs peaks will likely enhance future studies associating spindle activity with memory, aging, and psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as with large-scale epidemiological and genetic studies.

Twenty-six healthy subjects were divided into two different groups: control group (CG) and DSB group (DSBG). All subjects were exposed to a stress-stimulated environment with 80% exercise intensity. After the 80% exercise intensity was maintained for 10 minutes, the subjects rested for 5 minutes and then measuring EEG and HRV. The chain-reaction changes of stress stimulation through EEG and HRV analysis showed that DSBG had higher values of alpha/high-beta ratio and High-Frequency (HF) value of HRV than CG (p <.05), and Low-Frequency/High-Frequency (LF/HF) ratio of DSBG is significant time-group interaction, indicating a significant difference between groups (p <.05). In consequence, DSB will be used as a meaningful intervention for patients of stress-related diseases or potential patients.

To solve this problem, the visual stimulus signal modulated by trinary frequency shift keying was introduced. OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of this paper is to find a more reliable recognition algorithm for SSVEP-BCI based on trinary frequency shift keying modulated stimuli. METHODS: First, the signal modulated by trinary frequency shift keying is simulated by MATLAB. At different noise levels, the empirical mode decomposition, singular value decomposition, and synchrosqueezing with the short-time Fourier transform are used to extract the characteristic frequency and reconstruct the signal. Then, the coherent method is used to demodulate the reconstructed signal. Second, in the paradigm of BCI using trinary frequency shift keying modulated stimuli, the three methods mentioned above are used to reconstruct EEG signals, and canonical correlation analysis and coherent demodulation are used to recognize the BCI instructions. RESULTS: For simulated signals, it is found that synchrosqueezing with short-time Fourier transform has a better effect on extracting the characteristic frequencies. For the EEG signal, it is found that the method combining synchrosqueezing with short-time Fourier transform and coherent demodulation has a higher accuracy and information translate rate than other methods. CONCLUSION: The method combining synchrosqueezing with short-time Fourier transform and coherent demodulation proposed in this paper can be applied in the SSVEP system based on trinary frequency shift keying modulated stimuli.

The present study aimed to investigate the neurophysiological evidence and potential biomarkers for rTMS and intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) treatment. A total of 61 treatment-resistant depression patients were randomly assigned to receive prolonged iTBS (piTBS; N = 19), 10 Hz rTMS (N = 20), or sham stimulation (N = 22). Each participant went through a treatment phase with resting state electroencephalography (EEG) recordings before and after the treatment phase. The aftereffects of stimulation showed that theta-alpha amplitude modulation frequency (f(am)) was associated with piTBS_Responder, which involves repetitive bursts delivered in the theta frequency range, whereas alpha carrier frequency (f(c)) was related to 10 Hz rTMS, which uses alpha rhythmic stimulation. In addition, theta-alpha amplitude modulation frequency was positively correlated with piTBS antidepressant efficacy, whereas the alpha frequency was not associated with the 10 Hz rTMS clinical outcome. The present study showed that TMS stimulation effects might be lasting, with changes of brain oscillations associated with the delivered frequency. Additionally, theta-alpha amplitude modulation frequency may be as a function of the degree of recovery in TRD with piTBS treatment and also a potential EEG-based predictor of antidepressant efficacy of piTBS in the early treatment stage, that is, first 2 weeks.

Despite the importance of walking, methodological limitations mean that surprisingly little is known about the neural and cognitive processes that support ambulatory motor control. Here, we report mobile EEG data recorded from 32 healthy young adults during real-world ambulatory obstacle avoidance. Participants walked along a path while stepping over expected and unexpected obstacles projected on the floor, allowing us to capture the dynamic oscillatory response to changes in environmental demands. Compared to obstacle-free walking, time-frequency analysis of the EEG data revealed clear neural markers of proactive and reactive forms of movement control (occurring before and after crossing an obstacle), visible as increases in frontal theta and centro-parietal beta power respectively. Critically, the temporal profile of changes in frontal theta allowed us to arbitrate between early selection and late adaptation mechanisms of proactive control. Our data show that motor plans are updated as soon as an upcoming obstacle appears, rather than when the obstacle is reached. In addition, regardless of whether motor plans required updating, a clear beta rebound was present after obstacles were crossed, reflecting the resetting of the motor system. Overall, mobile EEG recorded during real-world walking provides novel insight into the cognitive and neural basis of dynamic motor control in humans, suggesting new routes to the monitoring and rehabilitation of motor disorders such as dyspraxia and Parkinson's disease.

The goal of this study was to compare an envelope-based (i.e. Amplitude Envelope Correlation, AEC) and a phase-based (i.e. weighted Phase Lag Index, wPLI) measure of FC in their classification of states of consciousness. Nine healthy participants underwent a three-hour experimental anesthetic protocol with propofol induction and isoflurane maintenance, in which five minutes of 128-channel electroencephalography were recorded before, during, and after anestheticinduced unconsciousness, at the following time points: Baseline; light sedation with propofol (Light Sedation); deep unconsciousness following three hours of surgical levels of anesthesia with isoflurane (Unconscious); five minutes prior to the recovery of consciousness (Pre-ROC); and three hours following the recovery of consciousness (Recovery). Support vector machine classification was applied to the source-localized EEG in the alpha (8-13 Hz) frequency band in order to investigate the ability of AEC and wPLI (separately and together) to discriminate i) the four states from Baseline; ii) Unconscious ("deep" unconsciousness) vs. Pre-ROC ("light" unconsciousness); and iii) responsiveness (Baseline, Light Sedation, Recovery) vs. unresponsiveness (Unconscious, Pre-ROC). AEC and wPLI yielded different patterns of global connectivity across states of consciousness, with AEC showing the strongest network connectivity during the Unconscious epoch, and wPLI showing the strongest connectivity during full consciousness (i.e., Baseline and Recovery). Both measures also demonstrated differential predictive contributions across participants and used different brain regions for classification. AEC showed higher classification accuracy overall, particularly for distinguishing anesthetic-induced unconsciousness from Baseline (83.7 +/- 0.8%). AEC also showed stronger classification accuracy than wPLI when distinguishing Unconscious from Pre-ROC (i.e., "deep" from "light" unconsciousness) (AEC: 66.3 +/- 1.2%; wPLI: 56.2 +/- 1.3%), and when distinguishing between responsiveness and unresponsiveness (AEC: 76.0 +/- 1.3%; wPLI: 63.6 +/- 1.8%). Classification accuracy was not improved compared to AEC when both AEC and wPLI were combined. This analysis of source-localized EEG data demonstrates that envelope- and phase-based FC provide different information about states of consciousness but that, on a group level, AEC is better able to detect relative alterations in brain FC across levels of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness compared to wPLI.

Schizophrenia Classification Using Resting State EEG Functional Connectivity: Source Level Outperforms Sensor Level	2021 43RD ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE & BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (IEEE EMBC)	NOV 01-05, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, IEEE, Elsevier, Inst Engn & Technol			BRAIN NETWORKS	Disrupted functional and structural connectivity measures have been used to distinguish schizophrenia patients from healthy controls. Classification methods based on functional connectivity derived from EEG signals are limited by the volume conduction problem. Recorded time series at scalp electrodes capture a mixture of common sources signals, resulting in spurious connections. We have transformed sensor level resting state EEG times series to source level EEG signals utilizing a source reconstruction method. Functional connectivity networks were calculated by computing phase lag values between brain regions at both the sensor and source level. Brain complex network analysis was used to extract features and the best features were selected by a feature selection method. A logistic regression classifier was used to distinguish schizophrenia patients from healthy controls at five different frequency bands. The best classifier performance was based on connectivity measures derived from the source space and the theta band.

First, we use continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to get the time-frequency representation (TFR) of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals on each channel and extract rich information from different frequency bands for subsequent analysis. Brain networks are then constructed in multiple bands to characterize the spatial connections hidden in the multichannel EEG signals. Based on brain networks, we further develop core brain networks through a set of key nodes determined by DE. These core brain networks are associated with brain activities and differ markedly between different emotional states. The final designed MCNN model takes DE features and core brain networks as inputs for emotion recognition. We evaluate our method on the SITU emotion EEG dataset, and the average accuracy of 15 subjects achieves 91.45%. Utilizing the complementary features of DE and brain network, the proposed method provides an efficient framework for accurate emotion recognition from EEG signals.

To evaluate the feasibility of an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based prediction model as a CPR feedback indicator of high- or low-CBF carotid blood flow (CBF), the frontal EEG and hemodynamic data including CBF were measured during animal experiments with a ventricular fibrillation (VF) swine model. The most significant 10 EEG parameters in the time, frequency and entropy domains were determined by neighborhood component analysis and Student's t-test for discriminating high- or low-CBF recovery with a division criterion of 30%. As a binary CBF classifier, the performances of logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor, random forest and multilayer perceptron algorithms were compared with eight-fold cross-validation. The three-order polynomial kernel-based SVM model showed the best accuracy of 0.853. The sensitivity, specificity, F1 score and area under the curve of the SVM model were 0.807, 0.906, 0.853 and 0.909, respectively. An automated CBF classifier derived from non-invasive EEG is feasible as a potential indicator of the CBF recovery during CPR in a VF swine model.

Methods: Overnight polysomnography recordings were obtained from 33 healthy individuals. The relative spectral powers of five frequency bands, three ECG morphological features and respiratory rate were obtained from six EEG channels, ECG, and oronasal airflow, respectively. The synchronous feature series were interpolated to 1 Hz to retain the high time-resolution required to detect rapid physiological variations. CNS-cardiorespiratory interaction networks were built for each EEG channel and a directionality analysis was conducted using multivariate transfer entropy. Finally, the difference in interaction between Deep, Light, and REM sleep (DS, LS, and REM) was studied. Results: Bidirectional interactions existed in central-cardiorespiratory networks, and the dominant direction was from the cardiorespiratory system to the brain during all sleep stages. Sleep stages had evident influence on these interactions, with the strength of information transfer from heart rate and respiration rate to the brain gradually increasing with the sequence of REM, LS, and DS. Furthermore, the occipital lobe appeared to receive the most input from the cardiorespiratory system during LS. Finally, different ECG morphological features were found to be involved with various central-cardiac and cardiac-respiratory interactions. Conclusion: These findings reveal detailed information regarding CNS-cardiorespiratory interactions during sleep and provide new insights into understanding of sleep control mechanisms. Significance: Our approach may facilitate the investigation of the pathological cardiorespiratory complications of sleep disorders.

Interpersonal synchrony of many rhythmic (periodic) behaviors displays dynamics of coupled biological oscillators. The current study addresses oscillatory dynamics on the levels of brain and behavior between music duet partners performing at spontaneous (uncued) rates. Wireless EEG was measured from N = 20 pairs of pianists as they performed a melody first in Solo performance (at their spontaneous rate of performance), and then in Duet performances at each partner's spontaneous rate. Influences of partners' spontaneous rates on interpersonal synchrony were assessed by correlating differences in partners' spontaneous rates of Solo performance with Duet tone onset asynchronies. Coupling between partners' neural oscillations was assessed by correlating amplitude envelope fluctuations of cortical oscillations at the Duet performance frequency between observed partners and between surrogate (re-paired) partners, who performed the same melody but at different times. Duet synchronization was influenced by partners' spontaneous rates in Solo performance. The size and direction of the difference in partners' spontaneous rates were mirrored in the size and direction of the Duet asynchronies. Moreover, observed Duet partners showed greater inter-brain correlations of oscillatory amplitude fluctuations than did surrogate partners, suggesting that performing in synchrony with a musical partner is reflected in coupled cortical dynamics at the performance frequency. The current study provides evidence that dynamics of oscillator coupling are reflected in both behavioral and neural measures of temporal coordination during musical joint action.

Alpha and broadband high-frequency activity track task dynamics and predict performance in controlled decision-making	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						decision-making; iEEG; oscillation; time frequency analyses	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; POWER; EEG; HUMANS; INTERFERENCE; POTENTIALS; INHIBITION; CONFLICT; THETA	Intracranial recordings in human subjects provide a unique, fine-grained temporal and spatial resolution inaccessible to conventional non-invasive methods. A prominent signal in these recordings is broadband high-frequency activity (approx. 70-150 Hz), generally considered to reflect neuronal excitation. Here we explored the use of this broadband signal to track, on a single-trial basis, the temporal and spatial distribution of task-engaged areas involved in decision-making. We additionally focused on the alpha rhythm (8-14 Hz), thought to regulate the (dis)engagement of neuronal populations based on task demands. Using these signals, we characterized activity across cortex using intracranial recordings in patients with intractable epilepsy performing the Multi-Source Interference Task, a Stroop-like decision-making paradigm. We analyzed recordings both from grid electrodes placed over cortical areas including frontotemporal and parietal cortex, and depth electrodes in prefrontal regions, including cingulate cortex. We found a widespread negative relationship between alpha power and broadband activity, substantiating the gating role of alpha in regions beyond sensory/motor cortex. Combined, these signals reflect the spatio-temporal pattern of task-engagement, with alpha decrease signifying task-involved regions and broadband increase temporally locking to specific task aspects, distributed over cortical sites. We report sites that only respond to stimulus presentation or to the decision report and, interestingly, sites that reflect the time-on-task. The latter predict the subject's reaction times on a trial-by-trial basis. A smaller subset of sites showed modulation with task condition. Taken together, alpha and broadband signals allow tracking of neuronal population dynamics across cortex on a fine temporal and spatial scale.

Methods This prospective randomized trial (NCT03745092) enrolled 50 cases of CCI patients, which were divided into NBO (8 L/min of oxygen supplement) group and control group (room air) randomly, and also enrolled 21 healthy volunteers. Two times of 30-min EEG recordings with the interval of 45min of NBO or room air were analyzed quantitatively. Results The CCI-mediated EEG presented with two patterns of electrical activities: high-power oscillations (high-power EEG, n = 26) and paroxysmal slow activities under the normal-power background (normal-power EEG, n = 24). The fronto-central absolute power (AP) of the beta, alpha, theta, and delta in the high-power EEG was higher than that in healthy EEG (p < 0.05). The fronto-central theta/alpha, delta/alpha and (delta + theta)/(alpha + beta) ratios in the normal-power EEG were higher than those in healthy EEG (p < 0.05). The high-power EEG in NBO group had higher fronto-central AP reduction rates than those in control group (p < 0.05). NBO remarkably reduced the fronto-central theta/alpha, delta/alpha, and (delta + theta)/(alpha + beta) ratios in the normal-power EEG (p < 0.05). Conclusions NBO rapidly ameliorates CCI-mediated EEG anomalies, including attenuation of the abnormal high-power oscillations and the paroxysmal slow activities associated with CCI.

Methods: Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during the performance of a task, which evaluates the ability to use predictive information in order to facilitate predictable versus random target detection. We evaluated EEG event-related directed connectivity, in patients with schizophrenia (SZ), major depressive disorder (MDD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), compared with healthy age-matched controls. Directed connectivity was evaluated using phase transfer entropy. Results: We showed that top-down frontal-parietal connectivity was weaker in SZ (theta and beta bands) and ASD (alpha band) compared to control subjects, during the processing of stimuli consisting of the predictive sequence. In SZ patients, top-down connectivity was also attenuated, during the processing of predictive targets in the beta frequency band. In contrast, compared with controls, MDD patients displayed an increased top-down flow of information, during the processing of predicted targets (alpha band). Conclusions: The findings suggest that top-down frontal-parietal connectivity is altered differentially across three major psychiatric disorders, specifically during the processing of predictive stimuli. Significance: Altered top-down connectivity may contribute to the specific prediction deficits observed in each of the patient populations.

In clinical practice, the recurrence risk is estimated by the treating physician using the neurological examination, brain imaging, a thorough history for risk factors, and routine scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) to detect abnormal epileptiform activity. The decision to use antiseizure medication can be challenging when objective findings are missing. There is a need for new biomarkers to better diagnose epilepsy following a first seizure. Recently, an EEG-based novel analytical method was reported to detect paroxysmal slowing in the cortical network of patients with epilepsy. The aim of our study is to test this method's sensitivity and specificity to predict epilepsy following a first seizure. Methods We analyzed interictal EEGs of 70 patients admitted to the emergency department of a tertiary referral center after a first seizure. Clinical data from a follow-up period of at least 18 months were available. EEGs of 30 healthy controls were also analyzed and included. For each EEG, we applied an automated algorithm to detect paroxysmal slow wave events (PSWEs). Results Of patients presenting with a first seizure, 40% had at least one additional recurring seizure and were diagnosed with epilepsy. Sixty percent did not report additional seizures. A significantly higher occurrence of PSWEs was detected in the first interictal EEG test of those patients who were eventually diagnosed with epilepsy. Conducting the EEG test within 72 h after the first seizure significantly increased the likelihood of detecting PSWEs and the predictive value for epilepsy up to 82%. Significance The quantification of PSWEs by an automated algorithm can predict epilepsy and help the neurologist in evaluating a patient with a first seizure.

It turned out, however, to be highly non-trivial to remove the strong stimulation signal, including its harmonic and non-harmonic distortions, as well as various induced higher-order artifacts from the EEG data recorded during the stimulation. In this paper, we discuss some of the problems encountered and present methodological approaches aimed at overcoming them. To illustrate the mechanisms of artifact induction and the proposed removal strategies, we use data obtained with the help of a schematic demonstrator setup as well as human-subject data.

The aim of this study is to characterize the functional brain network alterations in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). To this end, rsEEG signals were recorded before and after a cognitive task. Functional connectivity metrics were calculated using debiased weighted phase lag index (DWPLI). Topological features of the functional connectivity network were analyzed using both the classical graph approach and minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm. Subsequently, the network and connectivity values together with Mini-Mental State Examination cognitive test were used as features to classify the participants. Results showed that: (1) across the pre-task condition, in the theta band, the aMCI group had a significantly lower global mean DWPLI than the control group; the functional connectivity patterns were different in the left hemisphere between two groups; the aMCI group showed significantly higher average clustering coefficient and the remarkably lower global efficiency than the control. (2) Analysis of graph measures under post-task resting state, unveiled that for the percentage change of post-task vs. pre-task in beta EEG, a significant increase in tree hierarchy was observed in aMCI group (2.41%) than in normal control (-3.89%); (3) Furthermore, the classification analysis of combined measures of functional connectivity, brain topology, and MMSE test showed improved accuracy compared to the single method, for which the connectivity patterns and graph metrics were used as separate inputs. The classification accuracy obtained for the case of post-task resting state was 87.2%, while the one achieved under pre-task resting state was found to be 77.7%. Therefore, the functional network alterations in aMCI patients were more prominent during the post-task resting state. This study suggests that the disintegration observed in MCI functional network during the resting states, preceding and following a task, might be possible biomarkers of cognitive dysfunction in aMCI patients.

Our study aimed to analyze electroencephalography (EEG) FC and network differences in the alpha and beta frequency band during visuospatial memory maintenance between Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients and healthy elderly with subjective memory complaints. Methods: Functional connectivity and network structure of 17 MCI patients and 20 control participants were studied with 128-channel EEG during a visuospatial memory task with varying memory load. FC between EEG channels was measured by amplitude envelope correlation with leakage correction (AEC-c), while network analysis was performed by applying the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) approach, which reconstructs the critical backbone of the original network. Results: Memory load (increasing number of to-be-learned items) enhanced the mean AEC-c in the control group in both frequency bands. In contrast to that, after an initial increase, the MCI group showed significantly (p < 0.05) diminished FC in the alpha band in the highest memory load condition, while in the beta band this modulation was absent. Moreover, mean alpha and beta AEC-c correlated significantly with the size of medial temporal lobe structures in the entire sample. The network analysis revealed increased maximum degree, betweenness centrality, and degree divergence, and decreased diameter and eccentricity in the MCI group compared to the control group in both frequency bands independently of the memory load. This suggests a rerouted network in the MCI group with a more centralized topology and a more unequal traffic load distribution. Conclusion: Alpha- and beta-band FC measured by AEC-c correlates with cognitive load-related modulation, with subtle medial temporal lobe atrophy, and with the disruption of hippocampal fiber integrity in the earliest stages of cognitive decline. The more integrated network topology of the MCI group is in line with the "hub overload and failure" framework and might be part of a compensatory mechanism or a consequence of neural disinhibition.

J	Bosch, TJ; Groth, C; Singh, A				Bosch, Taylor J.; Groth, Christopher; Singh, Arun			Resting-State Low-Frequency Cerebellar Oscillations Can Be Abnormal in Parkinson's Disease	CEREBELLUM			English	Article; Early Access						Rest; Cerebellum; EEG; Parkinson's disease; Oscillations		Recent anatomical studies have shown connections between the basal ganglia and the cerebellum. The basal ganglia and cerebellum are major subcortical structures that influence motor and cognitive functions. Recent neuroimaging and animal studies have suggested the role of the cerebellum in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. However, the role of cerebellar oscillations in PD has not been studied. Here, we recruited 75 PD and 39 healthy control subjects to collect cerebellar EEG during a resting-state condition. We followed the recently published protocols to collect cerebellar oscillations. Relative spectral power was computed in the delta, theta, beta, and gamma frequency bands. Further, we performed classifier methods to differentiate PD subjects from controls. We observed significantly increased theta-band (4-7 Hz) relative power in the cerebellar electrodes in PD subjects compared to controls. We also found differences in different frequency bands between mid-cerebellar and nearby mid-occipital EEG signals. Classification analysis using mid-cerebellar theta relative power showed differentiation between PD and control groups. Our results demonstrate that in addition to established cortical and basal ganglia oscillations, abnormal cerebellar oscillations in the theta-band may also participate in the underlying pathophysiology of PD. We suggest that low-frequency cerebellar oscillations may be a potential target for non-invasive neuromodulation to improve PD symptoms.

Noise amplification precedes extreme epileptic events on human EEG	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article								Extreme events are rare and sudden abnormal deviations of the system's behavior from a typical state. Statistical analysis reveals that if the time series contains extreme events, its distribution has a heavy tail. In dynamical systems, extreme events often occur due to developing instability preceded by noise amplification. Here, we apply this theory to analyze generalized epileptic seizures in the human brain. First, we demonstrate that the time series of electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral power in a frequency band of 1-5 Hz obeys a heavy-tailed distribution, confirming the presence of extreme events. Second, we report that noise on EEG signals gradually increases before the seizure onset. Thus, we hypothesize that generalized epileptic seizures in humans are the extreme events emerging from instability accompanied by preictal noise amplification similar to other dynamical systems.

Improvement of human error prediction accuracy in single-trial analysis of electroencephalogram	2021 43RD ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE & BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (IEEE EMBC)	NOV 01-05, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, IEEE, Elsevier, Inst Engn & Technol			FAILURE	The prevention of human error is an important task that has already been researched. Previous studies have shown that EEG signals can predict the occurrence of human errors. However, high accuracy has not yet been achieved in a single-trial analysis. This study is aimed to improve the accuracy of single-trial analysis, and propose a method for anomaly detection with auto encoder(AE). In the experiment, we conducted "Press the button(Go)" or "Do nothing(No-Go)" according to the visual stimulus and analyzed the EEG signal from -1000 ms to 0 ms when the stimulus was displayed. We prepared two types of inputs, time series data and frequency spectrum, and an AE was trained to reconstruct the inputs. We then calculated the difference between the reconstructed data and input data and predicted human error by its largeness. In the prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on the frequency spectrum, some over-fitting occurred and the average accuracy was 43 %. In the prediction using anomaly detection with frequency spectrum was 53 % and could not be classified. The time series data was 63 % which improved the accuracy. A previous study has shown frequency-dependent features such as -band activity and rhythm, as precursors of human error. However, in single-trial analysis, we obtained a higher accuracy by time series data than when by using the frequency spectrum. However, there was no noticeable difference between SVM and anomaly detection methods other than over-fitting. Therefore, in this case, the improvement in accuracy by the anomaly detection method could not be confirmed. However, the result suggests that it is more effective to use the frequency spectrum than the time series data in the single-trial analysis in the future.

Electroencephalography (EEG) cleaning has been a longstanding issue in the research community. In recent times, huge leaps have been made in the field, resulting in very promising techniques to address the issue. The most widespread ones rely on a family of mathematical methods known as blind source separation (BSS), ideally capable of separating artefactual signals from the brain originated ones. However, corruption of EEG data still remains a problem, especially in real life scenario where a mixture of artefact components affects the signal and thus correctly choosing the correct cleaning procedure can be non trivial. Our aim is here to evaluate and score the plethora of available BSS-based cleaning methods, providing an overview of their advantages and downsides and of their best field of application. Approach. To address this, we here first characterized and modeled different types of artefact, i.e. arising from muscular or blinking activity as well as from transcranial alternate current stimulation. We then tested and scored several BSS-based cleaning procedures on semi-synthetic datasets corrupted by the previously modeled noise sources. Finally, we built a lifelike dataset affected by many artefactual components. We tested an iterative multistep approach combining different BSS steps, aimed at sequentially removing each specific artefactual component. Main results. We did not find an overall best method, as different scenarios require different approaches. We therefore provided an overview of the performance in terms of both reconstruction accuracy and computational burden of each method in different use cases. Significance. Our work provides insightful guidelines for signal cleaning procedures in the EEG related field.

Sleep disorders are medical disorders of a subject's sleep architecture and based on their severity, they can interfere with mental, emotional and physical functioning. The most common ones are insomnia, narcolepsy, sleep apnea, bruxism, etc. There is an increased risk of developing sleep disorders in elderly like insomnia, periodic leg movements, rapid eye movement behavior disorders, sleep disorder breathing, etc. Consequently, their accurate diagnosis and classification are important steps towards an early stage treatment that could save the life of a patient. Approach. The electroencephalographic (EEG) signal is the most sensitive and important biosignal, which is able to capture the brain sleep activity that is sensitive to sleep. In this study, we attempt to analyze EEG sleep activity via complementary cross-frequency coupling (CFC) estimates, which further feed a classifier, aiming to discriminate sleep disorders. We adopted an open EEG database with recordings that were grouped into seven sleep disorders and a healthy control. The EEG brain activity from common sensors has been analyzed with two basic types of CFC. Main results. Finally, a random forest (RF) classification model was built on CFC patterns, which were extracted from non-cyclic alternating pattern epochs. Our RFCFC model achieved a 74% multiclass accuracy. Both types of CFC, phase-to-amplitude and amplitude-amplitude coupling patterns contribute to the accuracy of the RF model, thus supporting their complementary information. Significance. CFC patterns, in conjunction with the RF classifier proved a valuable biomarker for the classification of sleep disorders.

This so-called semantic congruence effect has been broadly studied in healthy young adults with a focus on neural encoding mechanisms. However, the impacts on retrieval, and possible impairments during healthy aging, which is typically associated with changes in declarative long-term memory, remain unclear. To investigate these issues, we used a previously established paradigm in healthy young and older humans with a focus on the neural activity at a final retrieval stage as measured with electroencephalography (EEG). In both age groups, semantic congruence at encoding enhanced subsequent long-term recognition memory of words. Compatible with this observation, semantic congruence led to differences in event-related potentials (ERPs) at retrieval, and this effect was not modulated by age. Specifically, congruence modulated old/new ERPs at a fronto-central (Fz) and left parietal (P3) electrode in a late (400-600 ms) time window, which has previously been associated with recognition memory processes. Importantly, ERPs to old items also correlated with the positive effect of semantic congruence on long-term memory independent of age. Together, our findings suggest that semantic congruence drives subsequent recognition memory across the lifespan through changes in neural retrieval processes.</p>	[Alejandro, Ricardo J.; Packard, Pau A.; Steiger, Tineke K.; Bunzeck, Nico] Univ Lubeck, Dept Psychol, Lubeck, Germany; [Alejandro, Ricardo J.] Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Psychol, Ghent, Belgium; [Packard, Pau A.] Univ Pompeu Fabra Roc Boronat, Ctr Brain & Cognit, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Barcelona, Spain; [Fuentemilla, Lluis] Hosp Llobregat, Bellvitge Biomed Res Inst IDIBELL, Cognit & Brain Plast Grp, Barcelona, Spain; [Fuentemilla, Lluis] Univ Barcelona, Dept Cognit Dev & Educ Psychol, Barcelona, Spain; [Fuentemilla, Lluis] Univ Barcelona, Inst Neurosci, Barcelona, Spain; [Bunzeck, Nico] Univ Lubeck, Ctr Brain Behav & Metab CBBM, Ratzeburger Allee, Lubeck, Germany		Alejandro, RJ; Bunzeck, N (corresponding author), Univ Lubeck, Dept Psychol, Lubeck, Germany.; Alejandro, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Expt Psychol, Ghent, Belgium.; Bunzeck, N (corresponding author), Univ Lubeck, Ctr Brain Behav & Metab CBBM, Ratzeburger Allee, Lubeck, Germany.	ricardo.alejandrobenavides@UGent.be; nico.bunzeck@uni-luebeck.de		Packard, Pau/0000-0003-4795-5704; Bunzeck, Nico/0000-0001-8834-450X	German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) [BU 2670/7-1, 2670/7-2]	German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)(German Research Foundation (DFG))	This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Grant BU 2670/7-1 and 2670/7-2 to NB).		115	1	1	3	5	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND	1663-4365			FRONT AGING NEUROSCI	Front.

Modulation of recognition memory performance by light and its relationship with cortical EEG theta and gamma activities	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Light intensity; Recognition memory performance; EEG theta; EEG gamma; Mice	BEHAVIORAL-INHIBITION; BRIGHT LIGHT; TRANSIENT DECLINE; BODY-TEMPERATURE; WAVE ACTIVITY; EXPOSURE; SLEEP; BRAIN; ALERTNESS; OSCILLATIONS	Acute exposure to light exerts widespread effects on physiology, in addition to its key role in photoentrainment. Although the modulatory effect of light on physiological arousal is well demonstrated in mice, its effect on memory performance is inconclusive, as the direction of the effect depends on the nature of the behavioural task employed and/or the type of stimulus utilised. Moreover, in all rodent studies that reported significant effects of light on performance, brain activity was not assessed during the task and thus it is unclear how brain activity was modulated by light or the exact relationship between light-modulated brain activity and performance. Here we examine the modulatory effects of light of varying intensities on recognition memory performance and frontoparietal waking electroencephalography (EEG) in mice using the spontaneous recognition memory task. We report a light-intensity-dependent disruptive effect on recognition memory performance at the group level, but inspection of individual-level data indicates that light-intensity-dependent facilitation is observed in some cases. Using linear mixed-effects models, we then demonstrate that EEG fast theta (0) activity at the time of encoding negatively predicts recognition memory performance, whereas slow gamma (gamma) activity at the time of retrieval positively predicts performance. These relationships between 0/gamma activity and performance are strengthened by increasing light intensity. Thus, light modulates 0 and gamma band activities involved in attentional and mnemonic processes, thereby affecting recognition memory performance. However, extraneous factors including the phase of the internal clock at which light is presented and homeostatic sleep pressure may determine how photic input is translated into behavioural performance.

J	Alsuradi, H; Park, W; Eid, M				Alsuradi, Haneen; Park, Wanjoo; Eid, Mohamad			Midfrontal theta oscillation encodes haptic delay	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PREDICTION ERRORS; EEG DYNAMICS; BETA; FEEDBACK; SYNCHRONIZATION; MODULATION; ADAPTATION; MOVEMENTS; RESPONSES; SIGNALS	Haptic technologies aim to simulate tactile or kinesthetic interactions with a physical or virtual environment in order to enhance user experience and/or performance. However, due to stringent communication and computational needs, the user experience is influenced by delayed haptic feedback. While delayed feedback is well understood in the visual and auditory modalities, little research has systematically examined the neural correlates associated with delayed haptic feedback. In this paper, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to study sensory and cognitive neural correlates caused by haptic delay during passive and active tasks performed using a haptic device and a computer screen. Results revealed that theta power oscillation was significantly higher at the midfrontal cortex under the presence of haptic delay. Sensory correlates represented by beta rebound were found to be similar in the passive task and different in the active task under the delayed and synchronous conditions. Additionally, the event related potential (ERP) P200 component is modulated under the haptic delay condition during the passive task. The P200 amplitude significantly reduced in the last 20% of trials during the passive task and in the absence of haptic delay. Results suggest that haptic delay could be associated with increased cognitive control processes including multi-sensory divided attention followed by conflict detection and resolution with an earlier detection during the active task.

Although evidence suggests sex differences in fear recall and extinction recall, there are currently no human studies examining the oscillatory foundations of these memory processes separately in men and women. METHODS: Because previous studies suggest that estradiol partially mediates these sex differences, we examined 20 men (low estradiol and low progesterone), 20 women using oral contraceptives (low estradiol and low progesterone), and 20 free-cycling women during midcycle (high estradiol and low progesterone). We used a fear conditioning procedure, allowing us to separately assess fear recall and extinction recall 24 hours after fear and extinction learning. Skin conductance responses and electroencephalography were recorded during fear recall and extinction recall, and prefrontal oscillations were source localized. RESULTS: We found elevated fear expression during fear recall and impaired extinction recall, as indicated by increased peripheral arousal (skin conductance responses) and fronto-central theta oscillations, source localized in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Importantly, peripheral arousal and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex theta oscillations were stronger in men and women on oral contraceptives than in women from the midcycle group. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that neural oscillatory and peripheral correlates of heightened fear expression during fear recall and (impaired) extinction recall do not simply differ between sexes but depend on hormonal fluctuations within women.

Studies suggest that linguistic symbols expressing conceptual categories ('apple', 'squirrel') make us focus on categorical information (e.g. that you saw a squirrel) and disregard individual information (e.g. whether that squirrel had a long or short tail). Across two experiments with preverbal infants, we demonstrated that it is not language but nonverbal category knowledge that determines what information is packed into object representations. Twelve-month-olds (N = 48) participated in an electroencephalography (EEG) change-detection task involving objects undergoing a brief occlusion. When viewing objects from unfamiliar categories, infants detected both across- and within-category changes, as evidenced by their negative central wave (Nc) event-related potential. Conversely, when viewing objects from familiar categories, they did not respond to within-category changes, which indicates that nonverbal category knowledge interfered with the representation of individual surface features necessary to detect such changes. Furthermore, distinct patterns of gamma and alpha oscillations between familiar and unfamiliar categories were evident before and during occlusion, suggesting that categorization had an influence on the format of recruited object representations. Thus, we show that nonverbal category knowledge has rapid and enduring effects on object representation and discuss their functional significance for generic knowledge acquisition in the absence of language.

Studies deploying spectral analysis consistently reported an increase of spectral power in the lower frequencies with increasing time-on-task, whereas event-related studies observed decreases in various measures related to task engagement and attentional resources. The results from these two lines of research cannot be aligned easily. (Frontal) theta power has been linked to cognitive control and was found to increase with time-on-task. In contrast, theoretical frameworks on mental fatigue suggest a decline in task-engagement as causal for the performance decline observed in mental fatigue. The goal of the present study was to investigate mental fatigue in time-frequency space using linear regression on single-trial data in order to obtain a better understanding about how time-on-task affects theta oscillatory activity. A data-driven analysis approach indicated an increase of alpha and theta power during the intertrial interval. In contrast, task-related theta activity declined. This reduction of stimulus-locked theta power may be interpreted as a reduction of task engagement with increasing mental fatigue. The increase of theta spectral power in the intertrial interval, moreover, could possibly be explained by an increased idling of cognitive control networks. Alternatively, it might be the case that the increase of theta power with time-on-task is a by-product an alpha power increase. As alpha peak frequency systematically decreases with time-on-task, the theta band might be affected as well.

Participants completed the LSBQ, which quantifies language use and crucially the division of labor of dual-language use in diverse activities and settings over the lifespan. We hypothesized correlations between the degree of active bilingualism with power of neural oscillations in specific frequency bands. Moreover, we anticipated levels of mean coherence (connectivity between brain regions) to vary by degree of bilingual language experience. Results demonstrated effects of Age of L2/2L1 onset on high beta and gamma powers. Higher usage of the non-societal language at home and society modulated indices of functional connectivity in theta, alpha and gamma frequencies. Results add to the emerging literature on the neuromodulatory effects of bilingualism for rs-EEG, and are in line with claims that bilingualism effects are modulated by degree of engagement with dual-language experiential factors.

J	Tsai, CC; Liang, WK				Tsai, Chong-Chih; Liang, Wei-Kuang			Event-related components are structurally represented by intrinsic event-related potentials	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; FACE PERCEPTION; WORKING-MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS	The detection of event-related potentials (ERPs) through electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis is a well-established method for understanding brain functions during a cognitive process. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and stationarity of the data, ERPs are often filtered to a wideband frequency range, such as 0.05-30 Hz. Alternatively, a natural-filtering procedure can be performed through empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which yields intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) for each trial of the EEG data, followed by averaging over trials to generate the event-related modes. However, although the EMD-based filtering procedure has advantages such as a high SNR, suitable waveform shape, and high statistical power, one fundamental drawback of the procedure is that it requires the selection of an IMF (or a partial sum of a range of IMFs) to determine an ERP component effectively. Therefore, in this study, we propose an intrinsic ERP (iERP) method to overcome the drawbacks and retain the advantages of event-related mode analysis for investigating ERP components. The iERP method can reveal multiple ERP components at their characteristic time scales and suitably cluster statistical effects among modes by using a tailored definition of each mode's neighbors. We validated the iERP method by using realistic EEG data sets acquired from a face perception task and visual working memory task. By using these two data sets, we demonstrated how to apply the iERP method to a cognitive task and incorporate existing cluster-based tests into iERP analysis. Moreover, iERP analysis revealed the statistical effects between (or among) experimental conditions more effectively than the conventional ERP method did.

Response certainty during bimanual movements reduces gamma oscillations in primary motor cortex	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BETA-DESYNCHRONIZATION; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; SEPARATION; FREQUENCY; EEG; MEG	Even when movement outputs are identical, the neural responses supporting them might differ substantially in order to adapt to changing environmental contexts. Despite the essential nature of this adaptive capacity of the human motor system, little is known regarding the effects of contextual response (un)certainty on the neural dynamics known to serve motor processing. In this study, we use a novel bimanual motor task and neuroimaging with magnetoencephalography (MEG) to examine the effects of contextual response certainty on the dynamic neural responses that are important for proper movement. Significant neural responses were identified in the time-frequency domain at the sensor-level and imaged to the cortex using a spectrally resolved beamformer. Combined frequentist and Bayesian statistical testing between neural motor responses under certain and uncertain conditions indicated evidence for no conditional effect on the peri-movement beta desynchronization (18 - 28 Hz; -100 to 300 ms). In contrast, the movement-related gamma synchronization (MRGS; 66 - 86 Hz; -50 to 150 ms) exhibited a robust effect of motor certainty, such that increased contextual response certainty reduced the amplitude of this response. Interestingly, the peak frequency of the MRGS was unaffected by response certainty. These findings both advance our understanding of the neural processes required to adapt our movements under altered environmental contexts, and support the growing conceptualization of the MRGS as being reflective of ongoing higher cognitive processes during movement execution.

A delay unit and a gain unit were added to the Wendling model to fit EEG signals in the time domain. An optimal parameter set minimising the error between observed and simulated EEG was identified using a genetic algorithm. To compare the inhibition and excitation during the ictal and interictal periods, the model parameters were determined for two sets of EEG signals using the proposed method. The results show that the model with identified parameters can simulate the real EEG signal well, with a mean square error of 0.0315-0.2138. Fifty repetitions for every selected EEG signal showed that the dispersion of the identified parameters was small in most cases, and the identification procedure generally showed similar values. Comparison of the model parameters of seizure and non-seizure EEG signals showed enhanced excitability, attenuated inhibition, and a more concentrated energy distribution in the frequency domain during the ictal periods. The experimental results for long-term EEG signals revealed continuous changes in the model parameters during epileptic seizures.

Abnormal sleep physiology in children with 15q11.2-13.1 duplication (Dup15q) syndrome	MOLECULAR AUTISM			English	Article						Dup15q syndrome; Autism; Sleep; EEG; GABA(A)R; UBE3A; Spindles; Slow wave sleep; Biomarkers	GABA(A) RECEPTOR SUBTYPE; SYNDROME PROTEIN UBE3A; ANGELMAN-SYNDROME; EEG ABNORMALITIES; SPINDLE ACTIVITY; BASAL FOREBRAIN; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; AUTISM; MEMORY; NEURONS	Background Sleep disturbances in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) represent a common and vexing comorbidity. Clinical heterogeneity amongst these warrants studies of the mechanisms associated with specific genetic etiologies. Duplications of 15q11.2-13.1 (Dup15q syndrome) are highly penetrant for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as intellectual disability and ASD, as well as sleep disturbances. Genes in the 15q region, particularly UBE3A and a cluster of GABA(A) receptor genes, are critical for neural development, synaptic protein synthesis and degradation, and inhibitory neurotransmission. During awake electroencephalography (EEG), children with Dup15q syndrome demonstrate increased beta band oscillations (12-30 Hz) that likely reflect aberrant GABAergic neurotransmission. Healthy sleep rhythms, necessary for robust cognitive development, are also highly dependent on GABAergic neurotransmission. We therefore hypothesized that sleep physiology would be abnormal in children with Dup15q syndrome. Methods To test the hypothesis that elevated beta oscillations persist in sleep in Dup15q syndrome and that NREM sleep rhythms would be disrupted, we computed: (1) beta power, (2) spindle density, and (3) percentage of slow-wave sleep (SWS) in overnight sleep EEG recordings from a cohort of children with Dup15q syndrome (n = 15) and compared them to age-matched neurotypical children (n = 12). Results Children with Dup15q syndrome showed abnormal sleep physiology with elevated beta power, reduced spindle density, and reduced or absent SWS compared to age-matched neurotypical controls. Limitations This study relied on clinical EEG where sleep staging was not available. However, considering that clinical polysomnograms are challenging to collect in this population, the ability to quantify these biomarkers on clinical EEG-routinely ordered for epilepsy monitoring-opens the door for larger-scale studies. While comparable to other human studies in rare genetic disorders, a larger sample would allow for examination of the role of seizure severity, medications, and developmental age that may impact sleep physiology. Conclusions We have identified three quantitative EEG biomarkers of sleep disruption in Dup15q syndrome, a genetic condition highly penetrant for ASD. Insights from this study not only promote a greater mechanistic understanding of the pathophysiology defining Dup15q syndrome, but also lay the foundation for studies that investigate the association between sleep and cognition. Abnormal sleep physiology may undermine healthy cognitive development and may serve as a quantifiable and modifiable target for behavioral and pharmacological interventions.

Neural Oscillatory Abnormalities During Gaze Processing in Schizophrenia: Evidence of Reduced Theta Phase Consistency and Inter- areal Theta-Gamma Coupling	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY-COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE AND NEUROIMAGING			English	Article							BAND ACTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MECHANISMS; EEG; PERCEPTION; BRAIN; EYE; SPECTRUM; INFORMATION; DYSFUNCTION	BACKGROUND: Abnormal gaze discrimination in schizophrenia (SZ) is associated with impairment in social functioning, but the neural mechanisms remain unclear. Evidence suggests that local neural oscillations and inter-areal communication through neural synchronization are critical physiological mechanisms supporting basic and complex cognitive processes. The roles of these mechanisms in abnormal gaze processing in SZ have not been investigated. The present study examined local neural oscillations and connectivity between anterior and bilateral posterior brain areas during gaze processing. METHODS: During electroencephalography recording, 28 participants with SZ and 34 healthy control participants completed a gaze discrimination task. Time-frequency decomposition of electroencephalography data was used to examine neural oscillatory power and intertrial phase consistency at bilateral posterior and midline anterior scalp sites. In addition, connectivity between these anterior and posterior sites, in terms of cross-frequency coupling between theta phase and gamma amplitude, was examined using the Kullback-Leibler Modulation Index. RESULTS: Participants with SZ showed reduced total power of theta-band activity relative to healthy control participants at all sites examined. This group difference could be accounted for by reduced intertrial phase consistency of theta activity in SZ participants, which was related to reduced gaze discrimination accuracy in SZ. In addition, SZ participants exhibited reduced Kullback-Leibler indexing, both feedforward and feedback connectivity, between the posterior and anterior sites. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that abnormal theta phase consistency and dysconnection between posterior face processing and anterior areas may underlie gaze processing deficits in SZ.

To examine whether tACS can actually improve tactile perception via alpha and gamma modulation, we measured the effects of 10-Hz and 70-Hz tACS (alpha- and gamma-tACS) on the left somatosensory cortex on right-finger tactile spatial orientation discrimination, and the associations between performance changes and individual alpha and gamma activities. Methods Fifteen neurologically healthy subjects were recruited into this study. Electroencephalography (EEG) was performed before the first day, to assess the normal alpha- and gamma-activity levels. A grating orientation discrimination task was performed before and during 10-Hz and 70-Hz tACS. Results The 10-Hz tACS protocol decreased the grating orientation discrimination threshold, primarily in subjects with low alpha event-related synchronization (ERS). In contrast, the 70-Hz tACS had no effect on the grating orientation discrimination threshold. Conclusions This study showed that 10-Hz tACS can improve tactile orientation discrimination in subjects with low alpha activity. Alpha-frequency tACS may help identify the contributions of these oscillations to other neurophysiological and pathological processes.

We developed a clinically feasible method that combines the phase synchrony index (PSI) with resting-state 19-channel electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate post-stroke motor impairment. In this study, we investigated whether our method could be applied to aphasia, a common post-stroke cognitive impairment. This study included 31 patients with subacute aphasia and 24 healthy controls. We assessed the expressive function of patients and calculated the PSIs of three motor language-related regions: frontofrontal, left frontotemporal, and right frontotemporal. Then, we evaluated post-stroke network alterations by comparing PSIs of the patients and controls and by analyzing the correlations between PSIs and aphasia scores. The frontofrontal PSI (beta band) was lower in patients than in controls and positively correlated with aphasia scores, whereas the right frontotemporal PSI (delta band) was higher in patients than in controls and negatively correlated with aphasia scores. Evaluation of artifacts suggests that this association is attributed to true synchrony rather than spurious synchrony. These findings suggest that post-stroke aphasia is associated with alternations of two different networks and point to the usefulness of EEG PSI in understanding the pathophysiology of aphasia.

Due to the distinct rhythmicity of these signals, undirected connectivity is typically assessed in the frequency domain. This leaves the investigator with two critical choices, namely a) the appropriate measure for spectral estimation (i.e., the transformation into the frequency domain) and b) the actual connectivity measure. As there is no consensus regarding best practice, a wide variety of methods has been applied. Here we systematically compare combinations of six standard spectral estimation methods (comprising fast Fourier and continuous wavelet transformation, bandpass filtering, and short-time Fourier transformation) and six connectivity measures (phase-locking value, Gaussian-Copula mutual information, Rayleigh test, weighted pairwise phase consistency, magnitude squared coherence, and entropy). We provide performance measures of each combination for simulated data (with precise control over true connectivity), a single-subject set of real MEG data, and a full group analysis of real MEG data. Our results show that, overall, WPPC and GCMI tend to outperform other connectivity measures, while entropy was the only measure sensitive to bimodal deviations from a uniform phase distribution. For group analysis, choosing the appropriate spectral estimation method appears to be more critical than the connectivity measure. We discuss practical implications (sampling rate, SNR, computation time, and data length) and aim to provide recommendations tailored to particular research questions.

Diagnostics and development of novel therapeutic approaches are, however, hampered by the lack of reliable quantitative biomarkers enabling prediction of clinical outcomes. EEG is considered as an optimal source of such data due to its broad availability, but traditional power spectral analysis was not designed for complex non-stationary EEG recordings with nonlinear nature, and therefore often fails as a diagnostic and prognostic tool for MDD. As brain activity is a highly complex, nonlinear and mostly irregular system, it can best be explained using the measures of multiple time-frequency resolution, especially the wavelet analysis, chaos theory and methods of nonlinear dynamics, such as fractal dimension or entropy. This non-conventional approach has proven to be highly sensitive to specific alterations of brain dynamics related to MDD. In this review, we consider the neurophysiological correlates of MDD, describe the different analytical approaches, ranging from the traditional ones to the highly innovative, and discuss their diagnostic relevance and practical utility. Our aim is to provide a current view of the complex determinants related to brain activity under MDD, and emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to neurophysiological signal processing.

However, the surgical environment, as well as the patient him/herself, generates electrical interferences that cause EEG waveform distortion. Case presentation A 52-year-old patient required general anesthesia due to the right femur necrotizing fasciitis. He had no history of epilepsy or head injury. His cardiovascular status was stable without arrhythmia under propofol and remifentanil anesthesia. The DOA was evaluated with Root (R) with SedLine (R) Brain Function Monitoring (Masimo Inc, Irvine, CA). The EEG showed a rhythmic, heart rate time-locked pulsation artifact, which diminished after electrode repositioning. Offline analysis revealed that the pulse wave-like interference in EEG was observed at the heart rate frequency. Conclusions We experienced an anesthesia case that involves a pulsation artifact generated by the superficial temporal artery contaminating the EEG signal. Numerous clinical conditions, including pulsation artifact, disturb anesthesia EEG.

Cannabis users demonstrate enhanced neural reactivity to reward: An event-related potential and time-frequency EEG study	ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS			English	Article						Cannabis; ERP; Marijuana; Reward positivity	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; NEUROIMAGING METAANALYSIS; REGION RESPONSIVITY; MARIJUANA USE; MONETARY; VULNERABILITY; ASSOCIATION; ACTIVATION; DEPRESSION; MOTIVATION	Introduction: Disruptions in neural measures of reward responsiveness are implicated in risk for and the development of Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) in general, but it is not clear if this is also true for Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD). To date, no studies have examined neural reward responsiveness in cannabis users using EEG. Methods: Cannabis users (CU; n = 67) and non-users (n = 60) were drawn from larger studies of individuals with and without internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Groups were matched on current and lifetime psychopathology. Participants completed a validated monetary reward task during electroencephalogram (EEG). One-way between subject analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models examined group differences in four EEG indicators of reward responsiveness - the reward positivity (RewP) and feedback negativity (FN) event-related potentials and two time-frequency measures (reward-related delta and loss-related theta). Results: CU demonstrated an enhanced RewP to the attainment of monetary reward compared to non-users (p = .004), even after controlling for relevant covariates. Secondary analyses found that occasional CU, but not current CUD or remitted CUD, showed enhanced RewP compared to non-users. There were no significant differences in FN, reward-related delta, or loss-related theta time-frequency measures between groups. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show preliminary evidence that CU have an enhanced RewP to reward and the extent of disruption may be related to CUD status.

In sharp contrast with the wide accessibility of the electroencephalogram (EEG) index of sleep homeostasis, an electrophysiological measure of the circadian modulation of sleep is still unavailable. Evidence suggests that sleep-spindle frequencies decelerate during biological night. In order to test the feasibility of measuring this marker in common polysomnographic protocols, the Budapest-Munich database of sleep records (N = 251 healthy subjects, 122 females, age range: 4-69 years), as well as an afternoon nap sleep record database (N = 112 healthy subjects, 30 females, age range: 18-30 years) were analysed by the individual adjustment method of sleep-spindle analysis. Slow and fast sleep-spindle frequencies were characterised by U-shaped overnight dynamics, with highest values in the first and the fourth-to-fifth sleep cycle and the lowest values in the middle of the sleeping period (cycles two to three). Age-related attenuation of sleep-spindle deceleration was evident. Estimated phases of the nadirs in sleep-spindle frequencies were advanced in children as compared to other age groups. Additionally, nap sleep spindles were faster than night sleep spindles (0.57 and 0.39 Hz difference for slow and fast types, respectively). The fine frequency resolution analysis of sleep spindles is a feasible method of measuring the assumed circadian modulation of sleep. Moreover, age-related attenuation of circadian sleep modulation might be measurable by assessing the overnight dynamics in sleep-spindle frequency. Phase of the minimal sleep-spindle frequency is a putative biomarker of chronotype.

Dissimilarity-based time-frequency distributions as features for epileptic EEG signal classification	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Epileptic seizure; EEG signals; Dissimilarity; Classification; ANN; SVM; LDA; k-NN; TFA; TFD; SPWV; SNR	SEIZURE DETECTION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; LEAST-SQUARES; REPRESENTATION; PATTERN; SIMILARITY; DOMAIN; MODEL	This work aims at exploring a general framework embedding techniques from classifiers, Time-Frequency Distributions (TFD) and dissimilarity measures for epileptic seizures detection. The proposed approach consists firstly in computing dissimilarities between TFD of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and secondly in using them to define a decision rule. Compared to the existing approaches, the proposed one uses entire TFD of EEG signals and does not require arbitrary feature extraction. Several dissimilarity measures and TFDs have been compared to select the most appropriate for EEG signals. Classifiers, such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) and k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), have been combined with the proposed approach. In order to evaluate the proposed approach, 13 different classification problems (including 2, 3 and 5-class) pertaining to five types of EEG signals have been used. The comparison between results obtained with the proposed approach and results reported in the literature with the same database of epileptic EEG signals demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach for seizure detection. Experimental results show that this approach has achieved highest accuracy in the most studied classification problems. A high value of 98% is achieved for the 5-class problem. Further, in most classification problems with 2 and 3-class, it also yields a satisfactory accuracy of approximately 100%. The robustness of the proposed approach is evaluated with the addition of noise to the EEG signals at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The experimental results show that this approach has a good classification accuracy at low SNRs.

Processing of such signals separately in the time-domain or in the frequency-domain does not provide sufficient information as their spectral properties change over time. Traditional methods such as the Fourier transform (FT) perform a transformation from time-domain to frequency-domain allowing a suitable spectral analysis but looses the spatial/temporal information of the signal components. Hence, it is not easy to observe a direct relationship between the time and frequency characteristics of the signal. This makes it difficult to extract useful information by using only time- or frequency-domain analysis for further processing purposes. To overcome this problem, joint time-frequency (TF) methods are developed and applied to the analysis and representation of non-stationary signals. In addition to revealing a time-dependent energy distribution information, TF methods have successfully been utilized in the estimation of some parameters related to the analyzed signals. In this paper, we briefly summarize the existing methods and present several state-of-the-art applications of TF methods in the classification of biomedical signals. We also point out some future perspectives for the processing of non-stationary signals in the joint TF domain. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: This retrospective case-control study was based on the analysis of awake EEGs and included 15 patients with EE-CSWS and 15 age-matched and sex-matched patients with typical SFE. The EEGs were anonymised and scored by four independent readers. The following qualitative and quantitative EEG indices were analysed: slowwave index (SLWI), spike-wave index (SWI), spike-wave frequency (SWF), long spike-wave clusters (CLSW) and EEG score (between grades 0 and 4). Sensitivity and specificity were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and their reproducibility with a kappa test. Results: Based on a highly sensitive cut-off, EE-CSWS patients were 8.4 times more likely than those with SFE to have an SLWI > 6%, 15 times more likely to have an SWI > 10 % and six times more likely to have a CLSW of >= 1 s. There was substantial agreement between readers (with kappa values of 0.64, 0.69 and 0.67). EE-CSWS patients were 13 times more likely to have an SWF of > 11 % and 149 times more likely to have an EEG score of >= 3 than typical SFE patients. Agreement about these ratings was almost perfect (kappa 0.91 and 0.86). Conclusion: An EEG score of >= 3 on a 20-min awake EEG differentiates typical SFE from EE-CSWS at the time of cognitive regression, with good reliability across readers with different levels of expertise.

Schizophrenia manifests itself with disordered thought development, hallucinations, and different behaviours and reactions. In this study, EEG data were collected and analyzed on a total of 84 subjects diagnosed with normal and schizophrenia. EEG data used as a diagnostic tool with low-resolution level has been used to distinguish between schizophrenic and normal individuals. First of all, statistical methods were used in the analyzes, and also frequency properties of the data were extracted by Wavelet analysis. As a result of the analysis, statistical findings include characteristics that distinguish between diagnosed schizophrenia and normal individuals. In addition, the findings obtained as a result of the Wavelet analysis were determined to distinguish between normal and schizophrenic individuals. While the mean used in statistical analysis takes the value 1.6 for normal individuals, it takes the value 2.9 for individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia. Also, in the results of Continuous Wavelet (CW) Analysis, very important findings were obtained in terms of detection in scale 16 and 64 bands.

Here, we have isolated early versus late periods of sleep in order to replicate previous behavioural findings and to demonstrate: i) that distinct sleep and sleep electroencephalography (EEG) factors influence the generalisation of learned information, and; ii) that the consolidation and generalisation of memory across sleep depends on individual alpha frequency (IAF) and strength of initial encoding. Subjects underwent a night-half protocol with polysomnography (PSG), and completed a Chinese character-English paired associates learning task. Recognition accuracy of learned word-pairs, the extent to which the subject was able to generalise this knowledge, and the extent of explicit transfer of knowledge were measured. Results demonstrate that quality of initial learning determined the relationship between sleep neurophysiology and outcome, with IAF modulating this effect. We also note an effect of IAF in modulating the effect of sleep spindles in determining generalisation of learned materials. Finally, we note a complex relationship between initial learning, IAF and sleep spindle density in determining when information will reach explicit awareness across sleep. Together, these data implicate encoding factors in subsequent offline processing, demonstrate a potential role for individual differences in the EEG and subsequently add to our understanding of the the conditions in which sleep may benefit both memory and learning.

Feasibility of Repeated Assessment of Cognitive Function in Older Adults Using a Wireless, Mobile, Dry-EEG Headset and Tablet-Based Games	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						EEG; EEG biomarker; cognition; gamification; mobile EEG	CLINICAL HIGH-RISK; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; HEART-FAILURE; FRONTAL EEG; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; PSYCHOSIS; BIOMARKER	Access to affordable, objective and scalable biomarkers of brain function is needed to transform the healthcare burden of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disease. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, both resting and in combination with targeted cognitive tasks, have demonstrated utility in tracking disease state and therapy response in a range of conditions from schizophrenia to Alzheimer's disease. But conventional methods of recording this data involve burdensome clinic visits, and behavioural tasks that are not effective in frequent repeated use. This paper aims to evaluate the technical and human-factors feasibility of gathering large-scale EEG using novel technology in the home environment with healthy adult users. In a large field study, 89 healthy adults aged 40-79 years volunteered to use the system at home for 12 weeks, 5 times/week, for 30 min/session. A 16-channel, dry-sensor, portable wireless headset recorded EEG while users played gamified cognitive and passive tasks through a tablet application, including tests of decision making, executive function and memory. Data was uploaded to cloud servers and remotely monitored via web-based dashboards. Seventy-eight participants completed the study, and high levels of adherence were maintained throughout across all age groups, with mean compliance over the 12-week period of 82% (4.1 sessions per week). Reported ease of use was also high with mean System Usability Scale scores of 78.7. Behavioural response measures (reaction time and accuracy) and EEG components elicited by gamified stimuli (P300, ERN, Pe and changes in power spectral density) were extracted from the data collected in home, across a wide range of ages, including older adult participants. Findings replicated well-known patterns of age-related change and demonstrated the feasibility of using low-burden, large-scale, longitudinal EEG measurement in community-based cohorts. This technology enables clinically relevant data to be recorded outside the lab/clinic, from which metrics underlying cognitive ageing could be extracted, opening the door to potential new ways of developing digital cognitive biomarkers for disorders affecting the brain.

Spectral features of cortical auditory evoked potentials inform hearing threshold and intensity percepts in acoustic and electric hearing	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; classification; cortical auditory responses; frequency domain; event-related spectral perturbation; inter-trial coherence	EEG; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; CAEPS	Objective. Stimulus-elicited changes in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings can be represented using Fourier magnitude and phase features (Makeig et al (2004 Trends Cogn. Sci. 8 204-10)). The present study aimed to quantify how much information about hearing responses are contained in the magnitude, quantified by event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs); and the phase, quantified by inter-trial coherence (ITC). By testing if one feature contained more information and whether this information was mutually exclusive to the features, we aimed to relate specific EEG magnitude and phase features to hearing perception. Approach. EEG responses were recorded from 20 adults who were presented with acoustic stimuli, and 20 adult cochlear implant users with electrical stimuli. Both groups were presented with short, 50 ms stimuli at varying intensity levels relative to their hearing thresholds. Extracted ERSP and ITC features were inputs for a linear discriminant analysis classifier (Wong et al (2016 J. Neural. Eng. 13 036003)). The classifier then predicted whether the EEG signal contained information about the sound stimuli based on the input features. Classifier decoding accuracy was quantified with the mutual information measure (Cottaris and Elfar (2009 J. Neural. Eng. 6 026007), Hawellek et al (2016 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. 113 13492-7)), and compared across the two feature sets, and to when both feature sets were combined. Main results. We found that classifiers using either ITC or ERSP feature sets were both able to decode hearing perception, but ITC-feature classifiers were able to decode responses to a lower but still audible stimulation intensity, making ITC more useful than ERSP for hearing threshold estimation. We also found that combining the information from both feature sets did not improve decoding significantly, implying that ERSP brain dynamics has a limited contribution to the EEG response, possibly due to the stimuli used in this study. Significance. We successfully related hearing perception to an EEG measure, which does not require behavioral feedback from the listener; an objective measure is important in both neuroscience research and clinical audiology.

One of the characteristic EEG oscillations is the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR)?with its arch-shaped waveform in alpha- and betabands?that reflect sensorimotor activity. The representation of sensorimotor activity by the SMR depends on the signal-to-noise ratio achieved by EEG spatial filters. New method: We employed simultaneous recording of EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging, and 10min resting-state brain activities were recorded in 19 healthy volunteers. To compare the EEG spatial-filtering methods commonly used for extracting sensorimotor cortical activities, we assessed nine different spatialfilters: a default reference of EEG amplifier system, a common average reference (CAR), small-, middle- and large-Laplacian filters, and four types of bipolar manners (C3-Cz, C3-F3, C3-P3, and C3-T7). We identified the brain region that correlated with the EEG-SMR power obtained after each spatial-filtering method was applied. Subsequently, we calculated the proportion of the significant voxels in the sensorimotor cortex as well as the sensorimotor occupancy in all significant regions to examine the sensitivity and specificity of each spatial-filter. Results: The CAR and large-Laplacian spatial-filters were superior at improving the signal-to-noise ratios for extracting sensorimotor activity from the EEG-SMR signal. Comparison with existing methods: Our results are consistent with the spatial-filter selection to extract taskdependent activation for better control of EEG-SMR-based interventions. Our approach has the potential to identify the optimal spatial-filter for EEG-SMR. Conclusions: Evaluating spatial-filters for extracting spontaneous sensorimotor activity from the EEG is a useful procedure for constructing more effective EEG-SMR-based interventions.

Patients with RTT suffer from severe deficits in motor, perceptual and cognitive domains. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has provided useful information to clinicians and scientists, from the very first descriptions of RTT, and yet no reliable neurophysiological biomarkers related to the pathophysiology of the disorder or symptom severity have been identified to date. To identify consistently observed and potentially informative EEG characteristics of RTT pathophysiology, and ascertain areas most worthy of further systematic investigation, here we review the literature for EEG abnormalities reported in patients with RTT and in its disease models. While pointing to some promising potential EEG biomarkers of RTT, our review identify areas of need to realize the potential of EEG including (1) quantitative investigation of promising clinical-EEG observations in RTT, e.g., shift of mu rhythm frequency and EEG during sleep; (2) closer alignment of approaches between patients with RTT and its animal models to strengthen the translational significance of the work (e.g., EEG measurements and behavioral states); (3) establishment of large-scale consortium research, to provide adequate Ns to investigate age and genotype effects.

Impaired modulations of resting alpha oscillations have been demonstrated to be an important biomarker of MDD. In this study, we investigated the alpha-band dynamic functional networks in MDD using resting state electroencephalography. To explore the dysconnectivity networks at the group level, we assume that the MDD group and the healthy group share some common temporal networks but also retain individual temporal networks. Considering the multiway structure of the data, we applied a coupled tensor decomposition model on two adjacency tensors with the dimension of time x connectivity x subject. The double-coupled constraints are imposed on temporal and adjacency modes. We summarized two alpha-band dysconnectivity networks by clustering the individual networks characterized with MDD.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate network-level changes in functional brain connectivity associated with the recovery and return of six cognitive functions after general anesthesia. High-density electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded from healthy volunteers undergoing a clinically relevant anesthesia protocol (propofol induction and isoflurane maintenance), and age-matched healthy controls. A battery of cognitive tests (motor praxis, visual object learning test, fractal-2-back, abstract matching, psychomotor vigilance test, digital symbol substitution test) was administered at baseline, upon recovery of consciousness (ROC), and at half-hour intervals up to 3 h following ROC. EEG networks were derived using the strength of functional connectivity measured through the weighted phase lag index (wPLI). A partial least squares (PLS) analysis was conducted to assess changes in these networks: (1) between anesthesia and control groups; (2) during the 3-h recovery from anesthesia; and (3) for each cognitive test during recovery from anesthesia. Networks were maximally perturbed upon ROC but returned to baseline 30-60 min following ROC, despite deficits in cognitive performance that persisted up to 3 h following ROC. Additionally, during recovery from anesthesia, cognitive tests conducted at the same time-point activated distinct and dissociable functional connectivity networks across all frequency bands. The results highlight that the return of cognitive function after anesthetic-induced unconsciousness is task-specific, with unique behavioral and brain network trajectories of recovery.

Comparing physiological responses during cognitive tests in virtual environments vs. in identical real-world environments	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							STROOP INTERFERENCE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; CINGULATE CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; COLOR; ATTENTION; DESIGN; PERCEPTION; SELECTION; DISTANCE	Immersive virtual environments (VEs) are increasingly used to evaluate human responses to design variables. VEs provide a tremendous capacity to isolate and readily adjust specific features of an architectural or product design. They also allow researchers to safely and effectively measure performance factors and physiological responses. However, the success of this form of design-testing depends on the generalizability of response measurements between VEs and real-world contexts. At the current time, there is very limited research evaluating the consistency of human response data across identical real and virtual environments. Rendering tools were used to precisely replicate a real-world classroom in virtual space. Participants were recruited and asked to complete a series of cognitive tests in the real classroom and in the virtual classroom. Physiological data were collected during these tests, including electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), electrooculography (EOG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and head acceleration. Participants' accuracy on the cognitive tests did not significantly differ between the real classroom and the identical VE. However, the participants answered the tests more rapidly in the VE. No significant differences were found in eye blink rate and heart rate between the real and VR settings. Head acceleration and GSR variance were lower in the VE setting. Overall, EEG frequency band-power was not significantly altered between the real-world classroom and the VE. Analysis of EEG event-related potentials likewise indicated strong similarity between the real-world classroom and the VE, with a single exception related to executive functioning in a color-mismatch task.

Here we used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine sleep in 6 year old OVT73 transgenic sheep (Ovis aries) that we used as a presymptomatic model of HD. We hypothesized that despite the lack of overt symptoms of HD at this age, early alterations of the sleep-wake pattern and EEG powers may already be present. We recorded EEG from female transgenic and normal sheep (5/group) during two undisturbed 'baseline' nights with different lighting conditions. We then recorded continuously through a night of sleep disruption and the following 24 h (recovery day and night). On baseline nights, regardless of whether the lights were on or off, transgenic sheep spent more time awake than normal sheep particularly at the beginning of the night. Furthermore, there were significant differences between transgenic and normal sheep in both EEG power and its pattern of distribution during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In particular, there was a significant decrease in delta (0.5-4 Hz) power across the night in transgenic compared to normal sheep, and the distributions of delta, theta and alpha oscillations that typically dominate the EEG in the first half of the night of normal sheep were skewed so they were predominant in the second, rather than the first half of the night in transgenic sheep. Interestingly, the effect of sleep disruption on normal sheep was also to skew the pattern of distribution of EEG powers so they looked more like that of transgenic sheep under baseline conditions. Thus it is possible that transgenic sheep exist in a state that resemble a chronic state of physiological sleep deprivation. During the sleep recovery period, normal sheep showed a significant 'rebound' increase in delta power with frontal dominance. A similar rebound was not seen in transgenic sheep, suggesting that their homeostatic response to sleep deprivation is abnormal. Although sleep abnormalities in early stage HD patients are subtle, with patients often unaware of their existence, they may contribute to impairment of neurological function that herald the onset of disease. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying EEG abnormalities in early stage HD would give insight into how, and when, they progress into the sleep disorder. The transgenic sheep model is ideally positioned for studies of the earliest phase of disease when sleep abnormalities first emerge.	[Vas, Szilvia; Nicol, Alister U.; Miles, Jack; Morton, A.

Moreover, a systematic multimodal fusion of EEG with other informative brain signals such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) towards enhancing the performance of the BCI systems is not fully investigated. In this study, we present a robust EEG-fNIRS data fusion framework utilizing a series of graph-based EEG features to investigate their performance on a motor imaginary (MI) classification task. Method: We first extract the amplitude and phase sequences of users' multi-channel EEG signals based on the complex Morlet wavelet time-frequency maps, and then convert them into an undirected graph to extract EEG topological features. The graph-based features from EEG are then selected by a thresholding method and fused with the temporal features from fNIRS signals after each being selected by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm. The fused features were then classified as MI task vs. baseline by a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Results: The time-frequency graphs of EEG signals improved the MI classification accuracy by similar to 5% compared to the graphs built on the band-pass filtered temporal EEG signals. Our proposed graph-based method also showed comparable performance to the classical EEG features based on power spectral density (PSD), however with a much smaller standard deviation, showing its robustness for potential use in a practical BCI system. Our fusion analysis revealed a considerable improvement of similar to 17% as opposed to the highest average accuracy of EEG only and similar to 3% compared with the highest fNIRS only accuracy demonstrating an enhanced performance when modality fusion is used relative to single modal outcomes. Significance: Our findings indicate the potential use of the proposed data fusion framework utilizing the graph-based features in the hybrid BCI systems by making the motor imaginary inference more accurate and more robust.

Increased 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol levels normalize cortical responses to sound and improve behaviors in Fmr1 KO mice	JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Gamma-band power; Cortical hyperexcitability; Auditory hypersensitivity; 2-Arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol; Endocannabinoid modulation	FRAGILE-X-SYNDROME; MOUSE MODEL; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; SOCIAL-INTERACTION; CANNABIDIOL; LIPASE; AUTISM	Background: Individuals with Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit an array of symptoms, including sociability deficits, increased anxiety, hyperactivity, and sensory hyperexcitability. It is unclear how endocannabinoid (eCB) modulation can be targeted to alleviate neurophysiological abnormalities in FXS as behavioral research reveals benefits to inhibiting cannabinoid (CB) receptor activation and increasing endocannabinoid ligand levels. Here, we hypothesize that enhancement of 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (2-AG) in Fragile X mental retardation 1 gene knock-out (Fmr1 KO) mice may reduce cortical hyperexcitability and behavioral abnormalities observed in FXS. Methods: To test whether an increase in 2-AG levels normalized cortical responses in a mouse model of FXS, animals were subjected to electroencephalography (EEG) recording and behavioral assessment following treatment with JZL-184, an irreversible inhibitor of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). Assessment of 2-AG was performed using lipidomic analysis in conjunction with various doses and time points post-administration of JZL-184. Baseline electrocortical activity and evoked responses to sound stimuli were measured using a 30-channel multielectrode array (MEA) in adult male mice before, 4 h, and 1 day post-intraperitoneal injection of JZL-184 or vehicle. Behavior assessment was done using the open field and elevated plus maze 4 h post-treatment. Results: Lipidomic analysis showed that 8 mg/kg JZL-184 significantly increased the levels of 2-AG in the auditory cortex of both Fmr1 KO and WT mice 4 h post-treatment compared to vehicle controls. EEG recordings revealed a reduction in the abnormally enhanced baseline gamma-band power in Fmr1 KO mice and significantly improved evoked synchronization to auditory stimuli in the gamma-band range post-JZL-184 treatment. JZL-184 treatment also ameliorated anxiety-like and hyperactivity phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice. Conclusions: Overall, these results indicate that increasing 2-AG levels may serve as a potential therapeutic approach to normalize cortical responses and improve behavioral outcomes in FXS and possibly other ASDs.

Volitional modification of brain activity in adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Bayesian analysis of Slow Cortical Potential neurofeedback	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Slow Cortical Potential training; EEG Neurofeedback; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Adolescents; Bayesian multilevel model; Volitional brain activity modification	PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; CHILDREN; MEG	Autism spectrum disorder is (ASD) characterized by a persisting triad of impairments of social interaction, language as well as inflexible, stereotyped and ritualistic behaviors. Increasingly, scientific evidence suggests a neurobiological basis of these emotional, social and cognitive deficits in individuals with ASD. The aim of this randomized controlled brain self-regulation intervention study was to investigate whether the core symptomatology of ASD could be reduced via an electroencephalography (EEG) based brain self-regulation training of Slow Cortical Potentials (SCP). 41 male adolescents with ASD were recruited and allocated to a) an experimental group undergoing 24 sessions of EEG-based brain training (n(1) = 21), or to b) an active control group undergoing conventional treatment (n(2) = 20), that is, clinical counseling during a 3-months intervention period. We employed real-time neurofeedback training recorded from a fronto-central electrode intended to enable participants to volitionally regulate their brain activity. Core autistic symptomatology was measured at six time points during the intervention and analyzed with Bayesian multilevel approach to characterize changes in core symptomatology. Additional Bayesian models were formulated to describe the neural dynamics of the training process as indexed by SCP (time-domain) and power density (PSD, frequency-domain) measures. The analysis revealed a substantial improvement in the core symptomatology of ASD in the experimental group (reduction of 21.38 points on the Social Responsiveness Scale, SD = 5.29), which was slightly superior to that observed in the control group (evidence Ratio = 5.79). Changes in SCP manifested themselves as different trajectories depending on the different feedback conditions and tasks. Further, the model of PSD revealed a continuous decrease in delta power, parallel to an increase in alpha power. Most notably, a non-linear (quadratic) model turned out to be better at predicting the data than a linear model across all analyses. Taken together, our analyses suggest that behavioral and neural processes of change related to neurofeedback training are complex and non-linear. Moreover, they have implications for the design of future trials and training protocols.	[Konicar, L.; Radev, S.; Prillinger, K.; Diehm, R.; Plener, P.

Regular perception of media, often in parallel with other activities, can create additional emotional stress and overload the brain with information flow. The purpose of this study was to identify what neurophysiological and psychophysiological changes in functional state occur when media content of different modalities is perceived (including video, audio, and video with sound), and what type of media requires the greatest cognitive resource. The study involved 19 healthy subjects. 3 experiments were performed on different days with participation of each subject ("sound", "video", "video+sound"), the order of experiments was ranked. Before and after the sessions, sensory-motor reaction tests were performed; EEG was recorded before, after and during the sessions. Analysis of results showed that only the EEG indicators revealed significant differences between stimuli sessions. The greatest cognitive stress was observed in the experiments with audio content: the power of alpha and beta2 rhythms decreased after the session, the peak frequency of alpha and beta rhythms increased; the power of theta and beta rhythms increased during the session. The perception of video without sound did not cause significant interest and attention: the alpha rhythm power at rest increased after the sessions and the peak frequency values decreased. The experiments with perception of video with sound showed moderate interest and attention: increase of the theta and beta rhythms power after the sessions, and increase of the beta rhythms power in the middle of the sessions. Obtained results suggest, that the most resource-intensive was the perception of audio content without video.	[Lebedeva, N. N.; Karimova, E.

Here, an Expert Panel from the Electrophysiology Professional Interest Area of the Alzheimer's Association reviewed the field literature and reached consensus on the event-related electroencephalographic oscillations (EROs) that show consistent abnormalities in patients with significant cognitive deficits due to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's (PD), Lewy body (LBD), and cerebrovascular diseases. Converging evidence from oddball paradigms showed that, as compared to cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults, AD patients had lower amplitude in widespread delta (>4 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) phase-locked EROs as a function of disease severity. Similar effects were also observed in PD, LBD, and/or cerebrovascular cognitive impairment patients. Non-phase-locked alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) oscillations were abnormally reduced (event-related desynchronization, ERD) in AD patients relative to CU. However, studies on patients with other dementias remain lacking. Delta and theta phase-locked EROs during oddball tasks may be useful neurophysiological biomarkers of cognitive systems at work in heuristic and intervention clinical trials performed in AD patients, but more research is needed regarding their potential role for other dementias.

J	Ma, QG; Wang, ML; Da, Q				Ma, Qingguo; Wang, Manlin; Da, Qian			The effects of brand familiarity and product category in brand extension: An ERP study	NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						Brand extension; Event-related potentials; N270; Time-frequency analysis	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; NEURAL RESPONSES; THETA-RESPONSES; EEG; ALPHA; MEMORY; FIT; FREQUENCY	In this paper, neural features influenced by brand familiarity and category were investigated in a brand extension experiment by using conventional event-related potentials (ERPs) and time-frequency analysis. Twenty-four participants were required to decide whether to accept the extension of one brand (stimulus 1) to a certain product category (stimulus 2) in a 2 familiarity x 2 category paradigm. Stimulus 1 consisted of household appliance brands that had different degrees of familiarity (high familiarity vs. low familiarity) to a certain participant, and stimulus 2 consisted of two categories of products (high conflict vs. low conflict). Twenty-two sets of valid data were used for data analysis. We found greater N270 amplitudes in the low-familiarity brand condition and in the high-conflict product category condition, which meant that the participants had to devote more cognitive resources when the brand was less familiar and felt more conflict when the brand was extended to the high-conflict product category. According to the time-frequency analysis results, brand familiarity and product category were found to have a significant effect on the amplitude of theta-band power (4-7.5 Hz) at frontal electrodes in the time period of 270 & minus;340 ms. This result indicated that the activity of individual nodes of the language processing networks increased when the extension product category was mismatched with respect to the brand name and that the related memory of the brand was activated and the long-term memory was extracted when the participants faced the high-familiarity brand extension. The study provides an insightful view of how brand familiarity and category influence consumers' cognitive processes regarding brand extension. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. and Japan Neuroscience Society.

Aging reduces EEG markers of recognition despite intact performance: Implications for forensic memory detection	CORTEX			English	Article						Episodic memory; Aging; Forensic memory detection; ERP; EEG oscillations	CONCEALED INFORMATION TEST; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; THETA OSCILLATIONS; RETRIEVAL; ERP; P300; DYNAMICS; ALPHA; RECOLLECTION	ERP-based forensic memory detection is based on the logic that guilty suspects will hold incriminating knowledge about crimes they have committed, and therefore should show parietal ERP positivities related to recognition when presented with reminders of their crimes. We predicted that such forensic memory detection might however be inaccurate in older adults, because of changes to recognition-related brain activity that occurs with aging. We measured both ERPs and EEG oscillations associated with episodic old/new recognition and forensic memory detection in 30 younger (age < 30) and 30 older (age > 65) adults. EEG oscillations were included as a complementary measure which is less sensitive to temporal variability and component overlap than ERPs. In line with predictions, recognition-related parietal ERP positivities were significantly reduced in the older compared to younger group in both tasks, despite highly similar behavioural performance. We also observed aging-related reductions in oscillatory markers of recognition in the forensic memory detection test, while the oscillatory effects associated with episodic recognition were similar across age groups. This pattern of results suggests that while both forensic memory detection and episodic recognition are accompanied by aging-induced reductions in parietal ERP positivities, these reductions may be caused by non-overlapping mechanisms across the two tasks. Our findings suggest that EEG-based forensic memory detection tests are less valid in older than younger populations, limiting their practical applications.& nbsp; (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

We hereby investigate the modulatory effects of TMS on brain connectivity in Genetic Generalized Epilepsy (GGE) and explore their potential as a diagnostic biomarker in GGE. Methods: Patients with GGE (n = 18) and healthy controls (n = 11) were investigated with a paired-pulse TMS-EEG protocol. The brain network was studied at local and at global levels using Coherence as an EEG connectivity measure. Comparison of patients vs controls was performed in a time-resolved manner by analyzing comparatively pre- vs post-TMS brain networks. Results: There was statistically significant TMS-induced modulation of connectivity at specific frequency bands within groups and difference in TMS-induced modulation between the two groups. The most significant difference between patients and controls related to connectivity modulation in the c band at 1-3 sec post-TMS (p = 0:004). Conclusions: TMS modulates the healthy and epileptic brain connectivity in different ways. Our results indicate that TMS-EEG connectivity analysis can be a basis for a diagnostic biomarker of GGE. Significance: The analysis identifies specific time periods and frequency bands of interest of TMS-induced connectivity modulation and elucidates the effect of TMS on the healthy and epileptic brain connectivity.

Research has shown that the behavioral aspects of living species are significantly affected by type of illumination, level of intensity and Correlated Colour Temperature (CCT). Continuous Electroencephalograph (EEG) is electrical activity of brain and it is a complex signal, detected with the help of several electrodes on scalp. EEG data consists of low frequency signals and main five different rhythmus - delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. Stimulus brain activity is the Event Related Potential (ERP). EEG and ERP arc the main tools to study the role of brain in different activities. Present study examines the effect of intensity of light and CCT of a LED source on the subject with the help of EEGLAB a software tool available for MATLAB toolbox. The signal processing is carried out for time-frequency analysis and independent component analysis (ICA). Experiments are conducted on five different subjects in age group from 25 to 50 years. EEG measurements are carried out in dark scene, and in an enlightened scene with the help of NeXus-10 physiological monitoring system. It is observed that event related potential rises and shows a peculiar pattern when light intensity and CCT change. Subjective response shows that cool white light and neutral white light are more comfortable. Alertness is more in warm white light.	[Yawale, P.

Motor Cortical Network Flexibility is Associated With Biomechanical Walking Impairment in Chronic Stroke	NEUROREHABILITATION AND NEURAL REPAIR			English	Article						electroencephalography; transcranial magnetic stimulation; gait; functional connectivity; cortical network; corticospinal	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; INTERHEMISPHERIC INHIBITION; OSCILLATIONS; SPEED; EXCITABILITY; INDIVIDUALS; PERFORMANCE; ACTIVATION; RESPONSES; SYMMETRY	Background: The inability to flexibly modulate motor behavior with changes in task demand or environmental context is a pervasive feature of motor impairment and dysfunctional mobility after stroke. Objective: The purpose of this study was to test the reactive and modulatory capacity of lower-limb primary motor cortical (M1) networks using electroencephalography (EEG) measures of cortical activity evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and to evaluate their associations with clinical and biomechanical measures of walking function in chronic stroke. Methods: TMS assessments of motor cortex excitability were performed during rest and active ipsilateral plantarflexion in chronic stroke and age-matched controls. TMS-evoked motor cortical network interactions were quantified with simultaneous EEG as the post-TMS (0-300 ms) beta (15-30 Hz) coherence between electrodes overlying M1 bilaterally. We compared TMS-evoked coherence between groups during rest and active conditions and tested associations with poststroke motor impairment, paretic propulsive gait deficits, and the presence of paretic leg motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Results: Stroke (n = 14, 66 +/- 9 years, F = 4) showed lower TMS-evoked cortical coherence and activity-dependent modulation compared to controls (n = 9, 68 +/- 6 years, F = 3). Blunted reactivity and atypical modulation of TMS-evoked coherence were associated with lower paretic ankle moments for propulsive force generation during walking and absent paretic MEPs. Conclusions: Impaired flexibility of motor cortical networks to react to TMS and modulate during motor activity is distinctly associated with paretic limb biomechanical walking impairment, and may provide useful insight into the neuromechanistic underpinnings of chronic post-stroke mobility deficits.

By detecting a participant's instantaneous phase of EEG alpha oscillation and delivering phase-locked visual stimuli to the participant, a new closed-loop feedback paradigm, named phase-locked visual feedback modulation (PLVFM), has been developed to modulate his/her amplitude and frequency of alpha oscillation. However, the underlying neurodynamic mechanism of the PLVFM technique is still not clear, which limits the developments of precise and individualized applications of this new neural modulation technique. In this study, a neural dynamical model based on the limit cycle attractor has been proposed for alpha wave simulation to explore the neurodynamic mechanism of PLVFM. Results show that the simulated dynamic behaviors are consistent with the real results of online EEG modulation. The external stimuli at a specific phase change the instantaneous radius and phase of alpha oscillation. The repeated phase-locked stimuli stabilize the alpha oscillation in a new trajectory in the phase space and further induce the change of the amplitude and peak-frequency of alpha wave. The current study improves our understanding of the visual- modulated alpha wave, which is an important step towards precise modulation of EEG activity for the modulation of sensory and cognitive states.

The N2pc is a small amplitude transient interhemispheric voltage asymmetry used in cognitive neuroscience to investigate subject's allocation of selective visuo-spatial attention. N2pc is typically estimated by averaging the sweeps of the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal but, in absence of explicit normative indications, the number of sweeps is often based on arbitrariness or personal experience. With the final aim of reducing duration and cost of experimental protocols, here we developed a new approach to reliably predict N2pc amplitude from a minimal EEG dataset. Approach. First, features predictive of N2pc amplitude were identified in the time-frequency domain. Then, an artificial neural network (NN) was trained to predict N2pc mean amplitude at the individual level. By resorting to simulated data, accuracy of the NN was assessed by computing the mean squared error (MSE) and the amplitude discretization error (ADE) and compared to the standard time averaging (TA) technique. The NN was then tested against two real datasets consisting of 14 and 12 subjects, respectively. Main result. In simulated scenarios entailing different number of sweeps (between 10 and 100), the MSE obtained with the proposed method resulted, on average, 1/5 of that obtained with the TA technique. Implementation on real EEG datasets showed that N2pc amplitude could be reliably predicted with as few as 40 EEG sweeps per cell of the experimental design. Significance. The developed approach allows to reduce duration and cost of experiments involving the N2pc, for instance in studies investigating attention deficits in pathological subjects.

Previous research suggests that multisensory integration is shaped by a context-dependent and largely adaptive interplay between stimulus-driven bottom-up and top-down endogenous influences. One critical question concerns the extent to which this interplay is sensitive to the amount of available cognitive resources. In the present study, we investigated the influence of limited cognitive resources on audiovisual integration by measuring high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in healthy participants performing the soundinduced flash illusion (SIFI) and a verbal n-back task (0-back, low load and 2-back, high load) in a dual-task design. In the SIFI, the integration of a flash with two rapid beeps can induce the illusory perception of two flashes. We found that high compared with low load increased illusion susceptibility and modulated neural oscillations underlying illusion-related crossmodal interactions. Illusion perception under high load was associated with reduced early beta power (18-26 Hz, similar to 70 ms) in auditory and motor areas, presumably reflecting an early mismatch signal and subsequent top-down influences including increased frontal theta power (7-9 Hz, similar to 120 ms) in mid-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and a later beta power suppression (13-22 Hz, similar to 350 ms) in prefrontal and auditory cortex. Our study demonstrates that integrative crossmodal interactions underlying the SIFI are sensitive to the amount of available cognitive resources and that multisensory integration engages top-down theta and beta oscillations when cognitive resources are scarce.

It is hypothesized that the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) plays a key role by inhibiting the motor cortex via the basal ganglia. The electroencephalography (EEG)-derived beta-rhythm (15-29Hz) is thought to reflect communication within this network, with increased right frontal beta-power often observed before successful response inhibition. Recent literature suggests that averaging spectral power obscures the transient, burst-like nature of beta-activity. There is evidence that the rate of beta-bursts following a Stop signal is higher when a motor response is successfully inhibited. However, other characteristics of beta-burst events, and their topographical properties, have not yet been examined. Here, we used a large human (male and female) EEG Stop Signal task (SST) dataset (n=218) to examine averaged normalized beta-power, beta-burst rate, and beta-burst "volume" (which we defined as burst duration x frequency span x amplitude). We first sought to optimize the beta-burst detection method. In order to find predictors across the whole scalp, and with high temporal precision, we then used machine learning to (1) classify successful versus failed stopping and to (2) predict individual stop signal reaction time (SSRT). beta-burst volume was significantly more predictive of successful and fast stopping than beta-burst rate and normalized beta-power. The classification model generalized to an external dataset (n = 201). We suggest beta-burst volume is a sensitive and reliable measure for investigation of human response inhibition.

In order to enhance functional recovery, it is important to understand the mechanisms supporting neural repair and neuroplasticity in the cortex surrounding the lesion. Brain oscillations of the local field potential (LFP) are rhythmic fluctuations of neuronal excitability that synchronize neuronal activity to organize information processing and plasticity. Although the oscillatory activity of the brain has been probed after stroke in both animals and humans using electroencephalography (EEG), the latter is ineffective to precisely map the oscillatory changes in the peri-infarct zone where synaptic plasticity potential is high. Here, we worked on the hypothesis that the brain oscillatory system is altered in the surviving peri-infarct cortex, which may slow down the functional repair and reduce the recovery. In order to document the relevance of this hypothesis, oscillatory power was measured at various distances from the necrotic core at 7 and 21 days after a permanent cortical ischemia induced in mice. Delta and theta oscillations remained at a normal power in the peri-infarct cortex, in contrast to low gamma oscillations that displayed a gradual decrease, when approaching the border of the lesion. A broadband increase of power was also observed in the homotopic contralateral sites. Thus, the proximal peri-infarct cortex could become a target of therapeutic interventions applied to correct the oscillatory regimen in order to boost post-stroke functional recovery.

However, the precise characteristics of position marking have remained largely elusive. Recent studies have shown that space is involved in marking serial position of items in verbal working memory (WM). Furthermore, it has been suggested, but not proven, that accessing these items involves horizontal shifts of spatial attention. We used continuous electroencephalography recordings to show that memory search in serial order verbal WM involves spatial attention processes that share the same electrophysiological signatures as those operating on the visuospatial WM and external space. Accessing an item from a sequence in verbal WM induced posterior "early directing attention negativity" and "anterior directing attention negativity" contralateral to the position of the item in mental space (i.e., begin items on the left; end items on the right). In the frequency domain, we observed posterior alpha suppression contralateral to the position of the item. Our results provide clear evidence for the involvement of spatial attention in retrieving serial information from verbal WM. Implications for WM models are discussed.

J	Bhattacharyya, A; Tripathy, RK; Garg, L; Pachori, RB				Bhattacharyya, Abhijit; Tripathy, Rajesh Kumar; Garg, Lalit; Pachori, Ram Bilas			A Novel Multivariate-Multiscale Approach for Computing EEG Spectral and Temporal Complexity for Human Emotion Recognition	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Multivariate-multiscale; emotion recognition; spectral entropy; temporal entropy; ARF classifier	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; ECG SIGNALS; ENTROPY; CLASSIFICATION; TRANSFORM	This work proposes a novel multivariate-multiscale approach for computing the spectral and temporal entropies from the multichannel electroencephalogram(EEG) signal. This facilitates the recognition of three human emotions : positive, neutral, and negative. The proposed approach is based on the application of the Fourier-Besselseries expansion based empirical wavelet transform(FBSE-EWT). We have extended the existing FBSE-EWT method for multichannel signals and derived FBSE-EWT based multivariate Hilbert marginal spectrum (MHMS) for computing spectral Shannon and K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) entropies. The multivariate FBSE-EWT decomposes the multichannel EEG signals into narrow band subband signals. The multiscaling operation adapted in the spectral domain is based on the selection of successive joint instantaneous amplitude and frequency functions of the subband signals. On the other hand, the time domain multiscale K-NN entropy is computed from the cumulatively added multidimensional subband signals. The extracted spectral and temporal entropy features are smoothed and fed to the sparse autoencoder based random forest (ARF) classifier architecture for emotion classification. The proposed approach is tested using multichannel EEG signals available in a public database (SJTU emotion EEG dataset (SEED)). The bivariate EEG signals from different channel pairs with distinct spatial locations over the scalp are considered as input to our proposed system. The obtained overall classification accuracy of 94.4% reveals that the proposed approach is useful in classifying human emotions. The method is also validated using DREAMER emotion EEG public database. The method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods evaluated in these databases.

Neuroscientific studies of working memory have mostly focused on the essential roles of neural oscillations during item encoding from single sensory modalities (e.g., visual and auditory). However, the characteristics of neural oscillations during multisensory encoding in working memory are rarely studied. Our study investigated the oscillation characteristics of neural signals in scalp electrodes and mapped functional brain connectivity while participants encoded complex audiovisual objects in a working memory task. Experimental results showed that theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) were prominent and topographically distributed across multiple cortical regions, including prefrontal (e.g., superior frontal gyrus), parietal (e.g., precuneus), temporal (e.g., inferior temporal gyrus), and occipital (e.g., cuneus) cortices. Furthermore, neural connectivity at the theta oscillation frequency was significant in these cortical regions during audiovisual object encoding compared with single modality object encoding. These results suggest that local oscillations and interregional connectivity via theta activity play an important role during audiovisual object encoding and may contribute to the formation of working memory traces from multisensory items.

Due to the shortcomings of the conventional polysomnographic acquisition, an automatic sleep scoring method based on a single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) is vital in sleep medicine practice. In this study, we proposed a data-driven and robust automatic sleep staging scheme based on a single-channel EEG. With the decomposition of the EEG epochs using Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), we extracted various features using statistical, time-domain and nonlinear dynamics characteristics from not only the original EEG signal but also the decomposed intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). A classification model with the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was trained and tested using 5-fold cross-validation on three different databases, i.e., the Sleep-EDF database available at Physionet, the DREAMS Subjects database and the database of Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). The results demonstrated that the analysis of IMFs derived from EEMD could provide substantial supplement to the classification of EEG sleep stages. In the tasks of 4-class and 5-class sleep staging, the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 93.1% and 91.9% for the Sleep-EDF database, 86.4% and 83.4% for the DREAMS Subjects database, and 87.5% and 85.8% for the SHHS database, respectively. Furthermore, our observation that prefrontal EEG derivations should be optimal choices might evoke promising application of wearable EEG devices on sleep monitoring because EEG signals can be easily obtained using dry electrodes on the forehead. Additionally, the proposed method is computationally efficient and should be valuable in real-time sleep-scoring. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A method of EEG signal coupling feature extraction based on weight permutation conditional mutual information (WPCMI) was proposed in this research. With the WPCMI method, coupling feature strength of two time series in Alpha1, Alpha2, Beta1, Beta2 and Gamma bands for aMCI with T2DM and NC with T2DM could be extracted respectively. Then selected three frequency bands coupling feature matrix with the help of multi-spectral image transformation method to map it as spectral image characteristics. And finally classified these characteristics through the convolution neural network method(CNN). For aMCI with T2DM and NC with T2DM, the highest classification accuracy of 96%, 95%, 95% could be achieved respectively in the combination of three frequency bands (Alpha1, Alpha2, Gamma), (Beta1, Beta2 and Gamma) and (Alpha2, Beta1, Beta2). This WPCMI method highlighted the coupling dynamic characteristics of EEG signals, and its classification performance was better than all previous methods in aMCI with T2DM diagnosis field. WPCMI method could be used as an effective biomarker to distinguish EEG signals of aMCI with T2DM and NC with T2DM.

J	Rakhmatulin, I				Rakhmatulin, Ildar			The electronic board to replace the reference voltage on the earlobe for EEG measurement	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						EEG measurement; Reference voltage for EEG; Neural network in EEG	BLINK; CLASSIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS	An unstable reference point is a critical problem for electroencephalography (EEG) research since its instability introduces a significant distortion into the interpretation of the EEG signal. The main requirement for a reference point - electric potential should be unchanged. This is extremely difficult to implement in practice, due to biological processes occurring in the human body. Unlike other artifacts (network noise, electrical noise, blinking) that can be solved both by using analog circuitry (bandpass filters for noise, etc.) and by using various mathematical methods (method of head components for eye blink, etc.), a change in the potential of the reference point during the EEG measurement will be present in any case. Today, for a reference point an earlobe and overall average referential reference are used. The problems of using these methods are described in many works. In this manuscript, we propose a new method of using the reference point, electric potential which is generated by a 24-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC). At the initial stage, a 24-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) reads the potential between the earlobes, and then on the STM 32 microcontroller through the DAC it generates such potential with an accuracy of 0.1 mu V. From this moment, to calculate the voltage at the electrode, the voltage at the output of the DAC is used as the reference potential. Subsequently, the ADC makes comparisons of the potential between two points in the earlobes, which ideally should equal 0 V. In the case, if the difference between earlobes voltage is more than 0.1 mu V, the DAC starts to compensate this value at its output, thereby averaging the value between the two earlobes. Algorithms in software to exclude instantaneous changes in potential on the earlobe were written in the STM32. Algorithms eliminate the uncontrolled effect of an increase of neuronal activity in the temporal region of the head. Thus, the developed prototype by DAC of the device replaces the potential on the earlobes and, based on mathematical calculations, provides a stable reference voltage for calculating the voltage on the electrodes.

Both technical state of the art as well as measures and cognitive concepts are systematically addressed. Background Modern work is increasingly characterized by information processing. Therefore, the examination of mental states, mental load, or cognitive processing during work is becoming increasingly important for ergonomics. Results Mobile EEG allows to measure mental states and processes under real live conditions. It can be used for various research questions in cognitive neuroergonomics. Besides measures in the frequency domain that have a long tradition in the investigation of mental fatigue, task load, and task engagement, new approaches-like blink-evoked potentials-render event-related analyses of the EEG possible also during unrestricted behavior. Conclusion Mobile EEG has become a valuable tool for evaluating mental states and mental processes on a highly objective level during work. The main advantage of this technique is that working environments don't have to be changed while systematically measuring brain functions at work. Moreover, the workflow is unaffected by such neuroergonomic approaches.

Causal decoding of individual cortical excitability states	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						TMS; EEG; Excitability; Brain state; Classification; Machine learning	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERNS; MOTOR EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MUSCLE RESPONSES; EEG; VARIABILITY; PHASE; CLASSIFICATION; PLASTICITY; FLUCTUATIONS	Brain responsiveness to stimulation fluctuates with rapidly shifting cortical excitability state, as reflected by oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG). For example, the amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of motor cortex changes from trial to trial. To date, individual estimation of the cortical processes leading to this excitability fluctuation has not been possible. Here, we propose a data-driven method to derive individually optimized EEG classifiers in healthy humans using a supervised learning approach that relates pre-TMS EEG activity dynamics to MEP amplitude. Our approach enables considering multiple brain regions and frequency bands, without defining them a priori, whose compound phase-pattern information determines the excitability. The individualized classifier leads to an increased classification accuracy of cortical excitability states from 57% to 67% when compared to mu-oscillation phase extracted by standard fixed spatial fillers. Results show that, for the used TMS protocol, excitability fluctuates predominantly in the mu-oscillation range, and relevant cortical areas cluster around the stimulated motor cortex, but between subjects there is variability in relevant power spectra, phases, and cortical regions. This novel decoding method allows causal investigation of the cortical excitability state, which is critical also for individualizing therapeutic brain stimulation.

The correspondence between EMG and EEG measures of changes in cortical excitability following transcranial magnetic stimulation	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article						motor cortex; motor&#8208; evoked potential; paired&#8208; pulse TMS; peripherally evoked potentials; spectral amplitude; TMS&#8208; EEG; TMS&#8208; evoked potential; transcranial magnetic stimulation		Key points TMS is commonly used to study excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmission in cortical circuits. Changes in cortical excitability following TMS are typically measured from hand (using EMG; limited to motor cortex) or scalp (using EEG); however, it is unclear whether these two measures represent the same activity when assessing motor cortex. We found that TMS-EMG and TMS-EEG measures of motor cortex excitability are differentially affected by sensory confounds at different time points, masking any actual relationship between them in the time domain. In the frequency domain, local high-frequency oscillations in EEG recordings were minimally confounded by sensory artefacts and demonstrated strong correlations with EMG measures of cortical excitability across time, regardless of TMS intensity or waveform. Therefore, despite the effects of sensory artefacts, the two measures of motor cortex excitability share a response component, suggesting that they index a similar cortical activity and perhaps the same neuronal population. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a powerful tool for investigating cortical circuits. Changes in cortical excitability following TMS are typically assessed by measuring changes in either conditioned motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) following paired-pulse TMS over motor cortex or evoked potentials measured with electroencephalography following single-pulse TMS (TEPs). However, it is unclear whether these two measures of cortical excitability index the same cortical response. Twenty-four healthy participants received local and interhemispheric paired-pulse TMS over motor cortex with eight inter-pulse intervals, sub- and suprathreshold conditioning intensities, and two different pulse waveforms, while MEPs were recorded from a hand muscle. TEPs were also recorded in response to single-pulse TMS using the conditioning pulse alone. The relationships between TEPs and conditioned-MEPs were evaluated using metrics sensitive to both their magnitude at each time point and their overall shape across time. The impacts of undesired sensory potentials resulting from TMS pulse and muscle contractions were also assessed on both measures. Both conditioned-MEPs and TEPs were sensitive to re-afferent somatosensory activity following motor-evoked responses, but over different post-stimulus time points. Moreover, the amplitude of low-frequency oscillations in TEPs was strongly correlated with the sensory potentials, whereas early and local high-frequency responses showed minimal relationships. Accordingly, conditioned-MEPs did not correlate with TEPs in the time domain but showed high shape similarity with the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations in TEPs. Therefore, despite the effects of sensory confounds, the TEP and MEP measures share a response component, suggesting that they index a similar cortical response and perhaps the same neuronal populations.

An EEG investigation of alpha and beta activity during resting states in adults with Williams syndrome	BMC PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Williams syndrome; EEG; Alpha; Beta; Attention; Inhibition	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; LONG-TERM-MEMORY; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; THETA/BETA RATIO; BRAIN; PERFORMANCE; SLEEP	Background Williams syndrome (WS) is neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by executive deficits of attention and inhibitory processing. The current study examined the neural mechanisms during resting states in adults with WS in order to investigate how this subserves the attention and inhibitory deficits associated with the syndrome. Method Adopting electroencephalography (EEG) methodology, cortical electrical activity was recorded from eleven adults with WS aged 35 + years during Eyes Closed (EC) and Eyes Open (EO) resting states, and compared to that of thirteen typically developing adults matched for chronological age (CA) and ten typically developing children matched for verbal mental ability (MA). Using mixed-design analyses of variance (ANOVA), analyses focused on the full alpha (8-12.5 Hz), low-alpha (8-10 Hz), upper-alpha (10-12.5 Hz), and beta (13-29.5 Hz) bands, as these are thought to have functional significance with attentional and inhibitory processes. Results No significant difference in alpha power were found between the WS and CA groups across all analyses, however a trend for numerically lower alpha power was observed in the WS group, consistent with other developmental disorders characterised by attentional/inhibitory deficits such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In contrast, comparable beta power between the WS and CA groups during both EC/EO conditions suggests that their baseline EEG signature is commensurate with successful attentional processing, though this needs to be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size. Analyses also revealed an unusual trend for low variability in the EEG signature of the WS group, which contradicts the heterogeneity typically observed behaviourally. Conclusions This novel finding of low variability in the EEG spectra in the WS group has been previously associated with poor behavioural performance in ADHD and is highly informative, highlighting future research needs to also consider how the role of low variability in the EEG profile of WS manifests in relation to their behavioural and cognitive profiles.

J	Zhang, YY; Liu, BL; Gao, XR				Zhang, Yuanyuan; Liu, Baolin; Gao, Xiaorong			Investigation of the interaction between emotion and working memory load using spatiotemporal pattern similarity analysis	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						emotion; working memory; event-related spectral perturbation; spatiotemporal pattern similarity; electroencephalography	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; COGNITIVE CONTROL; ALPHA POWER; EEG ALPHA; ATTENTION; BRAIN; TASK; RESPONSES; OSCILLATIONS	Objective. Accumulating evidence has revealed that emotions can be provided with the modulatory effect on working memory (WM) and WM load is an important factor for the interaction between emotion and WM. However, it remains controversial whether emotions inhibit or facilitate WM and the interaction between cognitive task, processing load and emotional processing remains unclear. Approach. In this study, we used a change detection paradigm wherein memory items have four different load sizes and emotion videos to induce three emotions (negative, neutral, and positive). We performed an event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analysis and a spatiotemporal pattern similarity (STPS) analysis on the electroencephalography data. Main results. The ERSP results indicated that alpha and beta oscillations can reflect the difference among WM load sizes and also can reflect the difference among emotions under middle high WM load over posterior brain region in the maintenance stage. Moreover, the STPS results demonstrated a significant interaction between emotion and WM load size in the posterior region and found significantly higher similarity indexes for the negative emotion to the neutral emotion under the middle high WM load during WM maintenance. In addition, The STPS results also revealed that both positive emotion and negative emotion could interfere with the distinction of load sizes. Significance. The consistence of the behavioral, ERSP and STPS results suggested that when the memory load approaches the limit of WM capacity, negative emotion could facilitate WM through the top-down attention modulation promoting the most relevant information storage during WM maintenance.

This case-control observational study measured beta electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillation in 12 right-handed adult male with chronic neuropathic pain and 10 matched controls (similar to 55 years). Participants were submitted to clinical evaluation (pain visual analog scale, Hospital Anxiety, and Depression scale) and a 24-min high-density EEG recording (BIOSEMI). Data were analyzed using the EEGlab toolbox (MATLAB), SPSS, and R. The global power spectrum computed within the low (L beta, 13-20 Hz) and the high (H beta, 20-30 Hz) beta frequency sub-bands was significantly lower in patients than in controls, and accordingly, L beta was negatively correlated to the pain visual analog scale (R = -0.931, p = 0.007), whereas H beta correlation was at the edge of significance (R = -0.805; p = 0.053). Patients' anxiety was correlated to pain intensity (R = 0.755; p = 0.003). Normalization of the low and high beta global power spectrum (GPS) to the GPS of the full frequency range, while confirming the significant L beta power decrease in chronic neuropathic pain patients, vanished the significance of the H beta decrease, as well as the correlation between L beta power and pain intensity. Our results suggest that the GABAergic L beta EEG oscillation is affected by chronic neuropathic pain. Confirming the L beta GPS decrease and the correlation with pain intensity in larger studies would open new opportunities for the clinical application of gamma-aminobutyric acid-modifying therapies.

Successful single trial classification holds potential for translation into the clinical realm for real-time detection of memory and other cognitive states to provide real-time interventions (i.e., brain-computer interfaces). However, most of these stud-ies -and classification analyses in general - do not make clear if the chosen methodology is optimally suited for the classification of memory-related brain states. To address this problem, we systematically compared different methods for every step of classification (i.e., feature extraction, feature selection, classifier selection) to investi-gate which methods work best for decoding episodic memory brain states -the first analysis of its kind. Using an adult lifespan sample EEG dataset collected during performance of an episodic context encoding and retrieval task, we found that no specific feature type (including Common Spatial Pattern (CSP)-based features, mean, vari -ance, correlation, features based on AR model, entropy, phase, and phase synchronization) outperformed others consistently in distinguishing different memory classes. However, extracting all of these feature types consistently outperformed extracting only one type of feature. Additionally, the combination of filtering and sequential for-ward selection was the optimal method to select the effective features compared to filtering alone or performing no feature selection at all. Moreover, although all classifiers performed at a fairly similar level, LASSO was con-sistently the highest performing classifier compared to other commonly used options (i.e., naive Bayes, SVM, and logistic regression) while naive Bayes was the fastest classifier. Lastly, for multiclass classification (i.e., levels of context memory confidence and context feature perception), generalizing the binary classification using the binary decision tree performed better than the voting or one versus rest method. These methods were shown to outperform alternative approaches for three orthogonal datasets (i.e., EEG working memory, EEG motor imagery, and MEG working memory), supporting their generalizability. Our results provide an optimized methodological process for classifying single-trial neural data and provide important insight and recommendations for a cognitive neuroscientist's ability to make informed choices at all stages of the classification process for predicting memory and other cognitive states.

In this article, we developed an immersive visuo-haptic task for conducting stimulus-response measurements. Visual cues were randomly provided to signify the required amplitude and tolerance of fingertip force. Participants were required to respond to the visual cues by pressing force transducers using their fingertips. Response time variation was taken as a behavioral measure of sustained attention states during the task. 50% low-variability trials were classified as the optimal state and the other high-variability trials were classified as the suboptimal state using z-scoring over time. A 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition system was used to collect brain activities during the tasks. The haptics-elicited potential amplitude at 20 similar to 40 ms in latency and over the frontal-central region significantly decreased in the optimal state. Furthermore, the alpha-band power in the spectra of 8 similar to 13 Hz was significantly suppressed in the frontal-central, right temporal, and parietal regions in the optimal state. Taken together, we have identified neuroelectrophysiological features that were associated with sustained attention during multi-finger force control tasks, which would be potentially used in the development of closed-loop attention detection and training systems exploiting haptic interaction.

Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation to the Primary Motor Cortex Reduces Cortical Inhibition: A TMS-EEG Study	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						transcranial magnetic stimulation; TMS-evoked potentials; primary motor cortex; cortical inhibition	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; BRAIN; AREA; NETWORK; HUMANS; IMPACT; RTMS; EMG; POTENTIALS	Introduction: The aim of this study was to reveal the effects of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) in modulating cortical networks using transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) recording. Methods: Eighteen young adults participated in our study and received iTBS to the primary motor cortex (M1), supplementary motor area, and the primary visual cortex in three separate sessions. A finger tapping task and ipsilateral single-pulse TMS-EEG recording for the M1 were administrated before and after iTBS in each session. The effects of iTBS in motor performance and TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) were investigated. Results: The results showed that iTBS to the M1, but not supplementary motor area or the primary visual cortex, significantly reduced the N100 amplitude of M1 TEPs in bilateral hemispheres (p = 0.019), with a more prominent effect in the contralateral hemisphere than in the stimulated hemisphere. Moreover, only iTBS to the M1 decreased global mean field power (corrected ps < 0.05), interhemispheric signal propagation (t = 2.53, p = 0.030), and TMS-induced early alpha-band synchronization (p = 0.020). Conclusion: Our study confirmed the local and remote after-effects of iTBS in reducing cortical inhibition in the M1. TMS-induced oscillations after iTBS for changed cortical excitability in patients with various neurological and psychiatric conditions are worth further exploration.

The present study aimed to fill this gap by examining the persistence of mental fatigue on behavior and electrophysiological mechanisms. Fifteen participants performed an arm-pointing task consisting of reaching a target as fast as possible, before carrying out a 32-min cognitively demanding task [Time Load Dual Back (TLDB) task], and immediately, 10 and 20 min after completion of the TLDB task. During the experiment, electroencephalography was continuously recorded. The significant increase in mental fatigue feeling after the TLDB task was followed by a decrease during the 20 min of recovery without returning to premeasurement values. Brain oscillations recorded at rest during the recovery period showed an increase in both theta and alpha power over time, suggesting a persistence of mental fatigue. Arm-pointing movement duration increased gradually over time during the recovery period, indicating that behavioral performance remained impaired 20 min after the end of the cognitively demanding task. To conclude, subjective measurements indicated a partial recovery of mental fatigue following a cognitively demanding task, whereas electrophysiological and behavioral markers suggested that the effects of mental fatigue persisted for at least 20 min. While the subjective evaluation of mental fatigue is a very practical way to attest the presence of mental fatigue, electrophysiological and behavioral measures seem more relevant to evaluate the time course of mental fatigue effects.

However, the role of FC in the context of brain-computer interface applications is still poorly understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we considered a group of 20 healthy subjects during an EEG-based hand motor imagery (MI) task. We studied two well-established FC estimators, i.e. spectral- and imaginary-coherence, and we investigated how they were modulated by the MI task. We characterized the resulting FC networks by extracting the strength of connectivity of each EEG sensor and we compared the discriminant power with respect to standard power spectrum features. At the group level, results showed that while spectral-coherence based network features were increasing in the sensorimotor areas, those based on imaginary-coherence were significantly decreasing. We demonstrated that this opposite, but complementary, behavior was respectively determined by the increase in amplitude and phase synchronization between the brain signals. At the individual level, we eventually assessed the potential of these network connectivity features in a simple off-line classification scenario. Taken together, our results provide fresh insights into the oscillatory mechanisms subserving brain network changes during MI and offer new perspectives to improve BCI performance.

The eyes-closed resting state EEGs were recorded in 15 children at a yearly basis during the developmental period from 8 to 16-17 years. Age-related changes in EEG connectivity were explored by coherence (functional connectivity) and Granger causality (GC, considered as effective connectivity) analyses in frequency and time domains, which were carried out in delta (1.6-4 Hz), theta (4-7.5 Hz), alphal (7.5-9.5 Hz), alpha2 (9.5-12.5 Hz), betal (12.5-18 Hz), beta2 (18-30 Hz), and common (1.6-30 Hz) frequency bands. The coherence analysis revealed maturation effects reflected in an increased connectivity in all frequency bands. Most pronounced changes of EEG coherence were revealed in alpha2, betal, and common frequency bands. The interhemispheric frontal-parietal functional connectivity increased both in boys and girls. Additionally, in boys, interhemispheric functional connectivity increased between the central and temporal areas in alpha2 and common bands. In girls, there was observed an increase in intrahemispheric anterior-posterior functional connectivity in the alpha2 frequency band. The changes in effective connectivity in boys indicate an increased bidirectional information flow (revealed by the GC analysis) from the default mode network (DMN) to the frontoparietal network (FPN) and vice versa. By contrast, in girls, the information flow increases from the frontal to parietal areas (FPN), and decreasing between the central and frontal areas (sensorimotor network). The data suggest different age-related trends in the maturation of connectivity between the brain networks and different role of top-down and bottom-up regulation processes in boys compared to girls.

This study aims to improve the BCI performance by integrating electroencephalographic and cerebral hemodynamic patterns. Sixteen volunteers participated in a seven-session motor imagery (MI) based visual-haptic neurofeedback training (NFT) experiment. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) signals were synchronously recorded during the transient NFT. Time-frequency and topology analysis demonstrated that repetitive and continuous visual-haptic NFT conditions could induce an enhancement on cortical activations. Additionally, a classifier calibration strategy was proposed by integrating both the EEG and NIRS information into a strong classifier. The results revealed that the classifier constructed on integrating EEG and NIRS patterns was significantly superior to that only with independent information, achieving similar to 14% and 5% improvement respectively and reaching 84.5% in mean classification accuracy. Therefore, integrating EEG and NIRS patterns is an effective classifier calibration strategy to improve the MI-BCI performance, and could also be applied to other BCI paradigms.

These include symptoms such as delusions of control, i.e. the belief that one's actions are controlled by an external agent. Models of self-disorders point at altered neural mechanisms of source monitoring, i.e. the ability of the brain to discriminate self-generated stimuli from those driven by the environment. However, evidence supporting this putative relationship is currently lacking. We performed electroencephalography (EEG) during self-paced, brisk right fist closures in ten (M=9; F=1) patients with Early-Course Schizophrenia (ECSCZ) and age and gender-matched healthy volunteers. We measured the Readiness Potential (RP), i.e. an EEG feature preceding self-generated movements, and movement-related EEG spectral changes. Self-disorders in ECSCZ were assessed with the Examination of Anomalous Self-Experience (EASE). Patients showed a markedly reduced RP and altered post-movement Event-Related Synchronization (ERS) in the beta frequency band (14-24 Hz) compared to healthy controls. Importantly, smaller RP and weaker ERS were associated with higher EASE scores in ECSCZ. Our data suggest that disturbances of neural correlates preceding and following self-initiated movements may reflect the severity of self-disorders in patients suffering from ECSCZ. These findings point towards deficits in basic mechanisms of sensorimotor integration as a substrate for self-disorders.

The method was designed to analyze electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), and tremorogram data collected from patients with Parkinson's disease. The idea of the method of wave train electrical activity analysis is that we consider the biomedical signal as a combination of the wave trains. The wave train is the increase in the power spectral density of the signal localized in time, frequency, and space. We detect the wave trains as the local maxima in the wavelet spectrograms. We do not consider wave trains as a special kind of signal. The wave train analysis method is different from standard signal analysis methods such as Fourier analysis and wavelet analysis in the following way. Existing methods for analyzing EEG, EMG, and tremor signals, such as wavelet analysis, focus on local time-frequency changes in the signal and therefore do not reveal the generalized properties of the signal. Other methods such as standard Fourier analysis ignore the local time-frequency changes in the characteristics of the signal and, consequently, lose a large amount of information that existed in the signal. The method of wave train electrical activity analysis resolves the contradiction between these two approaches because it addresses the generalized characteristics of the biomedical signal based on local time-frequency changes in the signal. We investigate the following wave train parameters: wave train central frequency, wave train maximal power spectral density, wave train duration in periods, and wave train bandwidth. We have developed special graphical diagrams, named AUC diagrams, to determine what wave trains are characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases. In this paper, we consider the following types of AUC diagrams: 2D and 3D diagrams. The technique of working with AUC diagrams is illustrated by examples of analysis of EMG in patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy volunteers. It is demonstrated that new regularities useful for the high-accuracy diagnosis of Parkinson's disease can be revealed using the method of analyzing the wave train electrical activity and AUC diagrams.

The time-locked neurodynamics of semantic processing in autism spectrum disorder: an EEG study	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Semantic processing; EEG coherence; Autism spectrum disorder; Language	HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ARCUATE FASCICULUS; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; YOUNG-CHILDREN; WHITE-MATTER; LANGUAGE; COHERENCE; BRAIN; CONNECTIVITY	Language processing is often an area of difficulty in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Semantic processing-the ability to add meaning to a stimulus-is thought to be especially affected in ASD. However, the neurological origin of these deficits, both structurally and temporally, have yet to be discovered. To further previous behavioral findings on language differences in ASD, the present study used an implicit semantic priming paradigm and electroencephalography (EEG) to compare the level of theta coherence throughout semantic processing, between typically developing (TD) and ASD participants. Theta coherence is an indication of synchronous EEG oscillations and was of particular interest due to its previous links with semantic processing. Theta coherence was analyzed in response to semantically related or unrelated pairs of words and pictures across bilateral short, medium, and long electrode connections. We found significant results across a variety of conditions, but most notably, we observed reduced coherence for language stimuli in the ASD group at a left fronto-parietal connection from 100 to 300 ms. This replicates previous findings of underconnectivity in left fronto-parietal language networks in ASD. Critically, the early time window of this underconnectivity, from 100 to 300 ms, suggests that impaired semantic processing of language in ASD may arise during pre-semantic processing, during the initial communication between lower-level linguistic processing and higher-level semantic processing. Our results suggest that language processing functions are unique in ASD compared to TD, and that subjects with ASD might rely on a temporally different language processing loop altogether.

Previous studies suggest that bilateral somatosensory inputs interact differently depending on stimulus characteristics, including their noxious nature. The aim of this study was to clarify how bilateral inputs evoked by noxious laser stimuli, noxious shocks, and innocuous shocks interact in terms of perception and brain responses. The experiment comprised two conditions (right-hand stimulation and concurrent stimulation of both hands) in which painful laser stimuli, painful shocks and non-painful shocks were delivered. Perception, somatosensory-evoked potentials (P45, N100, P260), laser-evoked potentials (N1, N2 and P2) and event-related spectral perturbations (delta to gamma oscillation power) were compared between conditions and stimulus modalities. The amplitude of negative vertex potentials (N2 or N100) and the power of delta/theta oscillations were increased in the bilateral compared with unilateral condition, regardless of the stimulus type (P < 0.01). However, gamma oscillation power increased for painful and non-painful shocks (P < 0.01), but not for painful laser stimuli (P = 0.08). Despite the similarities in terms of brain activity, bilateral inputs interacted differently for painful stimuli, for which perception remained unchanged, and non-painful stimuli, for which perception increased. This may reflect a ceiling effect for the attentional capture by noxious stimuli and warrants further investigations to examine the regulation of such interactions by bottom-up and top-down processes.

HCD decomposes multivariate time series into spatiotemporal harmonic modes with the leading modes representing dominant oscillatory patterns in the data. HCD is closely related to data-adaptive harmonic decomposition (DAHD) [Chekroun and Kondrashov, Chaos 27, 093110 (2017)] in that it performs an eigendecomposition of a grand matrix containing lagged cross-correlations. As for DAHD, each HCD mode is uniquely associated with a Fourier frequency, which allows for the definition of multidimensional power and phase spectra. Unlike in DAHD, however, HCD does not exhibit a systematic dependency on the ordering of the channels within the grand matrix. Further, HCD phase spectra can be related to the phase relations in the data in an intuitive way. We compare HCD with DAHD and multivariate singular spectrum analysis, a third related correlation-based decomposition, and we give illustrative applications to a simple traveling wave, as well as to simulations of three coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators and to human EEG recordings.

Gratton proposed that alpha and theta oscillations are both related to cognitive control function, though in a complementary manner. Alpha activity is hypothesized to facilitate the maintenance of representations, such as task sets in preparation for expected task conditions. In contrast, theta activity would facilitate changes in representations, such as the updating of task sets in response to unpredicted task demands. Therefore, theta should be related to reactive control (which may prompt changes in task representations), while alpha may be more relevant to proactive control (which implies the maintenance of current task representations). Less is known about the possible relationship between 1/f activity and cognitive control, which was analyzed here in an exploratory fashion. To investigate these hypothesized relationships, we recorded eyes-open and eyes-closed resting-state EEG from younger and older adults and subsequently tested their performance on a cued flanker task, expected to elicit both proactive and reactive control processes. Results showed that alpha power and 1/f offset were smaller in older than younger adults, whereas theta power did not show age-related reductions. Resting alpha power and 1/f offset were associated with proactive control processes, whereas theta power was related to reactive control as measured by the cued flanker task. All associations were present over and above the effect of age, suggesting that these resting-state EEG correlates could be indicative of trait-like individual differences in cognitive control performance, which may be already evident in younger adults, and are still similarly present in healthy older adults.

Event detection in single trial EEG during attention and memory related task	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						brain computer interface; BCI; P300-event related potential; attention; adaptive filter; ensemble averaging; moving averager; latency; SNR; short-time Fourier transform; STFT; time-domain; frequency-domain	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; BCI; COMPONENT	P300 is an endogenous event related potential (ERP) elicited by a rare or significant visual stimulus and is widely preferred in brain computer interface (BCI) to assess the cognition level of the subject. Many researchers contribute to P300 estimation as this signal is of very low strength in background electroencephalogram (EEG) activity. This paper proposes a novel signal processing algorithm to detect the P300 event in a single trial EEG acquired from midline electrode sites in oddball paradigm to evaluate attention and memory related tasks of subjects. The algorithm incorporates wavelet combined adaptive noise canceller followed by ensemble and moving averager. Time domain analysis shows the localisation of ERP around 300 ms for target stimuli attended by the subjects. The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) analysis shows strong theta activity associated to memory related task. Thus, the proposed algorithm is efficient in detecting the P300 with higher correlation coefficient of 0.82 (average) compared to other existing methods.

Using a novel auditory oddball paradigm (Goldman et al., 2020) which enables us to disassociate a deviant (i.e. musical chord inversion) from a consistent functional class, we recorded scalp EEG from a group of musicians who spanned a range of improvisational and classically trained experience. Using a spatiospectral based inter and intra network connectivity analysis, we found that improvisers showed a variety of differences in connectivity within and between large-scale cortical networks compared to classically trained musicians, as a function of deviant type. Inter-network connectivity in the alpha band, for a time window leading up to the behavioural response, was strongly linked to improvisation experience, with the default mode network acting as a hub. Spatiospectral networks post response were substantially different between improvisers and classically trained musicians, with greater inter-network connectivity (specific to the alpha and beta bands) seen in improvisers whereas those with more classical training had largely reduced inter-network activity (mostly in the gamma band). More generally, we interpret our findings in the context of network-level correlates of expectation violation as a function of subject expertise, and we discuss how these may generalize to other and more ecologically valid scenarios.

Results indicate no theta-power changes between conditions, challenging previous findings that increased theta power is a marker of hypnosis. A decrease in gamma power under hypnotic suggestion and an almost significant decrease under neutral hypnosis were observed, compared to post-hypnosis. Anteroposterior power distribution remained stable over all conditions. The results are discussed and compared to earlier studies, which report heterogenous findings.

Increased alpha suppression with age during involuntary memory retrieval	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						aging; cognitive control; intentionality; memory; oscillations	OLDER-ADULTS; AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORIES; DIVIDED ATTENTION; PARIETAL CORTEX; EPISODIC MEMORY; EEG-ALPHA; DESYNCHRONIZATION ERD; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INTENTIONAL USES; WORKING-MEMORY	Recent work suggests that while voluntary episodic memory declines with age, involuntary episodic memory, which comes to mind spontaneously without intention, remains relatively intact. However, the neurophysiology underlying these differences has yet to be established. The current study used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate voluntary and involuntary retrieval in older and younger adults. Participants first encoded sounds, half of which were paired with pictures, the other half unpaired. EEG was then recorded as they listened to the sounds, with participants in the involuntary group performing a sound localization cover task, and those in the voluntary group additionally attempting to recall the associated pictures. Participants later reported which sounds brought the paired picture to mind during the localization task. Reaction times on the localization task were slower for voluntary than involuntary retrieval and for paired than unpaired sounds, possibly reflecting increased attentional demands of voluntary retrieval and interference from reactivation of the associated pictures respectively. For the EEG analyses, young adults showed greater alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) during voluntary than involuntary retrieval at frontal and occipital sites, while older adults showed pronounced alpha ERD regardless of intention. Additionally, older adults showed greater ERD for paired than unpaired sounds at occipital sites, likely reflecting visual reactivation of the associated pictures. Young adults did not show this alpha ERD memory effect. Taken together, these data suggest that involuntary memory is largely preserved with age, but this may be due to older adults' greater recruitment of top-down control even when demand for such control is limited.

Accurately predicting seizures enable doctors and patients to carry out medical prevention timely. In seizure prediction studies, single-domain information input (time domain or frequency domain, Etc.) neglects some parts' information from signals. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework named channel attention dual-input convolutional neural network (CADCNN) to obtain the signal's useful information fully. The spatial-temporal features extracted by short-time Fourier transform (STFT) are fed to the CADCNN, and the raw EEG signals are fed for further feature extraction. With the fusion of two inputs from different domains and the combination of channel attention, CADCNN can learn faithful and distinguishable representations of EEG signals and boost the temporal, spectrum, and spatial information utilization capability. We evaluate the proposed method using the Boston Children's Hospital-MIT scalp EEG public datasets. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the sensitivity, false prediction rate, specificity, and AUC of our proposed method reach 97.1%, 0.029h, 95.6%, and 0.917, respectively, presenting better performance and higher prediction accuracy.

Typically, these analyses are constrained to regions of interest to avoid the curse of dimensionality, with the latter leading to conservative hypothesis testing. New method: We removed such constraint by estimating high-dimensional source-based M/EEG-FC using cluster permutation statistic (CPS) and demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by identifying resting-state changes in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease. Particularly, we proposed a unified framework for CPS analysis together with a novel neighbourhood measure to estimate more compact and neurophysiological plausible neural communication. As clusters could more confidently reveal interregional communication, we proposed and tested a cluster-strength index to demonstrate other advantages of CPS analysis. Results: We found clusters of increased communication or hypersynchronization in MCI compared to healthy controls in delta (1-4 Hz) and higher-theta (6-8 Hz) bands oscillations. These mainly consisted of interactions between occipitofrontal and occipitotemporal regions in the left hemisphere, which may be critically affected in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Conclusions: Our approach could be important to create high-resolution FC maps from neuroimaging studies in general, allowing the multimodal analysis of neural communication across multiple spatial scales. Particularly, FC clusters more robustly represent the interregional communication by identifying dense bundles of connections that are less sensitive to inter-individual anatomical and functional variability. Overall, this approach could help to better understand neural information processing in healthy and disease conditions as needed for developing biomarker research.

J	Anuragi, A; Sisodia, DS; Pachori, RB				Anuragi, Arti; Sisodia, Dilip Singh; Pachori, Ram Bilas			Automated FBSE-EWT based learning framework for detection of epileptic seizures using time-segmented EEG signals	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Accumulated features; Epilepsy; CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset; EEG signals; FBSE-EWT; LS-SVM classifier	LINE LENGTH FEATURE; LEAST-SQUARES; PHASE-SPACE; CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES; PATTERN	Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that has severely affected many people's lives across the world. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are used to characterize the brain's state and detect various disorders. The EEG signals are non-stationary and non-linear in nature. Therefore, it is challenging to accurately process and learn from the recorded EEG signals in order to detect disorders like epilepsy. This paper proposed an automated learning framework using the Fourier-Bessel series expansion-based empirical wavelet transform (FBSE-EWT) method for detecting epileptic seizures from EEG signals. The scale-space boundary detection method was adopted to segment the Fourier-Bessel series expansion (FBSE) spectrum of multiple frame-size time-segmented EEG signals. Multiple frame-size time-segmented EEG signal's analysis was done using four different frame sizes: full, half, quarter, and half-quarter length of recorded EEG signals. Two different time-segmentation approaches were investigated on EEG signals: 1) segmenting signals based on multiple frame-size and 2) segmenting signals based on multiple frame-size with zero-padding the remaining signal. The FBSE-EWT method was applied to decompose the EEG signals into narrow sub-band signals. Features such as line-length (LL), log-energy-entropy (LEnt), and norm-entropy (NEnt) were computed from various frequency range sub-band signals. The relief-F feature ranking method was employed to select the most significant features; this reduces the computational burden of the models. The top-ranked accumulated features were used for classification using least square support machine learning (LS-SVM), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and ensemble bagged tree classifiers. The proposed framework for epileptic seizure detection was evaluated on two publicly available benchmark EEG datasets: the Bonn EEG dataset and Children's Hospital Boston (CHB) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), well known as the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset. Training and testing of the models were performed using the 10-fold cross-validation technique. The FBSE-EWT based learning framework was compared with other state-of-the-art methods using both datasets. Experimental results showed that the proposed framework achieved 100 % classification accuracy on the Bonn EEG dataset, whereas 99.84 % classification accuracy on the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset.

Differentiating transcranial magnetic stimulation cortical and auditory responses via single pulse and paired pulse protocols: A TMS-EEG study	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						TMS-EEG; Sham TMS; Long interval cortical inhibition; TMS-evoked potential	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; INHIBITION; MOTOR; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS	Objective: We measured the neurophysiological responses of both active and sham transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for both single pulse (SP) and paired pulse (PP; long interval cortical inhibition (LICI)) paradigms using TMS-EEG (electroencephalography). Methods: Nineteen healthy subjects received active and sham (coil 90 degrees tilted and touching the scalp) SP and PP TMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We measured excitability through SP TMS and inhibition (i.e., cortical inhibition (CI)) through PP TMS. Results: Cortical excitability indexed by area under the curve (AUC((25-275ms))) was significantly higher in the active compared to sham stimulation (F(1,18) = 43.737, p < 0.001, eta(2) = 0.708). Moreover, the amplitude of N100-P200 complex was significantly larger (F(1,18) = 9.118, p < 0.01, eta(2) = 0.336) with active stimulation (10.38 +/- 9.576 mu V) compared to sham (4.295 +/- 2.323 mu V). Significant interaction effects were also observed between active and sham stimulation for both the SP and PP (i.e., LICI) cortical responses. Finally, only active stimulation (CI = 0.64 +/- 0.23, p < 0.001) resulted in significant cortical inhibition. Conclusion: The significant differences between active and sham stimulation in both excitatory and inhibitory neurophysiological responses showed that active stimulation elicits responses from the cortex that are different from the non-specific effects of sham stimulation. Significance: Our study reaffirms that TMS-EEG represents an effective tool to evaluate cortical neurophysiology with high fidelity.

One of the most crucial domains that BCIs cater to is prosthetics, orthotics and rehabilitation devices. Such devices aim to better the lives of specially-abled people. Motor Imagery or Movement Intention (MI) neural signals are collected to obtain a better insight of the underlying neural activities. EEG is the most popular modality for obtaining neural signals due to its advantages like non-invasiveness, portability, and the ease of use. The utilization of MI EEG signals to design BCIs has been heavily exploited. Spectral estimation methods have been exploited to delineate different MI tasks. This article focusses on exploring channel-wise temporal and spectral features of MI EEG signals. A rich MI EEG dataset involving five different motor imageries has been utilized in this study. The analysis based upon channel-wise temporal and spectral decomposition involves two major biomarkers, Event Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) and Inter Trial Coherence (ITC). ERSP can be considered as a generalization of power increase and decrease within a frequency range of interest. ITC reflects consistency of rhythms across the trials. This article aims to exploit ERSP and ITC methods to explore relevant time segment, frequency range and informative channels associated to MI signatures.

Eye-blink artifact removal from single channel EEG with k-means and SSA	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							EMPIRICAL-MODE DECOMPOSITION; SIGNALS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; CLASSIFICATION; SEPARATION	In recent years, the usage of portable electroencephalogram (EEG) devices are becoming popular for both clinical and non-clinical applications. In order to provide more comfort to the subject and measure the EEG signals for several hours, these devices usually consists of fewer EEG channels or even with a single EEG channel. However, electrooculogram (EOG) signal, also known as eye-blink artifact, produced by involuntary movement of eyelids, always contaminate the EEG signals. Very few techniques are available to remove these artifacts from single channel EEG and most of these techniques modify the uncontaminated regions of the EEG signal. In this paper, we developed a new framework that combines unsupervised machine learning algorithm (k-means) and singular spectrum analysis (SSA) technique to remove eye blink artifact without modifying actual EEG signal. The novelty of the work lies in the extraction of the eye-blink artifact based on the time-domain features of the EEG signal and the unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The extracted eye-blink artifact is further processed by the SSA method and finally subtracted from the contaminated single channel EEG signal to obtain the corrected EEG signal. Results with synthetic and real EEG signals demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the existing methods. Moreover, the frequency based measures [the power spectrum ratio (Gamma) and the mean absolute error (MAE)] also show that the proposed method does not modify the uncontaminated regions of the EEG signal while removing the eye-blink artifact.

Resting-state brain oscillations predict cognitive function in psychiatric disorders: A transdiagnostic machine learning approach	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Resting-state EEG; Transdiagnostic psychiatry; Machine learning; Cognitive function	EEG ALPHA; WAVE FREQUENCY; MEMORY; BAND; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION; SYNCHRONY; ATTENTION; NETWORKS	Background: Cognitive dysfunction is widespread in psychiatric disorders and can significantly impact quality of life. Deficits cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries, necessitating new approaches to understand how cognitive function relates to large-scale brain activity and psychiatric symptoms across the diagnostic spectrum. Objective: Using random forest regression, we aimed to identify transdiagnostic patterns linking cognitive function to resting-state EEG oscillations. Methods: 216 participants recruited through an outpatient psychiatric clinic completed the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery and underwent a 5-minute eyes-closed resting state EEG recording. We built random forest regression models to predict performance on each cognitive test using the resting-state EEG power spectrum as input, and we compared model performance to a sampling distribution constructed with random permutations. For models that performed significantly better than chance, we used feature importance estimates to identify features of the EEG power spectrum that are predictive of cognitive functioning. Results: Random forest models successfully predicted performance on measures of episodic memory and associative learning (Paired Associates Learning, PAL), information processing speed (Choice Reaction Time, CRT), and attentional set-shifting and executive function (Intra-Extra Dimensional Set Shift, IED). Oscillatory power in the upper alpha range was associated with better performance on PAL and CRT, while low alpha power was associated with worse CRT performance. Beta power predicted poor performance on all three tests. Theta power was associated with good performance on PAL, and delta and theta oscillations were identified as predictors of good performance on IED. No differences in cognitive performance were found between diagnostic categories. Conclusion: Resting oscillations are predictive of certain dimensions of cognitive function across various psychiatric disorders. These findings may inform treatment development to improve cognition.

However, the lack of knowledge of brain disease's underlying mechanisms and ineffective neuropharmacological therapy have led to further exploration of optimal treatments and brain monitoring techniques. Objective This study aims to review the current state of brain disorders, which utilize transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) and daily usable noninvasive neuroimaging techniques. Furthermore, the second goal of this study is to highlight available gaps and provide a comprehensive guideline for further investigation. Method A systematic search was conducted of the PubMed and Web of Science databases from January 2000 to October 2020 using relevant keywords. Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy were selected as noninvasive neuroimaging modalities. Nine brain disorders were investigated in this study, including Alzheimer's disease, depression, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, stroke, schizophrenia, and traumatic brain injury. Results Sixty-seven studies (1,385 participants) were included for quantitative analysis. Most of the articles (82.6%) employed transcranial direct current stimulation as an intervention method with modulation parameters of 1 mA intensity (47.2%) for 16-20 min (69.0%) duration of stimulation in a single session (36.8%). The frontal cortex (46.4%) and the cerebral cortex (47.8%) were used as a neuroimaging modality, with the power spectrum (45.7%) commonly extracted as a quantitative EEG feature. Conclusion An appropriate stimulation protocol applying tES as a therapy could be an effective treatment for cognitive and neurological brain disorders. However, the optimal tES criteria have not been defined; they vary across persons and disease types. Therefore, future work needs to investigate a closed-loop tES with monitoring by neuroimaging techniques to achieve personalized therapy for brain disorders.

We investigated the effects of tSMS over the left primary motor cortex (M1) for 20 min on the local electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum and interregional EEG coupling. Twelve right-handed healthy subjects participated in this crossover, double-blind, sham-controlled study. Resting-state EEG data were recorded for 3 min before the intervention and 17 min after the beginning of the intervention. The power spectrum at the left central electrode (C3) and the weighted phase lag index (wPLI) between C3 and the other electrodes was calculated for theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and beta (12-30 Hz) frequencies. The tSMS significantly increased theta power at C3 and the functional coupling in the theta band between C3 and the parietal midline electrodes. The tSMS over the left M1 for 20 min exhibited modulatory effects on local cortical activity and interregional functional coupling in the theta band. The neural oscillations in the theta band may have an important role in the neurophysiological effects induced by tSMS over the frontal cortex.

However, the neural oscillatory mechanisms underlying unconscious priming of externally and intentionally generated inhibition remain unclear. This study aimed to explore this issue by extracting oscillatory power dynamics from electroencephalographic data with participants performing an unconscious version of the Go/No-Go/Choose task involving subliminally presented primes. The participants presented prolonged response times upon being instructed or intentionally deciding to commit a ?Go? response following a No-Go prime compared with those following a Go prime. This indicates that unconscious inhibitory processes can be externally and intentionally initiated. Time-frequency analysis indicated increased theta band oscillatory power on the forced Go response following a No-Go prime compared with that following a Go prime. Contrastingly, there was pronounced alpha/low-beta band oscillatory power on the free-choice Go response following a No-Go prime compared with that following a Go prime. Moreover, there was a positive correlation of theta and alpha/low-beta band oscillations with human behavior performance related to the two distinct unconscious inhibitory processes. Our findings delineate dissociable neural oscillatory mechanisms underlying the unconscious priming of externally and intentionally initiated inhibition. Moreover, they might provide complementary neural oscillatory evidence supporting the discrepancy between instructed and voluntary human action control.

As the control signal of the brain-computer interface (BCI), EEG may build a bridge between humans and computers to improve the life quality for patients with movement disorders. The collected EEG signals are extremely susceptible to the contamination of electromyography (EMG) artifacts, affecting their original characteristics. Therefore, EEG denoising is an essential preprocessing step in any BCI system. Previous studies have confirmed that the combination of ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) can effectively suppress EMG artifacts. However, the time-consuming iterative process of EEMD may limit the application of the EEMD-CCA method in real-time monitoring of BCI. Compared with the existing EEMD, the recently proposed signal serialization based EEMD (sEEMD) is a good choice to provide effective signal analysis and fast mode decomposition. In this study, an EMG denoising method based on sEEMD and CCA is discussed. All of the analyses are carried out on semi-simulated data. The results show that, in terms of frequency and amplitude, the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) decomposed by sEEMD are consistent with the IMFs obtained by EEMD. There is no significant difference in the ability to separate EMG artifacts from EEG signals between the sEEMD-CCA method and the EEMD-CCA method (p > 0.05). Even in the case of heavy contamination (signal-to-noise ratio is less than 2 dB), the relative root mean squared error is about 0.3, and the average correlation coefficient remains above 0.9. The running speed of the sEEMD-CCA method to remove EMG artifacts is significantly improved in comparison with that of EEMD-CCA method (p < 0.05). The running time of the sEEMD-CCA method for three lengths of semi-simulated data is shortened by more than 50%. This indicates that sEEMD-CCA is a promising tool for EMG artifact removal in real-time BCI systems.

A publication by Park and Whang shows measurements of excitations in the frequency range below 1 Hz. A similar correlation for frequencies between 1 Hz and 40 Hz has not yet been clarified. In order to evaluate small oscillations, a pupillometer with a spatial resolution of 1 mu m is required, exceeding the specifications of existing systems. In this paper, we present a setup able to measure with such a resolution. We consider noise sources, and identify the quantisation noise due to finite pixel sizes as the fundamental noise source. We present a model to describe the quantisation noise, and show that our algorithm to measure the pupil diameter achieves a sub-pixel resolution of about half a pixel of the image or 12 mu m. We further consider the processing gains from transforming the diameter time series into frequency space, and subsequently show that we can achieve a sub-micron resolution when measuring pupil oscillations, surpassing established pupillometry systems. This setup could allow for the development of a functional optical, fully-remote electroencephalograph (EEG). Such a device could be a valuable sensor in many areas of AI-based human-machine-interaction.

Methods Thirty-nine children with infantile spasms were enrolled and divided into seizure-free and non-seizure-free groups after ACTH treatment. Patients who were seizure-free were further divided into relapse and non-relapse subgroups based on the observations made during a 6-month follow-up period. Scalp ripples were detected and compared during the interictal periods before and after 2 weeks of treatment. Results After ACTH treatment, the number and channels of ripples were significantly lower, whereas the percentage decrease in the number, spectral power, and channels of ripples was significantly higher in the seizure-free group than in the non-seizure-free group. In addition, the relapse subgroup showed higher number and spectral power and wider distribution of ripples than did the non-relapse subgroup. Changes in HFOs in terms of number, spectral power, and channel of ripples were closely related to the severity of epilepsy and can indicate disease susceptibility. Significance Scalp HFOs can be used as an effective biomarker to monitor the effect and evaluate the prognosis of ACTH therapy in patients with infantile spasms.

Inconsistencies in the literature may be related to between-study differences in task difficulty. Therefore, we aimed to determine the effects of age and task difficulty on motor learning and associated brain activity. We used task-related electroencephalography (EEG) power in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) frequency bands to assess neural plasticity before, immediately after, and 24-h after practice of a mirror star tracing task at one of three difficulty levels in healthy younger (19-24 yr) and older (65-86 yr) adults. Results showed an age-related deterioration in motor performance that was more pronounced with increasing task difficulty and was accompanied by a more bilateral activity pattern for older vs. younger adults. Task difficulty affected motor skill retention and neural plasticity specifically in older adults. Older adults that practiced at the low or medium, but not the high, difficulty levels were able to maintain improvements in accuracy at retention and showed modulation of alpha TR-Power after practice. Together, these data indicate that both age and task difficulty affect motor learning, as well as the associated neural plasticity.

Sleep spindles promote memory retention, especially when occurring in the depolarized upstate of slow oscillation (SO). A less studied topic is the inter-spindle synchrony, i.e. the temporal overlap and phasic coherence between spindles perceived in different electroencephalography channels. In this study, we examined how synchrony between SOs and spindles, as well as between simultaneous spindles, is associated with the retention of novel verbal metaphors. Moreover, we combined the encoding of the metaphors with respiratory phase (inhalation/exhalation) with the aim of modulating the strength of memorized items, as previous studies have shown that inhalation entrains neural activity, thereby benefiting memory in a waking condition. In the current study, 27 young adults underwent a two-night mixed-design study with a 12-h delayed memory task during both sleep and waking conditions. As expected, we found better retention over the delay containing sleep, and this outcome was strongly associated with the timing of SO-spindle coupling. However, no associations were observed regarding inter-spindle synchrony or respiratory phase. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the importance of SO-spindle coupling for memory. In contrast, the observed lack of association with inter-spindle synchrony may emphasize the local nature of spindle-related plasticity.

J	Toledo, F; Thaler, M				Toledo, Felippe; Thaler, Markus			Gamma frequencies as a predictor for the accomplishment of a motor task guided through the action observation network	NEUROREHABILITATION			English	Article						EEG-Marker; action observation network; motor learning; neurorehabilitation	BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; EEG; PHASE; MODULATION	BACKGROUND: Action observation describes a concept where the subsequent motor behavior of an individual can be modulated though observing an action. This occurs through the activation of neurons in the action observation network, acting on a variety of motor learning processes. This network has been proven highly useful in the rehabilitation of patients with acquired brain injury, placing "action observation" as one of the most effective techniques for motor recovery in physical neurorehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to define an EEG marker for motor learning, guided through observation. METHODS: Healthy subjects (n = 41) participated voluntarily for this research. They were asked to repeat an unknown motor behavior, immediately after observing a video. During the observation, EEG raw signals where collected with a portable EEG and the results were later compared with success and fail on repeating the motor procedure. The comparison was then analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametrical data, with a confidence interval of 95%. RESULTS: A significant relation between motor performance and neural activity was found for Alpha (p = 0,0149) and Gamma (0,0005) oscillatory patterns. CONCLUSION: Gamma oscillations with frequencies between 41 and 49,75 Hz, seem to be an adequate EEG marker for motor performance guided through the action observation network. The technology used for this paper is easy to use, low-cost and presents valid measurements for the recommended oscillatory frequencies, implying a possible use on rehabilitation, by collecting data in real-time during therapeutic interventions and assessments.

Applying neurofeedback (NFB) with the aim of changing these oscillatory patterns not only provides help for those who suffer from the phantom percept, but a promising foundation from which to probe influential factors. The reliable attribution of influential factors that potentially predict oscillatory changes during the course of NFB training may lead to the identification of subgroups of individuals that are more or less responsive to NFB training. The present study investigated oscillatory trajectories of delta (3-4Hz) and individual alpha (8.5-12Hz) during 15 NFB training sessions, based on a Latent Growth Curve framework. First, we found the desired enhancement of alpha, while delta was stable throughout the NFB training. Individual differences in tinnitus-specific variables and general-, as well as health-related quality of life predictors were largely unrelated to oscillatory change prior to and across the training. Only the predictors age and sex at baseline were clearly related to slow-wave delta, particularly so for older female individuals who showed higher delta power values from the start. Second, we confirmed a hierarchical cross-frequency association between the two frequency bands; however, in opposing directions to those anticipated in tinnitus. The establishment of individually tailored NFB protocols would boost this therapy's effectiveness in the treatment of tinnitus. In our analysis, we propose a conceptual groundwork toward this goal of developing more targeted treatment.

However, the specific role of frontal structures in planning is unclear. We used a novel and ecological task, that allowed us to separate the planning period from the execution period. The spatio-temporal dynamics of EEG recordings showed that planning induced a progressive and sustained increase of frontal-midline theta activity (FM theta) over time. Source analyses indicated that this activity was generated within the prefrontal cortex. Theta activity from the right mid-Cingulate Cortex (MCC) and the left Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) were correlated with an increase in the time needed for elaborating plans. On the other hand, left Frontopolar cortex (FP) theta activity exhibited a negative correlation with the time required for executing a plan. Since reaction times of planning execution correlated with correct responses, left FP theta activity might be associated with efficiency and accuracy in making a plan. Associations between theta activity from the right MCC and the left ACC with reaction times of the planning period may reflect high cognitive demand of the task, due to the engagement of attentional control and conflict monitoring implementation. In turn, the specific association between left FP theta activity and planning performance may reflect the participation of this brain region in successfully self-generated plans.

Epilepsy is now defined as an archetypical hyperexcited neural network disorder. It can be investigated through the network analysis of interictal discharges, ictal discharges, and resting-state functional connectivity. Currently, there is an increasing interest in embedding resting-state connectivity analysis into the preoperative evaluation of epilepsy. Among the various neuroimaging technologies employed to achieve brain functional networks, magnetoencephalography (MEG) with the excellent temporal resolution is an ideal tool for estimating the resting-state connectivity between brain regions, which can reveal network abnormalities in epilepsy. What value does MEG resting-state functional connectivity offer for epileptic presurgical evaluation? Regarding this topic, this paper introduced the origin of MEG and the workflow of constructing source-space functional connectivity based on MEG signals. Resting-state functional connectivity abnormalities correlate with epileptogenic networks, which are defined by the brain regions involved in the production and propagation of epileptic activities. This paper reviewed the evidence of altered epileptic connectivity based on low- or high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) and the evidence of the advantage of using simultaneous MEG and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings. More importantly, this review highlighted that MEG-based resting-state functional connectivity has the potential to predict postsurgical outcomes. In conclusion, resting-state MEG functional connectivity has made a substantial progress toward serving as a candidate biomarker included in epileptic presurgical evaluations.

Using electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated the age-related changes in modulations of oscillatory brain activity supporting lexical retrieval and semantic binding. Young and older adult participants were visually presented two-word phrases, which for the first word revealed a lexical retrieval signature (e.g., swift vs. swrfeq) and for the second word revealed a semantic binding signature (e.g., horse in a semantic binding "swift horse" vs. no binding "swrfeq horse" context). The oscillatory brain activity associated with lexical retrieval as well as semantic binding significantly differed between healthy older and young adults. Specifically for lexical retrieval, we found that different age groups exhibited opposite patterns of theta and alpha modulation, which as a combined picture suggest that lexical retrieval is associated with different and delayed signatures in older compared with young adults. For semantic binding, in young adults, we found a signature in the low-beta range centred around the target word onset (i.e., a smaller low-beta increase for binding relative to no binding), whereas in healthy older adults, we found an opposite binding signature about similar to 500 ms later in the low- and high-beta range (i.e., a smaller low- and high-beta decrease for binding relative to no binding). The novel finding of a different and delayed oscillatory signature for semantic binding in healthy older adults reflects that the integration of word meaning into the semantic context takes longer and relies on different mechanisms in healthy older compared with young adults.

Emotion recognition has become a very controversial issue in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), and numerous studies have been conducted on recognizing emotions. In this paper, different classifiers have been employed using EEG signals from the multi-mode ASCERTAIN public dataset. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Discriminant Analysis (DA) and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers were implemented using time domain statistical features to classify emotions into four classes: High Arousal - High Valence (HAHV), High Arousal - Low Valence (HALV), Low Arousal - High Valence (LAHV) and Low Arousal Low Valence (LALV). Also, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) have been employed to perform a binary classification with Arousal and Valence classes. Research has also been done on the effect of selecting a proper frequency band for emotion recognition. According to the findings of this paper, GNNs have a much better performance than conventional neural networks. Moreover, we concluded that in addition to reducing computational costs, higher accuracy is achieved by using Alpha and Theta frequency bands for emotion recognition.

Methods: This cross-sectional study included 31 right-handed children, 6-11 years old, who were allocated to two groups: 1) the music group (MG), including children who attended preschool and musical training (n = 16), and 2) the no-music group (NMG), including children who attended preschool but received no additional music training (n = 15). The outcomes were gamma-band frequency measured by electroencephalography, manual dexterity, aim-and-catch, and static and dynamic balance abilities measured by the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, and fine motor skills, overall motor skills, balance, corporal body scheme, spatial organization, temporal orientation, and general motor quotient (GMQ) by a Brazilian scale for motor development. Results: There 1was a significant difference between groups in the peak frequency (p = 0.0195) and median frequency (p = 0.0070) in the F3-F4 regions. Static and dynamic balance (p = 0.03), temporal orientation (p < 0.01), and GMQ (p < 0.03) were higher in MG than in NMG. Conclusion: The musically trained children had increased gamma-peak frequency in the frontal region and greater temporal orientation, balance, and the overall motor quotient.

Due to its increasing application, it is crucial to know the reproducibility of several analysis measures of rsEEG. New method: A new brain network construction method was proposed based on simplified forward model (SFM). In addition, we aimed to carry out an extensive examination of the reproducibility of the power spectrum and functional connectivity at both the sensor-level and the source-level. We systematically proposed multiple new pipelines by integration source imaging, time-course extraction and network reconstruction. Results/comparison with existing method(s): Our results revealed that the reproducibility of eyes-closed was slightly higher than that of eyes-open, and the relative power was more repeatable than the absolute power, especially in high-frequency bands. The reproducibility of the sensor-level was higher than that of the source-level, both for power and connectivity. Remarkably, connectivity measures could be separated into two classes according to their reproducibility. Notably, the reproducibility of power envelope correlation (PEC) was generally the highest among those connectivity measures which are insensitive to volume conduction effect. For the whole-brain network construction, single dipole modeling was better than the dimensionality reduction methods, such as mean or principal component analysis (PCA) of multiple dipoles of a region. Conclusions: In conclusion, our results described the reproducibility of rsEEG power spectrum, connectivity measures, and network constructions, which could be considered in assessing inter-individual differences in brain-behavior relationships, as well as automatic biometric applications.

Methods. This review examines the approaches of time-frequency wavelet analysis for brain activity when performing perceptual tasks, as well as the possibility of using such methods in the tasks of constructing brain - computer interfaces. Results. Electroencephalographic markers of increased attention during the perception of visual stimuli have been identified. Based on their we created brain - computer interfaces, which can monitor and control attention using biological feedback. Conclusion. We shown that the speed and correctness of our decisions depends on the quality of sensory evidence. Ambiguous sensory information requires more time to process, more attention and increases the probability of error. The use of neurointerfaces has shown that the brain's resource is limited, and it is not maintained at a constant level - the time intervals of heightened attention alternate with the recovery period.

This work is the first to systematically review -following PRISMA guidelines- the empirical evidence regarding the effects of BD on neural activity -assessed by electroencephalography- of adolescents and young adults. A systematic review was conducted in 34 studies (N = 1723). Results indicated that binge drinkers (BDs) showed similar behavioral performance as non/low drinkers. The most solid electrophysiological finding was an augmented P3 amplitude during attention, working memory and inhibition tasks. This increased neural activity suggests the recruitment of additional resources to perform the task at adequate/successful levels, which supports the neurocompensation hypothesis. Similar to alcoholics, BDs also displayed increased reactivity to alcohol-related cues, augmented resting-state electrophysiological signal and reduced activity during error detection -which gives support to the continuum hypothesis. Evidence does not seem to support greater vulnerability to BD in females. Replication and longitudinal studies are required to account for mixed results and to elucidate the extent/direction of the neural impairments associated with BD.

J	Das, K; Pachori, RB				Das, Kritiprasanna; Pachori, Ram Bilas			Schizophrenia detection technique using multivariate iterative filtering and multichannel EEG signals	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						EEG; EEG rhythm separation; Iterative filtering; Multivariate iterative filtering; Schizophrenia diagnosis	TIME; MORTALITY	A new approach for extension of univariate iterative filtering (IF) for decomposing a signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) or oscillatory modes is proposed for multivariate multi-component signals. Additionally the paper proposes a method to detect schizophrenia (Sz), based on analysing multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Using proposed multivariate iterative filtering (MIF), multi-channel EEG data are decomposed into multivariate IMFs (MIMFs). Depends on mean frequency, IMFs are grouped in order to separate EEG rhythms (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) from EEG signals. The features, such as Hjorth parameters are extracted from EEG rhythms. Extracted features are ranked using student t-test and most discriminant 30 features are used for classification. Different classifier such as K-nearest neighbours (K-NN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM) with diffident kernels are considered to classify Sz and healthy EEG patterns. The proposed method is employed to evaluate 19-channel EEG signals recorded from 14 paranoid Sz patients and 14 healthy subjects. We have achieved highest accuracy of 98.9% using the SVM (Cubic) classifier. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and area under ROC curve (AUC) of the same classifier are 99.0%, 98.8%, 98.4% and 0.999 respectively. Proposed approach for MIF is computationally efficient as compared to other multivariate signal decomposition algorithms. This paper presents a framework for decomposing multivariate signals efficiently and builds a model for detecting Sz accurately.

Here, we show that rhythmicity can be observed in behavioral responses from memory tasks, where participants indicate, using button presses, the timing of encoding and recall of cue-object associative memories. We find no evidence for rhythmicity in button presses for visual tasks using the same stimuli, or for questions about already retrieved objects. The oscillations for correctly remembered trials center in the slow theta frequency range (1-5 Hz). Using intracranial EEG recordings, we show that the memory task induces temporally extended phase consistency in hippocampal local field potentials at slow theta frequencies, but significantly more for remembered than forgotten trials, providing a potential mechanistic underpinning for the theta oscillations found in behavioral responses.

This distinctive aspect is exploited to study the topological evolution of time series/signals. Specifically, EEG signals analysis is considered here for the challenging task of cognitive fatigue detection. This work utilizes the topological attributes like Betti numbers, and persistent homology of dimension 0 and 1 extracted from EEG signals to study the cognitive state of an individual. Using the CogBeacon dataset, a comparison of the topological features with the conventional time and frequency domain features is presented. Random forest classifier is used to classify the fatigue state. Results show that the performance of topological features is at par with the conventional features even when significantly less number of topological features are used. Also, enhancement in classification accuracy is observed by appropriately combining both conventional and topological features which outperforms the state-of-the-art method for fatigue detection. Additionally, recursive feature elimination is applied on combined features to reduce redundancy by selecting a subset consisting of prominent features. Analysis indicates that all topological features derived from EEG signals contribute to the best performing subset, which also increases the overall accuracy.

However, little is known about how these special vascular structures affect cortical network connectivity and brain function. By applying EEG analysis and graphic network analyses undergoing EEG recording of subjects with eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) resting states, and working memory (WM) tasks, we examined the brain network features of hemorrhagic (H-MMD) and ischemic MMD (I-MMD) brains. For the first time, we observed that I-MMD had the much lower alpha-blocking rate during EO state than healthy controls while H-MMD exhibited the relatively low EEG activity rate across all the behavior states. Further, I-MMD showed strong network connections in the alpha-wave band in frontal and parietal regions during EO and WM states. EEG frequency and network topological maps during both resting and WM states indicated that the left frontal lobe and left parietal lobe in H-MMD patients and the right parietal lobe and temporal lobe in I-MMD patients have clear differences compared with controls, which provides a new insight to understand distinct electrophysiological features of MMD. However, due to the small sample size of recruited patient subjects, the result conclusion may be limited.

Low frequency novel interictal EEG biomarker for localizing seizures and predicting outcomes	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						epilepsy; seizure onset zone; intracranial EEG; low frequency activity; slow wave activity	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; OSCILLATIONS; SPIKES; SLEEP; ONSET; LOCALIZATION; MECHANISMS; GENERATION; PLASTICITY; NETWORK	Localizing hyperexcitable brain tissue to treat focal seizures remains challenging. We want to identify the seizure onset zone from interictal EEG biomarkers. We hypothesize that a combination of interictal EEG biomarkers, including a novel low frequency marker, can predict mesial temporal involvement and can assist in prognosis related to surgical resections. Interictal direct current wide bandwidth invasive EEG recordings from 83 patients implanted with 5111 electrodes were retrospectively studied. Logistic regression was used to classify electrodes and patient outcomes. A feed-forward neural network was implemented to understand putative mechanisms. Interictal infraslow frequency EEG activity was decreased for seizure onset zone electrodes while faster frequencies such as delta (2-4Hz) and beta-gamma (20-50Hz) activity were increased. These spectral changes comprised a novel interictal EEG biomarker that was significantly increased for mesial temporal seizure onset zone electrodes compared to non-seizure onset zone electrodes. Interictal EEG biomarkers correctly classified mesial temporal seizure onset zone electrodes with a specificity of 87% and positive predictive value of 80%. These interictal EEG biomarkers also correctly classified patient outcomes after surgical resection with a specificity of 91% and positive predictive value of 87%. Interictal infraslow EEG activity is decreased near the seizure onset zone while higher frequency power is increased, which may suggest distinct underlying physiologic mechanisms. Narrowband interictal EEG power bands provide information about the seizure onset zone and can help predict mesial temporal involvement in seizure onset. Narrowband interictal EEG power bands may be less useful for predictions related to non-mesial temporal electrodes. Together with interictal epileptiform discharges and high-frequency oscillations, these interictal biomarkers may provide prognostic information prior to surgical resection. Computational modelling suggests changes in neural adaptation may be related to the observed low frequency power changes.

Sequential gains and losses during gambling feedback: Differential effects in time-frequency delta and theta measures	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						decision-making; feedback processing; oscillation; time frequency analyses; reward; sequential outcomes	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; TO-TARGET INTERVAL; INTEGRATIVE THEORY; MEDIOFRONTAL NEGATIVITIES; REWARD POSITIVITY; P300; ERROR; ERP	One critical aspect of reward-feedback is the impact of local outcome history-how past experiences with choices and outcomes influences current behavior and neural activity. Yet, prior event-related potential work in this area has been contentious. This study contributes to this field by using time-frequency measures to better isolate constituent processes. Specifically, we identify how theta and delta are differentially sensitive to local outcome history. Participants completed a binary monetary choice task while we collected EEG data. Unbeknownst to them, trial outcomes were manipulated into pre-determined sequences, ranging from one to eight gains or losses in a row. Analyses were arranged by sequence establishment (first 2 trials of a sequence) and continuation (prolonged sequences of 3-8 trials). During the establishment of a sequence, delta activity to gains and losses were virtually identical on the first (change) trial, demonstrating marked divergence only on the second trial. This difference grew throughout the continuation period, as delta activity was sustained with accruing gains but declined with multiple losses. Theta activity, conversely, demonstrated a maximal loss-gain difference on the change trial but was insensitive to the establishment of a new sequence. Differential theta activity between outcomes decreased as sequences continued, with theta activity increasing over accruing gains and remaining stable over losses. Results indicate that delta-gain and theta-loss signals are relatively stable across sequential outcomes. Furthermore, theta is most sensitive to loss-gain differences on the initial change trial, while delta is more sensitive to gain-loss differences with the continuation of a sequence.

Electroencephalography, Hospital Complications, and Longitudinal Outcomes After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage	NEUROCRITICAL CARE			English	Article						Subarachnoid hemorrhage; Electroencephalography; Outcomes; Delayed cerebral ischemia; Hydrocephalus	DELAYED CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; CONTINUOUS EEG; SPREADING DEPOLARIZATION; VASOSPASM	Background Following non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), in-hospital delayed cerebral ischemia is predicted by two chief events on continuous EEG (cEEG): new or worsening epileptiform abnormalities (EAs) and deterioration of cEEG background frequencies. We evaluated the association between longitudinal outcomes and these cEEG biomarkers. We additionally evaluated the association between longitudinal outcomes and other in-hospital complications. Methods Patients with nontraumatic SAH undergoing >= 3 days of cEEG monitoring were enrolled in a prospective study evaluating longitudinal outcomes. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was assessed at discharge, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up time points. Adjusting for baseline severity in a cumulative proportional odds model, we modeled the mRS ordinally and measured the association between mRS and two forms of in-hospital cEEG deterioration: (1) cEEG evidence of new or worsening epileptiform abnormalities and (2) cEEG evidence of new background deterioration. We compared the magnitude of these associations at each time point with the association between mRS and other in-hospital complications: (1) delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), (2) hospital-acquired infections (HAI), and (3) hydrocephalus. In a secondary analysis, we employed a linear mixed effects model to examine the association of mRS over time (dichotomized as 0-3 vs. 4-6) with both biomarkers of cEEG deterioration and with other in-hospital complications. Results In total, 175 mRS assessments were performed in 59 patients. New or worsening EAs developed in 23 (39%) patients, and new background deterioration developed in 24 (41%). Among cEEG biomarkers, new or worsening EAs were independently associated with mRS at discharge, 3, and 6 months, respectively (adjusted cumulative proportional odds 4.99, 95% CI 1.60-15.6; 3.28, 95% CI 1.14-9.5; and 2.71, 95% CI 0.95-7.76), but cEEG background deterioration lacked an association. Among hospital complications, DCI was associated with discharge, 3-, and 6-month outcomes (adjusted cumulative proportional odds 4.75, 95% CI 1.64-13.8; 3.4; 95% CI 1.24-9.01; and 2.45, 95% CI 0.94-6.6), but HAI and hydrocephalus lacked an association. The mixed effects model demonstrated that these associations were sustained over longitudinal assessments without an interaction with time. Conclusion Although new or worsening EAs and cEEG background deterioration have both been shown to predict DCI, only new or worsening EAs are associated with a sustained impairment in functional outcome. This novel finding raises the potential for identifying therapeutic targets that may also influence outcomes.

This paper presents an EEG-based real-time emotion tagging approach, by extracting inter-brain features from a group of participants when they watch the same emotional video clips. First, the continuous subjective reports on both the arousal and valence dimensions of emotion were obtained by employing a three-round behavioral rating paradigm. Second, the inter-brain features were systematically explored in both spectral and temporal domain. Finally, regression analyses were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of inter-brain amplitude and phase features. The inter-brain amplitude feature showed significantly better prediction performance than the inter-brain phase feature, as well as another two conventional features (spectral power and inter-subject correlation). By combining the four types of features, regression values (R-2) were obtained for the prediction of arousal (0.61 +/- 0.01) and valence (0.70 +/- 0.01), corresponding to prediction errors of 1.01 +/- 0.02 and 0.78 +/- 0.02 (unit on 9-point scales), respectively. The contributions of different electrodes and frequency bands were also analyzed. Our results show promising potentials of inter-brain EEG features in real-time emotion tagging applications.

In this context, the need for strong recognition performances results in increasingly sophisticated machine learning (ML) techniques, which may result in poor performance in a real application (e.g., limiting a real-time implementation). Here, we propose an ensemble approach to effectively balance between ML performance and computational costs in a BCI framework. The proposed model builds a classifier by combining different ML models (base-models) that are specialized to different classification sub-problems. More specifically, we employ this strategy with an ensemble-based architecture consisting of multi-layer perceptrons, and test its performance on a publicly available electroencephalography-based BCI dataset with four-class motor imagery tasks. Compared to previously proposed models tested on the same dataset, the proposed approach provides greater average classification performances and lower inter-subject variability.

The less obtrusive, minimized systems (e.g., single-channel EEG, no ECG reference) have the drawback of artifact contamination with varying intensity that are particularly difficult to identify and remove. We developed brMEGA, the first open-source algorithm for automated detection and removal of cardiogenic artifacts using non-linear time-frequency analysis and machine learning to (1) detect whether and where cardiogenic artifacts exist, and (2) remove those artifacts. We compare our algorithm against visual artifact identification and a previously established approach and validate it in one real and semi-real datasets. We demonstrated that brMEGA successfully identifies and substantially removes cardiogenic artifacts in singlechannel EEG recordings. Moreover, recovery of cardiogenic artifacts, if present, gives the opportunity for future extraction of heart rate features without ECG measurement.

Phase and power modulations on the amplitude of TMS-induced motor evoked potentials	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BRAIN-STIMULATION; EEG; VARIABILITY; EXCITABILITY; SYSTEM; CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; PLASTICITY; RESPONSES	The evaluation of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) promises valuable information about fundamental brain related mechanisms and may serve as a diagnostic tool for clinical monitoring of therapeutic progress or surgery procedures. However, reports about spontaneous fluctuations of MEP amplitudes causing high intra-individual variability have led to increased concerns about the reliability of this measure. One possible cause for high variability of MEPs could be neuronal oscillatory activity, which reflects fluctuations of membrane potentials that systematically increase and decrease the excitability of neuronal networks. Here, we investigate the dependence of MEP amplitude on oscillation power and phase by combining the application of single pulse TMS over the primary motor cortex with concurrent recordings of electromyography and electroencephalography. Our results show that MEP amplitude is correlated to alpha phase, alpha power as well as beta phase. These findings may help explain corticospinal excitability fluctuations by highlighting the modulatory effect of alpha and beta phase on MEPs. In the future, controlling for such a causal relationship may allow for the development of new protocols, improve this method as a (diagnostic) tool and increase the specificity and efficacy of general TMS applications.

Although visual cEEG analysis is most commonly used, automatic cEEG analysis has shown promising results in small samples. Here we aimed to compare visual versus automatic cEEG analysis for delirium diagnosis in septic patients. Methods: We obtained cEEG recordings from 102 septic patients who were scored for delirium six times daily. A total of 1252 cEEG blocks were visually analyzed, of which 805 blocks were also automatically analyzed. Results: Automatic cEEG analyses revealed that delirium was associated with 1) high mean global field power (p < 0.005), mainly driven by delta activity; 2) low average coherence across all electrode pairs and all frequencies (p < 0.01); 3) lack of intrahemispheric (fronto-temporal and temporo-occipital regions) and interhemispheric coherence (p < 0.05); and 4) lack of cEEG reactivity (p < 0.005). Classification accuracy was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, revealing a slightly higher area under the curve for visual analysis (0.88) than automatic analysis (0.74) (p < 0.05).

The fillers in these wh-dependencies involve lexically selected noun complements (Comp): quelle de ' cision a` propos de lui/`a son sujet 'which decision about him' or unselected NP-modifiers (Mod): quelle de ' cision le concernant 'which decision regarding him'; they also involve the lexical encoding of antecedent gender (lui/elle '3p. sing.masc/fem') or not (son '3p.sing.gen') in a pronoun. We propose that NNSs adapt to processing a non-native language by directing more resources toward computing lexically encoded properties than toward inferences that go beyond lexical information. At the recursive clause edge, a population-wide asymmetry between conditions arose at 15-16Hz in induced power: Lexical selection and gender specification led to diminished power for Comp son vs. Mod le/la and for specified lui/elle vs. unspecified son in Comps. This was also found at 17-22Hz in induced power in NSs whereas asymmetries were reversed in NNSs, with computations of lexically encoded properties demanding greater power. At 41-44Hz in induced power, group differences emerged: More power was directed at gender-specified le/la and lui/elle in NNSs, but at unspecified son in NSs. These asymmetries suggest that non-native processing seems characterized by resources directed toward lexically encoded properties in computations.

Reversed and increased functional connectivity in non-REM sleep suggests an altered rather than reduced state of consciousness relative to wake	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; PROPOFOL-INDUCED LOSS; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; RESTING-STATE; ARTIFACT REMOVAL; BRAIN ACTIVITY; WAKEFULNESS; ARCHITECTURE; NEUROSCIENCE; BREAKDOWN	Sleep resting state network (RSN) functional connectivity (FC) is poorly understood, particularly for rapid eye movement (REM), and in non-sleep deprived subjects. REM and non-REM (NREM) sleep involve competing drives; towards hypersynchronous cortical oscillations in NREM; and towards wake-like desynchronized oscillations in REM. This study employed simultaneous electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) to explore whether sleep RSN FC reflects these opposing drives. As hypothesized, this was confirmed for the majority of functional connections modulated by sleep. Further, changes were directional: e.g., positive wake correlations trended towards negative correlations in NREM and back towards positive correlations in REM. Moreover, the majority did not merely reduce magnitude, but actually either reversed and strengthened in the opposite direction, or increased in magnitude during NREM. This finding supports the notion that NREM is best expressed as having altered, rather than reduced FC. Further, as many of these functional connections comprised "higher-order" RSNs (which have been previously linked to cognition and consciousness), such as the default mode network, this finding is suggestive of possibly concomitant alterations to cognition and consciousness.

J	Poltorak, A				Poltorak, Alexander			Replicating Cortical Signatures May Open the Possibility for "Transplanting" Brain States via Brain Entrainment	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mental state; brain wave; transcranial stimulation; sensory stimulation; photobiomodulation; brain state; brain entrainment; cortical signature	STIMULATION; EXCITABILITY; DYNAMICS; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; DEPRESSION; DYSLEXIA; RHYTHMS; EEG; TMS	Brain states, which correlate with specific motor, cognitive, and emotional states, may be monitored with noninvasive techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) that measure macroscopic cortical activity manifested as oscillatory network dynamics. These rhythmic cortical signatures provide insight into the neuronal activity used to identify pathological cortical function in numerous neurological and psychiatric conditions. Sensory and transcranial stimulation, entraining the brain with specific brain rhythms, can effectively induce desired brain states (such as state of sleep or state of attention) correlated with such cortical rhythms. Because brain states have distinct neural correlates, it may be possible to induce a desired brain state by replicating these neural correlates through stimulation. To do so, we propose recording brain waves from a "donor" in a particular brain state using EEG/MEG to extract cortical signatures of the brain state. These cortical signatures would then be inverted and used to entrain the brain of a "recipient" via sensory or transcranial stimulation. We propose that brain states may thus be transferred between people by acquiring an associated cortical signature from a donor, which, following processing, may be applied to a recipient through sensory or transcranial stimulation. This technique may provide a novel and effective neuromodulation approach to the noninvasive, non-pharmacological treatment of a variety of psychiatric and neurological disorders for which current treatments are mostly limited to pharmacotherapeutic interventions.

In a previous neuroimaging study (Geuter et al., 2017) we observed an important role of the insula in such a model but could not establish its temporal aspects. Here, we employed electroencephalography to investigate neural representations of predictions and prediction errors in heat and pain processing. Our data show that alpha-to-beta activity was associated with stimulus intensity expectation, followed by a negative modulation of gamma band activity by absolute prediction errors. This is in contrast to prediction errors in visual and auditory perception, which are associated with increased gamma band activity, but is in agreement with observations in working memory and word matching, which show gamma band activity for correct, rather than violated, predictions.

J	Chen, Y; Chang, R; Guo, JF				Chen, Yu; Chang, Rui; Guo, Jifeng			Emotion Recognition of EEG Signals Based on the Ensemble Learning Method: AdaBoost	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								In recent years, with the continuous development of artificial intelligence and brain-computer interface technology, emotion recognition based on physiological signals, especially, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, has become a popular research topic and attracted wide attention. However, how to extract effective features from EEG signals and accurately recognize them by classifiers have also become an increasingly important task. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an emotion recognition method of EEG signals based on the ensemble learning method, AdaBoost. First, we consider the time domain, time-frequency domain, and nonlinear features related to emotion, extract them from the preprocessed EEG signals, and fuse the features into an eigenvector matrix. Then, the linear discriminant analysis feature selection method is used to reduce the dimensionality of the features. Next, we use the optimized feature sets and train a classifier based on the ensemble learning method, AdaBoost, for binary classification. Finally, the proposed method has been tested in the DEAP data set on four emotional dimensions: valence, arousal, dominance, and liking. The proposed method is proved to be effective in emotion recognition, and the best average accuracy rate can reach up to 88.70% on the dominance dimension. Compared with other existing methods, the performance of the proposed method is significantly improved.

Certain cases will lead to death. The detection and diagnosis is therefore an important task. It can be performed either by direct patient activity during seizure or by electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis by neurologists. EEG signal processing and detection of seizures using machine learning techniques make this task easier than manual detection. To overcome this problem related to a neurological disorder, we have proposed the ensemble learning technique for improved detection of epilepsy seizures from EEG signals. In the first stage, EEG signal decomposition is done by utilizing empirical wavelet transform (EWT) for smooth analysis in terms of sub-bands. Further, features are extracted from each sub. Time and frequency domain features are the two categories used to extract the statistical features. These features are used in a stacked ensemble of deep neural network (DNN) model along with multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for the detection and classification of ictal, inter-ictal, and pre-ictal (normal) signals. The proposed method is verified using two publicly available datasets provided by the University of Bonn (UoB dataset) and Neurology and Sleep Center -New Delhi (NSC-ND dataset). The proposed algorithm resulted in 98.93 % and 98 % accuracy for the UoB and NSC-ND datasets, respectively.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to modulate cortical oscillation and proposed as an approach to rebalance the symmetry, which has not been documented well. Objective: In this study, we investigated the influence of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on EEG power in patients with unilateral brain lesions by simultaneously stimulating both brain hemispheres and to elucidate asymmetrical changes in rTMS-induced neurophysiological activity. Methods: Fourteen patients with unilateral brain lesions were treated with one active and one sham session of 10 Hz rTMS over the vertex (Cz position). Resting-state EEGs were recorded before and immediately after rTMS. The brain symmetry index (BSI), calculated from a fast Fourier transform, was employed to quantify the power asymmetry in both hemispheres and paired channels over the entire range and five frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands). Results: Comparison between active and sham sessions demonstrated rTMS-induced EEG after-effects. rTMS in the active session significantly reduced the BSI in patients with unilateral brain lesions over the entire frequency range (t = 2.767, P = 0.016). Among the five frequency bands, rTMS only induced a noticeable decrease in the BSI in the delta band (t = 2.254, P = 0.042). Furthermore, analysis of different brain regions showed that significant changes in the BSI of the alpha band were only demonstrated in the posterior parietal lobe. In addition, EEG topographic mapping showed a decreased power of delta oscillations in the ipsilesional hemisphere, whereas distinct cortical oscillations were observed in the alpha band around the parietal-occipital lobe in the contralesional hemisphere. Conclusions: When both brain hemispheres were simultaneously activated, rTMS decreased interhemispheric asymmetry primarily via reducing the delta band in the lesioned hemisphere.

Forty-six mother-toddler dyads at either high (n = 22) or low (n = 24) familial risk of ASD completed a longitudinal, prospective study including free-play, resting electroencephalography, and standardized language assessments. Input quantity/quality at 18 months positively predicted expressive language at 24 months, and relationships were stronger for high-risk toddlers. Moderated mediations revealed that input-language relationships were explained by 24-month frontal and temporal gamma power (30-50 Hz) for high-risk toddlers who would later develop ASD. Results suggest that high-risk toddlers may be cognitively and neurally more sensitive to their language environments, which has implications for early intervention.

There is important local structural information in the EEG signals, which is effective for classification; and this locality of EEG features not only exists in the spatial channel position but also exists in the frequency domain. In order to retain sufficient spatial structure and frequency information, we use one-versus-rest filter bank common spatial patterns (OVR-FBCSP) to preprocess the data and extract preliminary features. On this basis, we conduct research and discussion on feature extraction methods. One-dimensional feature extraction methods like linear discriminant analysis (LDA) may destroy this kind of structural information. Traditional manifold learning methods or two-dimensional feature extraction methods cannot extract both types of information at the same time. We introduced the bilinear structure and matrix-variate Gaussian model into two-dimensional discriminant locality preserving projection (2DDLPP) algorithm and decompose EEG signals into spatial and spectral parts. Afterwards, the most discriminative features were selected through a weight calculation method. We tested the method on BCI competition data sets 2a, data sets IIIa, and data sets collected by our laboratory, and the results were expressed in terms of recognition accuracy. The cross-validation results were 75.69%, 70.46%, and 54.49%, respectively. The average recognition accuracy of new method is improved by 7.14%, 7.38%, 4.86%, and 3.8% compared to those of LDA, two-dimensional linear discriminant analysis (2DLDA), discriminant locality property projections (DLPP), and 2DDLPP, respectively. Therefore, we consider that the proposed method is effective for EEG classification.

Design a novel architecture for real-time quantitative characterization of functional brain connectivity (FC) networks derived from wearable electroencephalogram (EEG). Approach. We performed an algorithm to architecture mapping for the calculation of phase lag index to form the functional connectivity networks and the extraction of a set of graph-theoretic parameters to quantitatively characterize these networks. This mapping was optimized using approximations in the mathematical definitions of the algorithms which reduce its computational complexity and produce a more hardware amenable implementation. Main results. The architecture was developed for a 19-channel EEG system. The system can calculate all the functional connectivity parameters in a total time of 131 mu s, utilizes 71% of the total logic resources in the FPGA, and shows 51.84 mW dynamic power consumption at 22.16 MHz operation frequency when implemented in a Stratix IV EP4SGX230K FPGA. Our analysis also showed that the system occupies an area equivalent to approximately 937 K 2-input NAND gates, with an estimated power consumption of 39.3 mW at 0.9 V supply using a 90 nm CMOS application specific integrated circuit technology. Significance. The proposed architecture can calculate the FC and extract the graph-theoretic parameters in real-time with low power consumption. This characteristic makes the architecture ideal for applications such as a wearable closed-loop neurofeedback systems, where constant monitoring of the brain activity and fast processing of EEG is necessary to control the appropriate feedback.

However, most EEG measures previously used are either a univariate measure or a single type of brain connectivity, which may not fully capture the abnormal brain changes of SZ patients. In this paper, event-related potentials were collected from 45 SZ patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs) during a learning task, and then a combination of partial directed coherence (PDC) effective and phase lag index (PLI) functional connectivity were used as features to train a support vector machine classifier with leave-one-out cross-validation for classification of SZ from HCs. Our results indicated that an excellent classification performance (accuracy = 95.16%, specificity = 94.44%, and sensitivity = 96.15%) was obtained when the combination of functional and effective connectivity features was used, and the corresponding optimal feature number was 15, which included 12 PDC and three PLI connectivity features. The selected effective connectivity features were mainly located between the frontal/temporal/central and visual/parietal lobes, and the selected functional connectivity features were mainly located between the frontal/temporal and visual cortexes of the right hemisphere. In addition, most of the selected effective connectivity abnormally enhanced in SZ patients compared with HCs, whereas all the selected functional connectivity features decreased in SZ patients. The above results showed that our proposed method has great potential to become a tool for the auxiliary diagnosis of SZ.

Classification of Stereo-EEG Contacts in White Matter vs. Gray Matter Using Recorded Activity	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						stereo-electroencephalography; SEEG; white matter; classification; power spectrum; bipolar reference	EPILEPTOGENIC ZONE; IDENTIFICATION	For epileptic patients requiring resective surgery, a modality called stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) may be used to monitor the patient's brain signals to help identify epileptogenic regions that generate and propagate seizures. SEEG involves the insertion of multiple depth electrodes into the patient's brain, each with 10 or more recording contacts along its length. However, a significant fraction (approximate to 30% or more) of the contacts typically reside in white matter or other areas of the brain which can not be epileptogenic themselves. Thus, an important step in the analysis of SEEG recordings is distinguishing between electrode contacts which reside in gray matter vs. those that do not. MRI images overlaid with CT scans are currently used for this task, but they take significant amounts of time to manually annotate, and even then it may be difficult to determine the status of some contacts. In this paper we present a fast, automated method for classifying contacts in gray vs. white matter based only on the recorded signal and relative contact depth. We observe that bipolar referenced contacts in white matter have less power in all frequencies below 150 Hz than contacts in gray matter, which we use in a Bayesian classifier to attain an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 +/- 0.079 (SD) across 29 patients. Because our method gives a probability for each contact rather than a hard labeling, and uses a feature of the recorded signal that has direct clinical relevance, it can be useful to supplement decision-making on difficult to classify contacts or as a rapid, first-pass filter when choosing subsets of contacts from which to save recordings.

The objective of this work is to develop a 4D (3D+T) statistical anatomical atlas of the electrical properties of the upper part of the human head for cerebral electrophysiology and bioimpedance applications. Approach. The atlas was constructed based on 3D magnetic resonance images (MRI) of 107 human individuals and comprises the electrical properties of the main internal structures and can be adjusted for specific electrical frequencies. T1w+T2w MRI images were used to segment the main structures of the head while angiography MRI was used to segment the main arteries. The proposed atlas also comprises a time-varying model of arterial brain circulation, based on the solution of the Navier-Stokes equation in the main arteries and their vascular territories. Main results. High-resolution, multi-frequency and time-varying anatomical atlases of resistivity, conductivity and relative permittivity were created and evaluated using a forward problem solver for EIT. The atlas was successfully used to simulate electrical impedance tomography measurements indicating the necessity of signal-to-noise between 100 and 125 dB to identify vascular changes due to the cardiac cycle, corroborating previous studies. The source code of the atlas and solver are freely available to download. Significance. Volume conductor problems in cerebral electrophysiology and bioimpedance do not have analytical solutions for nontrivial geometries and require a 3D model of the head and its electrical properties for solving the associated PDEs numerically. Ideally, the model should be made with patient-specific information. In clinical practice, this is not always the case and an average head model is often used. Also, the electrical properties of the tissues might not be completely known due to natural variability. Anatomical atlases are important tools for in silico studies on cerebral circulation and electrophysiology that require statistically consistent data, e.g. machine learning, sensitivity analyses, and as a benchmark to test inverse problem solvers.

Sensor-Level Wavelet Analysis Reveals EEG Biomarkers of Perceptual Decision-Making	SENSORS			English	Article						perceptual decision-making; ambiguous stimuli; selective attention; top-down processes; beta-band activity		Perceptual decision-making requires transforming sensory information into decisions. An ambiguity of sensory input affects perceptual decisions inducing specific time-frequency patterns on EEG (electroencephalogram) signals. This paper uses a wavelet-based method to analyze how ambiguity affects EEG features during a perceptual decision-making task. We observe that parietal and temporal beta-band wavelet power monotonically increases throughout the perceptual process. Ambiguity induces high frontal beta-band power at 0.3-0.6 s post-stimulus onset. It may reflect the increasing reliance on the top-down mechanisms to facilitate accumulating decision-relevant sensory features. Finally, this study analyzes the perceptual process using mixed within-trial and within-subject design. First, we found significant percept-related changes in each subject and then test their significance at the group level. Thus, observed beta-band biomarkers are pronounced in single EEG trials and may serve as control commands for brain-computer interface (BCI).

However, results are heterogeneous, and the related neurophysiological mechanisms are not well understood. Oscillatory brain activitiy, such as task-related power (TRPow) in the alpha and beta frequencies, are known neural signatures of motor activity. Here, we tested the effects of aCE on motor performance and learning, along with corresponding modulations in EEG TRPow over the sensorimotor cortex. Forty-five right-handed participants (aged 18-34 years) practiced a visuomotor force-matching (FM) task after either high-intensity (HEG), low-intensity (LEG), or no exercise (control group, CG). Motor performance was assessed immediately, 15 min, 30 min, and 24 h after aCE/control. EEG was measured during the FM task. Results of frequentist and Bayesian statistics revealed that high- and low-intensity aCE had no effect at the behavioral level, adding to the previous mixed results. Interestingly, EEG analyses showed an effect of aCE on the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex, with a stronger decrease in beta-TRPow 15 min after exercise in both groups compared to the CG. Overall, aCE applied before motor practice increased ipsilateral sensorimotor activity, while motor learning was not affected; it remains to be seen whether aCE might affect motor learning in the long run.

The methodology discussed here could be applied to any neurological condition, including the important early stages of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we analyzed EEG from control (CL) participants and participants with diagnosed Parkinson's disease (PD), who were age-matched women in an eyes-closed resting state, to test the model. PD is predicted to rise over the next decades as the population ages. Furthermore, women are more likely to undergo PD-related complications and worse disability than men. Two groups based on age were considered: under and over 60 years (PD patients 60; CL 60). Continuous Wavelet Transform and Cross Wavelet Transform were applied to determine patterns of global wavelet curves, main frequencies, and power analyses. Our results indicate that both CL age groups and PD patients 60 showed a main delta brainwave. Interestingly, power anomalies analyses show a decreasing anteroposterior gradient in CL, whereas it is increasing in PD patients, which was not previously observed. The brainwave power in PD patients < 60 was higher in theta, alpha and beta waves and in > 60 group, the delta, theta and beta brainwaves were predominant. This methodology offers a tool to reveal abnormal electrical brain activity unseen by a regular EEG analysis. The advent of new models that process EEG, such as the model proposed in this study, promotes renewed interest in electrophysiology of the brain to study the early stages of PD and improve understanding of the origin and progress of the disease.

Spatial attention impairments are characterized by specific electro-encephalographic correlates and partially mediate the association between early life stress and anxiety	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Attention; Anxiety; Stress; EEG; Visuo-spatial	DIRECTED ATTENTION; CHILDHOOD MALTREATMENT; THETA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; DEPRESSION; VALIDATION; ALPHA; TRAUMA; ADAPTATION; DISORDERS	Although impaired attention is a diagnostic feature of anxiety disorders, we lack an understanding of which aspects of attention are impaired, the neurobiological basis of these impairments, and the contribution of stressors. To address these gaps in knowledge, we developed and tested behavioral tasks designed to parse the subdomains of attention impairments associated with anxiety symptoms and used electro-encephalographic (EEG) recordings to probe the neural basis of attentional performance. Participants were n = 55 individuals aged 18-35 with mild-to-moderate mood and anxiety symptoms. We also assessed stressful life events that may impact mental health and attention abilities, including stressors that occurred in early life before age 18 years. Severity of anxiety was found to be specifically associated with impairments in spatial attention but not feature-based attention. These impairments in spatial attention also partially mediated the association between early-life stressors and anxiety symptoms. Impairments in spatial selective attention were associated with decreased posterior alpha oscillations in EEG recordings in a subsample of participants, whereas spatial divided attention impairments were associated with decreased frontocentral theta oscillations. Our results provide a thorough characterization of attention impairments associated with anxiety, their EEG correlates, and the impact of stressors both in early life and adulthood.

Daniel			Disrupted Modulation of Alpha and Low Beta Oscillations Mediates Temporal Sequence Memory Deficits in People With Schizophrenia	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY-COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE AND NEUROIMAGING			English	Article							BAND OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; GAMMA; DYSFUNCTION; MECHANISMS; SYNCHRONY; PREDICT; ORDER	BACKGROUND: People with schizophrenia (SZ) exhibit impaired episodic memory when relating objects to each other in time and space. Empirical studies and computational models suggest that low-frequency neural oscillations may be a mechanism by which the brain keeps track of temporal relationships during encoding and retrieval, with modulation of oscillatory power as sequences are learned. It is unclear whether sequence memory deficits in SZ are associated with altered neural oscillations. METHODS: Using electroencephalography, this study examined neural oscillations in 51 healthy control subjects and 37 people with SZ during a temporal sequence learning task. Multiple 5-object picture sequences were presented across 4 study-test blocks in either fixed or random order. Participants answered semantic questions for each object (e.g., living/nonliving), and sequence memory was operationalized as faster responses for fixed versus random sequences. Differences in oscillatory power between fixed versus random sequences provided a neural index of temporal sequence memory. RESULTS: Although both groups showed reaction time differences in late blocks (blocks 3 and 4), this evidence of sequence memory was reduced in people with SZ relative to healthy control subjects. Decreases in globally distributed prestimulus alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta 1 (13-20 Hz) power for fixed versus random sequences in late blocks were also attenuated in people with SZ relative to healthy control subjects. Moreover, changes in oscillatory power predicted individual reaction time differences and fully mediated the relationship between group and sequence memory. CONCLUSIONS: Disrupted modulation of alpha and beta 1 electroencephalography oscillations is a candidate mechanism of temporal sequence memory deficits in people with SZ.

EEG was recorded for stationary sounds and for three patterns of sound motion produced by changes in interaural time differences. We explored the effect of motion velocity on the MOR potential, and also on the event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITC) calculated from the time-frequency decomposition of EEG signals. The phase coherence of slow oscillations increased with an increase in motion velocity similarly to the magnitude of cN1 and cP2 components of the MOR response. The delta-to-alpha inter-trial spectral power remained at the same level up to, but not including, the highest velocity, suggesting that gradual spatial changes within the sound did not induce non-coherent activity. Conversely, the abrupt sound displacement induced theta-alpha oscillations which had low phase consistency. The findings suggest that the MOR potential could be mainly generated by the phase resetting of slow oscillations, and the degree of phase coherence may be considered as a neurophysiological indicator of sound motion processing.

J	Li, MG; Zhang, YY				Li, Mingai; Zhang, Yuanyuan			An improved MAMA-EMD for the automatic removal of EOG artifacts	BIOCYBERNETICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Electrooculogram; Artifact removal; Kernel independent component analysis; Masking-aided minimum arclength empirical mode decomposition	CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM SIGNALS; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; EEG DATA; STATISTICS; ICA	The separation of electrooculogram (EOG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) is a potential problem in brain-computer interface (BCI). Especially, it is necessary to accurately remove EOG, as a disturbance, from the measured EEG in brain disease diagnosis, EEG-based rehabilitation systems, etc. Due to the interaction between the eye and periocular musculature, a multipoint spike is often produced in EEG for each ocular activity. Masking-aided minimum arclength empirical mode decomposition (MAMA-EMD) was developed to robustly decompose time series with impulse-like noise. However, the decomposition performance of MAMA-EMD was limited in the case of one impulse with multiple contiguous spike points. In this paper, MAMA-EMD was improved (called IMAMA-EMD) by supplementing the minimum arclength criterion, and it was combined with kernel independent component analysis (KICA), yielding an automatic EOG artifact removal method, denoted as KIIMME. The multi-channel contaminated EEG signals were separated into several independent components (ICs) by KICA. Then, IMAMA-EMD was applied to the EOG-related ICs decomposition to generate a set of inherent mode functions (IMFs), the low frequency ones, which have higher correlation with EOG components, were removed, and the others were employed to construct 'clean' EEG. The proposed KIIMME was evaluated and compared with other methods on semisimulated and real EEG data. Experimental results demonstrated that IMAMA-EMD effectively eliminated the influence of multipoint spike on sifting process, and KIIMME improved the removal accuracy of EOG artifacts from EEG while retaining more useful neural data. This improvement is of great significance to research on brain science as well as BCI. (C) 2021 Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

Previous research suggests that the visual system makes use of those redundancies to facilitate efficient processing. In this framework, a fast, initial analysis of low-spatial frequency (LSF) information guides the slower and later processing of high spatial frequency (HSF) detail. Here, we used multivariate classification as well as time-frequency analysis of MEG responses to the viewing of intact and phase scrambled images of human faces to demonstrate that the availability of redundant LSF information, as found in broadband intact images, correlates with a reduction in HSF representational dominance in both early and higher-level visual areas as well as a reduction of gamma-band power in early visual cortex. Our results indicate that the cross spatial frequency information redundancy that can be found in all natural images might be a driving factor in the efficient integration of fine image details.

As age is an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium (POD) the incidence of POD will increase concordantly. One approach to reduce the risk of POD would be to avoid excessively high doses of anaesthetics by using neuromonitoring to guide anaesthesia titration. Therefore, we evaluated the influence of patient's age on various electroencephalogram (EEG)-based anaesthesia indices. Design and patients: We conducted an analysis of previously published data by replaying single electrode EEG episodes of maintenance of general anaesthesia from 180 patients (18-90 years; ASA I-IV) into the five different commercially available monitoring systems and evaluated their indices. We included the State/Response Entropy, Narcotrend, qCON/qNOX, bispectral index (BIS), and Treaton MGA-06. For a non-commercial comparison, we extracted the spectral edge frequency (SEF) from the BIS. To evaluate the influence of the age we generated linear regression models. We also assessed the correlation between the various indices. Main results: During anaesthetic maintenance the values of the SEF, State/Response Entropy, qCON/qNOX and BIS all significantly increased (0.05 Hz/0.19-0.26 index points per year) with the patient's age (p < 0.001); whereas the Narcotrend did not change significantly with age (0.06 index points per year; p = 0.28). The index values of the Treaton device significantly decreased with age (-0.09 index points per year; p < 0.001). These findings were independent of the administered dose of anaesthetics. Conclusions: Almost all current neuromonitoring devices are influenced by age, with the potential to result in inappropriately high dosage of anaesthetics. Therefore, anaesthesiologists should be aware of this phenomenon, and the next generation of monitors should correct for these changes.

These models have achieved significant results, but they are heavily designed with millions of parameters, which increases train and test time, making the model complex and less suitable for real-time analysis. This paper proposes a simple, lightweight CNN model to classify cognitive states from Electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings. We develop a novel pipeline to learn distinct cognitive representation consisting of two stages. The first stage is to generate the 2D spectral images from neural time series signals in a particular frequency band. Images are generated to preserve the relationship between the neighboring electrodes and the spectral property of the cognitive events. The second is to develop a time-efficient, computationally less loaded, and high-performing model. We design a network containing 4 blocks and major components include standard and depth-wise convolution for increasing the performance and followed by separable convolution to decrease the number of parameters which maintains the tradeoff between time and performance. We experiment on open access EEG meditation dataset comprising expert, nonexpert meditative, and control states. We compare performance with six commonly used machine learning classifiers and four state of the art deep learning models. We attain comparable performance utilizing less than 4% of the parameters of other models. This model can be employed in a real-time computation environment such as neurofeedback.

The aim of this study was to compare the performance of EEG-related indexes in differentiating stroke patients from control participants, and to investigate pathological EEG changes after chronic stroke. 20 stroke and 13 healthy participants were recruited, and spontaneous EEG signals were recorded during the resting state. EEG rhythms and complexity were calculated based on Fast Fourier Transform and the fuzzy approximate entropy (fApEn) algorithm. The results showed a significant difference of alpha rhythm (p = 0.019) and fApEn (p = 0.003) of EEG signals from brain area among ipsilesional, contralesion hemisphere of stroke patients and corresponding brain hemisphere of healthy participants. EEG fApEn had the best classification accuracy (84.85%), sensitivity (85.00%), and specificity (84.62%) among these EEG-related indexes. Our study provides a potential method to evaluate alterations in the properties of the injured brain, which help us to understand neurological change in chronic strokes.

However, scientific proofs of its central nervous system (CNS) action remained largely unexplored. This study investigated chemotypes, electrical brain waves and sleep-wake effects of the essential oil from Citrus reticulata in rat model. Methods: Chemical contents of citrus EO were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Male Wistar rats implanted with electrodes on the frontal and parietal skulls were used for electroencephalographic (EEG) recording while inhaling the citrus EO (200 ml on cotton wool). Diazepam (10 mg/kg, p.o.) was used as a standard anxiolytic drug. EEG frequency analyses were performed by using Fast Fourier transform. All data were statistical analyzed using One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. Results: GC-MS analysis revealed D-limonene (95.7%) as a major constituent of citrus EO. The EEG results showed that overall EEG patterns of citrus EO effects were relatively similar to that of diazepam. However, significant differences between treatments were seen from sleep-wake analyses. Diazepam significantly increased episode numbers of awake and non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and reduced averaged episode duration. On the other hand, the citrus EO significantly decreased REM sleep latency and increased total time and episode numbers of REM sleep. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated unique CNS effects of C. reticulata EO with EEG fingerprints and sleep-wake profiles. The data might be useful for citrus essential oil subclassification and clinical application.

BRAIN			English	Review						EEG; delta oscillations; consciousness; disorders of consciousness; Angelman syndrome	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; LENNOX-GASTAUT-SYNDROME; LEMPEL-ZIV COMPLEXITY; ANGELMAN-SYNDROME; RETT-SYNDROME; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; IMPAIRED CONSCIOUSNESS; PROPOFOL ANESTHESIA; SLOW WAVES; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM SIGNATURES	A common observation in EEG research is that consciousness vanishes with the appearance of delta (1-4 Hz) waves, particularly when those waves are high amplitude. High amplitude delta oscillations are frequently observed in states of diminished consciousness, including slow wave sleep, anaesthesia, generalized epileptic seizures, and disorders of consciousness, such as coma and the vegetative state. This strong correlation between loss of consciousness and high amplitude delta oscillations is thought to stem from the widespread cortical deactivation that occurs during the 'down states' or troughs of these slow oscillations. Recently, however, many studies have reported the presence of prominent delta activity during conscious states, which casts doubt on the hypothesis that high amplitude delta oscillations are an indicator of unconsciousness. These studies include work in Angelman syndrome, epilepsy, behavioural responsiveness during propofol anaesthesia, postoperative delirium, and states of dissociation from the environment such as dreaming and powerful psychedelic states. The foregoing studies complement an older, yet largely unacknowledged, body of literature that has documented awake, conscious patients with high amplitude delta oscillations in clinical reports from Rett syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, schizophrenia, mitochondrial diseases, hepatic encephalopathy, and non-convulsive status epilepticus. At the same time, a largely parallel body of recent work has reported convincing evidence that the complexity or entropy of EEG and magnetoencephalographic signals strongly relates to an individual's level of consciousness. Having reviewed this literature, we discuss plausible mechanisms that would resolve the seeming contradiction between high amplitude delta oscillations and consciousness. We also consider implications concerning theories of consciousness, such as integrated information theory and the entropic brain hypothesis. Finally, we conclude that false inferences of unconscious states can be best avoided by examining measures of electrophysiological complexity in addition to spectral power.

Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying this ability is critical for comprehending attentional processes as well as neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by attentional deficits, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study, we aimed to investigate how trait-like critical oscillations during rest relate to the P300 evoked potential-a biomarker commonly used to assess attentional deficits. We measured long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) in resting-state EEG oscillations as index for criticality of the signal. In addition, the attentional performance of the subjects was assessed as reaction time variability (RTV) in a continuous performance task following an oddball paradigm. P300 amplitude and latencies were obtained from EEG recordings during this task. We found that, after controlling for individual variability in task performance, LRTC were positively associated with P300 amplitudes but not latencies. In line with previous findings, good performance in the sustained attention task was related to higher P300 amplitudes and earlier peak latencies. Unexpectedly, we observed a positive relationship between LRTC in ongoing oscillations during rest and RTV, indicating that greater criticality in brain oscillations during rest relates to worse task performance. In summary, our results show that resting-state neuronal activity, which operates near a critical state, relates to the generation of higher P300 amplitudes. Brain dynamics close to criticality potentially foster a computationally advantageous state which promotes the ability to generate higher event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes.

J	Kayabekir, M; Yaganoglu, M				Kayabekir, Murat; Yaganoglu, Mete			The relationship between snoring sounds and EEG signals on polysomnography	SLEEP AND BREATHING			English	Article; Early Access						Sleep Physiology; PSG; EEG; Snoring; Feature extraction; Simple diagnostic method	OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA; SLOW-WAVE; CLASSIFICATION; RESPONSES; ENTROPY	Purpose The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship of snoring sound signals obtained by polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep laboratory with cortical EEG (6 channel) signals to find answers to two important questions that have been covered to a limited extent in the literature: (1) Would the sounds generated by a snoring individual have an effect on the cerebral electrical waves occurring during sleep (specifically deep restorative sleep)? (2) Would the snoring sounds of an individual being examined by PSG have more of an effect on any one of the EEG electrodes? Methods PSG recordings were obtained from volunteers with primary snoring and those with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) on six different EEG channels (F4-M1, C4-M1, and O2-M1, F3-M2, C3-M2, and O1-M2). The relationship of each of these recordings and snoring sound signals was analyzed by using a computer-based electrophysiological signal analysis method. A three-tier approach was used in this relationship: "Feature extraction, Feature selection, and Classification". Results Data were obtained from a total of 40 volunteers (32 men, mean age (+/- SD) 47.5 +/- 3.2 years), 20 with primary snoring and 20 with OSAS. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) feature extraction method was the most successful method, and by utilizing this method for analyzing EEG channels, snoring sound signals were found to affect the C3-M2 channel the most (Duncan test, p < 0.05). Delta wave frequency levels during snoring were decreased compared to both before snoring (p = 0.160) and after snoring (p = 0.04) periods (paired sample test). Discussion When snoring sounds and EEG signals were analyzed for frequency, time, and wave conversion with feature extraction methods, the C3-M2 channel was to be found the most affected channel. The sleep physiologist who made the PSG analyses reported that, among the 6 EEG channels analyzed for periods where there was no apnea or hypopnea events but only snoring, C3-M2 was the channel showing changes in delta wave activity. Conclusion Our study showed that the monotonous and repetitive snoring sounds of the snorer do not wake the individual, but do affect deep restorative sleep (N3). PSG signal analysis revealed that the most significant changes were in the C3-M2 channel (N3 delta wave amplitude increase and frequency decrease during snoring). Thus, clinicians may be able to monitor the characteristic changes occuring in large cortical delta waves in snoring individuals with innovative single-channel EEG devices without microphones.

A lot of research has been carried out to predict the epileptic seizures. However, the literature shows that there are opportunities for further improvement in early seizure prediction. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to predict a seizure in advance with high prediction accuracy from EEG signals by using time-frequency feature extraction and classification techniques. An early prediction of an epileptic seizure will help clinicians and carers to properly intervene through medication or other preventive measures. Features from EEG signals were extracted using Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) and then Support Vector Machine (SVM) and post-processing technique were applied to predict seizure in advance. We evaluated the performance of our proposed method in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and classification/prediction accuracy. The average prediction accuracy of our proposed method on ten patients was observed to be 96.38% and our method was able to predict a seizure 26.1 min before the actual seizure occurrence on average. The performance comparison of our proposed method with some existing techniques applied on similar datasets demonstrates that our proposed method can be an effective technique for the prediction of seizures. The findings project the towards this method's possibility of future application in seizure prediction. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Brain connectivity alterations during sleep by closed-loop transcranial neurostimulation predict metamemory sensitivity	NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Brain stimulation; EEG; Metamemory; Functional connectivity; Graph theory; Sleep	DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; METACOGNITIVE ABILITY; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; EPISODIC MEMORY; HIPPOCAMPUS	Metamemory involves the ability to correctly judge the accuracy of our memories. The retrieval of memories can be improved using transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) during sleep, but evidence for improvements to metamemory sensitivity is limited. Applying tES can enhance sleep-dependent memory consolidation, which along with metamemory requires the coordination of activity across distributed neural systems, suggesting that examining functional connectivity is important for understanding these processes. Nevertheless, little research has examined how functional connectivity modulations relate to overnight changes in metamemory sensitivity. Here, we developed a closed-loop short-duration tES method, time-locked to up-states of ongoing slow-wave oscillations, to cue specific memory replays in humans. We measured electroencephalographic (EEG) coherence changes following stimulation pulses, and characterized network alterations with graph theoretic metrics. Using machine learning techniques, we show that pulsed tES elicited network changes in multiple frequency bands, including increased connectivity in the theta band and increased efficiency in the spindle band. Additionally, stimulation-induced changes in beta-band path length were predictive of overnight changes in metamemory sensitivity. These findings add new insights into the growing literature investigating increases in memory performance through brain stimulation during sleep, and highlight the importance of examining functional connectivity to explain its effects. Author Summary Numerous studies have demonstrated a clear link between sleep and memory-namely, memories are consolidated during sleep, leading to more stable and long-lasting representations. We have previously shown that tagging episodes with specific patterns of brain stimulation during encoding and replaying those patterns during sleep can enhance this consolidation process to improve confidence and decision-making of memories (metamemory). Here, we extend this work to examine network-level brain changes that occur following stimulation during sleep that predict metamemory improvements. Using graph theoretic and machine-learning methods, we found that stimulation-induced changes in beta-band path length predicted overnight improvements in metamemory. This novel finding sheds new light on the neural mechanisms of memory consolidation and suggests potential applications for improving metamemory.

When recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG), the MMR is traditionally extracted by subtracting the event-related potential/field (ERP/ERF) elicited in response to "deviant" sounds that occur randomly within a train of repetitive "standard" sounds. To overcome the limitations of this subtraction procedure, we propose a novel method which we call weighted-BSST/K, which uses only the deviant response to derive the MMR. We hypothesized that this novel weighted-BSST/K method highlights responses related to the detection of the deviant stimulus and is more sensitive than independent component analysis (ICA). To test this hypothesis and the validity and efficacy of the weightedB.C.Cr k in comparison with ICA (infomax), we evaluated the methods in 12 healthy adults. Auditory stimuli were presented at a constant rate of 2 Hz. Frequency MMRs at a sensor level were obtained from the bilateral temporal lobes with the subtraction approach at 96-276 ms (the MMR time range), defined on the basis of spatio-temporal cluster permutation analysis. In the application of the weighted-BSST/K, the deviant responses were given a constant weight on the MMR time range. The ERF elicited by the weighted deviant responses demonstrated one or a few dominant components representing the MMR with a high signal-to-noise ratio and similar topography to that of the sensor space analysis using the subtraction approach. In contrast, infomax or weighted-infomax revealed many minor or pseudo components as constituents of the MMR. Our new approach may assist in using the MMR in basic and clinical research.

J	Tabanfar, Z; Ghassemi, F; Moradi, MH				Tabanfar, Zahra; Ghassemi, Farnaz; Moradi, Mohammad Hassan			Estimating brain periodic sources activities in steady-state visual evoked potential using local fourier independent component analysis	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Local fourier-independent-component-analysis; Steady-state visual evoked potential; Brain-computer interface; Blind Source Separation		Objective: Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) are widely used in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) applications. This research aims to estimate the brain sources' activities which are corresponding to these signals. Methods: While in SSVEPs, the stimulus frequency could modulate the EEG signal, sparsity in the frequency domain distribution of the signal may be seen. Consequently, the Fourier-ICA method may be appropriate for SSVEP source estimation. Moreover, because the stimulus is visual, the physiological information of the visual cortex region is exploited. So the Local Fourier Independent Component Analysis method is introduced in this research. Results: In order to assess the proposed method, two online available SSVEP datasets such as "Dataset BCI EEG SSVEP for four classes of stimuli" and SSVEP part of "EEG dataset for three BCI paradigms" were utilized. K means clustering of independent components extracted using the Fourier-ICA algorithm revealed brain activity in occipital and parietal regions in response to flickering lights. The Local Fourier-ICA algorithm showed acceptable performance with the maximum average classification accuracies of 98.4% and 99.95% for the first and second datasets, respectively. Conclusions: The results in the channel domain do not have a remarkable difference from the ones in the IC domain. Therefore, for stimulus detection and BCI application purposes, using the information of the EEG signals of the channels in the same cluster as Oz is preferred to reduce computational load and save time.

J	Singh, K; Malhotra, J				Singh, Kuldeep; Malhotra, Jyoteesh			Cloud based ensemble machine learning approach for smart detection of epileptic seizures using higher order spectral analysis	PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Cloud computing; Epilepsy; Ensemble machine learning; EEG; Internet of Things; Healthcare	IOT	The present paper proposes a smart framework for detection of epileptic seizures using the concepts of IoT technologies, cloud computing and machine learning. This framework processes the acquired scalp EEG signals by Fast Walsh Hadamard transform. Then, the transformed frequency-domain signals are examined using higher-order spectral analysis to extract amplitude and entropy-based statistical features. The extracted features have been selected by means of correlation-based feature selection algorithm to achieve more real-time classification with reduced complexity and delay. Finally, the samples containing selected features have been fed to ensemble machine learning techniques for classification into several classes of EEG states, viz. normal, interictal and ictal. The employed techniques include Dagging, Bagging, Stacking, MultiBoost AB and AdaBoost M1 algorithms in integration with C4.5 decision tree algorithm as the base classifier. The results of the ensemble techniques are also compared with standalone C4.5 decision tree and SVM algorithms. The performance analysis through simulation results reveals that the ensemble of AdaBoost M1 and C4.5 decision tree algorithms with higher-order spectral features is an adequate technique for automated detection of epileptic seizures in real-time. This technique achieves 100% classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values with optimally small classification time.

We explored if task switching reveals altered alpha power and HRV in cognitively healthy individuals with AD pathology in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and whether HRV improves the AD pathology classification by alpha power alone. We compared low and high alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) and HRV parameters during task switch testing between two groups of cognitively healthy participants classified by CSF amyloid/tau ratio: normal (CH-NAT, n = 19) or pathological (CH-PAT, n = 27). For the task switching paradigm, participants were required to name the color or word for each colored word stimulus, with two sequential stimuli per trial. Trials include color (cC) or word (wW) repeats with low load repeating, and word (cW) or color switch (wC) for high load switching. HRV was assessed for RR interval, standard deviation of RR-intervals (SDNN) and root mean squared successive differences (RMSSD) in time domain, and low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and LF/ HF ratio in frequency domain. Results showed that CH-PATs compared to CH-NATs presented: 1) increased (less negative) low alpha ERD during low load repeat trials and lower word switch cost (low alpha: p = 0.008, Cohen's d = -0.83, 95% confidence interval -1.44 to -0.22, and high alpha: p = -0.019, Cohen's d = -0.73, 95% confidence interval 1.34 to 0.13); 2) decreasing HRV from rest to task, suggesting hyper-activated sympatho-vagal responses. 3) CH-PATs classification by alpha ERD was improved by supplementing HRV signatures, supporting a potentially compromised brain-heart interoceptive regulation in CH-PATs. Further experiments are needed to validate these findings for clinical significance.

Deep participation of patients with stroke in active rehabilitation training using motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can greatly improve the rehabilitation efficiency. At present, the brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery is mostly in the laboratory research stage, and the participants are mostly healthy people. Understanding EEG differences between healthy people and stroke patients is important. A Novel EEG decoding algorithm is proposed based on this present situation, which adopt the strategy of multi-domain feature complementary fusion in feature extraction, and the ensemble learning to enhance the robustness of the model. Multi-scale features were extracted from time domain, frequency domain, space domain and time-frequency domain for fusion, to effectively utilize them to improve the classification accuracy. The ensemble linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier based on Boosting algorithm is proposed to make boosting in the multidomain feature level, and extract and optimize the most discriminative features from the high-dimensional feature combination space, which maximizes the ratio of the discreteness between inter-class and intra-class. Then, the public dataset and the collected EEG dataset of healthy subjects and stroke patients are used to validated the effective of proposed algorithm, and neural activation characteristics of participants during motor imagery processing are analyzed. Compared with the single feature classification algorithm, the proposed method has better positive effects on classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Kappa, which opens up new possibilities for the usage of brain-controlled active rehabilitation devices.

In such contexts, gaze can be highly informative about others' intentions, goals, and upcoming decisions. Here, we investigated whether a humanoid robot's gaze (mutual or averted) influences the way people strategically reason in a social decision-making context. Specifically, participants played a strategic game with the robot iCub while we measured their behavior and neural activity by means of electroencephalography (EEG). Participants were slower to respond when iCub established mutual gaze before their decision, relative to averted gaze. This was associated with a higher decision threshold in the drift diffusion model and accompanied by more synchronized EEG alpha activity. In addition, we found that participants reasoned about the robot's actions in both conditions. However, those who mostly experienced the averted gaze were more likely to adopt a self-oriented strategy, and their neural activity showed higher sensitivity to outcomes. Together, these findings suggest that robot gaze acts as a strong social signal for humans, modulating response times, decision threshold, neural synchronization, as well as choice strategies and sensitivity to outcomes. This has strong implications for all contexts involving human-robot interaction, from robotics to clinical applications.

J	Benwell, CSY; Coldea, A; Harvey, M; Thut, G				Benwell, Christopher S. Y.; Coldea, Andra; Harvey, Monika; Thut, Gregor			Low pre-stimulus EEG alpha power amplifies visual awareness but not visual sensitivity	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; EEG; oscillations; perceptual awareness	OSCILLATIONS; PHASE; PERCEPTION; EXCITABILITY; MECHANISM; REFLECT; RHYTHMS; BIAS	Pre-stimulus oscillatory neural activity has been linked to the level of awareness of sensory stimuli. More specifically, the power of low-frequency oscillations (primarily in the alpha-band, i.e., 8-14 Hz) prior to stimulus onset is inversely related to measures of subjective performance in visual tasks, such as confidence and visual awareness. Intriguingly, the same EEG signature does not seem to influence objective measures of task performance (i.e., accuracy). We here examined whether this dissociation holds when stringent accuracy measures are used. Previous EEG-studies have employed 2-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) discrimination tasks to link prestimulus oscillatory activity to correct/incorrect responses as an index of accuracy/objective performance at the single-trial level. However, 2-AFC tasks do not provide a good estimate of single-trial accuracy, as many of the responses classified as correct will be contaminated by guesses (with the chance correct response rate being 50%). Here instead, we employed a 19-AFC letter identification task to measure accuracy and the subjectively reported level of perceptual awareness on each trial. As the correct guess rate is negligible (-5%), this task provides a purer measure of accuracy. Our results replicate the inverse relationship between pre-stimulus alpha/ beta-band power and perceptual awareness ratings in the absence of a link to discrimination accuracy. Pre-stimulus oscillatory phase did not predict either subjective awareness or accuracy. Our results hence confirm a dissociation of the pre-stimulus EEG power-task performance link for subjective versus objective measures of performance, and further substantiate pre-stimulus alpha power as a neural predictor of visual awareness.

Behavioral and brain measures of cognitive control are associated with a variety of psychiatric disorders and conditions as well as daily life functioning. Recognition of the importance of cognitive control in human behavior has led to intensive research into behavioral and neurobiological correlates. Oscillations in the theta band (4-8 Hz) over medial frontal recording sites are becoming increasingly established as a direct neural index of certain aspects of cognitive control. In this review, we point toward evidence that theta acts to coordinate multiple neural processes in disparate brain regions during task processing to optimize behavior. Theta-related signals in human electroencephalography include the N2, the error-related negativity, and measures of theta power in the (time-)frequency domain. We investigate how these theta signals are affected in a wide range of psychiatric conditions with known deficiencies in cognitive control: anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and substance abuse. Theta-related control signals and their temporal consistency were found to differ in most patient groups compared with healthy control subjects, suggesting fundamental deficits in reactive and proactive control. Notably, however, clinical studies directly investigating the role of theta in the coordination of goal-directed processes across different brain regions are uncommon and are encouraged in future research. A finer-grained analysis of flexible, subsecond-scale functional networks in psychiatric disorders could contribute to a dimensional understanding of psychopathology.

Methods: A beamforming source-analysis method was used to construct virtual sensors and an automatic algorithm was applied to detect HFOs (80-250 Hz). We evaluated the concordance of MEG findings with the sources of iEEG HFOs, the clinically defined seizure onset zone (SOZ), the location of resected brain structures, and with post-operative outcome. Results: In 8/9 patients there was good concordance between the sources of MEG HFOs and iEEG HFOs and the SOZ. Significantly more HFOs were detected in iEEG relative to MEG t(71) = 2.85, p < .05. There was good concordance between sources of MEG HFOs and the resected area in patients with good and poor outcome, however HFOs were also detected outside of the resected area in patients with poor outcome. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of automatically detecting HFOs non-invasively in MEG recordings in paediatric patients, and confirm compatibility of results with invasive recordings. Significance: This approach provides support for the non-invasive detection of HFOs to aid surgical planning and potentially reduce the need for invasive monitoring, which is pertinent to paediatric patients.

J	Sase, T; Kitajo, K				Sase, Takumi; Kitajo, Keiichi			The metastable brain associated with autistic-like traits of typically developing individuals	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							SPECTRUM QUOTIENT AQ; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; NETWORK DYNAMICS; TIME-SERIES; GAMMA-POWER; EEG ALPHA; MODELS; PERFORMANCE	Metastability in the brain is thought to be a mechanism involved in dynamic organization of cognitive and behavioral functions across multiple spatiotemporal scales. However, it is not clear how such organization is realized in underlying neural oscillations in a high-dimensional state space. It was shown that macroscopic oscillations often form phase-phase coupling (PPC) and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) which result in synchronization and amplitude modulation, respectively, even without external stimuli. These oscillations can also make spontaneous transitions across synchronous states at rest. Using resting-state electroencephalographic signals and the autism-spectrum quotient scores acquired from healthy humans, we show experimental evidence that the PAC combined with PPC allows amplitude modulation to be transient, and that the metastable dynamics with this transient modulation is associated with autistic-like traits. In individuals with a longer attention span, such dynamics tended to show fewer transitions between states by forming delta-alpha PAC. We identified these states as two-dimensional metastable states that could share consistent patterns across individuals. Our findings suggest that the human brain dynamically organizes inter-individual differences in a hierarchy of macroscopic oscillations with multiple timescales by utilizing metastability. Author summary The human brain organizes cognitive and behavioral functions dynamically. For decades, the dynamic organization of underlying neural oscillations has been a fundamental topic in neuroscience research. Even without external stimuli, macroscopic oscillations often form phase-phase coupling and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) that result in synchronization and amplitude modulation, respectively, and can make spontaneous transitions across synchronous states at rest. Using resting-state electroencephalography signals acquired from healthy humans, we show evidence that these two neural couplings enable amplitude modulation to be transient, and that this transient modulation can be viewed as the transition among oscillatory states with different PAC strengths. We also demonstrate that such transition dynamics are associated with the ability to maintain attention to detail and to switch attention, as measured by autism-spectrum quotient scores. These individual dynamics were visualized as a trajectory among states with attracting tendencies, and involved consistent brain states across individuals. Our findings have significant implications for unraveling variability in the individual brains showing typical and atypical development.

The present manuscript uses computational modeling and machine learning to test the hypothesis that alpha-band (8-12 Hz) oscillations are involved in the updating of expectations based on experience. Participants learned that a visual cue predicted an aversive loud noise with a probability of 50%. The Rescorla-Wagner model of associative learning explained trial-wise changes in self-reported noise expectancy as well as alpha power changes. Experience in the past trial and self-reported expectancy for the subsequent trial were accurately decoded based on the topographical distribution of alpha power at specific latencies. Decodable information during initial association formation and contingency report recurred when viewing the conditioned cue. Findings support the idea that alpha oscillations have multiple, temporally specific, roles in the formation of associations between cues and outcomes.

Oscillatory Correlates of Selective Restudy	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						restudy; context; context retrieval; EEG; brain oscillations	MEMORY RETRIEVAL; CONTEXT; THETA; INTERFERENCE; REPETITION; DYNAMICS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; INHIBITION; MECHANISMS; ACCOUNT	Prior behavioral work has shown that selective restudy of some studied items leaves recall of the other studied items unaffected when lag between study and restudy is short, but improves recall of the other items when lag is prolonged. The beneficial effect has been attributed to context retrieval, assuming that selective restudy reactivates the context at study and thus provides a retrieval cue for the other items (Bauml, 2019). Here the results of two experiments are reported, in each of which subjects studied a list of items and then, after a short 2-min or a prolonged 10-min lag, restudied some of the list items. Participants' electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during both the study and restudy phases. In Experiment 2, but not in Experiment 1, subjects engaged in a mental context reinstatement task immediately before the restudy phase started, trying to mentally reinstate the study context. Results of Experiment 1 revealed a theta/alpha power increase from study to restudy after short lag and an alpha/beta power decrease after long lag. Engagement in the mental context reinstatement task in Experiment 2 eliminated the decrease in alpha/beta power. The results are consistent with the view that the observed alpha/beta decrease reflects context retrieval, which became obsolete when there was preceding mental context reinstatement.

High-frequency oscillations (HFOs), spikes, and cross-rate are quantifiable epileptogenic biomarkers. In this study, we sought to evaluate, using SEEG signals recorded before and after thermocoagulation, whether a variation in these markers is related to the therapeutic effect of this procedure and to the outcome of surgery. Methods Interictal segments of SEEG signals were analyzed in 38 patients during presurgical evaluation. We used an automatized method to quantify the rate of spikes, rate of HFOs, and cross-rate (a measure combining spikes and HFOs) before and after thermocoagulation. We analyzed the differences both at an individual level with a surrogate approach and at a group level with analysis of variance. We then evaluated the correlation between these variations and the clinical response to RF-TC and to subsequent resective surgery. Results After thermocoagulation, 19 patients showed a clinical improvement. At the individual level, clinically improved patients more frequently had a reduction in spikes and cross-rate in the epileptogenic zone than patients without clinical improvement (p = .002, p = .02). At a group level, there was a greater decrease of HFOs in epileptogenic and thermocoagulated zones in patients with clinical improvement (p < .05) compared to those with no clinical benefit. Eventually, a significant decrease of all the markers after RF-TC was found in patients with a favorable outcome of resective surgery (spikes, p = .026; HFOs, p = .03; cross-rate, p = .03). Significance Quantified changes in the rate of spikes, rate of HFOs, and cross-rate can be observed after thermocoagulation, and the reduction of these markers correlates with a favorable clinical outcome after RF-TC and with successful resective surgery. This may suggest that interictal biomarker modifications after RF-TC can be clinically used to predict the effectiveness of the thermocoagulation procedure and the outcome of resective surgery.

However, the neural mechanism of interruption has yet to be understood clearly, and previous studies have largely ignored the role of fatigue state. To address these issues, the present study explores the behavioral and electrophysiological effects of interruption on WM performance using electroencephalography (EEG) data. The moderating effect of fatigue is also explored. The participants performed spatial 2-back tasks with math task interruption, suspension interruption, and non-interruption under different fatigue states. The results show that interruption led to increased alpha activity and P300 amplitude, indicating inhibitory control to interference from irrelevant information. Analysis of P200 amplitude revealed that interruption affected attentional reallocation when resuming the primary task. Increased theta power indicated an increased demand for information maintenance during the interruption. A speeding-up effect was discovered after interruption; however, fatigue impaired cognitive ability and further exacerbated the negative effects of interruption on WM and behavioral performance. These findings contribute to a better understanding of cognitive activity during the interruption and of the interaction with fatigue, and provide further support for the theory of memory for goals (MFG).

J	Ko, WJ; Jeon, E; Jeong, S; Suk, HI				Ko, Wonjun; Jeon, Eunjin; Jeong, Seungwoo; Suk, Heung-Il			Multi-Scale Neural Network for EEG Representation Learning in BCI	IEEE COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE MAGAZINE			English	Article								Recent advances in deep learning have had a methodological and practical impact on brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Among the various deep network architectures, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been well suited for spatio-spectral-temporal electroencephalogram (EEG) signal representation learning. Most of the existing CNN-based methods described in the literature extract features at a sequential level of abstraction with repetitive nonlinear operations and involve densely connected layers for classification. However, studies in neurophysiology have revealed that EEG signals carry information in different ranges of frequency components. To better reflect these multi-frequency properties in EEGs, we propose a novel deep multi-scale neural network that discovers feature representations in multiple frequency/time ranges and extracts relationships among electrodes, i.e., spatial representations, for subject intention/condition identification. Furthermore, by completely representing EEG signals with spatio-spectral-temporal information, the proposed method can be utilized for diverse paradigms in both active and passive BCIs, contrary to existing methods that are primarily focused on single-paradigm BCIs. To demonstrate the validity of our proposed method, we conducted experiments on various paradigms of active/passive BCI datasets. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved performance improvements when judged against comparable state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we analyzed the proposed method using different techniques, such as PSD curves and relevance score inspection to validate the multi-scale EEG signal information capturing ability, activation pattern maps for investigating the learned spatial filters, and t-SNE plotting for visualizing represented features. Finally, we also demonstrated our method's application to real-world problems. Based on our experimental results and analyses, we believe that the proposed multi-scale neural network can be useful for various BCI paradigms, as a starting model or as a backbone network in any new BCI experiments.

In this study, the preprocessing stages are optimized to improve the performance of MI-BCI systems in terms of the accuracy and the timing cost. Taguchi method is adopted for the optimization study. Time window-step size, time interval, theta frequency band, and mu and beta frequency bands are considered as controllable factors in the preprocessing stage. The preprocessing stages are performed according to an experimental plan created by the Taguchi method. The study is applied on BCI Competition IV-2b dataset. The features are extracted from the data with the Hjorth algorithm and classified by using the SVM classifier. The statistical significance and relatively contribution effects of factors on the performance parameters are tested with ANOVA. As a result, optimum combinations of the preprocessing stage factors providing the highest accuracy and the lowest timing cost are both individually and simultaneously revealed. In addition, it is concluded that the most effective factor on the preprocessing stage is determined as time window-step size. Consequently, the results of various combinations of the preprocessing stages on the MIBCI performance are revealed in terms of both the accuracy and the timing cost.

This trial-to-trial variability (TTV) has been much studied, however how this neural variability quenching is influenced by the ongoing dynamics of the prestimulus period is unknown. Utilizing a human intracranial stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) data set, we investigate how prestimulus dynamics, as operationalized by standard deviation (SD), shapes poststimulus activity through trial-to-trial variability (TTV). We first observed greater poststimulus variability quenching in those real trials exhibiting high prestimulus variability as observed in all frequency bands. Next, we found that the relative effect of the stimulus was higher in the later (300-600ms) than the earlier (0-300ms) poststimulus period. Lastly, we replicate our findings in a separate EEG dataset and extend them by finding that trials with high prestimulus variability in the theta and alpha bands had faster reaction times. Together, our results demonstrate that stimulus-related activity, including its variability, is a blend of two factors: 1) the effects of the external stimulus itself, and 2) the effects of the ongoing dynamics spilling over from the prestimulus period the state at stimulus onset with the second dwarfing the influence of the first.

It typically contains a strong 10 Hz oscillatory component, suggesting that visual information reverberates in the human brain as a "perceptual echo ". The neural origin of these echoes remains unknown. To address this question, we recorded EEG and fMRI in two separate sessions. In both sessions, a disk whose luminance followed a random (white noise) sequence was presented in the upper left quadrant. Individual IRFs were derived from the EEG session. These IRFs were then used as "response templates " to reconstruct an estimate of the EEG during the fMRI session, by convolution with the corresponding random luminance sequences. The 7-14 Hz (alpha, the main frequency component of the IRF) envelope of the reconstructed EEG was finally used as an fMRI regressor, to determine which brain voxels co-varied with the oscillations elicited by the luminance sequence, i.e., the "perceptual echoes ". The reconstructed envelope of EEG alpha was significantly correlated with BOLD responses in V1 and V2. Surprisingly, this correlation was visible outside, but not within the directly (retinotopically) stimulated region. We tentatively interpret this lack of alpha modulation as a BOLD saturation effect, since the overall stimulus-induced BOLD response was inversely related, across voxels, to the signal variability over time. In conclusion, our results suggest that perceptual echoes originate in early visual cortex, driven by widespread activity in V1 and V2, not retinotopically restricted, but possibly reflecting the propagation of a travelling alpha wave.

Emerging biomarkers for child & family intervention studies: A review of EEG studies of parenting	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						EEG; ERP; Parenting; Self-regulation; Child and family intervention emotion	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; BRAIN ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; MATERNAL SENSITIVITY; EMOTION REGULATION; ALPHA-ASYMMETRY; INFANT DISTRESS; YOUNG-CHILDREN; RESPONSES	Most interventions for childhood mental health problems require significant parental involvement, and treatment programs are increasingly incorporating components aimed at enhancing parents' own self-regulation in the context of potentially stressful parent-child interactions. This paper discusses the promise of EEG in examining the rapidly unfolding perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and regulatory processes that occur in parenting, in hopes of ultimately informing child and family interventions. First, we review two separate bodies of work that have used EEG with parents: one examining event-related potential (ERP) measures, and the other examining frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA). We discuss benefits of each within the study of parenting, and also suggest other EEG metrics (such as event-related time-frequency analyses) that can be leveraged to fill current gaps in our knowledge. Finally, we discuss the potential for these findings to inform clinical work with children and families, such as identifying biomarkers that could aid in assessment, treatment recommendations, and monitoring response to interventions.

Objective: We assessed whether transcranial photobiomodulation with near-infrared light modulates cerebral electrical activity through electroencephalogram (EEG) and cerebral blood flow (CBF). Methods: We conducted a single-blind, sham-controlled pilot study to test the effect of continuous (c-tPBM), pulse (p-tPBM), and sham (s-tPBM) transcranial photobiomodulation on EEG oscillations and CBF using diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) in a sample of ten healthy subjects [6F/4 M; mean age 28.6 +/- 12.9 years]. c-tPBM near-infrared radiation (NIR) (830 nm; 54.8 mW/cm(2); 65.8 J/cm(2); 2.3 kJ) and p-tPBM (830 nm; 10 Hz; 54.8 mW/cm(2); 33%; 21.7 J/cm(2); 0.8 kJ) were delivered concurrently to the frontal areas by four LED clusters. EEG and DCS recordings were performed weekly before, during, and after each tPBM session. Results: c-tPBM significantly boosted gamma (t = 3.02, df = 7, p < 0.02) and beta (t = 2.91, df = 7, p < 0.03) EEG spectral powers in eyes-open recordings and gamma power (t = 3.61, df = 6, p < 0.015) in eyes-closed recordings, with a widespread increase over frontal-central scalp regions. There was no significant effect of tPBM on CBF compared to sham. Conclusion: Our data suggest a dose-dependent effect of tPBM with NIR on cerebral gamma and beta neuronal activity. Altogether, our findings support the neuromodulatory effect of transcranial NIR.

J	Ablin, P; Cardoso, JF; Gramfort, A				Ablin, Pierre; Cardoso, Jean-Francois; Gramfort, Alexandre			Spectral Independent Component Analysis with noise modeling for M/EEG source separation	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						ICA; EEG; MEG; Source separation	COMPLETE ARTIFACT REMOVAL; BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; JOINT DIAGONALIZATION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; OSCILLATIONS; MEG; ICA; ALGORITHM	Background: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a widespread tool for exploration and denoising of electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals. In its most common formulation, ICA assumes that the signal matrix is a noiseless linear mixture of independent sources that are assumed non-Gaussian. A limitation is that it enforces to estimate as many sources as sensors or to rely on a detrimental PCA step. Methods: We present the Spectral Matching ICA (SMICA) model. Signals are modelled as a linear mixing of independent sources corrupted by additive noise, where sources and the noise are stationary Gaussian time series. Thanks to the Gaussian assumption, the negative log-likelihood has a simple expression as a sum of `divergences' between the empirical spectral covariance matrices of the signals and those predicted by the model. The model parameters can then be estimated by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Results: On phantom MEG datasets with low amplitude dipole sources (20 nAm), SMICA makes a median dipole localization error of 1.5 mm while competing methods make an error >= 7 mm. Experiments on EEG datasets show that SMICA identifies a source subspace which contains sources that have less pairwise mutual information, and are better explained by the projection of a single dipole on the scalp. With 10 sources, the number of strongly dipolar sources (dipolarity >90%) is more than 80% for SMICA while competing methods do not exceed 65%. Comparison with existing methods: With the noisy model of SMICA, the number of sources to be recovered is controlled by choosing the size of the mixing matrix to be fitted rather than by a preprocessing step of dimension reduction which is required in traditional noise-free ICA methods. Conclusions: SMICA is a promising alternative to other noiseless ICA models based on non-Gaussian assumptions.

These complex processes can be boosted by attentional mechanisms triggered by multi-sensory information. Previous electrophysiological studies suggest that brain oscillations are sensitive to different hierarchical complexity levels of the input, making them a plausible neural substrate for speech parsing. Here, we investigated the functional role of brain oscillations during concurrent speech segmentation and meaning acquisition in sixty 9-year-old children. We collected EEG data during an audio-visual statistical learning task during which children were exposed to a learning condition with consistent word-picture associations and a random condition with inconsistent word-picture associations before being tested on their ability to recall words and word-picture associations. We capitalized on the brain dynamics to align neural activity to the same rate as an external rhythmic stimulus to explore modulations of neural synchronization and phase synchronization between electrodes during multi-sensory word learning. Results showed enhanced power at both word- and syllabic-rate and increased EEG phase synchronization between frontal and occipital regions in the learning compared to the random condition. These findings suggest that multi-sensory cueing and attentional mechanisms play an essential role in children's successful word learning.

Here, we examined the developmental change of resting EEG power and its links to vocabulary acquisition in school-age children. We further explored what mechanisms may mediate the relation between brain rhythm maturation and vocabulary knowledge. Eyes-opened resting-state EEG data were recorded from 53 typically-developing Chinese children every 2 years between the ages of 7 and 11. Our results showed first that delta, theta, and gamma power decreased over time, whereas alpha and beta power increased over time. Second, after controlling for general cognitive abilities, age, home literacy environment, and phonological skills, theta decreases explained 6.9% and 14.4% of unique variance in expressive vocabulary at ages 9 and 11, respectively. We also found that beta increase from age 7 to 9 significantly predicted receptive vocabulary at age 11. Finally, theta decrease predicted expressive vocabulary through the effects of phoneme deletion at age 9 and tone discrimination at age 11. These results substantiate the important role of brain oscillations at rest, especially theta rhythm, in language development. The developmental change of brain rhythms could serve as sensitive biomarkers for vocabulary development in school-age children, which would be of great value in identifying children at risk of language impairment.

In this work, the instantaneous radiated power (IRP) is proposed as a new whole-brain descriptor, reflecting the cortical activity from an exclusively electromagnetic perspective. Considering that the brain consists of multiple elementary dipoles, the whole-brain IRP takes into account the radiational contribution of all cortical sources. Unlike conventional EEG analyses that evaluate a large number of scalp or source locations, IRP reflects a whole-brain, event-related measure and forces the analysis to focus on a single time-series, thus efficiently reducing the EEG spatial dimensions and multiple comparisons. Results To apply the developed methodology in real EEG data, two groups (25 controls vs 30 body dysmorphic disorder, BDD, patients) were matched for age and sex and tested in a prepulse inhibition (PPI) and facilitation (PPF) paradigm. Two global brain descriptors were extracted for between-groups and between-conditions comparison purposes, namely the global field power (GFP) and the whole-brain IRP. Results showed that IRP can replicate the expected condition differences (with PPF being greater than PPI responses), exhibiting also reduced levels in BDD compared to control group overall. There were also similar outcomes using GFP and IRP, suggesting consistency between the two measures. Finally, regression analysis showed that the PPI-related IRP (during N100 time-window) is negatively correlated with BDD psychometric scores. Conclusions Investigating the brain activity with IRP significantly reduces the data dimensionality, giving insights about global brain synchronization and strength. We conclude that IRP can replicate the existing evidence regarding sensorimotor gating effects, revealing also group electrophysiological alterations. Finally, electrophysiological IRP responses exhibited correlations with BDD psychometrics, potentially useful as supplementary tool in BDD symptomatology.

In this study, we further investigated if this ability can be predicted by the individual brain's functional organization at rest. To this purpose, we recorded resting-state, high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) in healthy volunteers before performing the DTP task. This allowed us to obtain source-reconstructed cortical activity and compute whole-brain resting state functional connectivity at the source level. We then extracted phase locking values from the parceled cortex based on the Destrieux atlas to estimate individual functional connectivity at rest in the three task-related networks. Furthermore, we applied a machine-learning approach (i.e., support vector regression) and were able to predict both behavioral (response speed and accuracy adaptation) and neural (ERP modulation) task-dependent outcome. Finally, by exploiting graph theory nodal measures (i.e., degree, strength, local efficiency and clustering coefficient), we characterized the contribution of each node to the task-related neural and behavioral effects. These results show that the brain's intrinsic functional organization can be potentially used as a predictor of the system capability to adjust motor control in a flexible and implicit way. Additionally, our findings support the theoretical framework in which cognitive control is conceived as an emergent property rooted in bottom-up associative learning processes.

To provide insights into this connection, we studied the cortical correlates of risk-sensitive skin conductance peaks using electroencephalography. Fluctuations in skin conductance responses were elicited while participants played a threat-of-shock card game. Precise temporal information about skin conductance peaks was obtained by applying continuous decomposition analysis on raw electrodermal signals. Shortly preceding skin conductance peaks, we observed a decrease in oscillatory power in the frequency range between 3 and 17 Hz in occipitotemporal cortical areas. Atlas-based analysis indicated the left lingual gyrus as the source of the power decrease. The oscillatory power averaged across 3-17 Hz showed a significant negative relationship with the skin conductance peak amplitude. Our findings indicate a possible interaction between attention and threat perception. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We studied neural oscillations associated with risk-sensitive skin conductance responses. Going beyond previous studies, we applied methods with high-temporal resolution to account for the temporal properties of the sympathetic activity. Preceding skin conductance peaks, we observed decreased occipital cortex oscillatory power and a relationship between the oscillatory power decrease and the skin conductance peak amplitude. Our study suggests an interaction between attention and emotion such as threat perception reflected in skin conductance responses.

However, most evidence derives from top-down tasks, and it remains elusive whether bottom-up processing also entails dynamic coordination. Here, we developed a novel feature processing paradigm and combined time-resolved behavioral measurements and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings to address the question. Specifically, a salient color in a multicolor display serves as a noninformative cue to capture attention and presumably reset the oscillations of feature processing. We then measured the behavioral performance of a probe stimulus associated with either high- or low-salient color at varied temporal lags after the cue. First, the behavioral results (i.e., reaction time) display an alpha-band (similar to 8 Hz) profile with a consistent phase lag between high- and low-salient conditions. Second, simultaneous EEG recordings show that behavioral performance is modulated by the phase of alpha-band neural oscillation at the onset of the probes. Finally, high- and low-salient probes are associated with distinct preferred phases of alpha-band neural oscillations. Taken together, our behavioral and neural results convergingly support a central function of alpha-band rhythms in feature processing, that is, features with varied saliency levels are processed at different phases of alpha neural oscillations.

However, this sensorimotor resonance is modulated by a multitude of social factors including similarity in bodily appearance, e.g. skin colour. The current study investigated whether increasing self-other similarity via virtual transfer to another colour body reduced ingroup bias in sensorimotor resonance. A sample of 58 white participants was momentarily transferred to either a black or a white body using virtual reality technology. We then employed electroencephalography to examine event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the sensorimotor beta (13-23 Hz) oscillations while they viewed black, white and violet photorealistic virtual agents being touched with a noxious or soft object. While the noxious treatment of a violet agent did not increase beta ERD, amplified beta ERD in response to black agent's noxious vs soft treatment was found in perceivers transferred to a black body. Transfer to the white body dismissed the effect. Further exploratory analysis implied that the pain-related beta ERD occurred only when the agent and the participant were of the same colour. The results suggest that even short-lasting changes in bodily resemblance can modulate sensorimotor resonance to others' perceived pain.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography provide complementary spatiotemporal information and simultaneous recording of these two modalities can remove inter-session drug response and environment variability. We sought to assess the effects of ketamine and midazolam on simultaneous electrophysiological and hemodynamic recordings during working memory (WM) processes. Thirty participants were included in a placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design with ketamine and midazolam. Compared to placebo, ketamine administration attenuated theta power increases and alpha power decreases and midazolam attenuated low beta band decreases to increasing WM load. Additionally, ketamine caused larger blood-oxygen-dependent (BOLD) signal increases in the supplementary motor area and angular gyrus, and weaker deactivations of the default mode network (DMN), whereas no difference was found between midazolam and placebo. Ketamine administration caused positive temporal correlations between frontal-midline theta (fm-theta) power and the BOLD signal to disappear and attenuated negative correlations. However, the relationship between fm-theta and the BOLD signal from DMN areas was maintained in some participants during ketamine administration, as increasing theta strength was associated with stronger BOLD signal reductions in these areas. The presence of, and ability to manipulate, both positive and negative associations between the BOLD signal and fm-theta suggest the presence of multiple fm-theta components involved in WM processes, with ketamine administration disrupting one or more of these theta-linked WM strategies.

Indeed, phase-amplitude interactions are believed to allow for the transfer of information from large-scale brain networks, oscillating at low frequencies, to local, rapidly oscillating neural assemblies. A promising approach to estimating such interactions is the use of transfer entropy (TE), a non-linear, information-theory-based effective connectivity measure. The conventional method involves feeding instantaneous phase and amplitude time series, extracted at the target frequencies, to a TE estimator. In this work, we propose that the problem of directed phase-amplitude interaction detection is recast as a phase TE estimation problem, under the hypothesis that estimating TE from data of the same nature, i.e., two phase time series, will improve the robustness to the common confounding factors that affect connectivity measures, such as the presence of high noise levels. We implement our proposal using a kernel-based TE estimator, defined in terms of Renyi's alpha entropy, which has successfully been used to compute single-trial phase TE. We tested our approach on the synthetic data generated through a simulation model capable of producing a time series with directed phase-amplitude interactions at two given frequencies, and on EEG data from a cognitive task designed to activate working memory, a memory system whose underpinning mechanisms are thought to include phase-amplitude couplings. Our proposal detected statistically significant interactions between the simulated signals at the desired frequencies for the synthetic data, identifying the correct direction of the interaction. It also displayed higher robustness to noise than the alternative methods. The results attained for the working memory data showed that the proposed approach codes connectivity patterns based on directed phase-amplitude interactions, that allow for the different cognitive load levels of the working memory task to be differentiated.

Cortical Oscillations and Connectivity During Postoperative Recovery	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article						cognitive dysfunction; delayed emergence from anesthesia; delirium; electroencephalography; postanesthesia nursing	GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; DELIRIUM; EMERGENCE; ADULTS	Background: The objective of this study was to test whether postoperative electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers, parietal alpha power and frontal-parietal connectivity, were associated with measures of clinical recovery in adult surgical patients. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study that analyzed intraoperative connectivity patterns in adult surgical patients (N=53). Wireless, whole-scalp EEG data were collected in the postanesthesia care unit and assessed for relevance to clinical and neurocognitive recovery. Parietal alpha power and frontal-parietal connectivity (estimated by weighted phase lag index) were tested for associations with postanesthesia care unit discharge readiness and University of Michigan Sedation Scale scores upon postoperative admission. Bivariable correlation and regression models were constructed to test for unadjusted associations, then multivariable regression models were constructed to adjust for confounding. Results: Postoperative EEG patterns were characterized by a predominance of alpha parietal power and frontal-parietal connectivity. Neither relative parietal alpha power (% alpha, -0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.41 to 0.90; P=0.657) nor alpha frontal-parietal connectivity (weighted phase lag index, -82; 95% CI, -237 to 73; P=0.287) were associated with time until postanesthesia discharge criteria were met. Furthermore, neither alpha power (-0.03; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.01; P=0.206) nor alpha frontal-parietal connectivity (-4.2; 95% CI, -11 to 2.6; P=0.226) were associated with sedation scores upon initial assessment. Conclusions: In a pragmatic study investigating clinically relevant endpoints of postoperative recovery, we found no correlation with surrogate measures of brain neurodynamics. These data contribute to the overall impetus of developing anesthetic-invariant and generalizable markers of brain recovery.

User Adaptation to Closed-Loop Decoding of Motor Imagery Termination	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Decoding; Clocks; Electroencephalography; Microsoft Windows; Synchronization; Task analysis; Calibration; Brain&#8211; machine interface (BMI); EEG; motor imagery; motor termination; latency; decoding adaptation	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; BETA-SYNCHRONIZATION; FINGER MOVEMENT; CORTICAL AREAS; MU-RHYTHM; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; ONSET; BAND	One of the most popular methods in non-invasive brain machine interfaces (BMI) relies on the decoding of sensorimotor rhythms associated to sustained motor imagery. Although motor imagery has been intensively studied, its termination is mostly neglected. Objective: Here, we provide insights in the decoding of motor imagery termination and investigate the use of such decoder in closed-loop BMI. Methods: Participants (N = 9) were asked to perform kinesthetic motor imagery of both hands simultaneously cued with a clock indicating the initiation and termination of the action. Using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, we built a decoder to detect the transition between event-related desynchronization and event-related synchronization. Features for this decoder were correlates of motor termination in the upper mu and beta bands. Results: The decoder reached an accuracy of 76.2% (N = 9), revealing the high robustness of our approach. More importantly, this paper shows that the decoding of motor termination has an intrinsic latency mainly due to the delayed appearance of its correlates. Because the latency was consistent and thus predictable, users were able to compensate it after training. Conclusion: Using our decoding system, BMI users were able to adapt their behavior and modulate their sensorimotor rhythm to stop the device (clock) accurately on time. Significance: These results show the importance of closed-loop evaluations of BMI decoders and open new possibilities for BMI control using decoding of movement termination.

The neurobiology of prefrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in promoting brain plasticity: A systematic review and meta-analyses of human and rodent studies	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Neurobiology; tDCS; Meta-analysis; Functional connectivity; Oscillation; Human; Rodent; fMRI; EEG; MEG; LTP; BDNF	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; HUMAN MOTOR CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BDNF LEVELS; IN-VIVO; MODULATION	The neurobiological mechanisms underlying prefrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) remain elusive. Randomized, sham-controlled trials in humans and rodents applying in vivo prefrontal tDCS were included to explore whether prefrontal tDCS modulates resting-state and event-related functional connectivity, neural oscillation and synaptic plasticity. Fifty studies were included in the systematic review and 32 in the metaanalyses. Neuroimaging meta-analysis indicated anodal prefrontal tDCS significantly enhanced bilateral median cingulate activity [familywise error (FWE)-corrected p < .005]; meta-regression revealed a positive relationship between changes in median cingulate activity after tDCS and current density (FWE-corrected p < .005) as well as electric current strength (FWE-corrected p .05). Meta-analyses of electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography data revealed nonsignificant changes (ps .1) in both resting-state and event-related oscillatory power across all frequency bands. Applying anodal tDCS over the rodent hippocampus/prefrontal cortex enhanced long-term potentiation and brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression in the stimulated brain regions (ps <.005). Evidence supporting prefrontal tDCS administration is preliminary; more methodologically consistent studies evaluating its effects on cognitive function that include brain activity measurements are needed.

Although growing evidence shows a strong link between alpha oscillations and the functionality of the visual system, asymmetries in alpha oscillatory patterns still need to be investigated. Converging findings indicate that the typical alpha desynchronization occurring in the transition from the eyes-closed to the eyes-open resting state might represent an index of reactivity of the visual system. Thus, investigating hemispheric asymmetries in EEG reactivity at the opening of the eyes in brain-lesioned patients may shed light on the contribution of specific cortical sites and each hemisphere in regulating the oscillatory patterns reflecting the functionality of the visual system. To this aim, EEG signal was recorded during eyes-closed and eyes-open resting state in hemianopic patients with posterior left or right lesions, patients without hemianopia with anterior lesions and healthy controls. Hemianopics with both left and right posterior lesions showed a reduced alpha reactivity at the opening of the eyes, suggesting that posterior cortices have a pivotal role in the functionality of alpha oscillations. However, right-lesioned hemianopics showed a greater dysfunction, demonstrated by a reactivity reduction more distributed over the scalp, compared to left-lesioned hemianopics. Moreover, they also revealed impaired reactivity in the theta range. This favors the hypothesis of a specialized role of the right hemisphere in orchestrating oscillatory patterns, both coordinating widespread alpha oscillatory activity and organizing focal processing in the theta range, to support visual processing at the opening of the eyes.

At present, little is known about the neural functions that support listening effort. One form of neural activity that has been suggested to reflect listening effort is the power of 8-12 Hz (alpha) oscillations measured by electroencephalography (EEG). Alpha power in two cortical regions has been associated with effortful listening-left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and parietal cortex-but these relationships have not been examined in the same listeners. Further, there are few studies available investigating neural correlates of effort in the individuals with cochlear implants. Here we tested 16 CI users in a novel effort-focused speech-in-noise listening paradigm, and confirm a relationship between alpha power and self-reported effort ratings in parietal regions, but not left IFG. The parietal relationship was not linear but quadratic, with alpha power comparatively lower when effort ratings were at the top and bottom of the effort scale, and higher when effort ratings were in the middle of the scale. Results are discussed in terms of cognitive systems that are engaged in difficult listening situations, and the implication for clinical translation.

BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; theta; gamma; cross-frequency coupling; phase-amplitude coupling; short-term memory capacity	WORKING-MEMORY; BAND ACTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; ABILITY; NUMBER; TASK; LOAD; EEG	Several studies suggest that EEG parameters, reflecting top-down processes in the brain, may predict cognitive performance, e.g. short-term memory (STM) capacity. According to Lisman and Idiart's model, STM capacity is predicted by theta and gamma EEG waves and their ratio. This model suggests that the more periods of gamma band waves fit into one period of theta band waves, the more information can be stored. We replicated the study by Kaminski et al. (2011), which recorded spontaneous EEG activity and measured verbal STM capacity with a modified digit span task from the Wechsler battery. Our study included more subjects and two EEG recording sessions. We discuss the possible limits of EEG correlates of STM capacity as EEG parameters were not stable across the two measurements and no correlation was found between the theta/gamma ratio and performance in the digit span task.

Auditory Oddball Responses Across the Schizophrenia-Bipolar Spectrum and Their Relationship to Cognitive and Clinical Features	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; PAIRED STIMULI; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL ENDOPHENOTYPES; DIAGNOSTIC SPECIFICITY; PSYCHIATRIC-ILLNESS; DRUG DEVELOPMENT; TIME-FREQUENCY; P300; PSYCHOSIS; DISORDER	Objective: Neural activations during auditory oddball tasks may be endophenotypes for psychosis and bipolar disorder. The authors investigated oddball neural deviations that discriminate multiple diagnostic groups across the schizophrenia-bipolar spectrum (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, psychotic bipolar disorder, and nonpsychotic bipolar disorder) and clarified their relationship to clinical and cognitive features. Methods: Auditory oddball responses to standard and target tones from 64 sensor EEG recordings were compared across patients with psychosis (total N=597; schizophrenia, N=225; schizoaffective disorder, N=201; bipolar disorder with psychosis, N=171), patients with bipolar disorder without psychosis (N=66), and healthy comparison subjects (N=415) from the second iteration of the Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP2) study. EEG activity was analyzed in voltage and in the time-frequency domain (low, beta, and gamma bands). Event-related potentials (ERPs) were compared with those from an independent sample collected during the first iteration of B-SNIP (B-SNIP1; healthy subjects, N=211; psychosis group, N=526) to establish the repeatability of complex oddball ERPs across multiple psychosis syndromes (r values > 0.94 between B-SNIP1 and B-SNIP2). Results: Twenty-six EEG features differentiated the groups; they were used in discriminant and correlational analyses. EEG variables from the N100, P300, and low-frequency ranges separated the groups along a diagnostic continuum from healthy to bipolar disorder with psychosis/bipolar disorder without psychosis to schizoaffective disorder/schizophrenia and were strongly related to general cognitive function (r=0.91). P50 responses to standard trials and early beta/gamma frequency responses separated the bipolar disorder without psychosis group from the bipolar disorder with psychosis group. P200, N200, and late beta/gamma frequency responses separated the two bipolar disorder groups from the other groups. Conclusions: Neural deviations during auditory processing are related to psychosis history and bipolar disorder. There is a powerful transdiagnostic relationship between severity of these neural deviations and general cognitive performance. These results have implications for understanding the neurobiology of clinical syndromes across the schizophrenia-bipolar spectrum that may have an impact on future biomarker research.

Methods: We reviewed the EEG database in Jianyang People's Hospital. Patients with acute HZ (n=71) were enrolled from January 2016 to December 2020. Each included subject underwent a ten-minute and 16-channel EEG examination. Five epochs of 10-second EEG data in resting-state were collected from each HZ patient. Five 10-second resting-state EEG epochs from sex-and age-matched healthy controls (HC, n=71) who reported no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders and visited the hospital for routine physical examinations were collected. Brain network and graph theory analysis based on phase locking value parameter and functional ICA were performed using a self-writing Matlab code and the LORETA KEY tool. Results: Compared with the HC group, the HZ patients showed significant altered brain networks. The graph theory analysis revealed that the clustering coefficient and local efficiency of full band in HZ patients were lower than those in HC group (P<0.05). In beta band, the global efficiency and local efficiency of HZ patients group decreased, compared with healthy group (P<0.05). The functional ICA showed that three components showed significant differences between the two groups. In component 2, HZ patients showed excess superior frontal gyrus (BA10) neuro oscillation in delta band and less medial frontal gyrus (BA 11) neuro oscillation in beta and gamma bands than that in HCs. And for component 3, the alpha band of the HZ patients presented increased neuro activities in superior frontal gyrus (BA 11) and decreased neuro activities in occipital lobe (BA 18). In component 4, the inferior frontal gyrus (BA 47) showed excess activity in the left hemisphere and reduced activity in the right hemisphere in delta band, compared with HC group. Conclusion: Altered brain networks exist in resting-state EEG data of patients with acute HZ. The changes of EEG brain networks in HZ patients are characterized by decreased global efficiency and local efficiency in beta band. Moreover, the spontaneous oscillation of some brain regions involving pain management and the connectivity of default mode network changed in HZ patients. Our study provided novel understanding of HZ from an electrophysiological view, and led to converging evidence for treatment of HZ with neural regulation in future.

Despite the rapid growth of S3D technology (S3D) in education, very little has been known about the effects of S3D on human behavior and the corresponding brain's responses over traditional 2D display during conscious learning and Long-Term Memory (LTM) recall process. The present study aims to explore the effects of S3D technology on human behavior and the brain responses during learning and memory using an electroencephalography (EEG) technique. A sample of 68 participants between 18 and 30 years of age was recruited to perform three tasks: (1) Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM) test to assess the fluid intelligence ability; (2) learning task to study the S3D or 2D based contents for learning; and (3) memory recall task to assess the memory recall and retention performance. The participants were randomly assigned to two groups-2D group and S3D group, in such a way that their fluid intelligence ability, age, and background knowledge about the learning material are controlled. The analysis of behavioral data suggested that responses of both groups in terms of reaction time after two months of retention were statistically significantly different, F (2.66,125.09) = 4.47, p =.007, eta(2)(p) = 0.087. The differences between the S3D and 2D groups were identified by EEG analysis, i.e., the classifier correctly discriminated the EEG signals of both groups with more than 90% accuracy rate. The EEG source analysis showed statistically significant differences between the groups in the brain regions of BA 7, BA 10, BA 11, and BA 25, reflecting widespread neuronal networks involved in the S3D group as compared to the 2D group in the LTM recollection. In conclusion, it was experimentally showed that the human brain processed the S3D contents differently by utilizing more cortical regions and neuronal networks than the traditional 2D contents, which modulates the behavior of the participants by recollecting the LTM faster in the recall task.

J	Tidare, J; Leon, M; Astrand, E				Tidare, Jonatan; Leon, Miguel; Astrand, Elaine			Time-resolved estimation of strength of motor imagery representation by multivariate EEG decoding	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						decoding; multivariate; motor imagery; temporal dynamics; EEG		Objective. Multivariate decoding enables access to information encoded in multiple brain activity features with high temporal resolution. However, whether the strength, of which this information is represented in the brain, can be extracted across time within single trials remains largely unexplored. Approach. In this study, we addressed this question by applying a support vector machine (SVM) to extract motor imagery (MI) representations, from electroencephalogram (EEG) data, and by performing time-resolved single-trial analyses of the multivariate decoding. EEG was recorded from a group of healthy participants during MI of opening and closing of the same hand. Main results. Cross-temporal decoding revealed both dynamic and stationary MI-relevant features during the task. Specifically, features representing MI evolved dynamically early in the trial and later stabilized into a stationary network of MI features. Using a hierarchical genetic algorithm for selection of MI-relevant features, we identified primarily contralateral alpha and beta frequency features over the sensorimotor and parieto-occipital cortices as stationary which extended into a bilateral pattern in the later part of the trial. During the stationary encoding of MI, by extracting the SVM prediction scores, we analyzed MI-relevant EEG activity patterns with respect to the temporal dynamics within single trials. We show that the SVM prediction score correlates to the amplitude of univariate MI-relevant features (as documented from an extensive repertoire of previous MI studies) within single trials, strongly suggesting that these are functional variations of MI strength hidden in trial averages. Significance. Our work demonstrates a powerful approach for estimating MI strength continually within single trials, having far-reaching impact for single-trial analyses. In terms of MI neurofeedback for motor rehabilitation, these results set the ground for more refined neurofeedback reflecting the strength of MI that can be provided to patients continually in time.

However, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this activity remains a major challenge. Here, we measured memory-sensitive oscillations using intracranial electroencephalography recordings from the temporal cortex of patients performing an episodic memory task. When these patients subsequently underwent resection, we employed transcriptomics on the temporal cortex to link gene expression with brain oscillations and identified genes correlated with oscillatory signatures of memory formation across six frequency bands. A co-expression analysis isolated oscillatory signature-specific modules associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and ion channel activity, with highly correlated genes exhibiting strong connectivity within these modules. Using single-nucleus transcriptomics, we further revealed that these modules are enriched for specific classes of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and immunohistochemistry confirmed expression of highly correlated genes. This unprecedented dataset of patient-specific brain oscillations coupled to genomics unlocks new insights into the genetic mechanisms that support memory encoding.

J	Murray, CH; Tare, I; Perry, CM; Malina, M; Lee, R; de Wit, H				Murray, Conor H.; Tare, Ilaria; Perry, Claire M.; Malina, Michael; Lee, Royce; de Wit, Harriet			Low doses of LSD reduce broadband oscillatory power and modulate event-related potentials in healthy adults	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						LSD; EEG; ERP; Psychedelic; Microdose	LYSERGIC-ACID DIETHYLAMIDE; LIFE-THREATENING CANCER; MICRODOSING PSYCHEDELICS; PSILOCYBIN; EEG; DEPRESSION; ANXIETY; STATES; INHIBITION; MECHANISM	Rationale Classical psychedelics, including psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), are under investigation as potential therapeutic agents in psychiatry. Whereas most studies utilize relatively high doses, there are also reports of beneficial effects of "microdosing," or repeated use of very low doses of these drugs. The behavioral and neural effects of these low doses are not fully understood. Objectives To examine the effects of LSD (13 mu g and 26 mu g) versus placebo on resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) responses in healthy adults. Methods Twenty-two healthy men and women, 18 to 35 years old, participated in 3 EEG sessions in which they received placebo or LSD (13 mu g and 26 mu g) under double-blind conditions. During each session, participants completed drug effect and mood questionnaires at hourly intervals, and physiological measures were recorded. During expected peak drug effect, EEG recordings were obtained, including resting-state neural oscillations in scalp electrodes over default mode network (DMN) regions and P300, N170, and P100 ERPs evoked during a visual oddball paradigm. Results LSD dose-dependently reduced oscillatory power across delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands during both eyes closed and eyes open resting conditions. During the oddball task, LSD dose-dependently reduced ERP amplitudes for P300 and N170 components and increased P100 latency. LSD also produced dose-related increases in positive mood, elation, energy, and anxiety and increased heart rate and blood pressure. On a measure of altered states of consciousness, LSD dose-dependently increased Blissful State, but not other indices of perceptual or sensory effects typical of psychedelic drugs. The subjective effects of the drug were not correlated with the EEG measures. Conclusions Low doses of LSD produced broadband cortical desynchronization over the DMN during resting state and reduced P300 and N170 amplitudes, patterns similar to those reported with higher doses of psychedelics. Notably, these neurophysiological effects raise the possibility that very low doses of LSD may produce subtle behavioral and perhaps therapeutic effects that do not rely on the full psychedelic experience.

J	Zhang, SS; Chen, D; Tang, YB; Zhang, L				Zhang, Shasha; Chen, Dan; Tang, Yunbo; Zhang, Lei			Children ASD Evaluation Through Joint Analysis of EEG and Eye-Tracking Recordings With Graph Convolution Network	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						autism spectrum disorder; EEG; eye-tracking; multi-modality fusion; graph convolution network	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; MULTISCALE ENTROPY; COMPLEXITY	Recent advances in neuroscience indicate that analysis of bio-signals such as rest state electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking data can provide more reliable evaluation of children autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than traditional methods of behavior measurement relying on scales do. However, the effectiveness of the new approaches still lags behind the increasing requirement in clinical or educational practices as the "bio-marker" information carried by the bio-signal of a single-modality is likely insufficient or distorted. This study proposes an approach to joint analysis of EEG and eye-tracking for children ASD evaluation. The approach focuses on deep fusion of the features in two modalities as no explicit correlations between the original bio-signals are available, which also limits the performance of existing methods along this direction. First, the synchronization measures, information entropy, and time-frequency features of the multi-channel EEG are derived. Then a random forest applies to the eye-tracking recordings of the same subjects to single out the most significant features. A graph convolutional network (GCN) model then naturally fuses the two group of features to differentiate the children with ASD from the typically developed (TD) subjects. Experiments have been carried out on the two types of the bio-signals collected from 42 children (21 ASD and 21 TD subjects, 3-6 years old). The results indicate that (1) the proposed approach can achieve an accuracy of 95% in ASD detection, and (2) strong correlations exist between the two bio-signals collected even asynchronously, in particular the EEG synchronization against the face related/joint attentions in terms of covariance.

Clinical symptoms are cognitive impairment, ranging from mild deficits to vascular dementia, impaired executive functioning, and gait disorders. In the EEG of SAE patients with vascular dementia, the lower frequencies are increased. However, it is unclear whether EEG changes also exist in SAE patients with gait disorders but without vascular dementia. Methods: The authors analyzed the EEGs of 50 nondemented patients with SAE and gait disorders and 50 healthy controls applying pointwise transinformation as a measure of synchronization. Results: Hundred seconds of waking EEG that appeared unaltered in visual analysis were sufficient to prove changes in synchronization. The authors found a decrease in the mean level of synchronization, combined with an elongation of synchronization time in all examined brain areas. These effects correlated slightly with the extent of subcortical lesions. Conclusions: Changes in EEG synchronization in patients with SAE and gait disorders seem to occur independently of cognitive function. The causal relationship of the changes in EEG synchronization and gait disorders remains to be clarified. The results of this study might point to a decrease in coupling efficiency in these patients, with the increase in synchronization duration as a possible compensatory mechanism. Because a time-efficient signal transmission particularly during gait execution is crucial, reduced efficiency might contribute to an impairment of postural stabilization. The study results might indicate a neuronal network for planning and execution of motor activity and particularly gait, extending from the frontal over the central to the parietal cortex.

Using noninvasive electroencephalography, we aimed to identify neural markers in the prior outcome-evaluation stage and the current option-assessment stage of the chicken game that predict an individual's behavioral choices in the subsequent decision-output stage. Hierarchical linear modeling-based brain-behavior association analyses revealed that midfrontal theta oscillation in the prior outcome-evaluation stage positively predicted subsequent aggressive choices; also, beta oscillation in the current option-assessment stage positively predicted subsequent cooperative choices. These findings provide electrophysiological evidence for the three-stage theory of decision-making and strengthen the feasibility of predicting an individual's behavioral choices using neural oscillations.

The state of stress could be measured using EEG signal, an electroencephalogram (EEG) measurement which contains an arousal and valence index value. In previous studies, it is found that the Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) performance accuracy is of 85 +/- 5%. The arousal indicates strong emotion, and valence indicates positive and negative degree of emotion. Arousal and valence values could be used to measure the accuracy performance. This research focuses on the enhance MCC parameter equation based on arousal and valence values to perform the maximum accuracy percentage in the frequency domain and time-frequency domain analysis. Twenty-one features were used to improve the significance of feature extraction results and the investigated arousal and valence value. The substantial feature extraction involved alpha, beta, delta and theta frequency bands in measuring the arousal and valence index formula. Based on the results, the arousal and valance index is accepted to be applied as parameters in the MCC equations. However, in certain cases, the improvement of the MCC parameter is required to achieve a high accuracy percentage and this research proposed Matthew correlation coefficient advanced (MCCA) in order to improve the performance result by using a six sigma method. In conclusion, the MCCA equation is established to enhance the existing MCC parameter to improve the accuracy percentage up to 99.9% for the arousal and valence index.

Auditory attention in complex scenarios can be decoded by electroencephalography (EEG)-based cortical speech-envelope tracking. The relative root-mean-square (RMS) intensity is a valuable cue for the decomposition of speech into distinct characteristic segments. To improve auditory attention decoding (AAD) performance, this work proposed a novel segmented AAD approach to decode target speech envelopes from different RMS-level-based speech segments. Approach. Speech was decomposed into higher- and lower-RMS-level speech segments with a threshold of -10 dB relative RMS level. A support vector machine classifier was designed to identify higher- and lower-RMS-level speech segments, using clean target and mixed speech as reference signals based on corresponding EEG signals recorded when subjects listened to target auditory streams in competing two-speaker auditory scenes. Segmented computational models were developed with the classification results of higher- and lower-RMS-level speech segments. Speech envelopes were reconstructed based on segmented decoding models for either higher- or lower-RMS-level speech segments. AAD accuracies were calculated according to the correlations between actual and reconstructed speech envelopes. The performance of the proposed segmented AAD computational model was compared to those of traditional AAD methods with unified decoding functions. Main results. Higher- and lower-RMS-level speech segments in continuous sentences could be identified robustly with classification accuracies that approximated or exceeded 80% based on corresponding EEG signals at 6 dB, 3 dB, 0 dB, -3 dB and -6 dB signal-to-mask ratios (SMRs). Compared with unified AAD decoding methods, the proposed segmented AAD approach achieved more accurate results in the reconstruction of target speech envelopes and in the detection of attentional directions. Moreover, the proposed segmented decoding method had higher information transfer rates (ITRs) and shorter minimum expected switch times compared with the unified decoder. Significance. This study revealed that EEG signals may be used to classify higher- and lower-RMS-level-based speech segments across a wide range of SMR conditions (from 6 dB to -6 dB). A novel finding was that the specific information in different RMS-level-based speech segments facilitated EEG-based decoding of auditory attention. The significantly improved AAD accuracies and ITRs of the segmented decoding method suggests that this proposed computational model may be an effective method for the application of neuro-controlled brain-computer interfaces in complex auditory scenes.

Characterizing pink and white noise in the human electroencephalogram	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						1; f; neural noise; pink noise; white noise; electroencephalogram (EEG); signal analysis	BRAIN ACTIVITY; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; BEHAVIOR; SPECTRA	Objective. The power spectrum of the human electroencephalogram (EEG) as a function of frequency is a mix of brain oscillations (Osc) (e.g. alpha activity around 10 Hz) and non-Osc or noise of uncertain origin. 'White noise' is uniformly distributed over frequency, while 'pink noise' has an inverse power-frequency relation (power proportional to 1/f). Interest in EEG pink noise has been growing, but previous human estimates appear methodologically flawed. We propose a new approach to extract separate valid estimates of pink and white noise from an EEG power spectrum. Approach. We use simulated data to demonstrate its effectiveness compared with established procedures, and provide an illustrative example from a new resting eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) dataset. The topographic characteristics of the obtained pink and white noise estimates are examined, as is the alpha power in this sample. Main results. Valid pink and white noise estimates were successfully obtained for each of our 5400 individual spectra (60 participants x 30 electrodes x 3 conditions/blocks [EO1, EC, EO2]). The 1/f noise had a distinct central scalp topography, and white noise was occipital in distribution, both differing from the parietal topography of the alpha Osc. These differences point to their separate neural origins. EC pink and white noise powers were globally greater than in EO. Significance. This valid estimation of pink and white noise in the human EEG holds promise for more accurate assessment of oscillatory neural activity in both typical and clinical groups, such as those with attention deficits. Further, outside the human EEG, the new methodology can be generalized to remove noise from spectra in many fields of science and technology.

However, in laboratory settings using music recordings, EEG frequency bands theta and alpha are connected to music improvisation and creativity. Here, we measured EEG of the audience in a concert-like setting outside the laboratory and compared the theta and alpha power evoked by partly improvised versus regularly performed familiar versus unfamiliar live classical music. To this end, partly improvised and regular versions of pieces by Bach (familiar) and Melartin (unfamiliar) were performed live by a chamber trio. EEG data from left and right frontal and central regions of interest were analysed to define theta and alpha power during each performance. After the performances, the participants rated how improvised and attractive each of the performances were. They also gave their affective ratings before and after each performance. We found that theta power was enhanced during the familiar improvised Bach piece and the unfamiliar improvised Melartin piece when compared with the performance of the same piece performed in a regular manner. Alpha power was not modulated by manner of performance or by familiarity of the piece. Listeners rated partly improvised performances of a familiar Bach and unfamiliar Melartin piece as more improvisatory and innovative than the regular performances. They also indicated more joy and less sadness after listening to the unfamiliar improvised piece of Melartin and less fearful and more enthusiastic after listening to the regular version of Melartin than before listening. Thus, according to our results, it is possible to study listeners' brain functions with EEG during live music performances outside the laboratory, with theta activity reflecting the presence of improvisation in the performances.

The use of classification algorithms can clarify the understanding of these factors. This study was aimed at measuring electrophysiological responses to food/nonfood stimuli and applying classification techniques to discriminate the responses using a single-sweep dataset. Twenty-one right-handed male athletes with body mass index (BMI) levels between 18.5% and 25% (mean age: 21.05 +/- 2.5) participated in this study voluntarily. The participants were asked to focus on the food and nonfood images that were randomly presented on the monitor without performing any motor task, and EEG data have been collected using a 16-channel amplifier with a sampling rate of 1024 Hz. The SensoMotoric Instruments (SMI) iView XTM RED eye tracking technology was used simultaneously with the EEG to measure the participants' attention to the presented stimuli. Three datasets were generated using the amplitude, time-frequency decomposition, and time-frequency connectivity metrics of P300 and LPP components to separate food and nonfood stimuli. We have implemented k-nearest neighbor (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), Bayesian classifier, decision tree (DT), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers on these datasets. Finally, the response to food-related stimuli in the hunger state is discriminated from nonfood with an accuracy value close to 78% for each dataset. The results obtained in this study motivate us to employ classifier algorithms using the features obtained from single-trial measurements in amplitude and time-frequency space instead of applying more complex ones like connectivity metrics.

Spindles are believed to help maintain sleep and to play a role in sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Here we applied an automated sleep spindle detection program to our large longitudinal sleep EEG dataset (98 human subjects, 6-18 years old, >2000 uninterrupted nights) to evaluate maturational trends in spindle wave frequency, density, amplitude, and duration. This large dataset enabled us to apply nonlinear as well as linear age models, thereby extending the findings of prior cross-sectional studies that used linear models. We found that spindle wave frequency increased with remarkable linearity across the age range. Central spindle density increased nonlinearly to a peak at age 15.1 years. Central spindle wave amplitude declined in a sigmoidal pattern with the age of fastest decline at 13.5 years. Spindle duration decreased linearly with age. Of the four measures, only spindle amplitude showed a sex difference in dynamics such that the age of most rapid decline in females preceded that in males by 1.4 years. This amplitude pattern, including the sex difference in timing, paralleled the maturational pattern for d (1-4 Hz) wave power. We interpret these age-related changes in spindle characteristics as indicators of maturation of thalamocortical circuits and changes in sleep depth. These robust age-effects could facilitate the search for cognitive-behavioral correlates of spindle waveforms and might also help guide basic research on EEG mechanisms and postnatal brain maturation.

Generally, the EEG signals contain unwanted frequency components and superimposed trends that may influence their complexity evaluation. Therefore, we propose a denoising technique based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and multiscale principal component analysis (MSPCA) called EMD-MSPCA, and explore its impact on the performance of RCMSE, RCMFE, and RCMPE features for seizure diagnosis. Additionally, we put forward a novel automated seizure detection methodology based on EMD-MSPCA denoised EEG and combined RCMSE, RCMFE, and RCMPE features to characterize healthy, seizure-free, and seizure EEG signals. The experimental results demonstrate that all the three entropy features can successfully characterize the abnormal dynamics related to epileptic EEG signals with RCMPE being the best feature; applying the proposed EMDMSPCA denoising technique prior to feature extraction using RCMSE, RCMFE and, RCMPE not only improved the performances of various classifiers but also reduced the computational time of these three entropy features significantly; and the proposed seizure detection scheme yielded good classification accuracies on two widely used EEG databases as compared to state-of-the-art works, hence emerges as a robust model for automated detection of epileptic seizures.

To elucidate the mechanistic architectures underlying various rhythmic activities, we tested whether spontaneous neural oscillations in different local cortical areas and large-scale networks can be phase-entrained by direct perturbation with distinct frequencies of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). While recording the electroencephalogram (EEG), we applied single-pulse TMS (sp-TMS) and rTMS at 5, 11, and 23 Hz over the motor or visual cortex. We assessed local and global modulation of phase dynamics using the phase-locking factor (PLF). sp-TMS to the motor and the visual cortex triggered a transient increase in PLF in distinct frequencies that peaked at 21 and 8 Hz, respectively. rTMS at 23 Hz over the motor cortex and 11 Hz over the visual cortex induced a prominent and progressive increase in PLF that lasted for a few cycles after the termination of rTMS. Moreover, the local increase in PLF propagated to other cortical areas. These results suggest that distinct cortical areas have area-specific oscillatory frequencies, and the manipulation of oscillations in local areas impacts other areas through the large-scale oscillatory network with the corresponding frequency specificity. We speculate that rTMS that is close to area-specific frequencies (natural frequencies) enables direct manipulation of brain dynamics and is thus useful for investigating the causal roles of synchronous neural oscillations. Moreover, this technique could be used to treat clinical symptoms associated with impaired oscillations and synchrony.

Alpha oscillatory power decreases are associated with better memory for higher valued information	COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Value-based memory; alpha oscillations; strategic encoding; attention; beta oscillations	THETA-SYNCHRONIZATION; BAND OSCILLATIONS; EEG; ATTENTION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; DYNAMICS; REWARD; CONSOLIDATION; CONNECTIVITY; HIPPOCAMPUS	Items associated with high value are often better remembered. Value may increase attention toward item in context associations. Alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) are thought to underlie attention and their observation may reveal the role attention plays in value-based memory. In the current study, EEG is used to record brain activity while participants (n = 30) completed a source recognition memory task where items were associated with either high or low value backgrounds to determine whether greater attentional resources are deployed when encoding high value information. Participants demonstrated better memory for objects associated with high value backgrounds. Alpha oscillatory power in occipital/temporal brain regions exhibited greater desynchronization when encoding objects associated with high value that were later successfully recalled compared to those associated with low value. In addition, beta oscillatory power in midfrontal brain regions exhibited greater desynchronization during successful recall of high value objects compared to low value objects. Together these results suggest that more attentional resources are used to encode information that is associated with high value, which increases the likelihood of later successful memory recall.

Therefore, the present study aimed to develop a learning-style recognition mechanism based on EEG features. The process for the mechanism included labeling learners' actual learning styles, designing a method to effectively stimulate different learners' internal state differences regarding learning styles, designing the data-collection method, designing the preprocessing procedure, and constructing the recognition model. In this way, we designed and verified an experimental method that can effectively stimulate learning-style differences in the information-processing dimension. In addition, we verified the effectiveness of using EEG signals to recognize learning style. The recognition accuracy of the learning-style processing dimension was 71.2%. This result is highly significant for the further exploration of using EEG signals for effective learning-style recognition.

Neonatal Isoflurane Does Not Affect Sleep Architecture and Minimally Alters Neuronal Beta Oscillations in Adolescent Rats	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						anesthesia; neurotoxicity; sleep; EEG; beta oscillations	INDUCED NEUROAPOPTOSIS; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; EARLY EXPOSURE; BRAIN; EEG; OLIGODENDROCYTES; PERSISTENT; APOPTOSIS; HUMANS; CORTEX	General anesthetics are neurotoxic to the developing rodent and primate brains leading to neurocognitive and socio-affective impairment later in life. In addition, sleep patterns are important predictors of cognitive outcomes. Yet, little is known about how anesthetics affect sleep-wake behaviors and their corresponding oscillations. Here we examine how neonatal general anesthesia affects sleep and wake behavior and associated neuronal oscillations. We exposed male and female rat pups to either 6 h of continuous isoflurane or sham anesthesia (compressed air) at the peak of their brain development (postnatal day 7). One cohort of animals was used to examine neurotoxic insult 2 h post-anesthesia exposure. At weaning age, a second cohort of rats was implanted with cortical electroencephalogram electrodes and allowed to recover. During adolescence, we measured sleep architecture (divided into wake, non-rapid eye movement, and rapid eye movement sleep) and electroencephalogram power spectra over a 24 h period. We found that exposure to neonatal isoflurane caused extensive neurotoxicity but did not disrupt sleep architecture in adolescent rats. However, these animals had a small but significant reduction in beta oscillations, specifically in the 12-20 Hz beta 1 range, associated with wake behavior. Furthermore, beta oscillations play a critical role in cortical development, cognitive processing, and homeostatic sleep drive. We speculate that dysregulation of beta oscillations may be implicated in cognitive and socio-affective outcomes associated with neonatal anesthesia.

The quantitative EEG in electroencephalogram-based brain monitoring during general anesthesia	ANAESTHESIST			German	Article						Consciousness; Anesthesia; general; Anesthetics; general; Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring; Dose-response relationship; drug		The electroencephalogram (EEG) is increasingly being used in the clinical routine of anesthesia in German-speaking countries. In over 90% of patients the frontal EEG changes somewhat predictably in response to administration of the normally used anesthetic agents (propofol and volatile gasses). An adequate depth of anesthesia and appropriate concentrations of anesthetics in the brain generate mostly frontal oscillations between 8 and 12 Hz as well as slow delta waves between 0.5 and 4 Hz. The frontal EEG channel is well-suited for avoidance of insufficient depth of anesthesia and excessive administration of anesthetics. This article explains the clinical interpretation of the most important EEG patterns and the biophysical background. Also discussed are important limitations and pitfalls for the clinical routine, which the anesthetist should know in order to utilize the EEG as an admittedly incomplete but clinically extremely important parameter for the level of consciousness.

These different characteristics divide epilepsy seizure types into two main groups: generalized and partial epilepsy. This study aimed to classify different types of epilepsy from EEG signals. For this purpose, a scalogram-based, deep learning approach has been developed. The utilized classification process had the following main steps: the scalogram images were obtained by using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) method. So, a one-dimension EEG time series was converted to a two-dimensional time-frequency data set in order to extract more features. Then, the increased dimension data set (CWT scalogram images) was applied to the convolutional neural network (CNN) as input patterns for classifying the images. The EEG signals were taken from Dicle University, Neurology Clinic of Medical School. This data consisted of four classes: healthy brain waves, generalized preseizure, generalized seizure, and partial epilepsy brain waves. With the proposed method, the average accuracy performance of three of the EEG records' classes (healthy, generalized preseizure, and generalized seizure), and that of all four classes of EEG records were 90.16 % (+/- 0.20) and 84.66 % (+/- 0.48). According to these results, regarding the specific accuracy ratings of the recordings, the healthy EEG records scored 91.29 %, generalized epileptic seizure records were at 96.50 %, partial seizure EEG records scored 89.63 %, and the preseizure EEG records had a 90.44 % rating. The results of the proposed method were compared to the results of both similar studies and conventional methods. As a result, the performance of the proposed method was found to be acceptable.

In particular, the extraction and analysis of human brain consciousness information itself have not received enough attention for the time being. In this paper, we aim to investigate the features of EEG signals from different conscious thoughts. Specifically, we try to extract the physiologically meaningful features of the brain responding to different contours and shapes in images in Gestalt cognitive tests by combining persistent homology analysis with electroencephalogram (EEG). The experimental results show that more brain regions in the frontal lobe are involved when the subject perceives the random and disordered combination of images compared to the ordered Gestalt images. Meanwhile, the persistence entropy of EEG data evoked by random sequence diagram (RSD) is significantly different from that evoked by the ordered Gestalt (GST) images in several frequency bands, which indicate that the human cognition of the shape and contour of images can be separated to some extent through topological analysis. This implies the feasibility to digitize the neural signals while preserving the whole and local features of the original signals, which are further verified by our extensive experiments. In general, this paper evaluates and quantifies cognitively related neural correlates by persistent homology features of EEG signals, which provides an approach to realizing the digitization of neural signals. Preliminary verification of the analyzability of human consciousness signals provides reliable research ideas and directions for the realization of feature extraction and analysis of human brain consciousness cognition.

Yet, little is known about how neural processes react to these variable challenges beyond the planning of individual words. Here, we examine how fundamental differences in syntax shape the time course of sentence planning. Most languages treat alike (i.e., align with each other) the 2 uses of a word like "gardener" in "the gardener crouched" and in "the gardener planted trees." A minority keeps these formally distinct by adding special marking in 1 case, and some languages display both aligned and nonaligned expressions. Exploiting such a contrast in Hindi, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking to suggest that this difference is associated with distinct patterns of neural processing and gaze behavior during early planning stages, preceding phonological word form preparation. Planning sentences with aligned expressions induces larger synchronization in the theta frequency band, suggesting higher working memory engagement, and more visual attention to agents than planning nonaligned sentences, suggesting delayed commitment to the relational details of the event. Furthermore, plain, unmarked expressions are associated with larger desynchronization in the alpha band than expressions with special markers, suggesting more engagement in information processing to keep overlapping structures distinct during planning. Our findings contrast with the observation that the form of aligned expressions is simpler, and they suggest that the global preference for alignment is driven not by its neurophysiological effect on sentence planning but by other sources, possibly by aspects of production flexibility and fluency or by sentence comprehension. This challenges current theories on how production and comprehension may affect the evolution and distribution of syntactic variants in the world's languages.

Aims: To investigate neural oscillatory activity supporting working memory (WM) in regular cannabis users and non-using controls. We focused our analyses on frontal midline theta and posterior alpha asymmetry as oscillatory fingerprints for the WM's maintenance process. Methods: 30 non-using controls (CG) and 57 regular cannabis users-27 exclusive cannabis users (CU) and 30 polydrug cannabis users (PU) completed a Sternberg modified WM task with a concurrent electroencephalography recording. Theta, alpha and beta frequency bands were examined during WM maintenance. Results: When compared to non-using controls, the PU group displayed increased frontal midline theta (FMT) power during WM maintenance, which was positively correlated with RT. The posterior alpha asymmetry during the maintenance phase, on the other hand, was negatively correlated with RT in the CU group. WM performance did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Both groups of cannabis users (CU and PU), when compared to the control group, displayed differences in oscillatory activity during WM maintenance, unique for each group (in CU posterior alpha and in PU FMT correlated with performance). We interpret those differences as a reflection of compensatory strategies, as there were no differences between groups in task performance. Understanding the psychophysiological processes in regular cannabis users may provide insight on how chronic use may affect neural networks underlying cognitive processes, however, a polydrug use context (i.e., combining cannabis with other illegal substances) seems to be an important factor.

J	Singh, K; Malhotra, J				Singh, Kuldeep; Malhotra, Jyoteesh			Deep learning based smart health monitoring for automated prediction of epileptic seizures using spectral analysis of scalp EEG	PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Deep learning; Epilepsy; Healthcare; Internet of Things; Scalp EEG; Spectral analysis	FREQUENCY; POWER; BUTTERWORTH; FILTERS; DESIGN; GAMMA	Being one of the most prevalent neurological disorders, epilepsy affects the lives of patients through the infrequent occurrence of spontaneous seizures. These seizures can result in serious injuries or unexpected deaths in individuals due to accidents. So, there exists a crucial need for an automatic prediction of epileptic seizures to alert the patients well before the onset of seizures, enabling them to have a healthier quality of life. In this era, the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are being used in a cloud-fog integrated environment to address such healthcare challenges using deep learning approaches. The present paper also proposes a smart health monitoring approach for automated prediction of epileptic seizures using deep learning-based spectral analysis of EEG signals. This approach processes EEG signals using filtering, segmentation into short duration segments and spectral-domain transformation. These signals are then analysed spectrally by separating them into several spectral bands, such as delta, theta, alpha, beta, and sub-bands of gamma. Furthermore, the mean spectral amplitude and spectral power features are retrieved from each spectral band to characterize various seizure states, which are fed to the proposed LSTM and CNN models. The results of the proposed CNN model show a maximum accuracy of 98.3% and 97.4% to obtain a binary classification of preictal and interictal seizure states for two different spectral band combinations respectively. Thus, the proposed CNN architecture accompanied by spectral analysis of EEG signals provides a viable method for reliable and real-time prediction of epileptic seizures.

In a virtual environment realistic human-avatars dynamically looked to the left or right side of a table. A moving stick served as a non-social control cue. Kitchen items were presented in the valid cued or invalid un-cued location for encoding. Behavioural findings showed a similar influence of the cues on working memory performance. Alpha power changes were equivalent for the cues during cueing and encoding, reflecting similar attentional processing. However, theta power changes revealed different patterns for the cues. Theta power increased more strongly for the non-social cue compared to the social cue during initial cueing. Furthermore, while for the non-social cue there was a significantly larger increase in theta power for valid compared to invalid conditions during encoding, this was reversed for the social cue, with a significantly larger increase in theta power for the invalid compared to valid conditions, indicating differences in the cues' effects on cognitive effort. Therefore, while social and non-social attention cues impact working memory performance in a similar fashion, the underlying neural mechanisms appear to differ.	[Gregory, Samantha E.

Recent developments have shown that the emergent dynamics of a network system are significantly affected by interactions involving multiple network nodes which cannot be described using pairwise links. While these higher-order interactions can be probed using information-theoretic measures, a rigorous framework to describe them in the frequency domain is still lacking. This work presents an approach for the spectral decomposition of multivariate information measures, capable of identifying higher-order synergistic and redundant interactions between oscillatory processes. We show theoretically that synergy and redundancy can coexist at different frequencies among the output signals of a network system and can be detected only using the proposed spectral method. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the framework, we provide parametric and non-parametric data-efficient estimators for the spectral information measures, and employ them to describe multivariate interactions in three complex systems producing rich oscillatory dynamics, namely the human brain, a ring of electronic oscillators, and the global climate system. In these systems, we show that the use of our framework for the spectral decomposition of information measures reveals multivariate and higher-order interactions not detectable in the time domain. Our results are exemplary of how the frequency-specific analysis of multivariate dynamics can aid the implementation of assessment and control strategies in real-world network systems.

Analysis of EEG Data Using Complex Geometric Structurization	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article								Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a common tool used to understand brain activities. The data are typically obtained by placing electrodes at the surface of the scalp and recording the oscillations of currents passing through the electrodes. These oscillations can sometimes lead to various interpretations, depending on, for example, the subject's health condition, the experiment carried out, the sensitivity of the tools used, or human manipulations. The data obtained over time can be considered a time series. There is evidence in the literature that epilepsy EEG data may be chaotic. Either way, the Embedding Theory in dynamical systems suggests that time series from a complex system could be used to reconstruct its phase space under proper conditions. In this letter, we propose an analysis of epilepsy EEG time series data based on a novel approach dubbed complex geometric structurization. Complex geometric structurization stems from the construction of strange attractors using Embedding Theory from dynamical systems. The complex geometric structures are themselves obtained using a geometry tool, the a-shapes from shape analysis. Initial analyses show a proof of concept in that these complex structures capture the expected changes brain in lobes under consideration. Further, a deeper analysis suggests that these complex structures can be used as biomarkers for seizure changes.	[Kwessi, E. A.] Trinity Univ, Dept Math, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA; [Edwards, L.

During spatial navigation, prefrontal neurons are linked to hippocampal theta oscillations, presumably in order to enhance communication. Hippocampal ripples have been suggested to reflect spatial memory processes. Whether prefrontal-hippocampal-interaction also takes place within the ripple band is unknown. This intracranial EEG study aimed to investigate whether ripple band coherences can also be used to show this communication. Twelve patients with epilepsy and intracranial EEG evaluation completed a virtual spatial navigation task. We calculated ordinary coherence between prefrontal and temporal electrodes during retrieval, re-encoding, and pre-task rest. Coherences were compared between the conditions via permutation testing. Additionally, ripples events were automatically detected and changes in occurrence rates were investigated excluding ripples on epileptic spikes. Ripple-band coherences yielded no general effect of the task on coherences across all patients. Furthermore, we did not find significant effects of task conditions on ripple rates. Subsequent analyses pointed to rather short periods of synchrony as opposed to general task-related changes in ripple-band coherence. Specifically designed tasks and adopted measures might be necessary in order to map these interactions in future studies.

It is vital to analyze the MI-EEG for the manipulation of external BCI actuator. However, traditional methods usually undertake EEG feature extraction and classification separately, which may lose efficient feature information. It behaves beyond our satisfaction for multi-class MI activity evoked by space-close and cannot eliminate the influence of individual differences. To solve these problems, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) with an end-to-end serial-parallel (SP) structure followed by tranfer learning. In detail, we use the serial module to extract the rough features in time-frequency-space domain, and the parallel module for fine feature learning in different scales. Meanwhile, a freeze-and-retrain fune tuning transfer learning strategy is proposed to improve the cross-subject accuracy. When our model is compared with the other three typical networks, results show that the proposed model performs best with the average testing accuracy of 72.13% and the average loss of 0.47, among which one subject only takes 0.7 s to reach 89.17% as the highest one. Through transfer learning, we reduce the training parameters by 53%. The average cross-subject classification accuracy increases by approximate 15%, and the individual highest accuracy reaches 76.98%. In conclusion, the integrity and separability of SPCNN determine that we require no additional EEG signal feature analysis, which is conducive to the realization of an efficient online BCI. It can also get rid of the dependence on training time and subject data to rapidly advance BCI in the future.

Preclinical and clinical evidence also suggests its therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression and anxiety. The effects of most widely used antidepressants on sleep and quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) are well characterized; however, such studies of tramadol are scarce. Our aim was to characterize the effects of tramadol on sleep architecture and qEEG in different sleep-wake stages. EEG-equipped Wistar rats were treated with tramadol (0, 5, 15 and 45 mg/kg) at the beginning of the passive phase, and EEG, electromyogram and motor activity were recorded. Tramadol dose-dependently reduced the time spent in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and increased the REM onset latency. Lower doses of tramadol had wake-promoting effects in the first hours, while 45 mg/kg of tramadol promoted sleep first, but induced wakefulness thereafter. During non-REM sleep, tramadol (15 and 45 mg/kg) increased delta and decreased alpha power, while all doses increased gamma power. In conclusion, the sleep-related and qEEG effects of tramadol suggest antidepressant-like properties, including specific beneficial effects in selected patient groups, and raise the possibility of a faster acting antidepressant action.

Neural mass models (NMMs) consider the average temporal dynamics of interconnected neuronal subpopulations without explicitly representing the underlying cellular activity. The mesoscopic level offered by the neural mass formulation has been used to model electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings and to investigate various cerebral mechanisms, such as the generation of physiological and pathological brain activities. In this work, we consider a NMM widely accepted in the context of epilepsy, which includes four interacting neuronal subpopulations with different synaptic kinetics. Due to the resulting three-time-scale structure, the model yields complex oscillations of relaxation and bursting types. By applying the principles of geometric singular perturbation theory, we unveil the existence of the canard solutions and detail how they organize the complex oscillations and excitability properties of the model. In particular, we show that boundaries between pathological epileptic discharges and physiological background activity are determined by the canard solutions. Finally we report the existence of canard-mediated small-amplitude frequency-specific oscillations in simulated local field potentials for decreased inhibition conditions. Interestingly, such oscillations are actually observed in intracerebral EEG signals recorded in epileptic patients during pre-ictal periods, close to seizure onsets.

Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) occur between two seizures onsets. IEDs are mainly captured by intracranial recordings and are often invisible over the scalp. This study proposes a model based on tensor factorization to map the time-frequency (TF) features of scalp EEG (sEEG) to the TF features of intracranial EEG (iEEG) in order to detect IEDs from over the scalp with high sensitivity. Approach. Continuous wavelet transform is employed to extract the TF features. Time, frequency, and channel modes of IED segments from iEEG recordings are concatenated into a four-way tensor. Tucker and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition techniques are employed to decompose the tensor into temporal, spectral, spatial, and segmental factors. Finally, TF features of both IED and non-IED segments from scalp recordings are projected onto the temporal components for classification. Main results. The model performance is obtained in two different approaches: within- and between-subject classification approaches. Our proposed method is compared with four other methods, namely a tensor-based spatial component analysis method, TF-based method, linear regression mapping model, and asymmetric-symmetric autoencoder mapping model followed by convolutional neural networks. Our proposed method outperforms all these methods in both within- and between-subject classification approaches by respectively achieving 84.2% and 72.6% accuracy values. Significance. The findings show that mapping sEEG to iEEG improves the performance of the scalp-based IED detection model. Furthermore, the tensor-based mapping model outperforms the autoencoder- and regression-based mapping models.

Meditation is linked to higher-order cognitive processes, which may function as a scaffold for cognitive control. In line with these developments, we analyze oscillatory brain activities of expert and non-expert meditators from the Himalayan Yoga tradition. We exploit four dimensions (Temporal, Spectral, Spatial and Pattern) of EEG data and present an analysis pipeline employing machine learning techniques. We discuss the significance of different frequency bands in relation with distinct primary 5 scalp brain regions. Functional connectivity networks (PLV) are utilized to generate features for classification between expert and non-expert meditators. We find (a) higher frequency / 3 and -y oscillations generate maximum discrimination over the parietal region whereas lower frequency 0 and a oscillations dominant over the frontal region; (b) maximum accuracy of over 90% utilizing features from all regions; (c) Quadratic Discriminant Analysis surpasses other classifiers by learning distribution for classification. Overall, this paper contributes a pipeline to analyze EEG data utilizing various properties and suggests potential neural markers for an expert meditative state. We discuss the implications of our research for the advancement of personalized headset design that rely on feedback on depth of meditation by learning from expert meditators.

In this study, we exploited transcra-nial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked potentials (TEPs) to test this hypothesis at the macroscale level, i.e., whether PS between cortical areas supports interarea communication. TEPs are electroencephalo-graphic (EEG) responses time-locked to TMS pulses reflecting interarea communication, as they are gen-erated by the transmission of neural activity from the stimulated area to connected regions. If interarea PS is important for communication, it should be associated with the TEP amplitude in the connected areas. Methods: TMS was delivered over the left primary motor cortex (M1) of fourteen healthy volunteers, and 70-channel EEG was recorded. Early TEP components were source-localized to identify their generators, i.e., distant brain regions activated by M1 through effective connections. Next, linear regressions were used to test the relationship between the TEP amplitude and the pre-stimulus PS between the M1 and the connected regions in four frequency bands (range 4-45 Hz). Results: Pre-stimulus interarea PS in the alpha-band was positively associated with the amplitude of early TEP components, namely, the N15 (ipsilateral supplementary motor area), P25 (contralateral M1) and P60 (ipsilateral parietal cortex). Conclusions: Alpha-band PS predicts the response amplitude of the distant brain regions effectively con-nected to M1. Significance: Our study supports the role of EEG-PS in interarea communication, as theorized by communication-through-coherence. (c) 2021 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Scott			Localizing the Epileptogenic Zone with Novel Biomarkers	SEMINARS IN PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Review							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPSY SURGERY; TEMPORAL-LOBE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; PRESURGICAL EVALUATION; CLINICAL UTILITY; SCALP EEG; SEIZURE; LOCALIZATION; CHILDREN	Several noninvasive methods, such as high-density EEG or magnetoencephalography, are currently used to delineate the epileptogenic zone (EZ) during the presurgical evaluation of patients with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE). Yet, none of these methods can reliably identify the EZ by their own. In most cases a multimodal approach is needed. Challenging cases often require the implantation of intracranial electrodes, either through stereo-taxic EEG or electro-corticography. Recently, a growing body of literature introduces novel biomarkers of epilepsy that can be used for analyzing both invasive as well as noninvasive electrophysiological data. Some of these biomarkers are able to delineate the EZ with high precision, augment the presurgical evaluation, and predict the surgical outcome of patients with DRE undergoing surgery. However, the use of these epilepsy biomarkers in clinical practice is limited. Here, we summarize and discuss the latest technological advances in the presurgical neurophysiological evaluation of children with DRE with emphasis on electric and magnetic source imaging, high frequency oscillations, and functional connectivity.

Predicting outcome of patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures after diagnosis in an epilepsy monitoring unit	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Pseudoseizures; Prognosis; Dissociative disorder; Conversive disorder; Conversion disorder; Somatization	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; ETIOLOGY; ATTACKS	Objective: To identify predictors of Psychogenic NonEpileptic Seizure (PNES) improvement and anti seizure medication (ASM) discontinuation in patients with PNES only. Methods: This is a retrospective study of a consecutively enrolled cohort of 271 patients diagnosed with PNES by video-EEG (vEEG) telemetry in our Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) between May 2000 and February 2010. Patients with any possibility of past or present comorbid epilepsy based on clinical, EEG, and neuroimaging, or less than one year of follow-up after discharge were excluded. Results: A total of 109 subjects were included. The mean age at PNES onset was 33 (range 6-89), mean age at EMU admission was 38.3 (16-89.8), 70.6% were female mean video-EEG length was 6.1 days, and the median time of final follow-up 3.3 (CI 1.6-6.4) years. 51/108 patients (47.2%) reported a PNES decrease and 29 (26.8%) experienced PNES resolution. 59/73 (81.9%) subjects on ASM at the time of EMU admission were able to discontinue them by the final visit. On univariate analysis, patients whose PNES frequency improved were significantly younger at time of admission, more likely married or cohabiting, less likely unemployed, less likely to have migraine, and had a higher frequency of PNES. On hierarchical regression analysis, younger age and employment remained significant predictors of PNES improvement and resolution. Patients who achieved ASM discontinuation had significantly more children and subsequent EMU visits, were less likely to have history of minor head trauma immediately preceding PNES onset and structural brain lesions, experienced a greater reduction of ASMs during the EMU admission, and had a greater improvement of their PNES frequency at the final visit (p < 0.05). On hierarchical regression analysis, higher number of children, absence of structural brain lesions, fewer ASMs at EMU discharge, and improvement of PNES frequency remained significant predictors of ASM discontinuation. Conclusion: The outcome of PNES is positively correlated with earlier age of diagnosis in an EMU, especially in patients with better social resources. Furthermore, discontinuation of ASM is more likely if the process is initiated during the EMU stay and in the absence of structural brain lesions. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Successful encoding trials manifested significantly greater high-gamma activity in hippocampus and frontal regions. Successful cued recall trials manifested sustained high-gamma activity in hippocampus compared to failed responses. Hippocampal ripple rates were greater during successful encoding and retrieval trials. Interictal epileptiform discharges during encoding were associated with 15% decreased odds of remembering in hippocampus (95% confidence interval 6-23%). Hippocampal interictal epileptiform discharges during retrieval predicted 25% decreased odds of remembering (15-33%). Odds of remembering were reduced by 25-52% if interictal epileptiform discharges occurred during the 500-2000 ms window of encoding or by 41% during retrieval. During encoding and retrieval, hippocampal interictal epileptiform discharges were followed by a transient decrease in ripple rate. We hypothesize that interictal epileptiform discharges impair associative memory in a regionally and temporally specific manner by decreasing physiological hippocampal ripples necessary for effective encoding and recall. Because dynamic memory impairment arises from pathological interictal epileptiform discharge events competing with physiological ripples, interictal epileptiform discharges represent a promising therapeutic target for memory remediation in patients with epilepsy.

Speech categorization is better described by induced rather than evoked neural activity	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION; ORGANIZATION; SEGREGATION; ATTENTION; ALPHA; GAMMA; EEG	Categorical perception (CP) describes how the human brain categorizes speech despite inherent acoustic variability. We examined neural correlates of CP in both evoked and induced electroencephalogram (EEG) activity to evaluate which mode best describes the process of speech categorization. Listeners labeled sounds from a vowel gradient while we recorded their EEGs. Using a source reconstructed EEG, we used band-specific evoked and induced neural activity to build parameter optimized support vector machine models to assess how well listeners' speech categorization could be decoded via whole-brain and hemisphere-specific responses. We found whole-brain evoked beta-band activity decoded prototypical from ambiguous speech sounds with similar to 70% accuracy. However, induced gamma-band oscillations showed better decoding of speech categories with similar to 95% accuracy compared to evoked beta-band activity (similar to 70% accuracy). Induced high frequency (gamma-band) oscillations dominated CP decoding in the left hemisphere, whereas lower frequencies (theta-band) dominated the decoding in the right hemisphere. Moreover, feature selection identified 14 brain regions carrying induced activity and 22 regions of evoked activity that were most salient in describing category-level speech representations. Among the areas and neural regimes explored, induced gamma-band modulations were most strongly associated with listeners' behavioral CP. The data suggest that the category-level organization of speech is dominated by relatively high frequency induced brain rhythms.

During the course of DT, as ideation proceeds, ideas tend to become more creative, being more likely to be drawn from new conceptual categories through the use of the cognitive mechanism of flexibility. The present study investigated whether EEG alpha synchronization can be modulated by flexibility in DT by comparing cortical activation patterns during the switch of category (switching) and the stay in the same category (clustering). Twenty participants were required to generate alternative uses of everyday objects during EEG recording. Differential results were specifically found in the lower alpha band (8-10 Hz): whereas clustering showed synchronization typically lateralized in the right posterior parietal areas, switching induced posterior parietal synchronization over both right and left hemispheres. These findings indicate that the two distinct cognitive mechanisms subsuming flexibility (switching and clustering) are associated with a different hemispheric modulation of lower alpha activity, as switching, in comparison to clustering, is related to higher power in the lower alpha band over the left hemisphere. Switching in comparison to clustering may thus require a larger investment of cognitive resources due to the exploratory process of moving from one semantic conceptual category to another in the course of creative ideation.

Here, we tested the effects of a single oral dose of two anti-glutamatergic drugs (dextromethorphan, an NMDA receptor antagonist; perampanel, an AMPA receptor antagonist) and an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blocker (nimodipine) on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked electroencephalographic (EEG) potentials (TEPs) and TMS-induced oscillations (TIOs) in 16 healthy adults in a pseudorandomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover design. Single-pulse TMS was delivered to the hand area of left primary motor cortex. Dextromethorphan increased the amplitude of the N45 TEP, while it had no effect on TIOs. Perampanel reduced the amplitude of the P60 TEP in the non-stimulated hemisphere, and increased TIOs in the beta-frequency band in the stimulated sensorimotor cortex, and in the alpha-frequency band in midline parietal channels. Nimodipine and placebo had no effect on TEPs and TIOs. The TEP results extend previous pharmaco-TMS-EEG studies by demonstrating that the N45 is regulated by a balance of GABAAergic inhibition and NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic excitation. In contrast, AMPA receptor-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission contributes to propagated activity reflected in the P60 potential and midline parietal induced oscillations. This pharmacological characterization of TMS-EEG responses will be informative for interpreting TMS-EEG abnormalities in neuropsychiatric disorders with pathological excitation-inhibition balance.

Graph Analysis of EEG Functional Connectivity Networks During a Letter-Speech Sound Binding Task in Adult Dyslexics	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; networks; dyslexia; letter-speech sound associations; phase lag index; minimum spanning tree (MST)	MINIMUM SPANNING TREE; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; COMPLEX BRAIN NETWORKS; THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; WHOLE-BRAIN; CHILDREN; OSCILLATIONS; DISRUPTION; SYSTEM; COMMUNICATION	We performed an EEG graph analysis on data from 31 typical readers (22.27 +/- 2.53 y/o) and 24 dyslexics (22.99 +/- 2.29 y/o), recorded while they were engaged in an audiovisual task and during resting-state. The task simulates reading acquisition as participants learned new letter-sound mappings via feedback. EEG data was filtered for the delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta (13-30 Hz) bands. We computed the Phase Lag Index (PLI) to provide an estimate of the functional connectivity between all pairs of electrodes per band. Then, networks were constructed using a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), a unique sub-graph connecting all nodes (electrodes) without loops, aimed at minimizing bias in between groups and conditions comparisons. Both groups showed a comparable accuracy increase during task blocks, indicating that they correctly learned the new associations. The EEG results revealed lower task-specific theta connectivity, and lower theta degree correlation over both rest and task recordings, indicating less network integration in dyslexics compared to typical readers. This pattern suggests a role of theta oscillations in dyslexia and may reflect differences in task engagement between the groups, although robust correlations between MST metrics and performance indices were lacking.

Prior research has shown that monitoring of EEG signals during sleep can contribute to automatic detection of apnea events. However, a more comprehensive classification of specific apnea types and their severity is required for accurate clinical diagnosis and real-time detection of critical apnea episodes. In this study, we employed annotated EEG signals from 25 apnea patients and constructed two distinct classifiers using EEG frequency domain and non-linear features for binary classification of apnea severity and multiclass classification of apnea types. In both classification problems, three models i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant analysis (LDA) and Naive Bayes (NB) were evaluated and compared. Results showed that SVM model performed the best in both classification problems reaching accuracy higher than the baseline level. The SVM performance in the binary classification of apnea severity was acceptable (76% mean accuracy) however in the case of multiclass classification of apnea types, the SVM classifier did not reach acceptable performance for all apnea types (48% mean accuracy). Our findings illustrate that in addition to the detection of apnea episodes, EEG signals can be used in classification of apnea severity, which could lead to development of accurate diagnostic systems for automatic assessment and management of sleep disorders.

J	Swindale, NV; Rowat, P; Krause, M; Spacek, MA; Mitelut, C				Swindale, Nicholas V.; Rowat, Peter; Krause, Matthew; Spacek, Martin A.; Mitelut, Catalin			Voltage distributions in extracellular brain recordings	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; exponential; Gaussian; local field potential; neural noise	SPIKE DETECTION; POLYTRODES; CODE; EEG	Extracellular recordings of brain voltage signals have many uses, including the identification of spikes and the characterization of brain states via analysis of local field potential (LFP) or EEG recordings. Though the factors underlying the generation of these signals are time varying and complex, their analysis may be facilitated by an understanding of their statistical properties. To this end, we analyzed the voltage distributions of high-pass extracellular recordings from a variety of structures, including cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus, in monkeys, cats, and rodents. We additionally investigated LFP signals in these recordings as well as human EEG signals obtained during different sleep stages. In all cases, the distributions were accurately described by a Gaussian within +/- 1.5 standard deviations from zero. Outside these limits, voltages tended to be distributed exponentially, that is, they fell off linearly on log-linear frequency plots, with variable heights and slopes. A possible explanation for this is that sporadically and independently occurring events with individual Gaussian size distributions can sum to produce approximately exponential distributions. For the high-pass recordings, a second explanation results from a model of the noisy behavior of ion channels that produce action potentials via Hodgkin-Huxley kinetics. The distributions produced by this model, relative to the averaged potential, were also Gaussian with approximately exponential flanks. The model also predicted time-varying noise distributions during action potentials, which were observed in the extracellular spike signals. These findings suggest a principled method for detecting spikes in high-pass recordings and transient events in LFP and EEG signals. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We show that the voltage distributions in brain recordings, including high-pass extracellular recordings, the LFP, and human EEG, are accurately described by a Gaussian within +/- 1.5 standard deviations from zero, with heavy, exponential tails outside these limits. This offers a principled way of setting event detection thresholds in high-pass recordings. It also offers a means for identifying event-like, transient signals in LFP and EEG recordings which may correlate with other neural phenomena.

Age- and movement-related modulation of cortical oscillations in a mouse model of presbycusis	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						Auditory cortex; Aging; Presbycusis; Temporal processing; Gamma oscillations; EEG; Parvalbumin		Brain oscillations are associated with specific cognitive and sensory processes. How age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) alters cortical oscillations is unclear. Altered inhibitory neurotransmission and temporal processing deficits contribute to speech recognition impairments in presbycusis. Specifically, age-related reduction in parvalbumin positive interneurons and perineuronal nets in the auditory cortex predicts a reduction in gamma oscillations that may lead to a decline in temporal precision and attention. To test the hypothesis that resting and evoked gamma oscillations decline with presbycusis, EEGs were recorded from the auditory and frontal cortex of awake, freely moving C57BL/6 J mice at three ages (3, 14 and 24 months). Resting EEG data were analyzed according to movement state (move versus still). Evoked responses were recorded following presentation of noise bursts or amplitude modulated noise with time varying modulation frequencies. We report an age-related decrease in resting gamma power, a decline in gamma-range synchrony to time varying stimuli, and an increase in noise evoked and induced gamma power. A decline in temporal processing is seen in aged mice that exhibit robust auditory-evoked potentials, dissociating hearing loss from temporal processing deficits. We also report an increase in gamma power when mice moved compared to the still state. However, the movement-related modulation of gamma oscillations did not change with age. Together, these data identify a number of novel markers of presbycusis-related changes in auditory and frontal cortex. Because EEGs are commonly recorded in humans, the mouse data may serve as translation relevant preclinical biomarkers to facilitate the development of therapeutics to delay or reverse central auditory processing deficits in presbycusis.

Examining motor evoked potential amplitude and short-interval intracortical inhibition on the up-going and down-going phases of a transcranial alternating current stimulation (tacs) imposed alpha oscillation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillation; cortical excitability; electroencephalography; transcranial alternating current stimulation; transcranial magnetic stimulation		Many brain regions exhibit rhythmical activity thought to reflect the summed behaviour of large populations of neurons. The endogenous alpha rhythm has been associated with phase-dependent modulation of corticospinal excitability. However, whether exogenous alpha rhythm, induced using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) also has a phase-dependent effect on corticospinal excitability remains unknown. Here, we triggered transcranial magnetic stimuli (TMS) on the up- or down-going phase of a tACS-imposed alpha oscillation and measured motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI). There was no significant difference in MEP amplitude or SICI when TMS was triggered on the up- or down-going phase of the tACS-imposed alpha oscillation. The current study provides no evidence of differences in corticospinal excitability or GABAergic inhibition when targeting the up-going (peak) and down-going (trough) phase of the tACS-imposed oscillation.

J	Wang, WJ				Wang, Wenjing			Brain network features based on theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling connections in EEG for emotion recognition	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Emotion recognition; EEG; Cross-frequency coupling(CFC); Brain network; Neural oscillation	PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; INTENSITY; ATTENTION	Emotion recognition is a hot topic in the field of cognitive neuroscience and interpersonal interaction, and EEG feature selection is an important classification technology. At present, the mainstream method of EEG feature selection is to extract non-interactive features of channels such as power spectral density, or correlation features among local multi-channels. With the application of complex network graph theory, the connection network between multiple brain regions is gradually included in feature selection. However, in the process of brain network construction, most of the current connections adopt simple signal phase or amplitude synchronization. In recent years, it has been found that in the process of emotion, memory, learning, and other advanced cognitive processes, the large-scale connection and communication between the brain regions are mainly completed by the cross-frequency coupling(CFC) between the low-frequency phase and the high-frequency amplitude of neural oscillations. Based on this, we use CFC to update the connection mode, reconstruct the brain network, and extract features for emotion recognition research. Our results show that the EEG network based on CFC performs better than other EEG synchronization networks in emotion classification. Moreover, the combination of global features and local features of the brain network, as well as the dynamic network features with continuous time-windows, can effectively improve the accuracy of emotion recognition. This study provides a new idea of network connection for the follow-up study of emotion recognition and other advanced cognitive activities and makes a pioneering exploration for further research on feature selection of emotion recognition and related neural circuits at the brain network level of functional connectivity.

One of the key symptoms of ASD is Sensory Features (SF), which refers to the difficulties that autistic people experience with particular kinds of environmental stimuli. Studies using eeg measures of neural connectivity across various regions of the brain hold promise in identifying how the autistic brain reacts to its environment. This commentary identifies several 'participant' and 'measurement' methodological issues that need to be adequately addressed in SF-eeg connectivity studies, and applies these comments to a sample of five previous studies.

J	Sharon, O; Fahoum, F; Nir, Y				Sharon, Omer; Fahoum, Firas; Nir, Yuval			Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation in Humans Induces Pupil Dilation and Attenuates Alpha Oscillations	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillations; EEG; noradrenaline; pupil; transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation; tVNS	LOCUS-COERULEUS; CLINICAL-EVIDENCE; EEG-DATA; NOREPINEPHRINE; BRAIN; RAT; COMPONENTS; NEURONS; MEMORY; P3	Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is widely used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy and depression. While the precise mechanisms mediating its long-term therapeutic effects are not fully resolved, they likely involve locus coeruleus (LC) stimulation via the nucleus of the solitary tract, which receives afferent vagal inputs. In rats, VNS elevates LC firing and forebrain noradrenaline levels, whereas LC lesions suppress VNS therapeutic efficacy. Noninvasive transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) uses electrical stimulation that targets the auricular branch of the vagus nerve at the cymba conchae of the ear. However, the extent to which tVNS mimics VNS remains unclear. Here, we investigated the short-term effects of tVNS in healthy human male volunteers (n = 24), using high-density EEG and pupillometry during visual fixation at rest. We compared short (3.4 s) trials of tVNS to sham electrical stimulation at the earlobe (far from the vagus nerve branch) to control for somatosensory stimulation. Although tVNS and sham stimulation did not differ in subjective intensity ratings, tVNS led to robust pupil dilation (peaking 4-5 s after trial onset) that was significantly higher than following sham stimulation. We further quantified, using parallel factor analysis, how tVNS modulates idle occipital alpha (8-13Hz) activity identified in each participant. We found greater attenuation of alpha oscillations by tVNS than by sham stimulation. This demonstrates that tVNS reliably induces pupillary and EEG markers of arousal beyond the effects of somatosensory stimulation, thus supporting the hypothesis that tVNS elevates noradrenaline and other arousal-promoting neuromodulatory signaling, and mimics invasive VNS.

In particular, it is unknown whether they operate at similar timescales, and whether they support different cognitive processes. We recorded EEG in 30 healthy human participants while they performed a learning task containing both novel (block-unique) and repeating stimuli. We investigated behavior and electrophysiology at both fast (i.e., within blocks) and slow (i.e., between blocks) timescales. Behaviorally, both response time and accuracy improved (respectively decrease and increase) over both fast and slow timescales. However, on the spectral level, theta power significantly decreased along the slow timescale, whereas alpha power significantly increased along the fast timescale. We thus demonstrate that theta and alpha both play a role during learning, but operate at different timescales. This result poses important empirical constraints for theories on learning, cognitive control, and neural oscillations.	[Huycke, Pieter; Verbeke, Pieter; Boehler, C.

In this topical review, we propose neural oscillatory dynamics and cross-frequency coupling as viable candidates for a neural mechanism underlying respiratory perception, and a technique warranting more attention in respiration research. With the evidence for the potential of neural oscillations in the study of normal and disordered breathing coming from disparate research fields with a limited history of interdisciplinary collaboration, the main objective of the review was to converge the existing research and suggest future directions. The existing findings show that distinct limbic and cortical activations, as measured by hemodynamic responses, underlie dyspnea, however, the time-scale of these activations is not well understood. The recent findings of oscillatory neural activity coupled with the respiratory rhythm could provide the solution to this problem, however, more research with a focus on dyspnea is needed. We also touch on the findings of distinct spectral patterns underlying the changes in breathing due to experimental manipulations, meditation and disease. Subsequently, we suggest general research directions and specific research designs to supplement the current knowledge using neural oscillation techniques. We argue for the benefits of interdisciplinary collaboration and the converging of neuroimaging and behavioral methods to best explain the emergence of the subjective and aversive individual experience of dyspnea.

We hypothesized that the outcome of AED treatment can be predicted from EEG data in patients with TLE. Methods: Twenty-three patients with TLE and twenty-five healthy controls were examined. Clinical outcome was dichotomized into seizure-free (SF) and non-seizure-free (NSF) after two years of LEV. EEG parameters were compared between healthy controls and patients with TLE at baseline (EEGpre) and after three months of AED therapy (EEG(pre-post)) and between SF and NSF patients. Receiver Operating Characteristic curves models were built to test whether EEG parameters predicted outcome. Results: AED therapy induces an increase in EEG power for Alpha (p = 0.06) and a decrease in Theta (p < 0.05). Connectivity values were lower in SF compared to NSF patients (p < 0.001). Quantitative EEG predicted outcome after LEV treatment with an estimated accuracy varying from 65.2% to 91.3% (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.56-0.93) for EEG(pre) and from 69.9% to 86.9% (AUC = 0.69-0.94) for EEG(pre-post). Conclusions: AED therapy induces EEG modifications in TLE patients, and such modifications are predictive of clinical outcome. Significance: Quantitative EEG may help understanding the effect of AEDs in the central nervous system and offer new prognostic biomarkers for patients with epilepsy.

J	Wang, WJ				Wang, Wenjing			The broadband power shifts in entorhinal EEG are related to the firing of grid cells	HELIYON			English	Article						Grid cell; Broadband shift; Theta oscillations; Gamma oscillations; LFP power		The relationship between the firing of the grid cell and mesoscopic neural oscillations is one of the key issues to understand the neural mechanism of grid cells. Previous studies have focused more on the correspondence between neuronal firing and phases of oscillations, such as phase precession. There are also some conclusions about the relationship between the activity of grid cells and the intensity of neural oscillations, such as the disappearance of grid pattern caused by the blocking of theta rhythm, but the correlation between the firing rates of grid cells and the narrowband power of neural oscillations or the broadband LFP power is still scarce. Through analyzing the records of spike times of grid cells and local entorhinal EEG obtained by Hafting et al., in the spatial navigation experiment, we find that grid cells are, to a large proportion, a kind of broadband-shift neurons, and the positive correlation between grid cell activity and power of low theta and gamma bands was observed. These results have well verified, promoted, and connected many scattered research conclusions, such as the broadband shift phenomenon of hippocampal neurons, the influence of low theta activity on the firing pattern of grid cells, and the positive correlation between single-cell activity and gamma-band activity. This work is of great significance for the study of the neural mechanism of grid cells at the micro and mesoscopic levels, and may also inspire the use of indicators such as broadband power as markers for grid cell activity.

Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) records interictal and ictal activities of the epilepsy in order to precisely find and localize epileptogenic zones in clinical practice. While it is difficult to find distinct ictal onset patterns generated the seizure onset zone from SEEG recordings in a confined region, high frequency oscillations are commonly considered as putative biomarkers for the identification of epileptogenic zones. Therefore, automatic and accurate detection of high frequency oscillations in SEEG signals is crucial for timely clinical evaluation. This work formulates the detection of high frequency oscillations as a signal segment classification problem and develops a hypergraph-based detector to automatically detect high frequency oscillations such that human experts can visually review SEEG signals. We evaluated our method on 4,000 signal segments from clinical SEEG recordings that contain both ictal and interictal data obtained from 19 patients who suffer from refractory focal epilepsy. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed detector that can successfully localize interictal high frequency oscillations and outperforms multiple peer machine learning methods. In particular, the proposed detector achieved 90.7% in accuracy, 80.9% in sensitivity, and 96.9% in specificity.

Design, Setting, Participants, and Measurements: Participants were 101 adults without dementia (52% female, mean age 70.3 years). Delayed verbal memory was first tested in the evening prior to overnight polysomnography (PSG). The following morning, subjects were asked to recall as many items as possible from the same List (overnight memory retention; OMR). Partial correlation analyses examined the associations of delayed verbal memory and OMR with slow wave sleep (SWS) and two physiologic EEG slow wave activity (SWA) power spectral bands (0.5-1 Hz slow oscillations vs. 1-4 Hz delta activity). Results: In subjects displaying SWS, SWS was associated with enhanced delayed verbal memory, but not with OMR. Interestingly, among participants that did not show SWS, OMR was significantly associated with a higher slow oscillation relative power, during NREM sleep in the first ultradian cycle, with medium effect size. Conclusions: These findings suggest a complex relationship between SWS and memory and illustrate that even in the absence of scorable SWS, older adults demonstrate substantial slow wave activity. Further, these slow oscillations (0.5-1 Hz), in the first ultradian cycle, are positively associated with OMR, but only in those without SWS. Our findings raise the possibility that precise features of slow wave activity play key roles in maintaining memory function in healthy aging. Further, our results underscore that conventional methods of sleep evaluation may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect associations between SWA and memory in older adults.

Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) methods have long been used for exploring brain electrical activity and functional connectivity modifications after stroke. However, results obtained so far are not univocal. Here, we used basic and advanced EEG methods to characterize how brain activity and functional connectivity change after stroke. Thirty-three unilateral post stroke patients in the sub-acute phase and ten neurologically intact age-matched right-handed subjects were enrolled. Patients were subdivided into two groups based on lesion location: cortico-subcortical (CS, n = 18) and subcortical (S, n = 15), respectively. Stroke patients were evaluated in the period ranging from 45 days since the acute event (T0) up to 3 months after stroke (T1) with both neurophysiological (resting state EEG) and clinical assessment (Barthel Index, BI) measures, while healthy subjects were evaluated once. Brain power at T0 was similar between the two groups of patients in all frequency bands considered (delta, theta, alpha, and beta). However, evolution of theta-band power over time was different, with a normalization only in the CS group. Instead, average connectivity and specific network measures (Integration, Segregation, and Small-worldness) in the beta-band at T0 were significantly different between the two groups. The connectivity and network measures at T0 also appear to have a predictive role in functional recovery (BI T1-T0), again group-dependent. The results obtained in this study showed that connectivity measures and correlations between EEG features and recovery depend on lesion location. These data, if confirmed in further studies, on the one hand could explain the heterogeneity of results so far observed in previous studies, on the other hand they could be used by researchers as biomarkers predicting spontaneous recovery, to select homogenous groups of patients for the inclusion in clinical trials.

The neural basis of cognitive control is known to involve frontal regions of the brain such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but the temporal dynamics of larger scale networks is unclear. Here we used EEG with source localization to identify how the neural oscillations localized to the mPFC and ACC coordinate with parietal, sensory, and motor areas during spatial cognitive control. Theta coherence (3-8 Hz) between the mPFC and ACC increased with task difficulty and predicted individual differences in reaction time. Individual differences in accuracy were predicted by earlier activation of ACC-motor coherence, highlighting the relationship between processing speed and task performance. Our results provide evidence that successful cognitive control requires dynamic coordination between a widespread network of brain regions. Long range theta coherence may be a key mechanism for efficient cognitive control across the neocortex.

In an exploratory study, we aimed to identify independent power spectral features in the EEG useful for studying the cognitive processes involved in this effortful listening. Listeners performed the coordinate response measure task with a single-talker masker at a 0-dB signal-to-noise ratio. Sounds were left unfiltered or degraded with low-pass filtering. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to identify independent components (ICs) in the EEG data, the power spectral dynamics of which were then analyzed. Frontal midline theta, left frontal, right frontal, left mu, right mu, left temporal, parietal, left occipital, central occipital, and right occipital clusters of ICs were identified. All IC clusters showed some significant listening-related changes in their power spectrum. This included sustained theta enhancements, gamma enhancements, alpha enhancements, alpha suppression, beta enhancements, and mu rhythm suppression. Several of these effects were absent or negligible using traditional channel analyses. Comparison of filtered to unfiltered speech revealed a stronger alpha suppression in the parietal and central occipital clusters of ICs for the filtered speech condition. This not only replicates recent findings showing greater alpha suppression as listening difficulty increases but also suggests that such alpha-band effects can stem from multiple cortical sources. We lay out the advantages of the ICA approach over the restrictive analyses that have been used as of late in the study of listening effort. We also make suggestions for moving into hypothesis-driven studies regarding the power spectral features that were revealed.

We performed our experiments in adult, male Wistar rats, chronically implanted for sleep recording and divided into four experimental groups: the control (implanted controls), the bilateral pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) lesions (PD cholinopathy), the unilateral substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) lesions (hemiparkinsonism) and the unilateral SNpc/bilateral PPT lesions (hemiparkinsonism with PD cholinopathy). We followed their sleep, basal locomotor activity and spatial habituation for 14 days following the surgical procedures. Severe prodromal local sleep disturbances in the hemiparkinsonian rats were expressed as sleep fragmentation and distinct local NREM/REM EEG microstructure alterations in both the motor cortex and the hippocampus. Alongside the state-unrelated role of the dopaminergic control of theta oscillations and NREM/REM related sigma and beta oscillations, we demonstrated that the REM neurochemical regulatory substrate is particularly important in the dopaminergic control of beta oscillations. In addition, hippocampal prodromal sleep disorders in the hemiparkinsonian rats were expressed as NREM/REM fragmentation and the opposite impact of dopaminergic versus cholinergic control of the NREM delta and beta oscillation amplitudes in the hippocampus, likewise in the motor cortex versus the hippocampus. All these distinct prodromal local sleep disorders and the dopaminergic vs. cholinergic impact on NREM/REM EEG microstructure alterations are of fundamental importance for the further development and follow-up of PD-modifying therapies, and for the identification of patients who are at risk of developing PD.

In this paper, a motor imagery classification approach is proposed, combining virtual electrodes on the cortex layer with a convolutional neural network; this can effectively improve the decoding performance of the brain-computer interface system. A three layer (cortex, skull, and scalp) head volume conduction model was established by using the symmetric boundary element method to map the scalp signal to the cortex area. Nine pairs of virtual electrodes were created on the cortex layer, and the features of the time and frequency sequence from the virtual electrodes were extracted by performing time-frequency analysis. Finally, the convolutional neural network was used to classify motor imagery tasks. The results show that the proposed approach is convergent in both the training model and the test model. Based on the Physionet motor imagery database, the averaged accuracy can reach 98.32% for a single subject, while the averaged values of accuracy, Kappa, precision, recall, and F1-score on the group-wise are 96.23%, 94.83%, 96.21%, 96.13%, and 96.14%, respectively. Based on the High Gamma database, the averaged accuracy has achieved 96.37% and 91.21% at the subject and group levels, respectively. Moreover, this approach is superior to those of other studies on the same database, which suggests robustness and adaptability to individual variability.

Objectives: To re-assess the relationship between the mu-rhythm power expressed in left pericentral cortex and the amplitude of motor potentials (MEP) evoked with spTMS in left M1-HAND. Methods: 15 non-preselected healthy young participants received spTMS to the motor hot spot of left M1-HAND. Regional expression of mu-rhythm was estimated online based on a radial source at motor hotspot and informed the timing of spTMS which was applied either during epochs belonging to the highest or lowest quartile of regionally expressed mu-power. Using MEP amplitude as dependent vari-able, we computed a linear mixed-effects model, which included mu-power and mu-phase at the time of stimulation and the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) as fixed effects and subject as a random effect. Mu-phase was estimated by post-hoc sorting of trials into four discrete phase bins. We performed a follow-up analysis on the same EEG-triggered MEP data set in which we isolated mu-power at the sensor level using a Laplacian montage centered on the electrode above the M1-HAND. Results: Pericentral mu-power traced as radial source at motor hot spot did not significantly modulate the MEP, but mu-power determined by the surface Laplacian did, showing a positive relation between mu-power and MEP amplitude. In neither case, there was an effect of mu-phase on MEP amplitude. Conclusion: The relationship between cortical oscillatory activity and cortical excitability is complex and minor differences in the methodological choices may critically affect sensitivity.

A Glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction has been suggested as a possible mechanism underlying altered connectivity in schizophrenia, especially in the gamma- and theta-frequency range. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the NMDAR-antagonist ketamine on resting-state power, functional connectivity, and schizophrenia-like psychopathological changes in healthy volunteers. In a placebo-controlled crossover design, 25 healthy subjects were recorded using resting-state 64-channel-electroencephalography (EEG) (eyes closed). The imaginary coherence-based Multivariate Interaction Measure (MIM) was used to measure gamma and theta connectivity across 80 cortical regions. The network-based statistic was applied to identify involved networks under ketamine. Psychopathology was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D-ASC). Ketamine caused an increase in all PANSS (p < 0.001) as well as 5D-ASC scores (p < 0.01). Significant increases in resting-state gamma and theta power were observed under ketamine compared to placebo (p < 0.05). The source-space analysis revealed two distinct networks with an increased mean functional gamma- or theta-band connectivity during the ketamine session. The gamma-network consisted of midline regions, the cuneus, the precuneus, and the bilateral posterior cingulate cortices, while the theta-band network involved the Heschl gyrus, midline regions, the insula, and the middle cingulate cortex. The current source density (CSD) within the gamma-band correlated negatively with the PANSS negative symptom score, and the activity within the gamma-band network correlated negatively with the subjective changed meaning of percepts subscale of the 5D-ASC. These results are in line with resting-state patterns seen in people who have schizophrenia and argue for a crucial role of the glutamate system in mediating dysfunctional gamma- and theta-band-connectivity in schizophrenia. Resting-state networks could serve as biomarkers for the response to glutamatergic drugs or drug development efforts within the glutamate system.

However, these human language processing signals can also be beneficial in machine learning-based natural language processing tasks. Using EEG brain activity for this purpose is largely unexplored as of yet. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of systematically analyzing the potential of EEG brain activity data for improving natural language processing tasks, with a special focus on which features of the signal are most beneficial. We present a multi-modal machine learning architecture that learns jointly from textual input as well as from EEG features. We find that filtering the EEG signals into frequency bands is more beneficial than using the broadband signal. Moreover, for a range of word embedding types, EEG data improves binary and ternary sentiment classification and outperforms multiple baselines. For more complex tasks such as relation detection, only the contextualized BERT embeddings outperform the baselines in our experiments, which raises the need for further research. Finally, EEG data shows to be particularly promising when limited training data is available.

Such topological measures reflect the functional interactions of multiple brain structures, which support the integration of different sensorimotor information subtending awareness. However, conventional, single-layer, graph theoretical analysis (GTA)-based approaches cannot always reliably differentiate patients with Disorders of Consciousness (DoC). Using multiplex and multilayer network analyses of frequency-specific and area-specific networks, we investigated functional connectivity during resting-state EEG in 17 patients with Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS) and 15 with Minimally Conscious State (MCS). Multiplex and multilayer network metrics indicated the deterioration and heterogeneity of functional networks and, particularly, the frontal-parietal (FP), as the discriminant between patients with MCS and UWS. These data were not appreciable when considering each individual frequency-specific network. The distinctive properties of multiplex/multilayer network metrics and individual frequency-specific network metrics further suggest the value of integrating the networks as opposed to analyzing frequency-specific network metrics one at a time. The hub vulnerability of these regions was positively correlated with the behavioral responsiveness, thus strengthening the clinically-based differential diagnosis. Therefore, it may be beneficial to adopt both multiplex and multilayer network analyses when expanding the conventional GTA-based analyses in the differential diagnosis of patients with DoC. Multiplex analysis differentiated patients at a group level, whereas the multilayer analysis offered complementary information to differentiate patients with DoC individually. Although further studies are necessary to confirm our preliminary findings, these results contribute to the issue of DoC differential diagnosis and may help in guiding patient-tailored management.

A Pilot Study	SYMMETRY-BASEL			English	Article						laterality; brain; hemisphere; asymmetry; activity; biofeedback; EEG	RATE-VARIABILITY BIOFEEDBACK; VISUAL FEEDBACK; SHORT-TERM; EEG-ALPHA; ULTRASOUND; DEPRESSION; ANXIETY; SPEECH	In the current pilot study, we attempt to find out how double neurofeedback influences functional hemispheric asymmetry and activity. We examined 30 healthy participants (8 males; 22 females, mean age = 29; SD = 8). To measure functional hemispheric asymmetry and activity, we used computer laterometry in the 'two-source' lead-lag dichotic paradigm. Double biofeedback included 8 min of EEG oscillation recording with five minutes of basic mode. During the basic mode, the current amplitude of the EEG oscillator gets transformed into feedback sounds while the current amplitude of alpha EEG oscillator is used to modulate the intensity of light signals. Double neurofeedback did not directly influence the asymmetry itself but accelerated individual sound perception characteristics during dichotic listening in the preceding effect paradigm. Further research is needed to investigate the effect of double neurofeedback training on functional brain activity and asymmetry, taking into account participants' age, gender, and motivation.

As an objective measure, steady-state responses have been used in different clinical settings, including measuring hearing thresholds of normal and hearing-impaired subjects. Recent studies are in favor of recording these responses as a part of the cochlear implant (CI) device-fitting procedure. Considering these potential benefits, the goals of the present study were to assess the feasibility of recording free-field SS-EPs in CI users and to compare their characteristics between CI users and controls. By taking advantage of a recently developed dual-frequency tagging method, we attempted to record subcortical and cortical SS-EPs from adult CI users and controls and measured reliable subcortical and cortical SS-EPs in the control group. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to remove CI stimulation artifacts, yet subcortical responses of several CIs were heavily contaminated by these artifacts. Consequently, only cortical SS-EPs were compared between groups, which were found to be larger in the controls. The lower cortical SS-EPs' amplitude in CI users might indicate a reduction in neural synchrony evoked by the modulation rate of the auditory input across different neural assemblies in the auditory pathway. The brain topographies of cortical auditory SS-EPs, the time course of cortical responses, and the reconstructed cortical maps were highly similar between groups, confirming their neural origin and possibility to obtain such responses also in CI recipients. As for subcortical SS-EPs, our results highlight a need for sophisticated denoising algorithms to pinpoint and remove artifactual components from the biological response.

Combining passive limb mobilization, robotic devices and EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) systems might improve treatment and clinical follow-up of these patients, but detailed knowledge of neurophysiological mechanisms involved in functional recovery, which might help for tailoring stroke treatment strategies, is lacking. Movement-related EEG changes (EEG event-related desynchronization (ERD) in beta and alpha bands, an indicator of motor cortex activation traditionally used for BCI systems), were evaluated in a group of 23 paralyzed chronic stroke patients in two unilateral motor tasks alternating paretic and healthy hands ((i) passive movement, using a hand exoskeleton, and (ii) voluntary movement), and compared to nine healthy subjects. In tasks using unaffected hand, we observed an increase of contralesional hemisphere activation for stroke patients group. Unexpectedly, when using paralyzed hand, motor cortex activation was reduced or absent in severely affected group of patients, while patients with moderate motor deficit showed an activation greater than control group. Cortical activation was reduced or absent in damaged hemisphere of all the patients in both tasks. Significant differences related to severity of motor deficit were found in the time course of alpha-beta bands power ratio in EEG of contralesional hemisphere while moving affected hand. These findings suggest the presence of different compensation mechanisms in contralesional hemisphere of stroke patients related to the grade of motor disability, that might turn quantitative EEG during a movement task, obtained from a BCI system controlling a robotic device included in a rehabilitation task, into a valuable tool for monitoring clinical progression, evaluating recovery, and tailoring treatment of stroke patients.

In this study, we investigated the effect of training with different task complexity on Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. Two types of training ('simple' and 'complex') were performed by two groups of healthy volunteers. The complex training group (CTG) performed a trace tracking task using their dominant foot and the simple training group (STG) executed repetitive ankle dorsiflexion in the training phase. Frequency analysis was performed to study the effect of training on EEG signals. In addition, the coherence between paired-channels investigated to represent changes in brain region connectivity. Results revealed that the power in the Beta (15 31 Hz) was significantly reduced while gamma band power (32 80 Hz) was significantly enhanced in the CTG compared to the STG mainly in the frontal, central and centro-parietal channels. Theta power was also increased after training in fronto-central channel. Moreover, performance variations were mainly correlated to the beta and gamma power changes. Finally, the connectivity of gamma and beta band increased significantly particularly between frontal and central region in CTG while connectivity score of theta and delta band decreased after training. These findings confirm that training-induced brain plasticity depends on the complexity of the task, more complexity.

J	Wu, F; Gong, AM; Li, HY; Zhao, L; Zhang, W; Fu, YF				Wu, Fan; Gong, Anmin; Li, Hongyun; Zhao, Lei; Zhang, Wei; Fu, Yunfa			A New Subject-Specific Discriminative and Multi-Scale Filter Bank Tangent Space Mapping Method for Recognition of Multiclass Motor Imagery	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						tangent space mapping; discriminative and multiscale filter bank; multiclass motor-imagery; Riemannian geometry based classifier; electroencephalogram		Objective: Tangent Space Mapping (TSM) using the geometric structure of the covariance matrices is an effective method to recognize multiclass motor imagery (MI). Compared with the traditional CSP method, the Riemann geometric method based on TSM takes into account the nonlinear information contained in the covariance matrix, and can extract more abundant and effective features. Moreover, the method is an unsupervised operation, which can reduce the time of feature extraction. However, EEG features induced by MI mental activities of different subjects are not the same, so selection of subject-specific discriminative EEG frequency components play a vital role in the recognition of multiclass MI. In order to solve the problem, a discriminative and multi-scale filter bank tangent space mapping (DMFBTSM) algorithm is proposed in this article to design the subject-specific Filter Bank (FB) so as to effectively recognize multiclass MI tasks. Methods: On the 4-class BCI competition IV-2a dataset, first, a non-parametric method of multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) based on the sum of squared distances is used to select discriminative frequency bands for a subject; next, a multi-scale FB is generated according to the range of these frequency bands, and then decompose multi-channel EEG of the subject into multiple sub-bands combined with several time windows. Then TSM algorithm is used to estimate Riemannian tangent space features in each sub-band and finally a liner Support Vector Machines (SVM) is used for classification. Main Results: The analysis results show that the proposed discriminative FB enhances the multi-scale TSM algorithm, improves the classification accuracy and reduces the execution time during training and testing. On the 4-class BCI competition IV-2a dataset, the average session to session classification accuracy of nine subjects reached 77.33 +/- 12.3%. When the training time and the test time are similar, the average classification accuracy is 2.56% higher than the latest TSM method based on multi-scale filter bank analysis technology. When the classification accuracy is similar, the training speed is increased by more than three times, and the test speed is increased two times more. Compared with Supervised Fisher Geodesic Minimum Distance to the Mean (Supervised FGMDRM), another new variant based on Riemann geometry classifier, the average accuracy is 3.36% higher, we also compared with the latest Deep Learning method, and the average accuracy of 10-fold cross validation improved by 2.58%. Conclusion: Research shows that the proposed DMFBTSM algorithm can improve the classification accuracy of MI tasks. Significance: Compared with the MFBTSM algorithm, the algorithm proposed in this article is expected to select frequency bands with good separability for specific subject to improve the classification accuracy of multiclass MI tasks and reduce the feature dimension to reduce training time and testing time.

Regional Brain Correlates of Beta Bursts in Health and Psychosis: A Concurrent Electroencephalography and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY-COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE AND NEUROIMAGING			English	Article							BIPOLAR DISORDER; WORKING-MEMORY; MOTOR CONTROL; SCHIZOPHRENIA; NETWORKS; CORTEX; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; SIGNATURES; SYMPTOMS	BACKGROUND: There is emerging evidence for abnormal beta oscillations in psychosis. Beta oscillations are likely to play a key role in the coordination of sensorimotor information that is crucial to healthy mental function. Growing evidence suggests that beta oscillations typically manifest as transient beta bursts that increase in probability following a motor response, observable as post-movement beta rebound. Evidence indicates that post-movement beta rebound is attenuated in psychosis, with greater attenuation associated with greater symptom severity and impairment. Delineating the functional role of beta bursts therefore may be key to understanding the mechanisms underlying persistent psychotic illness. METHODS: We used concurrent electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify blood oxygen level-dependent correlates of beta bursts during the n-back working memory task and intervening rest periods in healthy control participants (n = 30) and patients with psychosis (n = 48). RESULTS: During both task blocks and intervening rest periods, beta bursts phasically activated regions implicated in task-relevant content while suppressing currently tonically active regions. Patients showed attenuated postmovement beta rebound that was associated with persisting disorganization symptoms as well as impairments in cognition and role function. Patients also showed greater task-related reductions in overall beta burst rate and showed greater, more extensive, beta burst-related blood oxygen level-dependent activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our evidence supports a model in which beta bursts reactivate latently maintained sensorimotor information and are dysregulated and inefficient in psychosis. We propose that abnormalities in the mechanisms by which beta bursts coordinate reactivation of contextually appropriate content can manifest as disorganization, working memory deficits, and inaccurate forward models and may underlie a core deficit associated with persisting symptoms and impairment.

The aim of the research is isolating these neuronal responses from other visual and auditory features that covary with film editing. This system of comparing pairs of signals using permutation tests, the Spearman correlation, and slope analysis is implemented in an automated way through sliding windows, analyzing all the registered electrodes signals at all the frequency bands defined. Through this methodology, we are able to locate, identify, and quantify the variations in neuronal rhythms in specific cortical areas and frequency ranges with temporal precision. Our results detected that after a cut there is a synchronization in theta rhythms during the first 188 ms with left lateralization, and also a desynchronization between 250 ms and 750 ms in the delta frequency band. The cortical area where most of these neuronal responses are detected in both cases is the parietal area.

Neural and Behavioral Evidence for Vibrotactile Beat Perception and Bimodal Enhancement	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SENSORIMOTOR SYNCHRONIZATION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; NEURONAL ENTRAINMENT; CORTICAL ENTRAINMENT; TEMPO SENSITIVITY; BASAL GANGLIA; MOTOR AREAS; RHYTHMS; TIME; OSCILLATIONS	The ability to synchronize movements to a rhythmic stimulus, referred to as sensorimotor synchronization (SMS), is a behavioral measure of beat perception. Although SMS is generally superior when rhythms are presented in the auditory modality, recent research has demonstrated near-equivalent SMS for vibrotactile presentations of isochronous rhythms [Ammirante, P., Patel, A. D., & Russo, F. A. Synchronizing to auditory and tactile metronomes: A test of the auditory-motor enhancement hypothesis. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 23, 1882-1890, 2016]. The current study aimed to replicate and extend this study by incorporating a neural measure of beat perception. Nonmusicians were asked to tap to rhythms or to listen passively while EEG data were collected. Rhythmic complexity (isochronous, nonisochronous) and presentation modality (auditory, vibrotactile, bimodal) were fully crossed. Tapping data were consistent with those observed by Ammirante et al. (2016), revealing near-equivalent SMS for isochronous rhythms across modality conditions and a drop-off in SMS for nonisochronous rhythms, especially in the vibrotactile condition. EEG data revealed a greater degree of neural entrainment for isochronous compared to nonisochronous trials as well as for auditory and bimodal compared to vibrotactile trials. These findings led us to three main conclusions. First, isochronous rhythms lead to higher levels of beat perception than nonisochronous rhythms across modalities. Second, beat perception is generally enhanced for auditory presentations of rhythm but still possible under vibrotactile presentation conditions. Finally, exploratory analysis of neural entrainment at harmonic frequencies suggests that beat perception may be enhanced for bimodal presentations of rhythm.

However, the typical, asymmetrical and mass-univariate approach cannot capture the inherent, higher order structure in the EEG data, nor multivariate relations in the fMRI data, and it is nontrivial to accurately handle varying neurovascular coupling over patients and brain regions. We aim to overcome these drawbacks in a data-driven manner by means of a novel structured matrix-tensor factorization: the single-subject EEG data (represented as a third-order spectrogram tensor) and fMRI data (represented as a spatiotemporal BOLD signal matrix) are jointly decomposed into a superposition of several sources, characterized by space-time-frequency profiles. In the shared temporal mode, Toeplitz-structured factors account for a spatially specific, neurovascular 'bridge' between the EEG and fMRI temporal fluctuations, capturing the hemodynamic response's variability over brain regions. By analyzing interictal data from twelve patients, we show that the extracted source signatures provide a sensitive localization of the ictal onset zone (10/12). Moreover, complementary parts of the IOZ can be uncovered by inspecting those regions with the most deviant neurovascular coupling, as quantified by two entropy-like metrics of the hemodynamic response function waveforms (9/12). Hence, this multivariate, multimodal factorization provides two useful sets of EEG-fMRI biomarkers, which can assist the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. We make all code required to perform the computations available at https://github.com/svaneynd/structured-cmtf.

Investigating brain electrical activity and functional connectivity in adolescents with clinically elevated levels of ADHD symptoms in alpha frequency band	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						ADHD; EEG; Individualized alpha band; Spectral power; Connectivity	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; QUANTITATIVE EEG; CHILDREN; REACTIVITY; THICKNESS; LAPLACIAN; DYNAMICS; SUBTYPES; RHYTHMS; CORTEX	EEG measures such as power and connectivity have been widely used to investigate the neuronal underpinnings of ADHD. Traditionally, the fixed band analysis, in which a single frequency band is applied to all the subjects, has been used to estimate these EEG measures. However, there are important interindividual differences in the predominant frequency of alpha-band oscillations. In this study, we present an individualized estimate of EEG in the alpha band and compared the results with traditional fixed band analysis. We also examined the EEG profile separately in lower and upper alpha bands. We further examined the association between EEG measures and ADHD symptoms. Eyes closed resting EEG was collected from 21 adolescents with clinically elevated levels of ADHD and 21 age and gender matched control subjects. Spectral power and connectivity were computed in lower and upper alpha bands. Results revealed a dissociation between upper and lower alpha band power and connectivity in ADHD. The ADHD group showed reduced power and connectivity in the lower alpha band and an elevation of upper alpha power compared to the Control group. EEG power in the lower alpha band was negatively associated with ADHD severity. Our results, however, did not provide conclusive evidence for IAF as an overall greater measure of EEG compared to the traditional fixed band method.

EEG signals consisting of gamma-band (40-80 Hz) and theta-band (4-8 Hz) oscillations have been captured for performing empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Dominant intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) have been selected from the consequences of EMD and a statistical model is employed upon the IMFs to summarize the information on those. Bimodal Gaussian statistical model has been found most effective to prepare feature set taking the modeling parameters of its probability density function (PDF). Plotting together bimodal Gaussian PDF and empirical PDF for pictorial scrutiny; cumulative distribution function (CDF) in probability-probability (p-p) plot and goodness of fit K-S test result justified the effectiveness of proposed bimodal Gaussian statistical model. Hence, aforementioned statistical modeling parameters have been sent to numerous classifiers and rationalization of goodness of features has been shown through inter-class separability and intra-class compactness parameters. Extensive varieties of simulations are performed using a well-established dataset. The suggested strategy reveals the capability of making higher values of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy compared to that made by some cuffing-edge methods utilizing the same EEG dataset.

SimMEEG software for simulating event-related MEG and EEG data with underlying functional connectivity	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Simulation; Event-related responses; Functional connectivity; Phase coherence; Electromagnetic; Electroencephalography; Magnetoencephalography	PHASE-LAG INDEX; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; SYNCHRONY	Background: Simulating electromagnetic brain signals is becoming more and more prevalent because of the need to verify and validate electrophysiological analysis methods, especially with regards to measurements of functional connectivity and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). ew Method: A Matlab software package with a graphical user interface, called SimMEEG, was developed so that novice and expert users could input basic signal parameters (e.g., multiple frequencies, amplitudes, durations, phase interactions, and phase-amplitude couplings) in order to simulate signals that approximate event-related brain activity. A major objective for developing this software was to create software to simulate interacting brain signals that could be used to verify functional connectivity analyses, specifically phase-locking value (PLV), phase-lag index (PLI) algorithms, and PAC. SimMEEG simulates three sources with various parameters defined by users. Users can define, multiple frequencies, event-related changes in amplitude, synchronizations (i.e., PLV and PLI), and PAC. Results: SimMEEG simulated signals that estimated the signal input parameters within specific target limits for PLV, PLI, and PAC. In addition, SimMEEG's synthetic signals closely approximated real human visual eventrelated responses. The Monte-Carlo module was used to simulate ten MEG and EEG datasets, conduct function connectivity analyses for comparison among several inverse solutions, and generate errors from ground truth. SimMEEG identified inverse solutions that had good and poor performances for functional connectivity analyses. Comparison with existing methods: Comparison between other simulation methods and SimMEEG are discussed. Conclusion: SimMEEG software could be used to simulate real human EEG and MEG to aid in verification of analysis pipelines by comparing analyzed results to the simulated ground truth of the user-defined event-related brain signals. A core program within SimMEEG, called SimSignals, might also be used in other fields that would benefit from simulations of three interacting signals.

On the macroscopic scale, this control is reflected in the U-shaped deviations of EEG spectral-power dynamics from stochastic dynamics, characterized by disproportionately elevated occurrences of the lowest and highest ranges of power. To understand the mechanisms that generate these low- and high-power states, we fit a simple mathematical model of synchronization of oscillatory activity to human EEG data. The results consistently indicated that the majority (similar to 95%) of synchronization dynamics is controlled by slowly adjusting the probability of synchronization while maintaining maximum entropy within the timescale of a few seconds. This strategy appears to be universal as the results generalized across oscillation frequencies, EEG current sources, and participants (N = 52) whether they rested with their eyes closed, rested with their eyes open in a darkened room, or viewed a silent nature video. Given that precisely coordinated behavior requires tightly controlled oscillatory dynamics, the current results suggest that the large-scale spatial synchronization of oscillatory activity is controlled by the relatively slow, entropy-maximizing adjustments of synchronization probability (demonstrated here) in combination with temporally precise phase adjustments (e.g., phase resetting generated by sensorimotor interactions). Interestingly, we observed a modest but consistent spatial pattern of deviations from the maximum-entropy rule, potentially suggesting that the mid-central-posterior region serves as an "entropy dump" to facilitate the temporally precise control of spectral-power dynamics in the surrounding regions.

Prevention, control, and improvement of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction are of great significance for improving the patients' intellectual development and quality of life. Electroencephalograms (EEG) can predict an accelerated decline in cognitive function. AIM To determine the clinical and EEG characteristics and treatment results of benign epilepsy in spiking children. METHODS A total of 106 cases of benign epilepsy in children with myocardial spines treated at our hospital from January 2017 to January 2020 were selected. Differences in clinical data and EGG characteristics between treatment-effective/-ineffective patients were analyzed, and children's intellectual development before and after treatment evaluated using the Gesell Development Diagnostic Scale. RESULTS EEG showed that the discharge proportion in the awake and sleep periods was 66.04%, and the peak/peak discharge was mainly single- sided, accounting for 81.13%, while the discharge generalization accounted for 31.13%. There was no significant difference in any of these variables between sexes and ages (P > 0.05). The proportion of patients with early onset (< 5 years old) and seizure frequency > 3 times/half a year was 40.00% and 60.00%, respectively; the incidence rate and seizure frequency in the younger age group (< 5 years old) were significantly higher than those in the treatment-effective group (P < 0.05), while the discharge index was significantly lower than that in the treatment-effective group (P < 0.05). The discharge index was negatively correlated with fine motor skill and language development (r = -0.274 and -0.247, respectively; P < 0.05), but not with the rest (P > 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that low age onset (< 5 years old) and seizure frequency were the factors affecting ineffective-treatment of benign epilepsy in children (odds ratio = 11.304 and 5.784, respectively; P < 0.05). The discharge index of the responsive group after treatment was significantly lower than that of the unresponsive group (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between groups after treatment in gross and fine motor skills, adaptability, language, and personal social development (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION The EEG of children with benign epilepsy due to spinal wave in central time zone has characteristic changes, and the therapeutic effect is influenced by age of onset and attack frequency.

Neurophysiological biomarkers are needed for timely differentiation of encephalopathy severity within the short therapeutic window for initiation of hypothermia therapy. Methods: A novel analysis of mean Phase Amplitude Coupling index, PAC(m), of amplitudes high frequencies (12-30 Hz) coupled with phases of low (1,2 Hz) frequencies was calculated from the 6 h EEG recorded during the first day of life. PAC(m) values were compared to identify differences between mild versus higher-grade HIE, respectively, for each of the EEG electrodes. A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated to examine the performance of PAC(m). Results: 38 newborns with different HIE grades were enrolled in the first 6 h of life. Threshold PAC(m) 0.001 at Fz, O1, O2, P3, and P4 had AUC >0.9 to differentiate HIE severity and predict the persistence of moderate to severe encephalopathy that requires treatment with hypothermia. Conclusion: PAC is a promising biomarker to identify mild from higher severity of HIE after birth. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, for the first time, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate neurophysiological similarities and differences in response to the same verbal stimuli, expressed in the auditory and visual modality during the n-back task with varying memory load in children. Since VWM plays an important role in learning ability, we wanted to investigate whether children elaborated the verbal input from auditory and visual stimuli through the same neural patterns and if performance varies depending on the sensory modality. Performance in terms of reaction times was better in visual than auditory modality (p = 0.008) and worse as memory load increased regardless of the modality (p < 0.001). EEG activation was proportionally influenced by task level and was evidenced in theta band over the prefrontal cortex (p = 0.021), along the midline (p = 0.003), and on the left hemisphere (p = 0.003). Differences in the effects of the two modalities were seen only in gamma band in the parietal cortices (p = 0.009). The values of a brainwave-based engagement index, innovatively used here to test children in a dual-modality VWM paradigm, varied depending on n-back task level (p = 0.001) and negatively correlated (p = 0.002) with performance, suggesting its computational effectiveness in detecting changes in mental state during memory tasks involving children. Overall, our findings suggest that auditory and visual VWM involved the same brain cortical areas (frontal, parietal, occipital, and midline) and that the significant differences in cortical activation in theta band were more related to memory load than sensory modality, suggesting that VWM function in the child's brain involves a cross-modal processing pattern.

The classification of ESs and surgery in patients without lesions apparent on MRI is challenging. Total corpus callosotomy (TCC) is a surgi- cal option for diagnosis of the lateralization and possible treatment for ESs. This study investigated phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) of fast activity modulated by slow waves on scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate the strength of the modulation index (MI) before and after disconnection surgery in children with intractable nonlesional ESs. The authors hypothesize that a decreased MI due to surgery correlates with good seizure outcomes. METHODS The authors studied 10 children with ESs without lesions on MRI who underwent disconnection surgeries. Scalp EEG was obtained before and after surgery. The authors collected 20 epochs of 3 minutes each during non-rapid eye movement sleep. The MI of the gamma (30-70 Hz) amplitude and delta (0.5-4 Hz) phase was obtained in each electrode. MIs for each electrode were averaged in 4 brain areas (left/right, anterior/posterior quadrants) and evaluated to determine the correlation with seizure outcomes. RESULTS The median age at first surgery was 2.3 years (range 10 months-9.1 years). Two patients with focal onset ESs underwent anterior quadrant disconnection (AQD). TCC alone was performed in 5 patients with generalized or unknown onset ESs. Two patients achieved seizure freedom. Three patients had residual generalized onset ESs. Disconnection surgeries in addition to TCC consisted of TCC + posterior quadrant disconnection (PQD) (1 patient); TCC + AQD + PQD (1 patient); and TCC + AQD + hemispherotomy (1 patient). Seven patients became seizure free with a mean follow-up period of 28 months (range 5-54 months). After TCC, MIs in 4 quadrants were significantly lower in the 2 sei- zure-free patients than in the 6 patients with residual ESs (p < 0.001). After all 15 disconnection surgeries in 10 patients, MIs in the 13 target quadrants for each disconnection surgery that resulted in freedom from seizures were significantly lower than in the 26 target quadrants in patients with residual ESs (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In children with nonlesional ESs, PAC for scalp EEG before and after disconnection surgery may be a surrogate marker for control of ESs. The MI may indicate epileptogenic neuronal modulation of the interhemispheric corpus callosum and intrahemispheric subcortical network for ESs. TCC may be a therapeutic option to disconnect the interhemispheric modulation of epileptic networks.

However, fewer studies focused on beta band oscillations during postural control in upright stance. In this preliminary study, we examined beta rebound and other components of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity during perturbed upright stance to investigate supraspinal contributions to postural stabilization. Particularly, we aimed to clarify the timing and duration of beta rebound within a non-sustained, but long-lasting postural recovery process that occurs more slowly compared to upper extremities. To this end, EEG signals were acquired from nine healthy young adults in response to a brief support-surface perturbation, together with the center of pressure, the center of mass and electromyogram (EMG) activities of ankle muscles. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related spectral perturbations were computed from EEG data using the perturbation-onset as a triggering event. After short-latency (<0.3 s) ERPs, our results showed a decrease in high-beta band oscillations (event-related desynchronization), which was followed by a significant increase (event-related synchronization) in the same band, as well as a decrease in theta band oscillations. Unlike during upper extremity motor tasks, the beta rebound in this case was initiated before the postural recovery was completed, and sustained for as long as 3 s with small EMG responses for the first half period, followed by no excessive EMG activities for the second half period. We speculate that those novel characteristics of beta rebound might be caused by slow postural dynamics along a stable manifold of the unstable saddle-type upright equilibrium of the postural control system without active feedback control, but with active monitoring of the postural state, in the framework of the intermittent control.

Inspired by the brain functional network, we constructed a cortical-muscular functional network using electroencephalography and electromyography to explore the motion control mechanism of the central nervous system and understand the organization and coordination mechanisms of limb motion control. In the process of constructing the network, 12 signal acquisition channels were selected as nodes, and the wavelet coherence is used as the index of connection between network nodes. Based on the original network, we used a fixed weighted edge and threshold methods to remove weak weighted edges and compare the performance of the two methods. The experimental results showed that the constructed network had a higher clustering coefficient, and the smaller characteristic path length indicated a small-world characteristic. At the same time, the weighted characteristic path length and weighted clustering coefficient of the functional network simplified by the threshold method can show promising classification accuracy under Fisher and artificial neural network.

In this paper, a new technique that was introduced to solve problems of fluid dynamics called Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), is used to classify seizure and non-seizure epileptic EEG signals. The DMD decomposes a given signal into the intrinsic oscillations called modes which are used to define a DMD spectrum. In the proposed approach, the DMD spectrum is obtained by applying either multi-channel or single-channel based DMD technique. Then, subband and total power features extracted from the DMD spectrum and various classifiers are utilized to classify seizure and non-seizure epileptic EEG segments. Outstanding classification results are achieved by both the single-channel based (96.7%), and the multi-channel based (96%) DMD approaches.

A total of 65 healthy individuals were randomly allocated to an FR, MM, or a control group who received a cognitively oriented relaxation routine. Self-report ratings of perceived anxiety, muscle relaxation, and muscle pain were used to index changes in affect and physical sensations. The sit-and-reach and toe-touch tests, as well as a mental calculation task, were used to index motor and cognitive performances, respectively. We also conducted resting-state electroencephalography and continuous skin conductance recordings before and after the experimental intervention. Both FR and MM groups exhibited neural synchronization of alpha and beta oscillations during the posttest. Skin conductance increased from the pretest to the posttest in the relaxation group, but decreased in the FR group. All interventions improved range of motion, although only the MM group outperformed the relaxation group for the toe-touch performance. MM was associated with reduced muscle pain and increased muscle relaxation. Reduced perceived anxiety after the intervention was observed in the FR group only. Overall, MM and FR both improved objective and subjective indexes of performance and well-being. Differences between the two massage interventions are discussed in relation to the effects of pressure stimulation on autonomic regulations and the proactive vs. retroactive nature of FR, compared to MM.

Functional brain networks assessed with surface electroencephalography for predicting motor recovery in a neural guided intervention for chronic stroke	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						neural guided intervention; stroke; functional connectivity; predictive biomarker; EEG	VARIABLE SELECTION METHODS; QUANTITATIVE EEG; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; CONNECTIVITY; PROGNOSIS; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; ATTENTION; SCORE; FMRI	Predicting whether a chronic stroke patient is likely to benefit from a specific intervention can help patients establish reasonable expectations. It also provides the basis for candidates selecting for the intervention. Recent convergent evidence supports the value of network-based approach for understanding the relationship between dysfunctional neural activity and motor deficits after stroke. In this study, we applied resting-state brain connectivity networks to investigate intervention-specific predictive biomarkers of motor improvement in 22 chronic stroke participants who received either combined action observation with EEG-guided robot-hand training (Neural Guided-Action Observation Group, n= 12, age: 34-68 years) or robot-hand training without action observation and EEG guidance (non-Neural Guided-text group, n= 10, age: 42-57 years). The robot hand in Neural Guided-Action Observation training was activated only when significant mu suppression (8-12 Hz) was detected from participant's EEG signals in ipsilesional hemisphere while it was randomly activated in non-Neural Guided-text training. Only the Neural Guided-Action Observation group showed a significant long-term improvement in their upper-limb motor functions (P < 0.5). In contrast, no significant training effect on the paretic motor functions was found in the non-Neural Guided-text group (P> 0.5). The results of brain connectivity estimated via EEG coherence showed that the pre-training interhemispheric connectivity of delta, theta, alpha and contralesional connectivity of beta were motor improvement related in the Neural Guided-Action Observation group. They can not only differentiate participants with good and poor recovery (interhemispheric delta: P= 0.047, Hedges' g= 1.409; interhemispheric theta: P= 0.046, Hedges' g= 1.333; interhemispheric alpha: P= 0.038, Hedges' g= 1.536; contralesional beta: P= 0.027, Hedges' g= 1.613) but also significantly correlated with post-training intervention gains (interhemispheric delta: r = 0.901, P< 0.05; interhemispheric theta: r- 0.702, P< 0.05; interhemispheric alpha: r = 0.641, P< 0.05; contralesional beta: r - -0.729, P< 0.05). In contrast, no EEG coherence was significantly correlated with intervention gains in the non-Neural Guided-text group (all Ps > 0.05). Partial least square regression showed that the combination of pre-training interhemispheric and contralesional local connectivity could precisely predict intervention gains in the Neural Guided-Action Observation group with a strong correlation between predicted and observed intervention gains (r = 0.82r = 0.82) and between predicted and observed intervention outcomes (r - 0.90r - 0.90).

Methods: Focal epilepsy patients that underwent stereo-electroencephalography implantation with at least one electrode in their hippocampus were selected (n = 75). The occurrence of spindles and barques in the hippocampus was evaluated in each patient. We created pairs of pathologic and pathology-free groups according to two sets of criteria: 1. Non-invasive diagnostic criteria (patients grouped according to focal epilepsy classification). 2. Intracranial neurophysiological criteria (patient's hippocampi grouped according to their seizure onset involvement). Results: Hippocampal spindles and barques appear equally often in both pathologic and pathology-free groups, both for non-invasive (P-spindles = 0.73; P-barques = 0.46) and intracranial criteria (P-spindles = 0.08; P-barques = 0.26). In Engel Class I patients, spindles occurred with similar incidence both within the noninvasive (P = 0.67) and the intracranial criteria group (P = 0.20). Barques were significantly more frequent in extra-temporal lobe epilepsy defined by either non-invasive (P = 0.01) or intracranial (P = 0.01) criteria. Conclusions: Both spindles and barques are normal entities of the hippocampal intracranial electroencephalogram. The presence of barquesmayalso signify lack of epileptogenic properties in the hippocampus. Significance: Understanding that hippocampal spindles and barques do not reflect epileptogenicity is critical for correct interpretation of epilepsy surgery evaluations and appropriate surgical treatment selection.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying LFS are poorly understood. We investigated cortical activation changes occurring during LFS and if changes were associated with reduced nociceptive processing and increased amplitude of spontaneous cortical oscillations post-treatment. Methods: LFS was applied to the radial nerve of 25 healthy volunteers over two sessions using active (1 Hz) or sham (0.02 Hz) frequencies. Changes in resting electroencephalography (EEG) and laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) were investigated before and after LFS. Somatosensory-evoked potentials were recorded during LFS and source analysis was carried out. Results: Ipsilateral midcingulate and operculo-insular cortex source activity declined linearly during LFS. Active LFS was associated with attenuated long-latency LEP amplitude in ipsilateral frontocentral elec-trodes and increased resting alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (16-24 Hz) band power in electrodes overlying operculo-insular, sensorimotor and frontal cortical regions. Reduced ipsilateral operculo-insular cortex source activity during LFS correlated with a smaller post-treatment alpha-band power increase. Conclusions: LFS attenuated somatosensory processing both during and after stimulation. Significance: Results further our understanding of the attenuation of somatosensory processing both dur -ing and after LFS. (c) 2021 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Interpretable principal component analysis for multilevel multivariate functional data	BIOSTATISTICS			English	Article; Early Access						Convex optimization; Functional principal component analysis; Multilevel models; Psychological trauma; Regularization	REGRESSION	Many studies collect functional data from multiple subjects that have both multilevel and multivariate structures. An example of such data comes from popular neuroscience experiments where participants' brain activity is recorded using modalities such as electroencephalography and summarized as power within multiple time-varying frequency bands within multiple electrodes, or brain regions. Summarizing the joint variation across multiple frequency bands for both whole-brain variability between subjects, as well as location-variation within subjects, can help to explain neural reactions to stimuli. This article introduces a novel approach to conducting interpretable principal components analysis on multilevel multivariate functional data that decomposes total variation into subject-level and replicate-within-subject-level (i.e., electrode-level) variation and provides interpretable components that can be both sparse among variates (e.g., frequency bands) and have localized support over time within each frequency band. Smoothness is achieved through a roughness penalty, while sparsity and localization of components are achieved by solving an innovative rank-one based convex optimization problem with block Frobenius and matrix L-1-norm-based penalties. The method is used to analyze data from a study to better understand reactions to emotional information in individuals with histories of trauma and the symptom of dissociation, revealing new neurophysiological insights into how subject- and electrode-level brain activity are associated with these phenomena.

Low-frequency neural activity at rest is correlated with the movement-related cortical potentials elicited during both real and imagined movements	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); Low-frequency power; Event related potential (ERP); Readiness potential; Motor imagery	BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA	Ongoing low-frequency activity in the brain has been shown to indicate an inhibitory neural state; however, the effects of this low-frequency activity on event-related neural processes associated with movement preparation, including movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) or more specifically, the motor potential (MP), and event-related desynchronization (ERD) have not been assessed. Using data from 48 participants, the current study examined how ongoing mu and beta frequency activity at rest relates to the MP and mu and beta ERD during real or imagined movement of the fingers. Resting state EEG activity was collected for 1 min, prior to the real and imagined finger movement trials. 20 real and 20 imagined movement trials were collected for each hand. Resting beta activity correlated with MP amplitude during movement trials for both the right (r(47) = -0.304, p = 0.035) and left (r(47) = -0.468, p < 0.001) hands, whereas resting mu correlated with MP amplitude during motor imagery trials of both the right (r(47) = -0.289, p = 0.046) and left (r(47) = -0.330, p = 0.020) hands. Ongoing mu and beta activity was not significantly correlated with mu or beta ERD for both the movement and imagery trials. A connection between low-frequency activity and MP could inform biofeedback procedures that promote a reduction of this activity, ultimately allowing for easier identification of the intent to move.

This paper selects term preterm infants diagnosed with preterm infant asphyxia in the NICU of a university's First Affiliated Hospital from January 2018 to February 2019 as the research object. In addition, healthy term infants born at the same time in the obstetric department of this hospital are selected as the control group. Both groups of premature infants were monitored for brain function within 6 hours after birth. The aEEG results range from background activity (continuous normal voltage, discontinuous normal voltage, burst suppression, continuous low voltage, and plateau) and sleep-wake cycle (no sleep-wake cycle, immature, and mature sleep-wake cycle) to epileptic activity (single seizures, recurrent seizures, and status epilepticus), three aspects to judge. Statistical analysis uses SPSS 17.0 software. Amplitude-integrated EEG is a simplified form of continuous EEG recording. The trace of the trace represents the voltage change signal of the entire EEG background activity, which can reflect the EEG amplitude, frequency, burst-inhibition, and other pieces of information. aEEG can reflect the degree of HIE lesions in premature infants and the long-term prognosis. It is easy to operate and effective in diagnosis and can be continuously monitored. It is worthy of clinical popularization. There is a good correlation between the expression of EEG and biomarkers. Combining multiple methods can diagnose HIE earlier and evaluate the prognosis.

Since epilepsy is increasingly conceptualized as a network disorder, understanding how brain regions interact may be critical for planning re-operation in these patients. We aimed to estimate functional brain connectivity using scalp EEG and its evolution over time in patients who had repeated surgery (RS-group, n = 9) and patients who had one successful surgery (seizure-free, SF-group, n = 12). We analyzed EEGs without epileptiform activity at varying time points (before and after each surgery). We estimated functional connectivity between cortical regions and their relative centrality within the network. We compared the pre- and post-surgical centrality of all the non-resected (untouched) regions (far or adjacent to resection) for each group (using the Wilcoxon signed rank test). In alpha, theta, and beta frequency bands, the post-surgical centrality of the untouched cortical regions increased in the SF group (p < 0.001) whereas they decreased (p < 0.05) or did not change (p > 0.05) in the RS group after failed surgeries; when re-operation was successful, the post-surgical centrality of far regions increased (p < 0.05). Our data suggest that removal of the epileptogenic focus in children with DRE leads to a gain in the network centrality of the untouched areas. In contrast, unaltered or decreased connectivity is seen when seizures persist after surgery.

Executive dysfunction widely exists in a variety of neuropsychiatric diseases, and is closely related to the decline of daily living ability and function. This study intends to explore the effect of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on executive function and its neural mechanism by using event-related potential (ERP), so as to provide basis for further study on the relationship between cerebral cortex and executive function. Methods: Task switching paradigm was used to study the cognitive flexibility in executive function. Thirty-one healthy subjects were randomly assigned to receive rTMS stimulations (1 Hz rTMS or sham rTMS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) twice. The switching task and the electroencephalography EEG recordings were performed before (pre-rTMS/pre-sham rTMS) and immediately after the end of the rTMS application (post-rTMS/post-sham rTMS). Results: The analysis of RTs showed that the main effects of switching and time were statistically significant. Further analysis revealed that the RT of rTMS stimulation was longer than sham rTMS at post-stimulation. ERP analysis showed that there was a significant switching effect in frontal and central scalp location, and the P2 amplitude in switch trials was greater than that in non-switch trials. At post-stimulation, the N2 amplitude of rTMS is more negative than that of sham rTMS at non-switch trials, whereas no such difference was found at switch trials. The P3 amplitude and LPC amplitude are significantly reduced by rTMS at post-stimulation. Conclusion: Low-frequency rTMS of the left DLPFC can cause decline of cognitive flexibility in executive function, resulting in the change of N2 amplitude and the decrease of P3 and LPC components during task switching, which is of positive significance for the evaluation and treatment of executive function.

In clinical settings, it is evaluated by experts who identify patterns visually. Quantitative EEG is the application of digital signal processing to clinical recordings in order to automatize diagnostic procedures, and to make patterns visible that are hidden to the human eye. The EEG is related to chemical biomarkers, as electrical activity is based on chemical signals. The most well-known chemical biomarkers are blood laboratory tests to identify seizures after they have happened. However, research on chemical biomarkers is much less extensive than research on quantitative EEG, and combined studies are rarely published, but highly warranted. Quantitative EEG is as old as the EEG itself, but still, the methods are not yet standard in clinical practice. The most evident application is an automation of manual work, but also a quantitative description and localization of interictal epileptiform events as well as seizures can reveal important hints for diagnosis and contribute to presurgical evaluation. In addition, the assessment of network characteristics and entropy measures were found to reveal important insights into epileptic brain activity. Application scenarios of quantitative EEG in epilepsy include seizure prediction, pharmaco-EEG, treatment monitoring, evaluation of cognition, and neurofeedback. The main challenges to quantitative EEG are poor reliability and poor generalizability of measures, as well as the need for individualization of procedures. A main hindrance for quantitative EEG to enter clinical routine is also that training is not yet part of standard curricula for clinical neurophysiologists.

In this review, we evaluate the impacts of auditory stimulation on the neural oscillations of sleep and associated memory processes in a variety of populations. Recent Findings Cortical EEG recordings of slow-wave sleep (SWS) are characterised by two cardinal oscillations: slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles. Auditory stimulation delivered in SWS enhances SOs and phase-coupled spindle activity in healthy children and adults, children with ADHD, adults with mild cognitive impairment and patients with major depression. Under certain conditions, auditory stimulation bolsters the benefits of SWS for memory consolidation, although further work is required to fully understand the factors affecting stimulation-related memory gains. Recent work has turned to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, demonstrating that auditory stimulation can be used to manipulate REM sleep theta oscillations. Auditory stimulation enhances oscillations linked to overnight memory processing and shows promise as a technique for enhancing the memory benefits of sleep.

The induced parasympathetic predominance leads to an increase of heart rate variability (HRV). Knowledge on the corresponding cortical activation pattern is, however, scarce. We hypothesized taVNS-induced HRV increases to be related to modulation of cortical activity that regulates the autonomic outflow to the heart. Materials and Methods In thirteen healthy subjects, we simultaneously recorded 64-channel electroencephalography and electrocardiography during taVNS. Two taVNS stimulation targets were investigated, i.e., the cymba conchae and inner tragus, and compared to active control stimulation in the anatomical vicinity, i.e., at the crus helicis and outer tragus. We used intermitted stimulation bursts of 25 Hz applied at a periodicity of 1 Hz. HRV was estimated with different time-domain methodologies: standard deviation of RR (SDNN), the root mean squares of successive differences (RMSSD), the percentage of RR-intervals with at least 50 ms deviation from the preceding RR-interval (pNN50), and the difference of consecutive RR intervals weighted by their mean (rrHRV). Results The stimulation-induced HRV increases corresponded to frequency-specific oscillatory modulation of different cortical areas. All stimulation targets induced power modulations that were proportional to the HRV elevation. The most prominent changes that corresponded to HRV increases across all parameters and stimulation locations were frontal elevations in the theta-band. In the delta-band, there were frontal increases (RMSSD, pNN50, rrHRV, SDNN) and decreases (SDNN) across stimulation sites. In higher frequencies, there was a more divers activity pattern: Outer tragus/crus helicis stimulation increased oscillatory activity with the most prominent changes for the SDNN in frontal (alpha-band, beta-band) and fronto-parietal (gamma-band) areas. During inner tragus/cymba conchae stimulation the predominant pattern was a distributed power decrease, particularly in the fronto-parietal gamma-band. Conclusion Neuro-cardiac interactions can be modulated by electrical stimulation at different auricular locations. Increased HRV during stimulation is correlated with frequency-specific increases and decreases of oscillatory activity in different brain areas. When applying specific HRV measures, cortical patterns related to parasympathetic (RMSSD, pNN50, rrHRV) and sympathetic (SDNN) modulation can be identified. Thus, cortical oscillations may be used to define stimulation locations and parameters for research and therapeutic purposes.

The irregularity of NDD vGRF signals caused by gait abnormalities can indicate different force pattern variations compared to a healthy control (HC). The main purpose of this research is to help physicians in the early detection of NDDs, efficient treatment planning, and monitoring of disease progression. The detection algorithm comprises a preprocessing process, a feature transformation process, and a classification process. In the preprocessing process, the five-minute vertical ground reaction force signal was divided into 10, 30, and 60 s successive time windows. In the feature transformation process, the time-domain vGRF signal was modified into a time-frequency spectrogram using a continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Then, feature enhancement with principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized. Finally, a convolutional neural network, as a deep learning classifier, was employed in the classification process of the proposed detection algorithm and evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and k-fold cross-validation (k-fold CV, k = 5). The proposed detection algorithm can effectively differentiate gait patterns based on a time-frequency spectrogram of a vGRF signal between HC subjects and patients with neurodegenerative diseases.

The relationship of resting-state EEG oscillations to executive functions in middle childhood	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Executive functions; Inhibition; Working memory; Planning; Resting-state; EEG	N-BACK TASK; WORKING-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; YOUNG-CHILDREN; ATTENTION; BRAIN; ALPHA; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION; INSIGHTS	Executive functions (EFs) play important roles in children's development, but their neural mechanisms are rarely investigated, especially for the different components of EFs in middle childhood. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the links between resting-state EEG in the frontal scalp region and EFs in children aged 7-9 years. Fifty-nine typically developing children from the second and third grades performed two core EF tasks, i.e., inhibition and working memory, and a high-level EF task, i.e., planning, followed by the recording of EEG signals during eyes-open and eyes-closed resting states. The results showed that distinct EEG activities in the frontal scalp region predicted different EF components. More specifically, after controlling for age and verbal ability, alpha to theta power ratio (ATR) and beta to theta power ratio (BTR) during the eyes-open resting state positively predicted inhibition, and beta to theta power ratio (BTR) during the eyes-open resting state positively predicted planning. However, we did not find any EEG features related to working memory. Our results contributed to the understanding of inter-individual differences in EFs and provided insights into the regulation of corresponding EEG activities through EEG neurofeedback for enhancing children's EFs.

Adaptive Bayesian Spectral Analysis of High-Dimensional Nonstationary Time Series	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS			English	Article						Factor analysis; High-dimensional time series; Locally stationary process; Multiplicative gamma process; Spectral analysis; Stochastic approximation Monte Carlo		This article introduces a nonparametric approach to spectral analysis of a high-dimensional multivariate nonstationary time series. The procedure is based on a novel frequency-domain factor model that provides a flexible yet parsimonious representation of spectral matrices from a large number of simultaneously observed time series. Real and imaginary parts of the factor loading matrices are modeled independently using a prior that is formulated from the tensor product of penalized splines and multiplicative gamma process shrinkage priors, allowing for infinitely many factors with loadings increasingly shrunk toward zero as the column index increases. Formulated in a fully Bayesian framework, the time series is adaptively partitioned into approximately stationary segments, where both the number and locations of partition points are assumed unknown. Stochastic approximation Monte Carlo techniques are used to accommodate the unknown number of segments, and a conditional Whittle likelihood-based Gibbs sampler is developed for efficient sampling within segments. By averaging over the distribution of partitions, the proposed method can approximate both abrupt and slowly varying changes in spectral matrices. Performance of the proposed model is evaluated by extensive simulations and demonstrated through the analysis of high-density electroencephalography. for this article are available online.

Methods: We analyzed EEG signals recorded from pediatric to adult patients ( n = 131), separated into six age groups: < 1 year ( n = 15), 1-3 years ( n = 23), 3-6 years ( n = 19), 6-12 years ( n = 18), 12-18 years ( n = 16), and 18-45 years ( n = 40). Age related EEG power and cross frequency coupling analysis (phase amplitude coupling (PAC) and quadratic phase coupling) of data from maintenance of a surgical state of anesthesia (MOSSA) was conducted. Also, for patients of ages less than 6 years, we analyzed the performance of cross frequency coupling derived indices in distinguishing the states of wakefulness, MOSSA, and recovery of consciousness (ROC). Results: (1) During MOSSA, EEG power substantially increased with age from infancy to 3-6 years then decreased with age in the theta-gamma frequency bands. The infant group ( < 1 year) had the highest slow oscillation (SO) power among all age groups. (2) The distinct PAC pattern is absent in patients less than 1 year of age both in SO alpha and delta-alpha frequency band coupling during propofol induced unconsciousness. The modulation index between delta and alpha oscillations in MOSSA increased with age. (3) Wavelet bicoherence derived indices reach their peaks in the 3-6 years group and then decrease with age growth. (4) The Diag_En index (normalized entropy of the diagonal bicoherence entries of the bicoherence matrix) performed the best at distinguishing different states for ages less than 6 years ( p < 0.05). Conclusions: The combination of propofol induction and sevoflurane maintenance exhibited age-dependent EEG power spectra, PAC, and bicoherence, likely related to brain development.

Here, in a selective attention study with simultaneous EEG in humans of either sex, we first demonstrate that diminished anticipatory alpha synchrony between the mid-frontal region of the dorsal attention network and ventral visual sensory cortex (frontal-sensory synchrony (FSS)) significantly correlates with greater task performance. Then, in a double-blind, randomized controlled study in healthy adults, we implement closed-loop neurofeedback of the anticipatory alpha FSS signal over ten days of training. We refer to this closed-loop experimental approach of rapid neurofeedback (NF) integrated within a cognitive task as cognitive neurofeedback (cNF). We show that cNF results in significant trial-by-trial modulation of the anticipatory alpha FSS measure during training, concomitant plasticity of stimulus-evoked alpha/theta responses, as well as transfer of benefits to response time improvements on a standard test of sustained attention. In a third study, we implement cNF training in children with ADHD, replicating trial-by-trial modulation of the anticipatory alpha FSS signal as well as significant improvement of sustained attention response times. These first findings demonstrate the basic mechanisms and translational utility of rapid cognitive-task-integrated neurofeedback. Significance Statement When humans prepare to attend to incoming sensory information, neural oscillations in the alpha band (8-14 Hz) undergo desynchronization under the control of prefrontal cortex. Here, in an attention study with electroencephalography, we first show that frontal-sensory synchrony (FSS) of alpha oscillations during attentive preparation significantly correlates with task performance. Then, in a randomized controlled study in healthy adults, we show that neurofeedback training of this alpha FSS signal within the attention task is feasible. We show that this rapid cognitive neurofeedback (cNF) approach engenders plasticity of stimulus-evoked neural responses, and improves performance on a standard test of sustained attention. In a final study, we implement cNF in children with ADHD, replicating the improvement of sustained attention found in adults.

Yet, the neural mechanisms underlying such fatigability effect in cognitive flexibility are poorly understood. We examined how theta, alpha, and beta frequency event-related synchronization and desynchronization processes during cued memory-based task switching are modulated by time-on-task effects. We put special emphasis on the examination of functional neuroanatomical regions being associated with these modulations, using EEG beamforming. We show clear declines in task switching performance (increased switch costs) with time on task. For processes occurring before rule switching or repetition processes, we show that anticipatory attentional sampling and selection mechanisms associated with fronto-parietal structures are modulated by time-on-task effects but sensory areas (occipital cortex) also show fatigability-dependent modulations. After target stimulus presentation, the allocation of processing resources for response selection as reflected by theta-related activity in parietal cortices is compromised with time on task and similarly a concomitant increase in alpha and beta band-related attentional processing or gating mechanisms in frontal and occipital regions. Yet, considering the behavioral data showing an apparent decline in performance, this probably compensatory increase is still insufficient to allow reasonable performance. The same is likely the case for processes occurring before rule switching or repetition processes. Comparative analyses show that modulations of alpha band activity are as strongly modulated by fatigability as theta band activity. Implications of these findings for theoretical concepts on fatigability are discussed. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We examine the neurophysiological and functional neuroanatomical basis of fatigability in cognitive flexibility. We show that alpha and theta modulations in fronto-parietal and primary sensory areas are central for the understanding of fatigability effects in cognitive flexibility.

However, there has been little research aiming to improve the performance of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) using neuromodulation. The present study presents a novel design for a neurofeedback training (NFT) method to improve the operation of a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI and further explores its underlying mechanisms. The use of NFT to upregulate alpha-band power in the user's parietal lobe is presented in this study as a new neuromodulation method to improve SSVEP-based BCI in this study. After users completed this NFT intervention, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), accuracy, and information transfer rate (ITR) of the SSVEP-based BCI were increased by 5.8%, 4.7%, and 15.6%, respectively. However, no improvement was observed in the control group in which the subjects did not participate in NFT. Moreover, a general reinforcement of the information flow from the parietal lobe to the occipital lobe was observed. Evidence from a network analysis and an attention test further indicates that NFT improves attention by developing the control capacity of the parietal lobe and then enhances the above SSVEP indicators. Upregulating the amplitude of parietal alpha oscillations using NFT significantly improves the SSVEP-based BCI performance by modulating the control network. The study validates an effective neuromodulation method and possibly contributes to explaining the function of the parietal lobe in the control network.

This paper presents a fuzzy parallel cascades (FPC) model for predicting the continuous subjective emotional appraisal of music by time-varying spectral content of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The EEG, along with an emotional appraisal of 15 subjects, was recorded during listening to seven musical excerpts. The emotional appraisement was recorded along the valence and arousal emotional axes as a continuous signal. The FPC model was composed of parallel cascades with each cascade containing a fuzzy logic-based system. The FPC model performance was evaluated using linear regression (LR), support vector regression (SVR), and Long-Short-Term-Memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) models by 4 fold cross-validation. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the FPC was lower than other models in the estimation of both valence and arousal of all musical excerpts. The lowest obtained RMSE was 0.082, which was acquired by the FPC model. The analysis of mutual information of frontal EEG with the valence confirms the role of frontal channels in the theta frequency band in emotion recognition. Considering the dynamic variations of musical features during songs, employing a modeling approach to predict dynamic variations of the emotional appraisal can be a plausible substitute for the classification of musical excerpts into predefined labels.

Methods: Thirty healthy subjects, to take naps, underwent an intervention of electrical stimulation at 5 Hz, applied to the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. The subjects in the experiments were strictly controlled, and opened their eyes when stimulation was transmitted. Subsequently, after 15 min transcranial alternating current stimulation, subjects entered the experimental procedure of sleep. Electroencephalograph was taken at baseline and during sleep. Behavioral indicators were also added to the experiment. Results: We found that the total power of Electroencephalograph activity in the theta band, as well as low-frequency power at 1-7 Hz, was significantly entrained and increased, and that alpha activity was attenuated faster and spindle activity active earlier. Even more, the transition from awake to Non-rapid eye movement stages occurs earlier. Alertness also decreased when the subjects woke up after brief sleep. Conclusion: The intervention of low frequency brain rhythmic transcranial alternating current stimulation may induce accelerated effect on sleep onset process, thereby possibly alleviating the problems related to sleep disorders such as difficulty to reach the real sleep state quickly after lying down.

Five different MLs are implemented, including k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Wye Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). The EEG data from fifteen healthy subjects during motor execution (ME) and motor imagination (MI) are pre-processed with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to reduce eye-blinking associated artifacts. A sliding window technique varying from 1 s to 2 s is used to segment the signals. The majority voting (MV) strategy is employed during the post-processing stage. The results show that the application of ICA increases the accuracy of MI up to 6%, which is improved further by 1-2% using the MV (p<0.05). However, the improvement in the accuracies is more significant in MI (>5%) than in ME (<1%), indicating a more significant influence of eye-blinking artifacts in the EEG signals during MI than ME. Among the MLs, both RF and SVM consistently produced better accuracies in both ME and MI. Using RF, the 2 s window size produced the highest accuracies in both ME and MI than the smaller window sizes.

However, few studies have examined the neural correlates of memory binding encoding and retrieval during middle childhood. We examined age-related encoding and retrieval differences using continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) measures in a sample of 6- and 8-year-olds. For the memory binding task, children were tested on memory for individual items (i.e., objects and backgrounds only) and combined object-backgrounds pairings (combination condition). Memory for individual item information was comparable across both age groups. However, younger children experienced greater difficulty (i.e., higher false alarm rate) in the combination condition. Theta (4-7 Hz) neuronal oscillations were analyzed to compare memory encoding and retrieval processes. Widespread retrieval-related increases in theta band EEG power (compared with baseline and encoding-related activation) were evident in both 6- and 8-year-olds. Regression analyses revealed that parietal theta EEG power during retrieval accounted for variability in memory binding performance. These findings suggest that theta rhythms are intricately linked to memory binding processes during middle childhood.

Nested into slow oscillations (SOs) and modulated by their up-states, spindles are electrophysiological hallmarks of N2 sleep stage that present a complex hierarchical architecture. However, most studies have only described spindles in basic statistical terms, which were limited to the spindle itself without analyzing the characteristics of the pre-spindle moments in which the SOs are originated. The aim of this study was twofold: (a) to apply spectral and temporal measures to the pre-spindle and spindle periods, as well as analyze the correlation between them, and (b) to evaluate the potential of these spectral and temporal measures in future automatic detection algorithms. Approach. An automatic spindle detection algorithm was applied to the overnight electroencephalographic recordings of 26 subjects. Ten complementary features (five spectral and five temporal parameters) were computed in the pre-spindle and spindle periods after their segmentation. These features were computed independently in each period and in a time-resolved way (sliding window). After the statistical comparison of both periods, a correlation analysis was used to assess their interrelationships. Finally, a receiver operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis along with a bootstrap procedure was conducted to further evaluate the degree of separability between the pre-spindle and spindle periods. Main results. The results show important time-varying changes in spectral and temporal parameters. The features calculated in pre-spindle and spindle periods are strongly and significantly correlated, demonstrating the association between the pre-spindle characteristics and the subsequent spindle. The ROC analysis exposes that the typical feature used in automatic spindle detectors, i.e. the power in the sigma band, is outperformed by other features, such as the spectral entropy in this frequency range. Significance. The novel features applied here demonstrate their utility as predictors of spindles that could be incorporated into novel algorithms of automatic spindle detectors, in which the analysis of the pre-spindle period becomes relevant for improving their performance. From the clinical point of view, these features may serve as novel precision therapeutic targets to enhance spindle production with the aim of improving memory, cognition, and sleep quality in healthy and clinical populations. The results evidence the need for characterizing spindles in terms beyond power and the spindle period itself to more dynamic measures and the pre-spindle period. Physiologically, these findings suggest that spindles are more than simple oscillations, but nonstable oscillatory bursts embedded in the complex pre-spindle dynamics.

However, decoding PAC is still challenging. This contribution presents REPAC, a reliable and robust algorithm for modeling and detecting PAC events in EEG signals. First, we explain the synthesis of PAC-like EEG signals, with special attention to the most critical parameters that characterize PAC, i.e., SNR, modulation index, duration of coupling. Second, REPAC is introduced in detail. We use computer simulations to generate a set of random PAC-like EEG signals and test the performance of REPAC with regard to a baseline method. REPAC is shown to outperform the baseline method even with realistic values of SNR, e.g., dB. They both reach accuracy levels around 99%, but REPAC leads to a significant improvement of sensitivity, from 20.11% to 65.21%, with comparable specificity (around 99%). REPAC is also applied to a real EEG signal showing preliminary encouraging results.

Many are the mechanisms underlying the hyperexcitability in DCM, including the important contribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR). NMDAR blockers are shown to abolish seizures and epileptiform activity. Memantine, a NMDAR antagonist used to treat Alzheimers disease, has been recently investigated as a possible treatment for other neurological disorders. However, the effects on preventing or diminishing seizures are controversial. Here we aimed to evaluate the effects of memantine on pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in the freeze-lesion (FL) model. Bilateral cortical microgyria were induced (FL) or not (Sham) in male Wistar neonate rats. At P30, subdural electrodes were implanted and 7 days later, video-EEG was recorded in animals receiving either memantine (FL-M or Sham-M) or saline (FL-S or Sham-S), followed by PTZ. Seizures were evaluated by video-EEG during one hour and scored according to Racine scale. The video-EEG analyses revealed that the number of seizures and the total duration of stage IV-V seizures developed during the 1 h-period increased after memantine application in all groups. The EEG power spectral density (PSD) analysis showed an increased PSD of pre-ictal delta in Sham-M animals and increased PSD of slow, middle and fast gamma oscillations after memantine injection that persists during the pre-ictal period in all groups. Our findings suggested that memantine was unable to control the PTZ-induced seizures and that the associated enhancement of PSD of gamma oscillations may contribute to the increased probability of seizure development in these animals.

We measured within-subject (N = 10) event-related potential (ERP) changes during out-of-body imagery (OBI)-vivid imagery of a vertical line outside of the head/body-and within-body imagery (WBI)-vivid imagery of the line within one's own head. Furthermore, we measured ERP changes and line offset Vernier acuity (hyperacuity) performance concurrent with those imagery, compared to baseline detection without imagery. Relative to OEA baseline, OBI yielded larger N200 and P300, whereas WBI yielded larger P50, P100, N400, and P800. Additionally, hyperacuity dropped significantly when concurrent with both imagery types. Partial least squares analysis combined behavioural performance, ERPs, and/or event-related EEG band power (ERBP). For both imagery types, hyperacuity reduction correlated with opposite frontal and occipital ERP amplitude and polarity changes. Furthermore, ERP modulation and ERBP synchronizations for all EEG frequencies correlated inversely with hyperacuity. Dipole Source Localization Analysis revealed unique generators in the left middle temporal gyrus (WBI) and in the right frontal middle gyrus (OBI), whereas the common generators were in the left precuneus and middle occipital cortex (cuneus). Imagery experiences, we conclude, can be identified by symmetric and asymmetric combined neurophysiological-behavioural patterns in interactions with the width of attentional focus.

This study hypothesized that tPBM-induced and heat-induced alterations in EEG power topography were significantly distinct. We performed two sets of measurements from two separate groups of healthy humans under tPBM (n = 46) and thermal stimulation (thermo_stim; n = 11) conditions. Each group participated in the study twice under true and respective sham stimulation with concurrent recordings of 64-channel EEG before, during, and after 8-min tPBM at 1064 nm or thermo_stim with temperature of 33-41 degrees C, respectively. After data preprocessing, EEG power spectral densities (PSD) per channel per subject were quantified and normalized by respective baseline PSD to remove the power-law effect. At the group level for each group, percent changes of EEG powers per channel were statistically compared between (1) tPBM vs light-stimulation sham, (2) thermo_stim vs heat-stimulation sham, and (3) tPBM vs thermo_stim after sham exclusion at five frequency bands using the non-parametric permutation tests. By performing the false discovery rate correction for multi-channel comparisons, we showed by EEG power change topographies that (1) tPBM significantly increased EEG alpha and beta powers, (2) the thermal stimulation created opposite effects on EEG power topographic patterns, and (3) tPBM and thermal stimulations induced significantly different topographies of changes in EEG alpha and beta power. Overall, this study provided evidence to support our hypothesis, showing that the laser-induced heat on the human forehead is not a mechanistic source causing increases in EEG power during and after tPBM.

Specific electrophysiological features of pain recovery may either be monitored or be modulated through neurofeedback (NF) as a novel chronic pain treatment. The cold pressor test was applied with simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. EEG data were acquired, and analyzed to define: (1) EEG power topography patterns of pain recovery; (2) source generators of pain recovery at cortical level; (3) changes in functional connectivity associated with pain recovery; (4) features of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) as it relates to pain recovery. The novel finding of this study is that recovery from pain was characterized by significant theta power rebound at the left fronto-central area. The sources of theta power over-recovery were located in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), cingulate cortex, left insula and contralateral sensorimotor cortex. These effects were paralleled by theta band connectivity increase within hemispheres in a prefrontal-somatosensory network and interhemispherically between prefrontal and parietal areas. In addition, this study revealed significant reduction in PAC between theta/alpha and gamma oscillations during recovery period following tonic pain. These findings have largely been replicated across two identical sessions. Our study emphasizes the association between pain recovery and left lateral prefrontal theta power rebound, and significant over-recovery of functional connectivity in prefrontal-sensorimotor neural network synchronized at theta frequencies. These findings may provide basis for chronic pain treatment by modulating neural oscillations at theta frequencies in left prefrontal cortex. (c) 2021 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Sabotage Detection Using DL Models on EEG Data From a Cognitive-Motor Integration Task	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						deep learning; CNN; LSTM; wearable devices; baseline testing; cognitive-motor integration	LIE DETECTION; CONCUSSION	Objective clinical tools, including cognitive-motor integration (CMI) tasks, have the potential to improve concussion rehabilitation by helping to determine whether or not a concussion has occurred. In order to be useful, however, an individual must put forth their best effort. In this study, we have proposed a novel method to detect the difference in cortical activity between best effort (no-sabotage) and willful under-performance (sabotage) using a deep learning (DL) approach on the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The EEG signals from a wearable four-channel headband were acquired during a CMI task. Each participant completed sabotage and no-sabotage conditions in random order. A multi-channel convolutional neural network with long short term memory (CNN-LSTM) model with self-attention has been used to perform the time-series classification into sabotage and no-sabotage, by transforming the time-series into two-dimensional (2D) image-based scalogram representations. This approach allows the inspection of frequency-based, and temporal features of EEG, and the use of a multi-channel model facilitates in capturing correlation and causality between different EEG channels. By treating the 2D scalogram as an image, we show that the trained CNN-LSTM classifier based on automated visual analysis can achieve high levels of discrimination and an overall accuracy of 98.71% in case of intra-subject classification, as well as low false-positive rates. The average intra-subject accuracy obtained was 92.8%, and the average inter-subject accuracy was 86.15%. These results indicate that our proposed model performed well on the data of all subjects. We also compare the scalogram-based results with the results that we obtained by using raw time-series, showing that scalogram-based gave better performance. Our method can be applied in clinical applications such as baseline testing, assessing the current state of injury and recovery tracking and industrial applications like monitoring performance deterioration in workplaces.

The open eyes EEG recordings of five subjects with no artifacts were selected from a sample of 40 subjects. The recordings were filtered in frequency ranges of 2 Hz wide from 1 to 99 Hz. The analytic Hilbert transform was computed to obtain the amplitude envelopes of oscillatory bursts. The criteria of thresholding and a minimum of three cycles to define an oscillatory burst were imposed. Amplitude and duration parameters were extracted and they showed durations between hundreds of milliseconds and a few seconds, and peak amplitudes showed a unimodal distribution. Both parameters were positively correlated and the oscillatory burst durations were explained by a linear model with the terms peak amplitude and peak amplitude of amplitude envelope time derivative. The frequency content of the amplitude envelope was contained in the 0-2 Hz range. The results suggest the presence of amplitude modulated continuous oscillations in the human EEG during the resting conditions in a broad frequency range, with durations in the range of few seconds and modulated positively by amplitude and negatively by the time derivative of the amplitude envelope suggesting activation-inhibition dynamics. This macroscopic oscillatory network behavior is less pronounced in the low-frequency range (1-3 Hz).

We created 18 Biological Motion point-light displays (PLDs) depicting everyday human actions, and 18 Scrambled control PLDs. First, we conducted an online behavioral rating survey, in which deaf and hearing raters identified the biological motion PLDs and rated how easy it was for them to identify the actions. Then, we conducted an EEG study in which Deaf Signers and Hearing Non-Signers watched both the Biological Motion PLDs and the Scrambled PLDs, and we computed the time-frequency responses within the theta, alpha, and beta EEG rhythms. From the behavioral rating task, we show that the deaf raters reported significantly less effort required for identifying the Biological motion PLDs, across all stimuli. The EEG results showed that the Deaf Signers showed theta, mu, and beta differentiation between Scrambled and Biological PLDs earlier and more consistently than Hearing NonSigners. We conclude that native ASL users exhibit experience-dependent neuroplasticity in the domain of biological human motion perception.

Here, we review work from two methods that, in a closed-loop manner, have the potential to ameliorate these fluctuations. Ear-EEG can measure electric brain activity from areas in or around the ear, using small and thus portable hardware. It has been shown to capture the state of attention with high temporal resolution. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) comes with the same advantages (small and light) and critically current research suggests that it is possible to influence ongoing brain activity that has been linked to attention. Following the review of current work on ear-EEG and taVNS we suggest that a combination of the two methods in a closed-loop system could serve as a potential application to modulate attention.

Promising candidates include interictal high-frequency oscillation and phase-amplitude coupling. Investigators have independently created the toolboxes that compute the high-frequency oscillation rate and the severity of phase-amplitude coupling. This study of 135 patients determined what toolboxes and analytic approaches would optimally classify patients achieving post-operative seizure control. Four different detector toolboxes computed the rate of high-frequency oscillation at >= 80Hz at intracranial EEG channels. Another toolbox calculated the modulation index reflecting the strength of phase-amplitude coupling between highfrequency oscillation and slow-wave at 3-4Hz. We defined the completeness of resection of interictally-abnormal regions as the subtraction of high-frequency oscillation rate (or modulation index) averaged across all preserved sites from that averaged across all resected sites. We computed the outcome classification accuracy of the logistic regression-based standard model considering clinical, ictal intracranial EEG and neuroimaging variables alone. We then determined how well the incorporation of high-frequency oscillation/modulation index would improve the standard model mentioned above. To assess the anatomical variability across non-epileptic sites, we generated the normative atlas of detector-specific high-frequency oscillation and modulation index. Each atlas allowed us to compute the statistical deviation of high-frequency oscillation/modulation index from the non-epileptic mean. We determined whether the model accuracy would be improved by incorporating absolute or normalized high-frequency oscillation/modulation index as a biomarker assessing interictally-abnormal regions. We finally determined whether the model accuracy would be improved by selectively incorporating high-frequency oscillation verified to have high-frequency oscillatory components unattributable to a high-pass filtering effect. Ninety-five patients achieved successful seizure control, defined as International League against Epilepsy class 1 outcome. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that complete resection of interictally-abnormal regions additively increased the chance of success. The model accuracy was further improved by incorporating zscore normalized high-frequency oscillation/modulation index or selective incorporation of verified high-frequency oscillation. The standard model had a classification accuracy of 0.75. Incorporation of normalized high-frequency oscillation/modulation index or verified high-frequency oscillation improved the classification accuracy up to 0.82. These outcome prediction models survived the cross-validation process and demonstrated an agreement between the model-based likelihood of success and the observed success on an individual basis. Interictal high-frequency oscillation and modulation index had a comparably additive utility in epilepsy presurgical evaluation. Our empirical data support the theoretical notion that the prediction of post-operative seizure outcomes can be optimized with the consideration of both interictal and ictal abnormalities.

Indeed, psychophysical data suggest that humans sample acoustic information in extended soundscapes not uniformly, but weigh the evidence at different moments for their perceptual decision at the time scale of about 2 Hz. We here test the critical prediction that such rhythmic perceptual sampling is directly related to the state of ongoing brain activity prior to the stimulus. Human participants judged the direction of frequency sweeps in 1.2 s long soundscapes while their EEG was recorded. We computed the perceptual weights attributed to different epochs within these soundscapes contingent on the phase or power of pre-stimulus EEG activity. This revealed a direct link between 4 Hz EEG phase and power prior to the stimulus and the phase of the rhythmic component of these perceptual weights. Hence, the temporal pattern by which the acoustic information is sampled over time for behavior is directly related to pre-stimulus brain activity in the delta/theta band. These results close a gap in the mechanistic picture linking ongoing delta band activity with their role in shaping the segmentation and perceptual influence of subsequent acoustic information.

Few studies to date have addressed the neural and psychological effects of N,N-dimethyltryptamine alone, either administered intravenously or inhaled in freebase form, and none have been conducted in natural settings. Aims: Our primary aim was to study the acute effects of inhaled N,N-dimethyltryptamine in natural settings, focusing on questions tuned to the advantages of conducting field research, including the effects of contextual factors (i.e. "set" and "setting"), the possibility of studying a comparatively large number of subjects, and the relaxed mental state of participants consuming N,N-dimethyltryptamine in familiar and comfortable settings. Methods: We combined state-of-the-art wireless electroencephalography with psychometric questionnaires to study the neural and subjective effects of naturalistic N,N-dimethyltryptamine use in 35 healthy and experienced participants. Results: We observed that N,N-dimethyltryptamine significantly decreased the power of alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations throughout all scalp locations, while simultaneously increasing power of delta (1-4 Hz) and gamma (30-40 Hz) oscillations. Gamma power increases correlated with subjective reports indicative of some features of mystical-type experiences. N,N-dimethyltryptamine also increased global synchrony and metastability in the gamma band while decreasing those measures in the alpha band. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with previous studies of psychedelic action in the human brain, while at the same time the results suggest potential electroencephalography markers of mystical-type experiences in natural settings, thus highlighting the importance of investigating these compounds in the contexts where they are naturally consumed.

However, while neuroimaging has uncovered the ubiquitous functional relevance of theta rhythms in cognition, there remains a limited set of techniques for externally enhancing and stabilizing theta in the human brain non-invasively. Here, we developed and employed a new phase-synchronized low-intensity electric and magnetic stimulation technique to induce and stabilize narrowband 6-Hz theta oscillations in a group of healthy human adult participants, and then demonstrated how this technique also enhances cognitive processing by assaying working memory. Our findings demonstrate a technological advancement of brain stimulation methods, while also validating the causal link between theta activity and concurrent cognitive behavior, which may ultimately help to not only explain mechanisms, but offer perspectives for restoring deficient theta-band network activity observed in neuropsychiatric diseases.

It remains controversial, however, whether such envelope-tracking neural activity reflects entrainment of neural oscillations or superposition of transient responses evoked by sound features. Recently, it is suggested that the phase of envelope-tracking activity can potentially distinguish entrained oscillations and evoked responses. Here, we analyze the phase of envelope-tracking in humans during passive listening, and observe that the phase lag between cortical activity and speech envelope tends to change linearly across frequency in the theta band (4-8 Hz), suggesting that the theta-band envelope-tracking activity can be readily modeled by evoked responses.

We here probed the link between emotional arousal, a fundamental property of affective experience, and parieto-occipital alpha power under naturalistic stimulation: 37 young healthy adults completed an immersive VR experience, which included rollercoaster rides, while their EEG was recorded. They then continuously rated their subjective emotional arousal while viewing a replay of their experience. The association between emotional arousal and parieto-occipital alpha power was tested and confirmed by (1) decomposing the continuous EEG signal while maximizing the comodulation between alpha power and arousal ratings and by (2) decoding periods of high and low arousal with discriminative common spatial patterns and a long short-term memory recurrent neural network. We successfully combine EEG and a naturalistic immersive VR experience to extend previous findings on the neurophysiology of emotional arousal towards real-world neuroscience. eLife digest Human emotions are complex and difficult to study. It is particularly difficult to study emotional arousal, this is, how engaging, motivating, or intense an emotional experience is. To learn how the human brain processes emotions, researchers usually show emotional images to participants in the laboratory while recording their brain activity. But viewing sequences of photos is not quite like experiencing the dynamic and interactive emotions people face in everyday life. New technologies, such as immersive virtual reality, allow individuals to experience dynamic and interactive situations, giving scientists the opportunity to study human emotions in more realistic settings. These tools could lead to new insights regarding emotions and emotional arousal. Hofmann, Klotzsche, Mariola et al. show that virtual reality can be a useful tool for studying emotions and emotional arousal. In the experiment, 37 healthy young adults put on virtual reality glasses and 'experienced' two virtual rollercoaster rides. During the virtual rides, Hofmann, Klotzsche, Mariola et al. measured the participants' brain activity using a technique called electroencephalography (EEG). Then, the participants rewatched their rides and rated how emotionally arousing each moment was. Three different computer modeling techniques were then used to predict the participant's emotional arousal based on their brain activity. The experiments confirmed the results of traditional laboratory experiments and showed that the brain's alpha waves can be used to predict emotional arousal. This suggests that immersive virtual reality is a useful tool for studying human emotions in circumstances that are more like everyday life. This may make future discoveries about human emotions more useful for real-life applications such as mental health care.

Why, then, do neural and behavioral responses vary across repeated presentations of the same sensory input? Ongoing fluctuations of neu-ronal excitability are currently hypothesized to underlie the trial-by-trial variability in sensory processing. To test this, we capitalized on intracranial electrophysiology in neurosurgical patients performing an auditory discrim-ination task with visual cues: specifically, we examined the interaction between prestimulus alpha oscillations, excitability, task performance, and decoded neural stimulus representations. We found that strong prestimulus oscillations in the alpha + band (i.e., alpha and neighboring frequencies), rather than the aperiodic signal, corre-lated with a low excitability state, indexed by reduced broadband high-frequency activity. This state was related to slower reaction times and reduced neural stimulus encoding strength. We propose that the alpha + rhythm modulates excitability, thereby resulting in variability in behavior and sensory representations despite identical input.

Here, the effect of reduced alertness and active attention to the stimulus on beta rhythm modulation was investigated. Beta rhythm modulation to tactile stimulation of the index finger was recorded simultaneously with MEG and EEG in 23 healthy subjects (mean 23, range 19-35 years). The temporal spectral evolution method was used to obtain the peak amplitudes of beta suppression and rebound in three different conditions (neutral, snooze, and attention). Neither snooze nor attention to the stimulus affected significantly the strength of beta suppression nor rebound, although a decrease in suppression and rebound strength was observed in some subjects with a more pronounced decrease of alertness. The reduction of alertness correlated with the decrease of suppression strength both in MEG (left hemisphere r = 0.49; right hemisphere r = 0.49, *p < 0.05) and EEG (left hemisphere r = 0.43; right hemisphere r = 0.72, **p < 0.01). The results indicate that primary sensorimotor cortex beta suppression and rebound are not sensitive to slightly reduced alertness nor active attention to the stimulus at a group level. Hence, tactile stimulus-induced beta modulation is a suitable tool for assessing the sensorimotor cortex function at a group level. However, subjects' alertness should be maintained high during recordings to minimize individual variability.

Although the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning these impairments remain elusive, it is thought that WM depends on oscillatory interactions within and between nodes of large-scale functional networks. These include the hippocampus and default mode network as well as the prefrontal cortex and frontoparietal central executive network. Here, we review the functional roles of neural oscillations in subserving WM and the putative mechanisms by which epilepsy disrupts normative activity, leading to aberrant oscillatory signatures. We highlight the particular role of interictal epileptic activity, including interictal epileptiform discharges and high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in WM deficits. We also discuss the translational opportunities presented by greater understanding of the oscillatory basis of WM function and dysfunction in epilepsy, including potential targets for neuromodulation.

The perceived passage of time accelerates while working on demanding tasks, whereas time appears to drag during boring situations. Our experiment aimed at investigating whether this relationship is mutual: Can manipulated announcements of elapsed time systematically affect the attentional resources applied to a cognitive task? We measured behavioral performance and the EEG in a whole report working memory paradigm with six items of different colors that each had to be reported after a short delay period. The 32 participants were informed about the current time after each 20 trials, while the clock was running at either 100% (normal), 120% (fast), or 80% (slow) of normal clock speed depending on the experimental block. The mean number of correctly reported colors per trial was significantly increased in the fast as compared to the slow and normal clock conditions. In the EEG, we focused on neural oscillations during working memory encoding and storage. As an electrophysiological correlate of task engagement, frontal theta power during the storage interval was increased in the fast clock condition. Also, the power of frontal theta oscillations predicted the number of correctly reported colors on a single-trial basis. This shows that a covert manipulation of clock speed can lead to an improvement in cognitive performance, presumably mediated by a higher allocation of attentional resources resulting from an adaptation of the subjective passage of time during an experiment.

Recent work based on behavioral measures revealed an entrainment effect of auditory rhythms on motor rhythms. In this study, we propose a method to compute the neural component of such a process from an electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. A simple auditory-motor synchronization paradigm was used, where 28 healthy participants were instructed to synchronize their finger-tapping with a metronome. The computation of the neural outcome measure was carried out in two blocks. In the first block, we used Generalized Eigendecomposition (GED) to reduce the data dimensionality to the component which maximally entrained to the metronome frequency. The scalp topography pointed at brain activity over contralateral sensorimotor regions. In the second block, we computed instantaneous frequency from the analytic signal of the extracted component. This returned a time-varying measure of frequency fluctuations, whose standard deviation provided our "stability index" as a neural outcome measure of auditory-motor coupling. Finally, the proposed neural measure was validated by conducting a correlation analysis with a set of behavioral outcomes from the synchronization task: resultant vector length, relative phase angle, mean asynchrony, and tempo matching. Significant moderate negative correlations were found with the first three measures, suggesting that the stability index provided a quantifiable neural outcome measure of entrainment, with selectivity towards phase-correction mechanisms. We address further adoption of the proposed approach, especially with populations where sensorimotor abilities are compromised by an underlying pathological condition. The impact of using stability index can potentially be used as an outcome measure to assess rehabilitation protocols, and possibly provide further insight into neuropathological models of auditory-motor coupling.

J	Kacar, S				Kacar, Sezgin			A new data-hiding algorithm for multi-channel biomedical signals based on variable-order fractional chaotic neural networks with frequency effect	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS			English	Article							SYSTEM	In this study, a new variable-order fractional chaotic neural network with frequency effect is proposed based on Hopfield Neural Network Under Electromagnetic Radiation, which is used to model brain functions in the literature. The numerical solution of this proposed system is carried out by the Grunwald-Letnikov (G-L) method, and time series and phase portraits are presented. In addition, the chaotic behavior is analyzed by Lyapunov exponent analysis according to the frequency parameter used for the variable-order function. A Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) is designed for data security applications using the obtained state variables and the usability of the PRNG is demonstrated with the NIST-800-22 test. Afterward, a data-hiding algorithm for personal data is presented for multi-channel biomedical signals based on the designed PRNG. With this algorithm, implementations are made for EEG, ECG, and EMG signals. It is shown in time and frequency domains that the method is usable for data-hiding applications. In addition, the effectiveness of the newly developed algorithm is proven with statistical methods.

One of the properties of neural entrainment that is often taken for granted is that its modulatory effect on ongoing oscillations outlasts rhythmic stimulation. We tested the existence of this phenomenon by studying cortical neural oscillations during and after presentation of melodic stimuli in a passive perception paradigm. Melodies were composed of similar to 60 and similar to 80 Hz tones embedded in a 2.5 Hz stream. Using intracranial and surface recordings in male and female humans, we reveal persistent oscillatory activity in the high-gamma band in response to the tones throughout the cortex, well beyond auditory regions. By contrast, in response to the 2.5 Hz stream, no persistent activity in any frequency band was observed. We further show that our data are well captured by a model of damped harmonic oscillator and can be classified into three classes of neural dynamics, with distinct damping properties and eigenfrequencies. This model provides a mechanistic and quantitative explanation of the frequency selectivity of auditory neural entrainment in the human cortex.

To solve this problem, this study developed a novel method called dual-frequency biased coding (DFBC) to tag targets in a SSVEP-based 48-character virtual speller, in which each target is encoded with a permutation sequence consisting of two permuted flickering periods that flash at different frequencies. The proposed paradigm was validated by 11 participants in an offline experiment and 7 participants in an online experiment. Three occipital channels (O1, Oz, and O2) were used to obtain the SSVEP signals for identifying the targets. Based on the coding characteristics of the DFBC method, the proposed approach has the ability of self-correction and thus achieves an accuracy of 76.6% and 79.3% for offline and online experiments, respectively, which outperforms the traditional multiple frequencies sequential coding (MFSC) method. This study demonstrates that DFBC is an efficient method for coding a high number of SSVEP targets with a small number of available frequencies.

These methods include graph theoretic metrics ranging from the micro-scale such as the degree of a node to the macro-scale such as the small worldness of the brain network. However, most of these network models focus on average activity within a time window of interest and given frequency band. Therefore, they cannot capture the changes in network connectivity across time and different frequency bands. Recently, multilayer brain networks have attracted a lot of attention as they can capture the full view of neuronal connectivity. In this paper, we introduce a multilayer view of the functional connectivity network of the brain, where each layer corresponds to a different frequency band. We construct multifrequency connectivity networks from electroencephalogram data where the intra-layer edges are quantified by phase synchrony while the inter-layer edges are quantified by phase-amplitude coupling. We then introduce multilayer degree, participation coefficient and clustering coefficient to quantify the centrality of nodes across frequency layers and to identify the importance of different frequency bands. The proposed framework is applied to electroencephalogram data collected during a study of error monitoring in the human brain.	[Dittman, Zoe; Munia, Tamanna T.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study that has used hyperscanning in Virtual Reality (VR). The aims of this study were; firstly, to replicate results of inter-brain synchrony reported in existing literature for a real world task and secondly, to explore whether the inter-brain synchrony could be elicited in a Virtual Environment (VE). This paper reports on three pilot-studies in two different settings (real-world and VR). Paired participants performed two sessions of a finger-pointing exercise separated by a finger-tracking exercise during which their neural activity was simultaneously recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) hardware. By using Phase Locking Value (PLV) analysis, VR was found to induce similar inter-brain synchrony as seen in the real-world. Further, it was observed that the finger-pointing exercise shared the same neurally activated area in both the real-world and VR. Based on these results, we infer that VR can be used to enhance inter-brain synchrony in collaborative tasks carried out in a VE. In particular, we have been able to demonstrate that changing visual perspective in VR is capable of eliciting inter-brain synchrony. This demonstrates that VR could be an exciting platform to explore the phenomena of inter-brain synchrony further and provide a deeper understanding of the neuroscience of human communication.

Studies have examined the effects of observing fake hand movements after the RHI on brain sensorimotor activity, although results remain controversial. To address these discrepancies, we investigated the effects of observation of fake hand rotation after the RHI on sensorimotor mu (mu: 8-13 Hz) and beta (beta: 15-25 Hz) rhythm event-related desynchronization (ERD) using electroencephalography (EEG). Questionnaire results and proprioceptive drift revealed that the RHI occurred in participants when their invisible hand and fake visible hand were stroked synchronously but not during asynchronous stroking. Independent component (IC) clustering from EEG data during movement observation identified three IC clusters, including the right sensorimotor, left sensorimotor, and left occipital cluster. In the right sensorimotor cluster, we observed distinct modulation of mu and beta ERD during fake hand rotation. Illusory ownership over the fake hand enhanced mu ERD but inversely attenuated beta ERD. Further, the extent of mu ERD correlated with proprioceptive drift, but not with questionnaire ratings, whereas the converse results were obtained for beta ERD. No ownership-dependent ERD modulation was detected in the left sensorimotor cluster. Alpha (alpha: 8-13 Hz) rhythm ERD of the left occipital cluster was smaller in the synchronous condition than in the asynchronous condition, but alpha ERD was not correlated with questionnaire rating or drift. These findings suggest that observing embodied fake hand rotation induces distinct cortical processing in sensorimotor brain areas.

Recognizing motor intention is crucial for realizing BCI rehabilitation training. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) is a kind of electroencephalogram (EEG) inherent characteristics associated with motor intention. However, due to brain deficits poststroke, some patients are not able to generate ERD, which discourages them to be involved in BCI rehabilitation training. To boost ERD during motor imagery (MI), this paper investigates the effects of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on BCI classification performance. Eleven subjects participated in this study. The experiment consisted of two conditions: rTMS + MI versus sham rTMS + MI, which were arranged on different days. MI tests with 64-channel EEG recording were arranged immediately before and after rTMS and sham rTMS. Time-frequency analysis were utilized to measure ERD changes. Common spatial pattern was used to extract features and linear discriminant analysis was used to calculate offline classification accuracies. Paired-sample West and Wilcoxon signed rank tests with post-hoc analysis were used to compare performance before and after stimulation. Statistically stronger ERD (-13.93 +/- 12.99%) was found after real rTMS compared with ERD (-5.71 +/- 21.25% before real rTMS (p<0.05). Classification accuracy after real rTMS (70.71 +/- 10.32%) tended to be higher than that before real rTMS (66.50 +/- 8.48%) (p<0.1). However, no statistical differences were found after sham stimulation. This research provides an effective method in improving BCI performance by utilizing neural modulation.

Methods: We analyzed presurgical intracerebral EEG activity in calcarine and parietal cortices during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in seven patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The time course of the EEG spectral power and NREM vs REM differences was assessed. Sleep spindles were automatically detected. To assess homeostatic dynamics, we considered the first vs second half of the night ratio in the delta frequency range (0.5-4 Hz) and the rise rate of delta activity during the first sleep cycle. Results: While the parietal area showed the classically described NREM and REM sleep hallmarks, the calcarine cortex exhibited a distinctive pattern characterized by: (1) the absence of sleep spindles; (2) a large similarity between EEG power spectra of NREM and REM; and (3) reduced signs of homeostatic dynamics, with a decreased delta ratio between the first and the second half of the night, a reduced rise rate of delta activity during the first NREM sleep cycle, and lack of correlation between these measures. Conclusions: Besides describing for the first time the peculiar sleep EEG pattern in the human calcarine cortex, our findings provide evidence that different cortical areas may exhibit specific sleep EEG pattern, supporting the view of sleep as a local process and promoting the idea that the functional role of sleep EEG features should be considered at a regional level.

However, there is limited understanding of how the oscillatory dynamics accompanying MW states and task-focused states are characterized in clinical populations. In this study, we explored EEG local synchrony of MW associated with schizophrenia, under the premise that changes in attention that arise during MW are associated with a different pattern of brain activity. To this end, we measured the power of EEG oscillations in different frequency bands, recorded while participants watched short video clips. In the group of participants diagnosed with schizophrenia, the power in MW states was significantly lower than during task-focused states, mainly in the frontal and posterior regions. However, in the group of healthy controls, the differences in power between the task-focused and MW states occurred exclusively in the posterior region. Furthermore, the power of the frequency bands during MW and during episodes of task-focused attention correlated with cognitive variables such as processing speed and working memory. These findings on dynamic changes of local synchronization in different frequency bands and areas of the cortex can improve our understanding of mental disorders, such as schizophrenia.

In magneto- and electroencephalography, the most frequently used functional connectivity indices are constructed based on Fourier-based cross-spectral estimation applied to specific fast and band-limited oscillatory regimes. Recently, infraslow arrhythmic fluctuations (below the 1 Hz) were recognized as playing a leading role in spontaneous brain activity. The present work aims to propose to assess functional connectivity from fractal dynamics, thus extending the assessment of functional connectivity to the infraslow arrhythmic or scale-free temporal dynamics of M/EEG-quantified brain activity. Instead of being based on Fourier analysis, new Imaginary Coherence and weighted Phase Lag indices are constructed from complex-wavelet representations. Their performances are first assessed on synthetic data by means of Monte-Carlo simulations, and they are then compared favorably against the classical Fourier-based indices. These new assessments of functional connectivity indices are also applied to MEG data collected on 36 individuals both at rest and during the learning of a visual motion discrimination task. They demonstrate a higher statistical sensitivity, compared to their Fourier counterparts, in capturing significant and relevant functional interactions in the infraslow regime and modulations from rest to task. Notably, the consistent overall increase in functional connectivity assessed from fractal dynamics from rest to task correlated with a change in temporal dynamics as well as with improved performance in task completion, which suggests that the complex-wavelet weighted Phase Lag index is the sole index is able to capture brain plasticity in the infraslow scale-free regime.

Evidence indicates that the facilitation in the detection of multisensory stimuli is modulated by the perceptual load, the amount of information involved in the processing of the stimuli. Here, we used a realistic virtual reality environment while concomitantly acquiring Electroencephalography (EEG) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) to investigate how multisensory signals impact target detection in two conditions, high and low perceptual load. Different multimodal stimuli (auditory and vibrotactile) were presented, alone or in combination with the visual target. Results showed that only in the high load condition, multisensory stimuli significantly improve performance, compared to visual stimulation alone. Multisensory stimulation also decreases the EEG-based workload. Instead, the perceived workload, according to the "NASA Task Load Index" questionnaire, was reduced only by the trimodal condition (i.e., visual, auditory, tactile). This trimodal stimulation was more effective in enhancing the sense of presence, that is the feeling of being in the virtual environment, compared to the bimodal or unimodal stimulation. Also, we show that in the high load task, the GSR components are higher compared to the low load condition. Finally, the multimodal stimulation (Visual-Audio-Tactile-VAT and Visual-Audio-VA) induced a significant decrease in latency, and a significant increase in the amplitude of the P300 potentials with respect to the unimodal (visual) and visual and tactile bimodal stimulation, suggesting a faster and more effective processing and detection of stimuli if auditory stimulation is included. Overall, these findings provide insights into the relationship between multisensory integration and human behavior and cognition.

Emerging evidence shows that HFOs harbor great promise to delineate epileptogenic brain areas and possibly predict the likelihood of seizures. Investigations into HFOs in clinical epilepsy have advanced from small retrospective studies relying on visual identification and correlation analysis to larger prospective assessments using automatic detection and prediction strategies. Although most studies have yielded promising results, some have revealed significant obstacles to clinical application of HFOs, thus raising debate about the reliability and practicality of HFOs as clinical biomarkers. In this review, we give an overview of the current state of HFO research and pinpoint the conceptual and methodological issues that have hampered HFO translation. We highlight recent insights gained from long-term data, high-density recordings, and multicenter collaborations and discuss the open questions that need to be addressed in future research.

However, it remains unclear how these two processes are linked in the context of behavioral change. This is important to investigate, as behavioral change is associated with distinct neural correlates that reflect specific aspects of processing, such as information integration and rule updating. To clarify whether these processes characterize both direct learning and conformity, we elicited the two within the same task, using a role-swapping version of the Ultimatum Game-a fairness paradigm where subjects decide how to share a pot of money with other players-while electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded. Behavioral results showed that subjects decided how to divide the pot based on both direct feedback (seeing whether their past proposals were accepted or rejected) and social observation (copying the splits that others just proposed). Converging EEG evidence revealed that increased centroparietal positivity (P2, P3b, and late positivity) indexed behavioral changes motivated by direct feedback and those motivated by drives to conform. However, exploratory analyses also suggest that these two motivating factors may also be dissociable, and that frontal midline theta oscillations may predict behavioral changes linked to direct feedback but not conformity. Overall, this study provides novel electrophysiological evidence regarding the different forms of behavioral change. These findings are also relevant for understanding the mechanisms of social information processing that underlie successful cooperation.

Although BCIs bring many benefits to the rehabilitation process, their effects are limited since many patients cannot concentrate during training. Despite this outcome post-stroke motor-attention dual-task training using BCIs has remained mostly unexplored. This study was a randomized placebo-controlled blinded-endpoint clinical trial to investigate the effects of a BCI-controlled pedaling training system (BCI-PT) on the motor and cognitive function of stroke patients during rehabilitation. A total of 30 early subacute ischemic stroke patients with hemiplegia and cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to the BCI-PT or traditional pedaling training. We used single-channel Fp1 to collect electroencephalography data and analyze the attention index. The BCI-PT system timely provided visual, auditory, and somatosensory feedback to enhance the patient's participation to pedaling based on the real-time attention index. After 24 training sessions, the attention index of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group. The lower limbs motor function (FMA-L) increased by an average of 4.5 points in the BCI-PT group and 2.1 points in the control group (P = 0.022) after treatments. The difference was still significant after adjusting for the baseline indicators (beta = 2.41, 95%CI: 0.48-4.34, P = 0.024). We found that BCI-PT significantly improved the patient's lower limb motor function by increasing the patient's participation.

There has been a significant advancement in the diagnosis of different epileptic conditions. Therefore, the present work is focused on analyzing the technological advancement and scope of microRNA in the development of effective diagnostic tools and developing effective clinical management of epilepsy.Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, characterized by recurrent seizures, resulting from abnormally synchronized episodic neuronal discharges. Around 70 million people worldwide are suffering from epilepsy. The available antiepileptic medications are capable of controlling seizures in around 60-70% of patients, while the rest remain refractory. Poor seizure control is often associated with neuro-psychiatric comorbidities, mainly including memory impairment, depression, psychosis, neurodegeneration, motor impairment, neuroendocrine dysfunction, etc., resulting in poor prognosis. Effective treatment relies on early and correct detection of epileptic foci. Although there are currently a few well-established diagnostic techniques for epilepsy, they lack accuracy and cannot be applied to patients who are unsupportive or harbor metallic implants. Since a single test result from one of these techniques does not provide complete information about the epileptic foci, it is necessary to develop novel diagnostic tools. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current diagnostic tools of epilepsy, including electroencephalography (EEG) as well as structural and functional neuroimaging. We further discuss recent trends and advances in the diagnosis of epilepsy that will enable more effective diagnosis and clinical management of patients.

J	Demirer, RM; Kesebir, S				Demirer, Rustu Murat; Kesebir, Sermin			The entropy of chaotic transitions of EEG phase growth in bipolar disorder with lithium carbonate	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article								The application of chaos measures the association of EEG signals which allows for differentiating pre and post-medicated epochs for bipolar patients. We propose a new approach on chaos necessary for proof of EEG metastability. Shannon entropies of concealed patterns of Schwarzian derivatives from absolute instantaneous frequency transformations of EEG signals after Hilbert transform are compared and found significantly statistically different between pre and post-medication periods when fitted to von Bertalanffy's functions. Schwarzian dynamics measures was compared at first baseline and then at the end of the first hour of one dose 300 mg lithium carbonate intake for the same subject in depressive patients. With an application of Schwarzian derivative on the prediction of von Bertalanffy's models, integration and segregation of phase growth orbits of neural oscillations can be understood as an influence of chaos on the mixing of frequencies. A phase growth constant parameter was performed to determine the bifurcation parameter of von Bertalanffy's model at each given non-overlapped EEG segment. Schwarzian derivative was sometimes very close positive near the origin but stayed negative for most of the number of segments. Lithium carbonate changed the chaotic invariants of the EEG Schwarzian dynamics and removed sharp boundaries in the bipolar spectrum.

Frontal-midline theta reflects different mechanisms associated with proactive and reactive control of inhibition	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Response inhibition; EEG; fMRI; Proactive control; Frontal-midline theta	SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; STOP-SIGNAL; COGNITIVE CONTROL; CONFLICT; OSCILLATIONS; STIMULATION; NETWORKS; POWER; PERFORMANCE	Reactive control of response inhibition is associated with a right-lateralised cortical network, as well as frontal-midline theta (FM-theta) activity measured at the scalp. However, response inhibition is also governed by proac-tive control processes, and how such proactive control is reflected in FM-theta activity and associated neural source activity remains unclear. To investigate this, simultaneous recordings of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data was performed while participants performed a cued stop-signal task. The cues (0%, 25% or 66%) indicated the likelihood of an upcoming stop-signal in the following trial. Results indicated that participants adjusted their behaviour proactively, with increasing go-trial reaction times following increasing stop-signal probability, as well as modulations of both go-trial and stop-trial accura-cies. Target-locked theta activity was higher in stop-trials than go-trials and modulated by probability. At the single-trial level, cue-locked theta was associated with shorter reaction-times, while target-locked theta was as-sociated with both faster reaction times and higher probability of an unsuccessful stop-trial. This dissociation was also evident at the neural source level, where a joint ICA revealed independent components related to going, stopping and proactive preparation. Overall, the results indicate that FM-theta activity can be dissociated into several mechanisms associated with proactive control, response initiation and response inhibition processes. We propose that FM-theta activity reflects both heightened preparation of the motor control network, as well as stopping-related processes associated with a right lateralized cortical network.

Resting-state EEG Findings in Differentiating Alzheimer's Disease From Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Healthy Elderly Controls	TURKISH JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; mild cognitive impairment; resting-state EEG; delta; theta	DELTA OSCILLATORY RESPONSES; EVENT-RELATED OSCILLATIONS; ASSOCIATION WORKGROUPS; DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINES; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; ALPHA RHYTHMS; VOLUME; SYNCHRONIZATION; RECOMMENDATIONS	Objective: We aimed at investigating alterations in Resting-State electroencephalography (rsEEG) patterns of individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Materials and Methods: Twenty healthy controls (HC) with 20 aMCI, and 20 AD patients were included in the study. EEG data was recorded for 4 minutes of eyes-closed condition according to the International 10-20 system. EEG rhythms of interest were delta (0.5-3.9 Hz), theta (4-7.8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.4 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), and beta (13-30 Hz). The discriminatory power of rsEEG between groups was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic analysis. Correlations among cognitive scores and power values of rsEEG were analyzed using Pearson correlation analysis. Results: We observed effects on delta [F-(2.57): 8.353; p=0.001}, theta [F-(2.57): 5.038; p=0.010}, alpha 1 [F-(2.57): 3.837; p=0.027}, and alpha 2 [F-(2.57): 4.209; p=0.020} power between groups. Moreover, interaction effects for anterior-posterior electrode location x group on delta [F-(6.171): 2.621; p=0.038}, and theta [F-(6.171): 3.537; p=0.020} power were also detected. AD group demonstrated decreased delta power in frontal, central and parietal locations (for all; p<0.040) compared to HC and aMCI groups. In addition, the AD group also had decreased alpha and alpha1 power in comparison with HC (for all; p<0.026). Furthermore, we recorded a sensitivity of 80.0% and a specificity of 80.0% of delta power when using the cut-off score of >1.71 to identify AD from aMCI at central electrodes, and >1.73 to identify AD from HC at parietal electrodes. Moderate correlations were also detected among cognitive scores and rsEEG rhythms. Conclusion: This study revealed the importance of delta and theta activity in rsEEG both as an electrophysiological indicator of cognitive status in AD and as a discriminatory tool for detecting aMCI.

Little is known about to what extent blank-slate learning of new and adjustment of existing behavioural routines rely on different neural and bodily mechanisms. In the current study, participants first acquired novel stimulus-response contingencies, which were subsequently randomly changed to create the need for flexible adjustments. We measured midfrontal theta oscillations via EEG as an indicator of neural conflict processing, as well as heart rate as a proxy of autonomic activity. Participants' trial-wise learning progress was estimated via computation modelling. Theta power and heart rate significantly differed between correct and incorrect trials. Differences between correct and incorrect trials in both neural and cardiac feedback processing were more pronounced for adjustments compared to blank-slate learning. This indicates that both midfrontal and cardiac processing are sensitive to changes in stimulus-response contingencies. Increases in individual learning rates predicted lower impact of performance feedback on midfrontal theta power, but higher impact on heart rate. This suggests that cardiac and midfrontal reactivity are partially reflective of different mechanisms related to feedback learning. Our results shed new light on the role of neural and autonomic mechanisms for learning and behavioural adjustments.

Methods: We analyzed 16 patients with video-polysomnography-confirmed iRBD (age, 65.4 +/- 6.6 years; male, 87.5%) and 10 controls (age, 62.3 +/- 7.5 years; male, 70%). SSs and SOs were automatically detected during stage N2 and N3. We analyzed their characteristics, including density, frequency, duration, and amplitude. We additionally identified SO-locked spindles and examined their phase distribution and phase locking with the corresponding SO. For inter-group comparisons, we used the independent samples t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate. Results: The SOs of iRBD patients had significantly lower amplitude, longer duration (p = 0.005 for both), and shallower slope (p < 0.001) than those of controls. The SS power of iRBD patients was significantly lower than that of controls (p = 0.002), although spindle density did not differ significantly. Furthermore, SO-locked spindles of iRBD patients prematurely occurred during the down-to-up-state transition of SOs, whereas those of controls occurred at the up-state peak of SOs (p = 0.009). The phase of SO-locked spindles showed a positive correlation with delayed recall subscores (p = 0.005) but not with tonic or phasic electromyography activity during REM sleep. Conclusions: In this study, we found abnormal EEG oscillations during NREM sleep in patients with iRBD. The impaired temporal coupling between SOs and SSs may reflect early neurodegenerative changes in iRBD.

J	Miyauchi, E; Kawasaki, M				Miyauchi, Eri; Kawasaki, Masahiro			Behavioural effects of task-relevant neuromodulation by rTMS on giving-up	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; DECISION-MAKING; EEG; THETA; OSCILLATIONS; EXCITABILITY; HANDEDNESS; RUMINATION; ATTENTION	Recent studies suggest that online repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can induce local entrainment of ongoing endogenous oscillatory activity during a task. This effect may impact cognitive performance, depending on the function of the oscillation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of stimulation frequency and target location that are relevant to the cognitive processes of giving-up. We first investigated the correlations between the EEG oscillations and cognitive giving-up processes during problem-solving tasks (Experiment 1). We then conducted online rTMS to examine the frequency-dependent stimulation effects of rTMS on the performance of problem-solving tasks and ongoing oscillations (Experiment 2). The results of Experiment 1 suggested that the frontal theta rhythm is associated with the giving-up processes and that the frontal alpha rhythm is associated with problem-solving behaviour. Accordingly, we hypothesised that rTMS at the theta frequency would induce ongoing theta activity and accelerate the giving-up behaviour, while rTMS at the alpha frequency would induce ongoing alpha activity and slow down the giving-up behaviour in Experiment 2. The results showed that theta-frequency rTMS application induced an increase in theta amplitudes and shortened the giving-up response. Alpha-frequency rTMS application induced an increase in alpha amplitudes, but did not change giving-up responses. Considering the close resemblance between giving-up behaviour and rumination in depression, neuromodulation of cognitive giving-up processes may lead to a new intervention to treat depression by rTMS. Furthermore, this study strengthens the hypothesis that modulating task-relevant oscillations by rTMS could induce behavioural changes related to cognitive performance.

Recent fMRI studies reveal that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) contains grid-like representations. However, the neural mechanisms underlying human vmPFC grid-like representations and their interactions with EC grid activity have remained unknown. We conducted intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from epilepsy patients during a virtual spatial navigation task. Oscillatory theta power in the vmPFC exhibited a sixfold rotational symmetry that was coordinated with grid-like representations in the EC. We found that synchronous theta oscillations occurred between these regions that predicted navigational performance. Analysis of information transfer revealed a unidirectional signal from vmPFC to EC during memory retrieval. Together, this study provides insights into the previously unknown neural signature and functional role of grid-like representations outside the EC and their synchronization with the entorhinal grid during human spatial navigation.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) responses, such as a decrease in frontal alpha and an increase in frontal beta power, have been proposed to reflect stress-related brain activity. However, the stress response is likely composed of different parts such as cognitive effort, time pressure, and social-evaluative threat, which have not been distinguished in previous studies. This distinction, however, is crucial if we aim to establish reliable tools for early detection of stress-related conditions and monitoring of stress responses throughout treatment. This randomized cross-over study (N = 38) aimed to disentangle EEG correlates of stress. With linear mixed models accounting for missing values in some conditions, we found a decrease in frontal alpha and increase in beta power when performing the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT; cognitive effort; n = 32) compared to resting state (n = 33). No change in EEG power was found when the PASAT was performed under time pressure (n = 29) or when adding social-evaluative threat (video camera; n = 29). These findings suggest that frontal EEG power can discriminate stress from resting state but not more fine-grained differences of the stress response.

Passenger-driver behavior from psychological processes can provide insight into the trust levels of the dyad dynamic during an open-road drive. Measuring passenger trust can benefit in speeding up the adoption of self-driving cars. This area has not been fully explored from the passenger's point of view and can yield results that could potentially propel the progress of driver safety systems in autonomous driving. A novel approach to correlating the passenger-driver trust levels can be elicited from brain-based indicators that are extracted from time-locked electroencephalogram (EEG) signals that capture both sensory and cognitive processes. In this paper, we propose a trust identification technique utilizing evoked response potential (ERP) events such as P300 along with beta/alpha frequency ratios from specific passengers during braking, aggressive acceleration, and lane changing scenarios. The results obtained from the decomposition of these EEG signals into the frequency bands and application of machine learning techniques on data collected from frontal and parietal electrodes during these driving events prove the feasibility of this study. By examining additional passenger-driver pairs with varying social interaction and trust profiles in the future, we can strengthen the existence of a cognitive correlation between passenger-driver behavior and thus improve the efficiency of driver safety systems.

They cause the beat perception in the brain. BBs are used in both clinical and basic science applications. Studies in BB literature have mainly focused on linear analysis of the brain signals. Even though these approaches have produced promising findings, there may still be some facets left to be considered, which cannot be studied by linear measures. BBs entrain the brain and generate synchronous responses. Previous studies have proved that increasing brain synchronicity reduced its complexity measured by fractal dimension (FD). In this study, Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD) was used to test whether: 1) BB stimulation decreases the electroencephalogram (EEG) complexity, and 2) HFD is a reliable alternative to its common linear counterpart (i.e., relative power of the band in which the beat frequency lies) in terms of the brain entrainment detection. Results revealed that 3-min BB stimulation significantly decreased the HFD in temporal and parietal lobes, which was about half the time required to probe any changes in EEG power. Moreover, there was significant negative correlation between the relative power and HFD in these regions. In comparison to the relative power, HFD produced mostly higher classification accuracies and areas under empirical receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in these lobes. Our findings suggest that HFD can be a reliable replacement for relative power in terms of entrainment detection and response classification.

A Neural Marker of Speech Intention: Evidence From Contingent Negative Variation	JOURNAL OF SPEECH LANGUAGE AND HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article							WORD PRODUCTION; LEXICAL ACCESS; POTENTIALS; FREQUENCY; TIME; SELECTION; CORRELATE; EEG	Purpose: This study investigated whether changes in brain activity preceding spoken words can be used as a neural marker of speech intention. Specifically, changes in the contingent negative variation (CNV) were examined prior to speech production in three different study designs to determine a method that maximizes signal detection in a speaking task. Method: Electroencephalography data were collected in three different protocols to elicit the CNV in a spoken word task that varied the timing and type of linguistic information. The first protocol provided participants with the word to be spoken before the instruction of whether or not to speak, the second provided both the word and the instruction to speak, and the third provided the instruction to speak before the word. Participants ( N = 18) were split into three groups (one for each protocol) and were instructed to either speak (Go) or refrain from speaking (NoGo) each word according to task instructions. The CNV was measured by analyzing the difference in slope between Go and NoGo trials. Results: Statistically significant effects of hemispheric laterality on the CNV slope confirm the third protocol where the participants know they will speak in advance of the word, as the paradigm that reliably elicits a CNV response related to speech intention. Conclusions: The maximal CNV response when the instruction is known before the word indicates the neural processing measured in this protocol may reflect a generalized speech intention process in which the speech-language systems become prepared to speak and then execute production once the word information is provided. Further analysis of the optimal protocol identified in this study requires additional experimental investigation to confirm its role in eliciting an objective marker of speech intention.

Altered cortical activation associated with mirror overflow driven by non-dominant hand movement in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder	PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Mirror overflow; Event-related desynchronization; Attention-deficit; hyperactivity disorder; Hand skill asymmetry	MOTOR OVERFLOW; CHILDREN; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; INHIBITION; PREVALENCE; ALPHA; SCHIZOPHRENIA; HANDEDNESS; NETWORKS	Mirror overflow is involuntary movement that accompanies unilateral voluntary movement on the opposite side of the body, and is commonly seen in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Children with ADHD show asymmetry in mirror overflow between dominant and non-dominant hand, yet there are competing mechanistic accounts of why this occurs. Using EEG during a sequential, unimanual finger-tapping task, we found that children with ADHD exhibited significantly more mirror overflow than typically developing (TD) controls, especially during the tapping of the non-dominant hand. Furthermore, source-level EEG oscillation analysis revealed that children with ADHD showed decreased alpha (8-12 Hz) event-related desynchronization (ERD) compared with controls in both hemispheres, but only during tapping of the non-dominant hand. Moreover, only the ERD ipsilateral to the mirror overflow during non-dominant hand movement correlated with both magnitude of overflow movements and higher ADHD symptom severity (Conners ADHD Hyperactivity/ Impulsiveness scale) in children with ADHD. TD controls did not show these relationships. Our findings suggest that EEG differences in finger-tapping in ADHD are related primarily to voluntary movement in the nondominant hand. Our results are also consistent with the Ipsilateral Corticospinal Tract (CST) Hypothesis, which posits that the atypical persistence of mirror overflow in ADHD may originate in the sensorimotor areas ipsilateral to mirror overflow and be transmitted via non-decussating CST fibers.

Outliers detection for accurate HRV-seizure baseline estimation using modern numerical	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Heart rate variability; Baseline; Outliers; UFIR smoothing; Colored measurement noise; Time-frequency analysis	ECG	Due to inevitable measurement artifacts, accurate baseline estimation remains an important issue in modern heart rate variability (HRV) analysis with partial epilepsy signals. To detect seizures, the HRV is commonly analyzed as a quasi stationary signal, which is correlated with neuroautonomic activity and considered to be noninvasive. A sudden seizure induces outliers and disturbances to the normal baseline that makes it difficult to provide accurate HRV estimation and outliers classification using the traditional boxplot methodology. A standard strategy to detect outliers implies computing the residuals for the estimated baseline and setting thresholds to extract the first and third quartiles from a histogram. In this work, we analyze modern numerical algorithms developed for HRV-seizure baseline estimation. We also propose a new iterative unbiased finite impulse response (I-UFIR) smoothing algorithm developed for colored measurement noise (CMN) using the backward Euler-based state-space model and show its advantages and shortcomings. A comparison of the estimation algorithms is provided using simulated synthetic and real data. It is demonstrated that the I-UFIR smoother is highly robust against sharp HRV changes that allows removing the outliers with a minimum loss in information. It is also shown that the time-frequency analysis allows analyzing accurately the HRV frequencies, provided that the outliers are removed. All methods are tested by partial seizures records taken from patients during continuous electroencephalography, electrocardiography, and video monitoring.	[Munoz-Minjares, J.

Their functional relevance, however, is still passionately debated. Here, we asked whether endogenous gamma oscillations in the human brain can be entrained by a rhythmic photic drive .50 Hz. Such a noninvasive modulation of endogenous brain rhythms would allow conclusions about their causal involvement in neurocognition. To this end, we systematically investigated oscillatory responses to a rapid sinusoidal flicker in the absence and presence of endogenous gamma oscillations using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in combination with a high-frequency projector. The photic drive produced a robust response over visual cortex to stimulation frequencies of up to 80 Hz. Strong, endogenous gamma oscillations were induced using moving grating stimuli as repeatedly done in previous research. When superimposing the flicker and the gratings, there was no evidence for phase or frequency entrainment of the endogenous gamma oscillations by the photic drive. Unexpectedly, we did not observe an amplification of the flicker response around participants' individual gamma frequencies (IGFs); rather, the magnitude of the response decreased monotonically with increasing frequency. Source reconstruction suggests that the flicker response and the gamma oscillations were produced by separate, coexistent generators in visual cortex. The presented findings challenge the notion that cortical gamma oscillations can be entrained by rhythmic visual stimulation. Instead, the mechanism generating endogenous gamma oscillations seems to be resilient to external perturbation.

J	Barajas, MCO; Guevara, R; Gervain, J				Barajas, Maria Clemencia Ortiz; Guevara, Ramon; Gervain, Judit			The origins and development of speech envelope tracking during the first months of life	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Speech envelope tracking; Speech perception; EEG; Newborns; Infants	LANGUAGE DISCRIMINATION; TEMPORAL ENVELOPE; AUDITORY-CORTEX; PHASE PATTERNS; WORD-ORDER; INFANTS; PERCEPTION; OSCILLATIONS; COMPREHENSION; RESPONSES	When humans listen to speech, their neural activity tracks the slow amplitude fluctuations of the speech signal over time, known as the speech envelope. Studies suggest that the quality of this tracking is related to the quality of speech comprehension. However, a critical unanswered question is how envelope tracking arises and what role it plays in language development. Relatedly, its causal role in comprehension remains unclear, as some studies have found it to be present even for unintelligible speech. Using electroencephalography, we investigated whether the neural activity of newborns and 6-month-olds is able to track the speech envelope of familiar and unfamiliar languages in order to explore the developmental origins and functional role of envelope tracking. Our results show that amplitude and phase tracking take place at birth for familiar and unfamiliar languages alike, i.e. independently of prenatal experience. However, by 6 months language familiarity modulates the ability to track the amplitude of the speech envelope, while phase tracking continues to be universal. Our findings support the hypothesis that amplitude and phase tracking could represent two different neural mechanisms of oscillatory synchronisation and may thus play different roles in speech perception.

This notion is based on the mathematical reality that neural oscillations can only fully synchronize when their peak frequencies form harmonic 2:1 relationships (e.g., f(2) =f(1)/2). Non-harmonic cross-frequency relationships, on the other hand (based on the irrational golden mean 1.618.:1), provide the highest physiologically possible desynchronized state (reducing the occurrence of spurious, noisy, background coupling), and are therefore anticipated to characterize the resting state of the brain, in which no selective information processing takes place. The present study sought to assess whether the transient occurrence of 1.6:1 non-harmonic and 2:1 harmonic relationships between peak frequencies in the alpha (8-14 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) bands - respectively facilitating states of decoupling or coupling between oscillatory rhythms - are impacted by the intranasal administration of a single-dose of oxytocin (OT) or placebo. To do so, continuous resting-state electroencephalography (5 min eyes open, 19 electrodes) was obtained from 96 healthy adult men before and after nasal spray administration. The transient formation of non-harmonic cross-frequency configurations between alpha and theta peak frequencies was significantly increased after OT nasal spray administration, indicating an effect of OT on reducing the intrinsic occurrence of spurious (noisy) background phase synchronizations during resting-state. As a group, the OT group also showed a significant parallel increase in high-frequency and decrease in low-frequency heart rate variability, confirming a homeostatic role of OT in balancing parasympathetic drive. Overall, non-harmonic cross-frequency configurations have been put forward to lay the ground for a healthy neural network allowing the opportunity for an efficient transition from resting state to activity. The observed effects of OT on cross-frequency dynamics are therefore interpreted to reflect a homeostatic role of OT in increasing the signal-to-noise properties of the intrinsic EEG neural frequency architecture, i.e., by precluding the occurrence of `noisy', unwanted, spurious couplings among neural rhythms in the resting brain.

However, recent studies report various and sometimes inconsistent results regarding its capacity to induce changes in cortical activity beyond the stimulation period. Here, thirty healthy volunteers participated in a randomized, cross-over, sham-controlled, double-blind study using EEG to measure the offline effects of tACS on alpha and beta power. Sham and high current density tACS (1 mA; 10 Hz and 20 Hz; 0.32 mA/cm(2)) were applied for 20 min over bilateral sensorimotor areas and EEG was recorded at rest before and after stimulation for 20 min. Bilateral tACS was not associated with significant changes in local alpha and beta power frequencies at stimulation sites (C3 and C4 electrodes). Overall, the present results fail to provide evidence that bilateral tACS with high current density applied over sensorimotor regions at 10 and 20 Hz reliably modulates offline brain oscillation power at the stimulation site. These results may have implications for the design and implementation of future protocols aiming to induce sustained changes in brain activity, including in clinical populations.

Temporal structure of brain oscillations predicts learned nocebo responses to pain	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SCALE DEVELOPMENT; ALPHA; EEG; HYPERALGESIA; EXPECTATION; DYNAMICS; PLACEBO; FEAR; STIMULATION; MECHANISMS	This study aimed to identify electrophysiological correlates of nocebo-augmented pain. Nocebo hyperalgesia (i.e., increases in perceived pain resulting from negative expectations) has been found to impact how healthy and patient populations experience pain and is a phenomenon that could be better understood in terms of its neurophysiological underpinnings. In this study, nocebo hyperalgesia was induced in 36 healthy participants through classical conditioning and negative suggestions. Electroencephalography was recorded during rest (pre- and post-acquisition) and during pain stimulation (baseline, acquisition, evocation) First, participants received baseline high thermal pain stimulations. During nocebo acquisition, participants learned to associate an inert gel applied to their forearm with administered high pain stimuli, relative to moderate intensity control stimuli administered without gel. During evocation, all stimuli were accompanied by moderate pain, to measure nocebo responses to the inert gel. Pre- to post-acquisition beta-band alterations in long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) were negatively associated with nocebo magnitudes. Individuals with strong resting LRTC showed larger nocebo responses than those with weaker LRTC. Nocebo acquisition trials showed reduced alpha power. Alpha power was higher while LRTC were lower during nocebo-augmented pain, compared to baseline. These findings support nocebo learning theories and highlight a role of nocebo-induced cognitive processing.

The aim of the present study was to establish whether eccentricity representation in WM could be decoded from eletroencephalography (EEG) alpha-band oscillation in parietal cortex during delay-period while performing memory-guided saccade (MGS) task. In this regard, we recorded EEG and Eye-tracking signals of 17 healthy volunteers in a variant version of MGS task. We designed the modified version of MGS task for the first time to investigate the effect of locating stimuli in two different positions, in a near (6 degrees) eccentricity and far (12 degrees) eccentricity on saccade error as a behavioral parameter. Another goal of study was to discern whether or not varying the stimuli loci can alter behavioral and eletroencephalographical data while performing the variant version of MGS task. Our findings demonstrate that saccade error for the near fixation condition is significantly smaller than the far from fixation condition. We observed an increase in alpha power in parietal lobe in near vs far conditions. In addition, the results indicate that the increase in alpha (8-12 Hz) power from fixation to memory was negatively correlated with saccade error. The novel approach of using simultaneous EEG/Eye-tracking recording in the modified MGS task provided both behavioral and electroencephalographic analyses for oscillatory activity during this new version of MGS task.

This has led to the exploration of alternative sound perception methods involving training of vibrotactile discrimination of sounds within the language spectrum. In particular, stimulus duration plays an important role in linguistic categorical perception. We comparatively evaluated vibrotactile temporal discrimination of sound and how specific training can modify the underlying electrical brain activity. Fifteen profoundly deaf (PD) and 15 normal-hearing (NH) subjects performed a vibrotactile oddball task with simultaneous EEG recording, before and after a short training period (5 one-hour sessions; in 2.5-3 weeks). The stimuli consisted of 700 Hz pure-tones with different duration (target: long 500 ms; non-target: short 250 ms). The sound-wave stimuli were delivered by a small device worn on the right index finger. A similar behavioral training effect was observed in both groups showing significant improvement in sound-duration discrimination. However, quantitative EEG measurements reveal distinct neurophysiological patterns characterized by higher and more diffuse delta band magnitudes in the PD group, together with a generalized decrement in absolute power in both groups that might reflect a facilitating process associated to learning. Furthermore, training-related changes were found in the beta-band in NH. Findings suggest PD have different cognitive adaptive mechanisms which are not a mere amplification effect due to greater cortical excitability.

Current findings and perspectives on aberrant neural oscillations in schizophrenia	PSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCES			English	Review						EEG; MEG; neural oscillation; schizophrenia	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; GLUTAMIC-ACID DECARBOXYLASE; RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; DENDRITIC SPINE DENSITY; STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; TO-NOISE RATIO; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; FIRST-EPISODE	There is now consistent evidence that neural oscillation at low- and high-frequencies constitute an important aspect of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Specifically, impaired rhythmic activity may underlie the deficit to generate coherent cognition and behavior, leading to the characteristic symptoms of psychosis and cognitive deficits. Importantly, the generating mechanisms of neural oscillations are relatively well-understood and thus enable the targeted search for the underlying circuit impairments and novel treatment targets. In the following review, we will summarize and assess the evidence for aberrant rhythmic activity in schizophrenia through evaluating studies that have utilized Electro/Magnetoencephalography to examine neural oscillations during sensory and cognitive tasks as well as during resting-state measurements. These data will be linked to current evidence from post-mortem, neuroimaging, genetics, and animal models that have implicated deficits in GABAergic interneurons and glutamatergic neurotransmission in oscillatory deficits in schizophrenia. Finally, we will highlight methodological and analytical challenges as well as provide recommendations for future research.

On the other hand, dynamic changes in microstructure and activity are reflected in the EEG, for instance slow oscillation (SO) slope can reflect synaptic strength. SO-spindle coupling is a measure for neural communication. It was previously associated with memory consolidation, but also shown to reveal strong interindividual differences. In studies, weak electric current stimulation has modulated brain rhythms and memory retention. Here, we investigate whether SO-spindle coupling and SO slope during baseline sleep are associated with (predictive of) stimulation efficacy on retention performance. Methods: Tirrenty-five healthy subjects participated in three experimental sessions. Sleep-associated memory consolidation was measured in two sessions, in one anodal transcranial direct current stimulation oscillating at subjects individual SO frequency (so-tDCS) was applied during nocturnal sleep. The third session was without a learning task (baseline sleep). The dependence on SO-spindle coupling and SO-slope during baseline sleep of so-tDCS efficacy on retention performance were investigated. Results: Stimulation efficacy on overnight retention of declarative memories was associated with nesting of slow spindles to SO trough in deep nonrapid eye movement baseline sleep. Steepness and direction of SO slope in baseline sleep were features indicative for stimulation efficacy. Conclusions: Findings underscore a functional relevance of activity during the SO up-to-down state transition for memory consolidation and provide support for distinct consolidation mechanisms for types of declarative memories.

Digital electroencephalographic (EEG) analyses provide essential knowledge on sleep in the spider monkey. Recently, specific EEG bands related to sleep in these animals have been obtained using principal component analysis, but the exact spatio-temporal distribution of these EEG bands in this species has not yet been analyzed. This study determined the topographic distribution of the EEG spectral power of ad hoc broad bands during rapid eye movement sleep, nonrapid eye movement sleep, and wakefulness. Superficial EEG activity was obtained from the occipital, frontal, and central areas of six young adult male monkeys housed in a laboratory. During wakefulness, occipital areas showed high absolute power in the 1-3, 3-12, and 11-30 Hz ranges, while during nonrapid eye movement 1 sleep the highest absolute power was in the 13-30 Hz range. During nonrapid eye movement 3 sleep, frontal and central areas showed a high absolute power in the 18-19 Hz range. Finally, the right central area showed a high absolute power in the 20-30 Hz range during rapid eye movement sleep. This topographic distribution of EEG bands could represent the brain organization required for arousal and mnemonic processing during sleep in the spider monkey.

Recently, a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence that utilizes a variant of the rotary saturation approach has been suggested to detect weak transient magnetic field oscillations generated by neuronal currents in humans with epilepsy. Hypothesis/Objectives Effects on the magnetic field evoked by intrinsic epileptic activity can be detected by MRI in the canine brain. As proof-of-concept, the novel MRI sequence to detect neuronal currents was applied in dogs. Animals Twelve dogs with IE and 5 control dogs without a history of epileptic seizures were examined. Methods Prospective case-control study as proof-of-concept. All dogs underwent a clinical neurological examination, scalp electroencephalography, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and MRI. The MRI examination included a spin-locking (SL) experiment applying a low-power on-resonance radiofrequency pulse in a predefined frequency domain in the range of oscillations generated by the epileptogenic tissue. Results In 11 of 12 dogs with IE, rotary saturation effects were detected by the MRI sequence. Four of 5 control dogs did not show rotary saturation effects. One control dog with a diagnosis of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis had SL-related effects, but did not have epileptic seizures clinically. Conclusions and Clinical Importance The proposed MRI method detected neuronal currents in dogs with epileptic seizures and represents a potential new line of research to investigate neuronal currents possibly related to IE in dogs.

This is particularly important in the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), where feed forward systems gather data from imagined brain activity and then send that information to an effector. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a computational approach that enables an accurate mapping of spatial brain activity (fMRI) in relation to the temporal receptors (EEG electrodes) associated with imagined lower limb movement. New method: EEG and fMRI data from 16 healthy, male participants while imagining lower limb movement were used for this purpose. A combined analysis of fMRI data and EEG electrode locations was developed to identify EEG electrodes with a high likelihood of capturing imagined lower limb movement originating from various clusters of brain activity. This novel feature selection tool was used to develop an artificial neural network model to classify right and left lower limb movement. Results: Results showed that left versus right lower limb imagined movement could be classified with 66.5% accuracy using this approach. Comparison with existing methods: Adopting a purely data-driven approach for feature selection to use in the right/left classification task resulted in the same accuracy (66.6%) but with reduced interpretability. Conclusions: The developed fMRI-informed EEG approach could pave the way towards improved brain computer interfaces for lower limb movement while also being applicable to other systems where fMRI could be helpful to inform EEG acquisition and processing.

Prediction of treatment response leads to an increase in patient compliance and a decrease in morbidity. To decrease the treatment resistance rates, valid and useful instruments have been searched. Quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) based markers have been objective predictors of the treatment response in psychiatric disorders. Aim: This retrospective pilot study aims to explore QEEG as a biomarker to predict early response to paroxetine in OCD patients. Method: Resting state QEEG and Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) were administered to 30 drug-free OCD patients without comorbidity. After maximum 12-week of treatment with paroxetine, patients with and without an early improvement were classified based on at least a 35% reduction in Y-BOCS scores. Pretreatment QEEG data were compared between the two groups. Results: Pre-treatment gamma, gamma 1 and gamma 2 oscillations were significantly higher in OCD patients who did not show an early improvement. Conclusion: These preliminary results indicate that gamma oscillations could be acknowledged as the electrophysiological predictors of early clinical outcomes of OCD patients during paroxetine treatment.

Subjects were passively viewing 128 static and dynamic facial expressions of female and male actors and their respective avatars in neutral or fearful conditions. Event-related potentials (ERPs), as well as alpha and theta event-related synchronization and desynchronization (ERD/ERS), were derived from the EEG that was recorded during the task. All ERP features, except for the very early N100, differed in their response to avatar and actor faces. Whereas the N170 showed differences only for the neutral avatar condition, later potentials (N300 and LPP) differed in both emotional conditions (neutral and fear) and the presented agents (actor and avatar). In addition, we found that the avatar faces elicited significantly stronger reactions than the actor face for theta and alpha oscillations. Especially theta EEG frequencies responded specifically to visual emotional stimulation and were revealed to be sensitive to the emotional content of the face, whereas alpha frequency was modulated by all the stimulus types. We can conclude that the computerized avatar faces affect both, ERP components and ERD/ERS and evoke neural effects that are different from the ones elicited by real faces. This was true, although the avatars were replicas of the human faces and contained similar characteristics in their expression.

Effect of Wrist Tapping on Interhemispheric Coherence in Patients with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						interhemispheric coherence; electroencephalography; epilepsy; wrist tapping		The aim of this study was to assess the dynamics of interhemispheric coherence (IC) as an indicator of integration of different areas of the brain and their participation in the performance of certain functions before and after wrist tapping (WT), using the author's method in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Methods and Results: The study included 81 subjects of working age, including 51 clinically healthy volunteers (median age of 39[21;56] years) and 30 patients (median age of 27[23;38] years) with JME. Analysis of IC in the electrode pairs Fp1-Fp2, F3-F4, C3-C4, T3-T4 was performed using a computer encephalographic complex. A coherent EEG analysis was used to identify and evaluate the relationships between different areas of the brain. Based on the change in the coherence coefficients (CCs), the level of integrative activity of brain structures was quantified. In healthy volunteers, before and after WT, we observed a statistically significant decrease in CCs for the beta-1 band in the pairs Fp1-Fp2, F3-F4, and C3-C4 (P<0.05), while in the pair T3-T4, changes in CCs were not statistically significant (P>0.05). At the same time, a statistically significant decrease in CCs in the alpha band was found only in the frontal regions in the pairs Fp1-Fp2 and F3-F4 (P<0.05). No statistically significant changes were found in all the studied pairs in the theta band. When comparing CCs in JME patients in beta-1 and theta bands, before and after WT, we did not find statistically significant changes in CCs in all the studied electrode pairs. However, in the alpha band, we found a statistically significant decrease in CCs in the frontal region in the F3-F4 (P=0.0038) and C3-C4 electrode pairs (P=0.034). The results of the study of interhemispheric integration showed statistically significant differences between patients with JME and the control group. Conclusion: WT according to the author's method does not provoke the occurrence of interictal epileptiform discharges on the EEG and epileptic seizures in patients with JME. Coherent analysis showed positive changes in interhemispheric integrations of neurons in the beta-1 and alpha frequency ranges, mainly in the anterior hemispheres.

Pharmacological studies suggest that melatonin promotes prompt sleep installation through interaction with GABA receptors, and that it is associated with acute suppression of neural electrical activity. Nevertheless, melatonin's effects on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity related to REM sleep onset in AD patients have not been analyzed. Thus, in this pilot study we analyzed the effects of melatonin on EEG activity during the first episode of REM sleep in eight patients treated with 5-mg of fast-release melatonin. Methods: During a single-blind, placebo-controlled study, polysomnographic recordings were obtained from frontal, central, temporal, and occipital scalp derivations. REM sleep latency, as well as the relative power (RP) and EEG coherences of six EEG bands, were compared between the placebo and melatonin conditions. Results: Results showed that melatonin intake in AD patients decreased REM sleep onset, and that this was associated with lower RP and coherence of the beta and gamma EEG bands. Discussion: The possibility that the inhibitory GABAergic pathways related to REM sleep generation are well-preserved in mild-to-moderate AD is discussed. We conclude that the short REM sleep onset related to melatonin intake in AD patients is associated with a significant decrease in both RP and EEG coherence, mainly in the fast frequencies.

The diversity in their morphologies, their strengths, and their sources within the brain cause a great deal of uncertainty in their labeling by clinicians. The aim of this study is therefore to exploit and incorporate this uncertainty (the probability of the waveform being an IED) in the IED detection system which combines spatial component analysis (SCA) with the IED probabilities referred to as SCA-IEDP-based method. For comparison, we also propose and study SCA-based method in which probability of the waveform being an IED is ignored. The proposed models are employed to detect IEDs in two different classification approaches: (1) subject-dependent and (2) subject-independent classification approaches. The proposed methods are compared with two other state-of-the-art methods namely, time-frequency features and tensor factorization methods. The proposed SCA-IEDP model has achieved superior performance in comparison with the traditional SCA and other competing methods. It achieved 79.9% and 63.4% accuracy values in subject-dependent and subject-independent classification approaches, respectively. This shows that considering the IED probabilities in designing an IED detection system can boost its performance.

However, it is unknown what is the difference in the brain connectivity between top athletes with long-term professional trainings and age-matched controls. Here we ask whether long-term training can lower brain-wiring cost while have better performance. Since elite swimming requires athletes to move their arms and legs at different tempos in time with high coordination skills, we selected an eye-hand-foot complex reaction (CR) task to examine the relations between the task performance and the brain connections and activities, as well as to explore the energy cost-efficiency of top athletes. Twenty-one master-level professional swimmers and 23 age-matched non-professional swimmers as controls were recruited to perform the CR task with concurrent 8-channel EEG recordings. Reaction time and accuracy of the CR task were recorded. Topological network analysis of various frequency bands was performed using the phase lag index (PLI) technique to avoid volume conduction effects. The wiring number of connections and mean frequency were calculated to reflect the wiring and activity cost, respectively. Results showed that professional athletes demonstrated better eye-hand-foot coordination than controls when performing the CR task, indexing by faster reaction time and higher accuracy. Comparing to controls, athletes' brain demonstrated significantly less connections and weaker correlations in upper beta frequency band between the frontal and parietal regions, while demonstrated stronger connectivity in the low theta frequency band between sites of F3 and Cz/C4. Additionally, athletes showed highly stable and low eye-blinking rates across different reaction performance, while controls had high blinking frequency with high variance. Elite athletes' brain may be characterized with energy efficient sparsely wiring connections in support of superior motor performance and better cognitive performance in the eye-hand-foot complex reaction task.

However, extraction of the features from non-linear and non-stationary EEG signals is still a challenging task in current algorithms. With the development of artificial intelligence, various advanced algorithms have been proposed for signal classification in recent years. Among them, deep neural networks (DNNs) have become the most attractive type of method due to their end-to-end structure and powerful ability of automatic feature extraction. However, it is difficult to collect large-scale datasets in practical applications of BCIs, which may lead to overfitting or weak generalizability of the classifier. To address these issues, a promising technique has been proposed to improve the performance of the decoding model based on data augmentation (DA). In this article, we investigate recent studies and development of various DA strategies for EEG classification based on DNNs. The review consists of three parts: what kind of paradigms of EEG-based on BCIs are used, what types of DA methods are adopted to improve the DNN models, and what kind of accuracy can be obtained. Our survey summarizes the current practices and performance outcomes that aim to promote or guide the deployment of DA to EEG classification in future research and development.

Ripples reflect a spectrum of synchronous spiking activity in human anterior temporal lobe	ELIFE			English	Article						ripple oscillations; single unit activity; episodic memory; anterior temporal lobe; Human	HIGH-FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; EPISODIC MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA; THETA; RHYTHMS; POWER; COMMUNICATION; INTERNEURONS; MECHANISMS	Direct brain recordings have provided important insights into how high-frequency activity captured through intracranial EEG (iEEG) supports human memory retrieval. The extent to which such activity is comprised of transient fluctuations that reflect the dynamic coordination of underlying neurons, however, remains unclear. Here, we simultaneously record iEEG, local field potential (LFP), and single unit activity in the human temporal cortex. We demonstrate that fast oscillations within the previously identified 80-120 Hz ripple band contribute to broadband high-frequency activity in the human cortex. These ripple oscillations exhibit a spectrum of amplitudes and durations related to the amount of underlying neuronal spiking. Ripples in the macro-scale iEEG are related to the number and synchrony of ripples in the micro-scale LFP, which in turn are related to the synchrony of neuronal spiking. Our data suggest that neural activity in the human temporal lobe is organized into transient bouts of ripple oscillations that reflect underlying bursts of spiking activity.

This study tests the novel prediction that orienting search focus benefits goal-relevant retrieval by reducing competition from unwanted memories. In a modified retrieval-practice paradigm, participants encoded word-pairs in one of two encoding tasks. Critically, to evaluate whether this retrieval orientation (RO) reduces memory interference, target and competitor memories were always related to different encoding tasks. At retrieval, instructions were provided for half of the blocks with the intention to bias remembering towards items encoded with one of the ROs. Behav-ioural data show that adopting an RO improved target accessibility, strengthened the testing effect, and reduced retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF) of competitors. Specifically, RIF ? typically attributed to inhibitory control of memory interference ? was prominent when no retrieval orientation (NRO) instruction was provided. Further-more, a neural correlate of RO was calculated by training a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to discriminate the electroencephalographic (EEG) spatial brain patterns correspondent to the two ROs over the time course of selective retrieval. RO was characterised by increases in the theta and decreases in the beta frequency band, evident both before and after category-cue onset. While the pre-cue RO reinstatement effect predicted both immediate retrieval-practice success and later target accessibility, the post-cue effect predicted disengagement of inhibitory control, such that participants showing a stronger RO reinstatement effect showed lower levels of RIF. These data suggest that strategically orienting search focus during retrieval both increases target memory accessibility and reduces memory interference, which consequently protects related memories from inhibition and later forgetting. Furthermore, they also highlight the roles of theta and beta oscillations in establishing and maintaining a task-relevant bias towards target memory representations during competitive memory retrieval.

Spontaneous alpha power, which plays an important role in shaping responsivity to sensory information, is reduced across the lifespan in individuals with ASD. Furthermore, an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance has also been linked to sensory dysfunction in ASD and has been hypothesized to underlie atypical patterns of spontaneous brain activity. The present study examined whether resting-state alpha power differed in children with ASD as compared to TD children, and investigated the relationships between alpha levels, concentrations of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, and atypical sensory processing in ASD. Methods: Participants included thirty-one children and adolescents with ASD and thirty-one age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) participants. Resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) was used to obtain measures of alpha power. A subset of participants (ASD = 16; TD = 16) also completed a magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) protocol in order to measure concentrations of excitatory (glutamate + glutamine; Glx) and inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmitters. Results: Children with ASD evidenced significantly decreased resting alpha power compared to their TD peers. MRS estimates of GABA and Glx did not differ between groups with the exception of Glx in the temporal-parietal junction. Inter-individual differences in alpha power within the ASD group were not associated with region-specific concentrations of GABA or Glx, nor were they associated with sensory processing differences. However, atypically decreased Glx was associated with increased sensory impairment in children with ASD. Conclusions: Although we replicated prior reports of decreased alpha power in ASD, atypically reduced alpha was not related to neurochemical differences or sensory symptoms in ASD. Instead, reduced Glx in the temporal-parietal cortex was associated with greater hyper-sensitivity in ASD. Together, these findings may provide insight into the neural underpinnings of sensory processing differences present in ASD.

This study characterized the electroencephalographic correlation (rEEG) between prefrontal and parietal cortices in young men while solving logical-mathematical problems after 18 sessions of cognitive training. Method. Two training groups were formed: one trained with gradually increased complexity (CT), the other with no increase in complexity (ST). Results. CT had a greater number of correct responses in the post-training evaluation than ST and showed a higher correlation between the left frontopolar-parietal cortices in almost all EEG bands, and between the dorsolateral-parietal cortices in the alphal band while solving math problems post training. Results suggest that major functional synchronization between the left prefrontal and parietal cortices plays an important role in improving mathematical problem-solving after cognitive training.

In this present cross-sectional study, we aimed to search for neural networks with electroencephalography whose frequency-specific actions may predict bradykinesia. Methods: Twenty Parkinsonian patients treated with bilateral subthalamic stimulation were first prescreened while we selected four levels of contralateral stimulation (0: OFF, 1-3: decreasing symptoms to ON state) individually, based on kinematics. In the screening period, we performed 64-channel electroencephalography measurements simultaneously with electromyography and motion detection during a resting state, finger tapping, hand grasping tasks, and pronation-supination of the arm, with the four levels of contralateral stimulation. We analyzed spectral power at the low (13-20 Hz) and high (21-30 Hz) beta frequency bands and low (31-60 Hz) and high (61-100 Hz) gamma frequency bands using the dynamic imaging of coherent sources. Structural equation modelling estimated causal relationships between the slope of changes in network beta and gamma activities and the slope of changes in bradykinesia measures. Results: Activity in different subnetworks, including predominantly the primary motor and premotor cortex, the subthalamic nucleus predicted the slopes in amplitude and speed while switching between stimulation levels. These subnetwork dynamics on their preferred frequencies predicted distinct types and parameters of the movement only on the contralateral side. Discussion: Concurrent subnetworks affected in bradykinesia and their activity changes in the different frequency bands are specific to the type and parameters of the movement; and the primary motor and premotor cortex are common nodes.

Clinical improvement is related to changes in brain circuits, which have preferred resonant frequencies (RFs) and vary across individuals. Objective: We developed a novel rTMS-electroencephalography (rTMS-EEG) interrogation paradigm to identify RFs using the association of power/connectivity measures with symptom severity and treatment outcome. Methods: 35 subjects underwent rTMS interrogation at 71 frequencies ranging from 3 to 17 Hz admin-istered to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). rTMS-EEG was used to assess resonance in oscil-latory power/connectivity changes (phase coherence [PC], envelope correlation [EC], and spectral correlation coefficient [SCC]) after each frequency. Multiple regression was used to detect relationships between 10 Hz resonance and baseline symptoms as well as clinical improvement after 10 sessions of 10 Hz rTMS treatment. Results: Baseline symptom severity was significantly associated with SCC resonance in left sensorimotor (SM; p < 0.0004), PC resonance in fronto-parietal (p = 0.001), and EC resonance in centro-posterior channels (p = 0.002). Subjects significantly improved with 10 sessions of rTMS treatment. Only decreased SCC SM resonance was significantly associated with clinical improvement (r = 0.35, p = 0.04). Subjects for whom 10 Hz SM SCC was highly ranked as an RF among all stimulation frequencies had better outcomes from 10 Hz treatment. Conclusions: Resonance of 10 Hz stimulation measured using SCC correlated with both symptom severity and improvement with 10 Hz rTMS treatment. Research should determine whether this interrogation paradigm can identify individualized rTMS treatment frequencies. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Cognitive control can be assessed by time-frequency decompositions of electrophysiological data. We aimed to clarify neuroelectric mechanisms of performance monitoring in connection with impulsiveness during a modified Eriksen flanker task in high- (n = 24) and low-impulsive subjects (n = 21) and whether these are modulated by double-blind, sham-controlled intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS). We found a larger error-specific peri-response beta power decrease over fronto-central sites in high-impulsive compared to low-impulsive participants, presumably indexing less effective motor execution processes. Lower parieto-occipital theta intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) preceding correct responses predicted higher reaction time (RT) and higher RT variability, potentially reflecting efficacy of cognitive control or general attention. Single-trial preresponse theta phase clustering was coupled to RT in correct trials (weighted ITPC), reflecting oscillatory dynamics that predict trial-specific behavior. iTBS did not modulate behavior or EEG time-frequency power. Performance monitoring was associated with time-frequency patterns reflecting cognitive control (parieto-occipital theta ITPC, theta weighted ITPC) as well as differential action planning/execution processes linked to trait impulsivity (frontal low beta power). Beyond that, results suggest no stimulation effect related to response-locked time-frequency dynamics with the current stimulation protocol. Neural oscillatory responses to performance monitoring differ between high- and low-impulsive individuals, but are unaffected by iTBS.

To verify this assumption, 43 students aged 18-25 were recruited as the research subjects. Their intelligence quotients (IQ) were scored by using Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), while their electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded simultaneously by using Neuroscan system. The total energy and distribution patterns of EEG signals were acquired in Curry 8.0. The intensities of information flow across different brain regions were measured by Phase Slope Index (PSI). 20 channels and 190 channel combinations were selected for data analysis. The results show that the IQ score negatively correlates to the EEG energy and positively correlates to the intensities of information flows at specific frequency bands in specific channel pairs, especially in some long distance (18-24cm) channel pairs.

Altered neural oscillations and behavior in a genetic mouse model of NMDA receptor hypofunction	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							STEADY-STATE RESPONSE; GLUTAMATERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION; NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; PARVALBUMIN NEURONS; ARC EXPRESSION; D-SERINE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; GAMMA; KETAMINE; MICE	Abnormalities in electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers occur in patients with schizophrenia and those clinically at high risk for transition to psychosis and are associated with cognitive impairment. Converging evidence suggests N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction plays a central role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and likely contributes to biomarker impairments. Thus, characterizing these biomarkers is of significant interest for early diagnosis of schizophrenia and development of novel treatments. We utilized in vivo EEG recordings and behavioral analyses to perform a battery of electrophysiological biomarkers in an established model of chronic NMDAR hypofunction, serine racemase knockout (SRKO) mice, and their wild-type littermates. SRKO mice displayed impairments in investigation-elicited gamma power that corresponded with reduced short-term social recognition and enhanced background (pre-investigation) gamma activity. Additionally, SRKO mice exhibited sensory gating impairments in both evoked-gamma power and event-related potential amplitude. However, other biomarkers including the auditory steady-state response, sleep spindles, and state-specific power spectral density were generally neurotypical. In conclusion, SRKO mice demonstrate how chronic NMDAR hypofunction contributes to deficits in certain translationally-relevant EEG biomarkers altered in schizophrenia. Importantly, our gamma band findings suggest an aberrant signal-to-noise ratio impairing cognition that occurs with NMDAR hypofunction, potentially tied to impaired task-dependent alteration in functional connectivity.

It is one of the most important diagnostic methods in sleep research and must be carried out with a high degree of accuracy because any errors in the scoring in the patient's sleep EEG recordings can cause serious problems. The aim of this research is to develop a new automatic method for detecting the most important characteristics in sleep stage 2 such as k-complexes based on multi-domain features. In this study, each EEG signal is divided into a set of segments using a sliding window technique. Based on extensive experiments during the training phase, the size of the sliding window is set to 0.5 s (s). Then a set of statistical, fractal, frequency and non-linear features are extracted from each epoch based on the time domain, Katz's algorithm, power spectrum density (PSD) and tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT). As a result, a vector of twenty-two features is obtained to represent each EEG segment. In order to detect k-complexes, the extracted features were analysed for their ability to detect the k-complex waveforms. Based on the analysis of the features, twelve out of twenty-two features are selected and forwarded to a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier to identify k-complexes in EEG signals. A set of various classification techniques of K-means and extreme learning machine classifiers are used to compare the obtained results and to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.The experimental results showed that the proposed method, based on multi-domain features, achieved better recognition results than other methods and classifiers. An average accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 97.7 %, 97 %, and 94.2 % were obtained, respectively, with the CZ-A1 channel according to the R&K standard. The experimental results with high classification performance demonstrated that the technique can help doctors optimize the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders.

VP and VI are defined as a changing of brain signals when perceiving and memorizing visual information, respectively. These paradigms could be alternatives to the previous visual-based paradigms which have limitations such as fatigue and low information transfer rates. In this study, we analyzed VP and VI to investigate the possibility to control BCI. First, we conducted a time-frequency analysis with event-related spectral perturbation. In addition, two types of decoding accuracies were obtained with convolutional neural network to verify whether the brain signals can be distinguished from each class in the VP and whether they can be differentiated with VP and VI paradigms. As a result, the 6-class classification performance in VP was 32.56% (+/- 7.07) and the binary classification performance which classifies two paradigms was 90.16% (+/- 9.69).

The dynamic changes of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) indices during sleep also exhibit quasi-cyclic trends that appear to correlate with SWA. This article proposes a model to characterize the relationship between SWA, HR and HRV in the polar-coordinate (r-O) domain. Polar coordinates are particularly well-suited to model cyclic shapes with simple (linear) equations in the r-O plane. Group-level analyses and individual-level ones of the correlations between the polar-coordinate transformations of SWA and HR reveal R-2 values of 0.99 and 0.95 respectively.

Altered sleep spindles and slow waves during space shuttle missions	NPJ MICROGRAVITY			English	Article							RAPID-EYE-MOVEMENT; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS; DEPENDENT IMPROVEMENT; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; SHORT-TERM; K-COMPLEX; EEG; PERFORMANCE	Sleep deficiencies and associated performance decrements are common among astronauts during spaceflight missions. Previously, sleep in space was analyzed with a focus on global measures while the intricate structure of sleep oscillations remains largely unexplored. This study extends previous findings by analyzing how spaceflight affects characteristics of sleep spindles and slow waves, two sleep oscillations associated with sleep quality and quantity, in four astronauts before, during and after two Space Shuttle missions. Analysis of these oscillations revealed significantly increased fast spindle density, elevated slow spindle frequency, and decreased slow wave amplitude in space compared to on Earth. These results reflect sleep characteristics during spaceflight on a finer electrophysiological scale and provide an opportunity for further research on sleep in space.

This study examined whether (1) midfrontal theta oscillations similarly support conflict monitoring in children and adults, and (2) performance monitoring difficulty influences conflict monitoring and resolution. Children (n = 25) and adults (n = 24) completed a flanker task with fair or rigged response feedback. Relative to adults, children showed a smaller congruency effect on midfrontal theta power, overall lower midfrontal theta power and coherence, and (unlike adults) no correlation between midfrontal theta power and N2 amplitude, suggesting that reduced neural communication efficiency contributes to less efficient conflict monitoring in children than adults. In both age groups, response feedback fairness affected response times and the P3, but neither midfrontal theta oscillations nor the N2, indicating that performance monitoring difficulty influenced conflict resolution but not conflict monitoring.

Postdiction has been reported in all sensory modalities, but its neural underpinnings remain poorly understood. In the rabbit illusion, a sequence of nonequidistant stimuli presented isochronously is perceived as equidistantly spaced. This illusion might be driven by an internal prior favoring a constant-speed motion. Here, we hypothesized that prestimulus alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz), known to correlate with perceptual expectations and biases, would reflect the degree to which perceptual reports are influenced by a constant-speed prior. Human participants were presented with ambiguous visual sequences while being recorded simultaneously with MEG and EEG: the same sequences yielded an illusory perception in about half the trials, allowing contrasting brain responses elicited by identical sequences causing distinct percepts. As a proxy of an individual's prior, we used the percentage of perceived illusion and the detection criterion, assuming that a strong constant-speed prior would result in a higher rate of illusory percepts. We found that high frontoparietal alpha power was associated with perceiving the sequence according to the individual's prior: participants with high susceptibility to the illusion would report the illusion, while participants with low susceptibility would report the veridical sequence. Additionally, we found that prestimulus alpha phase in occipitoparietal regions dissociated illusion from no-illusion trials. We interpret our results as suggesting that alpha power reflects an individual's constant-speed prior, whereas alpha phase modulates sensory uncertainty.

Recent work has suggested that these difficulties are related to individual differences in brain function, including verbal working memory and the degree of cross-modal reorganization of auditory areas for visual processing. However, the neural basis for these relationships is not fully understood. Here, we investigated neural correlates of visual verbal working memory and sensory plasticity in 14 CI users and age-matched normal-hearing (NH) controls. While we recorded the high-density electroencephalogram (EEG), participants completed a modified Sternberg visual working memory task where sets of letters and numbers were presented visually and then recalled at a later time. Results suggested that CI users had comparable behavioural working memory performance compared with NH. However, CI users had more pronounced neural activity during visual stimulus encoding, including stronger visual-evoked activity in auditory and visual cortices, larger modulations of neural oscillations and increased frontotemporal connectivity. In contrast, during memory retention of the characters, CI users had descriptively weaker neural oscillations and significantly lower frontotemporal connectivity. We interpret the differences in neural correlates of visual stimulus processing in CI users through the lens of cross-modal and intramodal plasticity.

Recently, Very fast ripples 500-1000Hz (VFR) and ultra-fast ripples 1000-2000Hz (UFR) recorded using standard clinical macro electrodes have been shown to be more specific for EZ. High-sampled microelectrode recordings can bring new insights into this phenomenon of high frequency, multiunit activity. Unfortunately, visual detection of such events is extremely time consuming and unreliable. Here we present a detector of ultra-fast oscillations (UFO, >1kHz). In an example of two patients, we detected 951 UFOs which were more frequent in epileptic (8.6/min) vs. non-epileptic hippocampus (1.3/min). Our detection method can serve as a tool for exploring extremely high frequency events from microelectrode recordings.

Theta Synchrony Is Increased near Neural Populations That Are Active When Initiating Instructed Movement	ENEURO			English	Article						high frequency activity; instructed movement; intracranial EEG; sensory-motor transformation; synchrony; theta	SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; POWER SPECTRA; OSCILLATIONS; DOPAMINE; NETWORKS	Theta oscillations (3-8 Hz) in the human brain have been linked to perception, cognitive control, and spatial memory, but their relation to the motor system is less clear. We tested the hypothesis that theta oscillations coordinate distributed behaviorally relevant neural representations during movement using intracranial electro-encephalography (iEEG) recordings from nine patients (n = 490 electrodes) as they performed a simple instructed movement task. Using high frequency activity (HFA; 70-200 Hz) as a marker of local spiking activity, we identified electrodes that were positioned near neural populations that showed increased activity during instruction and movement. We found that theta synchrony was widespread throughout the brain but was increased near regions that showed movement-related increases in neural activity. These results support the view that theta oscillations represent a general property of brain activity that may also play a specific role in coordinating widespread neural activity when initiating voluntary movement.

Although valid retrospective cues often facilitate memory recall, invalid ones may or may not result in performance costs. We investigated individual differences in utilising retrospective cues and evaluated how these individual differences are associated with brain oscillatory activity at rest. At the behavioural level, we operationalised flexibility as the ability to make effective use of retrospective cues or disregard them if required. At the neural level, we tested whether individual differences in such flexibility were associated with properties of resting-state alpha oscillatory activity (8-12 Hz). To capture distinct aspects of these brain oscillations, we evaluated their power spectral density and temporal dynamics using long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs). In addition, we performed multivariate patterns analysis (MVPA) to classify individuals' level of behavioural flexibility based on these neural measures. We observed that alpha power alone (magnitude) at rest was not associated with flexibility. However, we found that the participants' ability to manipulate VWM representations was correlated with alpha LRTC and could be decoded using MVPA on patterns of alpha power. Our findings suggest that alpha LRTC and multivariate patterns of alpha power at rest may underlie some of the individual differences in using retrospective cues in working memory tasks.

Many different spectral analysis or time-frequency analysis methods have been used for this process. However, most of the methods used in previous studies were based on the features obtained from the power or energy of EEG signals. To date, a sufficiently high level of accuracy in classifying four-class motor imagery (MI) states with these features has not been achieved. Therefore, studies are still being carried out on this subject to increase accuracy. Since different parts of the brain interact in MI applications, it may also be important to examine phase information in MI classifications. Based on this idea, the empirical mode decomposition method was applied to EEG signals from 22 channels in this study. Thus, the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) of each channel were obtained. The instantaneous phase values were calculated by applying the Hilbert transform to these IMFs. Twenty-two eigenvalues were obtained for each window by sliding a 22 x 22 window with as many rows and columns as the number of channels on the instantaneous phase values. A feature vector was obtained by adding the eigenvalues of all windows, one under the other. Higher accuracy (89.89%) was achieved compared to state-of-the-art studies when feature vectors were applied to the long short-term memory (LSTM) deep network. This method increased the accuracy by 4.3%.

Earlier and more robust sensorimotor discrimination of ASL signs in deaf signers during imitation	LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Alpha rhythm; beta rhythm; imitation; signed language; EEG; sensorimotor	MU-RHYTHM; NEURAL BASIS; LANGUAGE; MOTOR; EEG; PERCEPTION; HEARING; OSCILLATIONS; EXPERIENCE; MOVEMENT	Prior research suggests that the amount of experience an individual has with an action influences the degree to which the sensorimotor systems of their brain are involved in the subsequent perception of those actions. Less is known about how action experience and semantic knowledge impact sensorimotor involvement during imitation. To address this question, we collected electroencephalograms (EEG) while deaf signers and hearing non-signers imitated one-handed and two-handed ASL signs. During observation, deaf signers showed early differentiation in alpha/beta power between the one- and two-handed sign conditions, whereas hearing non-signers showed this discrimination only later. During sign imitation, deaf signers showed desynchronisation of alpha/beta EEG signals, while hearing non-signers showed increased power. Thus, in an imitative context, deaf signers engage anticipatory motor preparation in advance of action production, while hearing non-signers engage slower, more memory-related processes to help them complete the complex task.

Optical Stimulation of Thalamic Spindle Circuitry Sustains Electroencephalogram Patterns of General Anesthesia but not Duration of Loss of Consciousness	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						sleep; sleep spindle; EEG; GABA; anesthesia; thalamus	GABA(A) RECEPTORS; THALAMOCORTICAL NEURONS; SLEEP SPINDLES; PROPOFOL; INHIBITION; AROUSAL; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; SIGNATURES	Alterations in thalamic GABAergic signaling are implicated in mediating the rise in 12-30 Hz electroencephalogram (EEG) activity that signals anesthetic-induced loss-of-consciousness with GABAA receptortargeting general anesthetics. A number of modeling studies have identified that anesthetic-induced alterations in thalamocortico-corticothalamic signaling in the same network that generates sleep spindles would be sufficient to elicit this key EEG signature of anesthetic hypnosis with general anesthetic agents. Accordingly, we hypothesize that targeted stimulation of this thalamic GABAergic circuitry into a sleep-spindle mode of activity would promote the general anesthetic effects of etomidate. We recorded EEG activity and loss-of-righting reflex in transgenic mice expressing channel rhodopsin-2 on GABAergic neurons (ChR2-VGAT, n = 8) and control, wildtype mice (C57BL/6J, n = 8). On two consecutive days mice were randomly assigned to receive spindle-rhythm stimulation via an optical probe targeting the left reticular thalamic nucleus or no stimulation. After an initial 30minute recording, mice were administered etomidate (12 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and recorded for 90 min with or without optical stimulation. Etomidate elicited an increase in 12-30 Hz EEG power in wild-type and ChR2-VGAT mice for 20 min following administration (p < 0.001). Optical spindle-rhythm stimulation prolonged the increase in 12-30 Hz activity in ChR2-VGAT mice only (p = 0.023). Spindle-rhythm stimulation also increased the incidence and duration of sleep spindle-like oscillations in ChR2-VGAT mice only (all p < 0.001). Despite the maintained anesthetic-like changes in EEG activity, optical spindle-rhythm stimulation was not associated with changes in the time to and duration of the loss-of-righting reflex, a behavioral endpoint of etomidate-induced general anesthesia in rodents.

J	Luke, R; Maureen, JSB; McAlpine, D				Luke, Robert; Maureen, J. Shader B.; McAlpine, David			Characterization of Mayer-wave oscillations in functional near-infrared spectroscopy using a physiologically informed model of the neural power spectra	NEUROPHOTONICS			English	Article						functional near-infrared spectroscopy; Mayer waves; signal processing	CORTICAL ACTIVATION; OXYGENATION; ACCURACY; EEG	Significance: Mayer waves are spontaneous oscillations in arterial blood pressure that can mask cortical hemodynamic responses associated with neural activity of interest. Aim: We aim to characterize the properties of oscillations in the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signal generated by Mayer waves in a large sample of fNIRS recordings. Further, we aim to determine the impact of short-channel correction for the attenuation of these unwanted signal components. Approach: Mayer-wave oscillation parameters were extracted from 310 fNIRS measurements using the fitting oscillations and one-over-f method to compute normative values. The effect of short-channel correction on Mayer-wave oscillation power was quantified on 222 measurements. The practical benefit of the short-channel correction approach for reducing Mayer waves and improving response detection was also evaluated on a subgroup of 17 fNIRS measurements collected during a passive auditory speech detection experiment. Results: Mayer-wave oscillations had a mean frequency of 0.108 Hz, bandwidth of 0.04 Hz, and power of 3.5 mu M2/Hz. The distribution of oscillation signal power was positively skewed, with some measurements containing large Mayer waves. Short-channel correction significantly reduced the amplitude of these undesired signals; greater attenuation was observed for measurements containing larger Mayer-wave oscillations. Conclusions: A robust method for quantifying Mayer-wave oscillations in the fNIRS signal spectrum was presented and used to provide normative parameterization. Short-channel correction is recommended as an approach for attenuating Mayer waves, particularly in participants with large oscillations. (C) The Authors.

There are few studies linking age differences in EEG to age differences in behavioural performance which is necessary to establish how neuroactivity corresponds to successful and impaired ageing. Eighty-six healthy participants completed a battery of cognitive tests and eye-tracking measures. Resting state EEG (n = 75, 31 young, 44 older adults) was measured for delta, theta, alpha and beta power as well as for alpha peak frequency. Age deficits in cognition were aligned with the literature, showing working memory and inhibitory deficits along with an older adult advantage in vocabulary. Older adults showed poorer eye movement accuracy and response times, but we did not replicate literature showing a greater age deficit for antisaccades than for prosaccades. We replicated EEG literature showing lower alpha peak frequency in older adults but not literature showing lower alpha power. Older adults also showed higher beta power and less parietal alpha power asymmetry than young adults. Interaction effects showed that better prosaccade performance was related to lower beta power in young adults but not in older adults. Performance at the trail making test part B (measuring task switching and inhibition) was improved for older adults with higher resting state delta power but did not depend on delta power for young adults. It is argued that individuals with higher slow-wave resting EEG may be more resilient to age deficits in tasks that utilise cross-cortical processing.

A ventromedial prefrontal dysrhythmia in obsessive-compulsive disorder is attenuated by nucleus accumbens deep brain stimulation	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Deep brain stimulation; EEG; Nucleus accumbens; Ventromedial frontal cross-frequency coupling	OSCILLATIONS; REPRESENTATION; STRIATUM; CORTEX	Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has consistently been linked to abnormal frontostriatal activity. The electrophysiological disruption in this circuit, however, remains to be characterized. Objective/hypothesis: The primary goal of this study was to investigate the neuronal synchronization in OCD patients. We predicted aberrant oscillatory activity in frontal regions compared to healthy control subjects, which would be alleviated by deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Methods: We compared scalp EEG recordings from nine patients with OCD treated with NAc-DBS with recordings from healthy controls, matched for age and gender. Within the patient group, EEG activity was compared with DBS turned off vs. stimulation at typical clinical settings (3.5 V, frequency of stimulation 130 Hz, pulse width 60 ms). In addition, intracranial EEG was recorded directly from depth macro electrodes in the NAc in four OCD patients. Results: Cross-frequency coupling between the phase of alpha/low beta oscillations and amplitude of high gamma was significantly increased over midline frontal and parietal electrodes in patients when stimulation was turned off, compared to controls. Critically, in patients, beta (16-25 Hz)-gamma (110-166 Hz) phase amplitude coupling source localized to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and was reduced when NAc-DBS was active. In contrast, intracranial EEG recordings showed no beta-gamma phase amplitude coupling. The contribution of non-sinusoidal beta waveforms to this coupling are reported. Conclusion: We reveal an increased beta-gamma phase amplitude coupling in fronto-central scalp sensors in patients suffering from OCD, compared to healthy controls, which may derive from ventromedial prefrontal regions implicated in OCD and is normalized by DBS of the nucleus accumbens. This aberrant cross-frequency coupling could represent a biomarker of OCD, as well as a target for novel therapeutic approaches. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The present study utilized lateralized beta power, which has been shown to index response preparation, to examine subthreshold error corrections in a task known to produce response conflict, the Simon task. We found that even when an overt correction is not made, greater activation of the corrective response, indexed by beta suppression ipsilateral to the initial responding hand, predicted post-error speeding, and enhanced post-error accuracy at the single-trial level. This provides support for the notion that response conflict associated with errors can be adaptive, and suggests that subthreshold corrections should be taken into account to fully understand error-monitoring processes. Furthermore, we expand on previous findings that demonstrate that post-error slowing and post-error accuracy can be dissociated, as well as findings that suggest that frontal midline theta oscillations and the error-related negativity (ERN) are dissociable neurocognitive processes.

Both two-class (sleep-awake) and multiclass classifications have been performed using a fusion of various EEG features and an ensemble classifier called random undersampling with boosting technique (RUSBoost). The results achieved using a single channel EEG are comparable or better than the state-of-the-art methods in the literature for both types of classification, on all the databases. Two-class classification is useful to determine the preferred timings for sensory stimulation of patients with disorders of consciousness. 10-fold cross-validation accuracies of 92.6% and 97.9% have been obtained on Sleep EDF database for 6-class and 2-class problems, respectively. Using Expanded Sleep-EDF dataset, the accuracies improved to 96.3% for 6-state and 99.8% for 2-state classification. For DREAMS dataset, we achieved an accuracy of 96.6% for 2-state classification. Unlike most research in the literature where performance on unseen subjects is not considered, we report classification results on the data from unseen test subjects using both 50% holdout and leave-one-out cross-validation approaches. Similar results were achieved using both validation techniques for different datasets emphasizing the reliability of our method. These results are very crucial for the method to be applicable for clinical use.

At the same time, technological advances in noninvasive neurophysiological methods such as electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography now allow researchers to map the neural time course of decision making with millisecond precision. Combining these approaches can potentially yield important new insights into how choices emerge over time. Here we review recent research on the computational and neurophysiological correlates of perceptual and value-based decision making, from DDM parameters to scalp potentials and oscillatory neural activity. Starting with motor response preparation, the most well-understood aspect of the decision process, we discuss evidence that urgency signals and shifts in baseline activation, rather than shifts in the physiological value of the choice-triggering response threshold, are responsible for adjusting response times under speeded choice scenarios. Research on the neural correlates of starting point bias suggests that prestimulus activity can predict biases in motor choice behavior. Finally, studies examining the time dynamics of evidence construction and evidence accumulation have identified signals at frontocentral and centroparietal electrodes associated respectively with these processes, emerging 300-500 ms after stimulus onset. These findings can inform psychological theories of decision-making, providing empirical support for attribute weighting in value-based choice while suggesting theoretical alternatives to dual-process accounts. Further research combining computational and neurophysiological approaches holds promise for providing greater insight into the moment-by-moment evolution of the decision process.

Here we analyzed the relationship between preoperative cognition and anesthesia-induced brain dynamics. We hypothesized that patients with low cognitive performance would be more sensitive to anesthetics and would show differences in electroencephalogram (EEG) activity consistent with a brain anesthesia overdose. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis from a previously reported observational study. We evaluated cognitive performance using the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) test. All patients received general anesthesia maintained with sevoflurane or desflurane during elective major abdominal surgery. We analyzed the EEG using spectral, coherence, and phase-amplitude modulation analyses. RESULTS: Patients were separated into a low MoCA group (<26 points, n = 12) and a high MoCA group (n = 23). There were no differences in baseline EEG, nor end-tidal age-corrected minimum alveolar concentration (MAC(age)). However, under anesthesia, the low MoCA group had lower alpha-beta power (high MoCA: 2.9 [interquartile range {IQR}: 0.6-5.8 dB] versus low MoCA: -1.2 [IQR: -2.1 to 0.6 dB], difference 4.1 [1.0-5.7]) and a lower alpha peak frequency (high MoCA: 9.0 [IQR: 8.3-9.8 Hz] versus low MoCA: 7.5 [IQR: 6.3-9.0 Hz], difference 1.5 [0-2.3]) compared to the high MoCA group. The low MoCA group also had a lower a band coherence and a stronger peak-max phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). Finally, patients in the low MoCA group had longer emergence times (high MoCA 663 +/- 345 seconds versus low MoCA: 960 +/- 352 seconds, difference 297 [15-578]). Multiple linear regression shows up that both age and MoCA scores are independently associated with intraoperative alpha-beta power. CONCLUSIONS: All these EEG features, together with a prolonged emergence time, are consistent with the possibility that older patients with low cognitive performance are receiving a brain anesthesia overdose compare to cognitive normal patients.

Although accurate, this method comes at a high cost of invasive surgery and experts trained to score EEG/EMG data. Here, we leverage modern computer vision methods to directly classify sleep substages from video data. This bypasses the need for surgery and expert scoring, provides a path to high-throughput studies of sleep in mice. Methods We collected synchronized high-resolution video and EEG/EMG data in 16 male C57BL/6J mice. We extracted features from the video that are time and frequency-based and used the human expert-scored EEG/EMG data to train a visual classifier. We investigated several classifiers and data augmentation methods. Results Our visual sleep classifier proved to be highly accurate in classifying wake, non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), and rapid eye movement sleep (REM) states, and achieves an overall accuracy of 0.92 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- SD). We discover and genetically validate video features that correlate with breathing rates, and show low and high variability in NREM and REM sleep, respectively. Finally, we apply our methods to noninvasively detect that sleep stage disturbances induced by amphetamine administration. Conclusions We conclude that machine learning-based visual classification of sleep is a viable alternative to EEG/EMG based scoring. Our results will enable noninvasive high-throughput sleep studies and will greatly reduce the barrier to screening mutant mice for abnormalities in sleep.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a newer noninvasive technique for localization. However, there is limited literature to evaluate if MEG provides additional advantage over the conventional imaging modalities in clinical decision making. The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic added value of MEG in decision making before epilepsy surgery. Method This was a prospective observational study. Patients underwent 3 h of recording in a MEG scanner, and the resulting localizations were compared with other complimentary investigations. Added value of MEG (considered separately from high-density electroencephalography) was defined as the frequency of cases in which (i) the information provided by magnetic source imaging (MSI) avoided implantation of intracranial electrodes and the patient was directly cleared for surgery, and (ii) MSI indicated additional substrates for implantation of intracranial electrodes. Postoperative seizure freedom was used as the diagnostic reference by which to measure the localizing accuracy of MSI. Results A total of 102 patients underwent epilepsy surgery. MEG provided nonredundant information, which contributed to deciding the course of surgery in 33% of the patients, and prevented intracranial recordings in 19%. A total of 76% of the patients underwent surgical resection in sublobes concordant with MSI localization, and the diagnostic odds ratio for good (Engel I) outcome in these patients was 2.3 (95% confidence interval 0.68, 7.86; p = 0.183) after long-term follow-up of 36 months. Conclusion Magnetic source imaging yields additional useful information which can significantly alter as well as improve the surgical strategy for persons with epilepsy.

Spectral Resting-State EEG (rsEEG) in Chronic Aphasia Is Reliable, Sensitive, and Correlates With Functional Behavior	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						aphasia; EEG; resting-state; spectral; reliability	QUANTITATIVE EEG; HEMISPHERIC LATERALIZATION; STROKE PATIENTS; THETA-POWER; PEOPLE; PARTICIPATION; LANGUAGE; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; RELIABILITY	We investigated spectral resting-state EEG in persons with chronic stroke-induced aphasia to determine its reliability, sensitivity, and relationship to functional behaviors. Resting-state EEG has not yet been characterized in this population and was selected given the demonstrated potential of resting-state investigations using other neuroimaging techniques to guide clinical decision-making. Controls and persons with chronic stroke-induced aphasia completed two EEG recording sessions, separated by approximately 1 month, as well as behavioral assessments of language, sensorimotor, and cognitive domains. Power in the classic frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) was examined via spectral analysis of resting-state EEG data. Results suggest that power in the theta, alpha, and beta bands is reliable for use as a repeated measure. Significantly greater theta and lower beta power was observed in persons with aphasia (PWAs) than controls. Finally, in PWAs theta power negatively correlated with performance on a discourse informativeness measure, while alpha and beta power positively correlated with performance on the same measure. This indicates that spectral rsEEG slowing observed in PWAs in the chronic stage is pathological and suggests a possible avenue for directly altering brain activation to improve behavioral function. Taken together, these results suggest that spectral resting-state EEG holds promise for sensitive measurement of functioning and change in persons with chronic aphasia. Future studies investigating the utility of these measures as biomarkers of frank or latent aphasic deficits and treatment response in chronic stroke-induced aphasia are warranted.	[Dalton, Sarah G.

However, current experimental procedures utilized to study incubation of methamphetamine craving do not incorporate the temporal dynamics of neuropsychological measures and electrophysiological activities associated with this incubation process. This study utilized the high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as a rapid, inexpensive, and noninvasive measure of cue-induced craving potential. A total of 156 male individuals with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) enrolled in this multisite, cross-sectional study. Structured clinical interview data, self-report questionnaires (cued craving, quality of sleep, impulsivity, anxiety, and depression) and resting-state, eye-closed 128 high-density channel EEG signals were collected at 5 abstinence duration time points (<1, 1-3, 3-6, 6-12, and 12-24 months) to track the neuropsychological and neurophysiological signatures. Cue-induced craving was higher after 1-3 months than after the other time points. This incubation effect was also observed for sleep quality but not for anxiety, depression, and impulsivity symptoms, along with exhibited decreased power spectrum for theta (5.5-8 Hz) and alpha (8-13 Hz), and increased in beta (16.5-26.5 Hz) frequency band. Source reconstructed resting-state EEG analysis showed increased synchronization of medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) for the beta frequency band in 1-3 months abstinent MUD group, and associated with the incubation of craving. Remarkably, the robust incubation-related abnormalities may be driven by beta-band source space connectivity between MPFC and bilateral orbital gyrus (ORB). Our findings suggest the enhancement of beta activity in the incubation period most likely originates from a dysfunction involving frontal brain regions. This neurophysiological signature of incubation of craving can be used to identify individuals who might be most susceptible to relapse, providing a potential insight into future therapeutic interventions for MUD via neuromodulation of beta activity.

Transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) is a recently proposed non-invasive brain stimulation approach with various effects on the nervous system from the cells to the whole brain networks. Specially in the neural network level, tPBM can alter the topology and synchronizability of functional brain networks. However, the functional properties of the neural networks after tPBM are still poorly clarified. Approach. Here, we employed electroencephalography and different methods (conventional and spectral) in the graph theory analysis to track the significant effects of tPBM on the resting state brain networks. The non-parametric statistical analysis showed that just one short-term tPBM session over right medial frontal pole can significantly change both topological (i.e. clustering coefficient, global efficiency, local efficiency, eigenvector centrality) and dynamical (i.e. energy, largest eigenvalue, and entropy) features of resting state brain networks. Main results. The topological results revealed that tPBM can reduce local processing, centrality, and laterality. Furthermore, the increased centrality of central electrode was observed. Significance. These results suggested that tPBM can alter topology of resting state brain network to facilitate the neural information processing. On the other hand, the dynamical results showed that tPBM reduced stability of synchronizability and increased complexity in the resting state brain networks. These effects can be considered in association with the increased complexity of connectivity patterns among brain regions and the enhanced information propagation in the resting state brain networks. Overall, both topological and dynamical features of brain networks suggest that although tPBM decreases local processing (especially in the right hemisphere) and disrupts synchronizability of network, but it can increase the level of information transferring and processing in the brain network.

Due to individual differences of patients, the iEEG signal from different patients usually shows very diverse features even if the features belong to the same class. Accordingly, automatic detection of epileptic focus is required to improve the accuracy and to shorten the time for treatment. In this paper, we propose a novel feature fusion-based iEEG classification method, a deep learning model termed Time-Frequency Hybrid Network (TF-HybridNet), in which short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and 1d convolution layers are performed on the input iEEG in parallel to extract features of the time-frequency domain and feature maps. And then, the time-frequency features and feature maps are fused and fed to a 2d convolutional neural network (CNN). We used the Bern-Barcelona iEEG dataset for evaluating the performance of TF-HybridNet, and the experimental results show that our approach is able to differentiate the focal from nonfocal iEEG signal with an average classification accuracy of 94.3% and demonstrates an improved accuracy rate compared to the model using only STFT or one-dimensional convolutional layers as feature extraction.

To further explore brain network dynamics and synchronization in first-episode schizophrenia, we exploited pinning control theory to adjust and control the brain regions interacting with each other in schizophrenia to make their network synchronization stability consistent with that of healthy individuals. Our results revealed that in a short-term memory task, the right frontal lobe was abnormal in schizophrenia, resulting in higher synchronous oscillation behavior of the entire brain networks compared with the healthy participants. And the synchronization was positively correlated with each participant's response time (RT) and negatively correlated with their response accuracy (ACC). In the healthy participants, the frontal lobe facilitated a higher brain synchronization state, whereas in the schizophrenia patients, the parietal-occipital lobe facilitated a higher brain synchronization state. These data provide new evidence for task-relevant dynamic interactions between brain regions in schizophrenia and provide theoretical methods for the adjustment and control of brain networks.

Dissociated neural signals of conflict and surprise in effortful decision Making: Theta activity reflects surprise while alpha and beta activity reflect conflict	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; COGNITIVE CONTROL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VISUAL FIXATIONS; THINKING; CHOICE; EEG	What makes a decision difficult? Two key factors are conflict and surprise: conflict emerges with multiple competing responses and surprise occurs with unexpected events. Conflict and surprise, however, are often thought of as parsimonious accounts of decision making rather than an integrated narrative. We sought to determine whether conflict and/or surprise concurrently or independently elicit effortful decision making. Participants made a series of diagnostic decisions from physiological readings while electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded. To induce conflict and surprise, we manipulated task difficulty by varying the distance between a presented physiological reading and the category border that separated the two diagnoses. Whereas frontal theta oscillations reflected surprise - when presented readings were far from the expected mean, parietal alpha and beta oscillations indicated conflict - when readings were near the category border. Our findings provide neural evidence that both conflict and surprise engage cognitive control to employ effort in decision making.

EEG-NFT is gaining increasing attention for its potential "peak performance" applications on healthy individuals. However, evidence for clear cognitive performance enhancements with healthy adults is still lacking. In particular, whether EEG-NFT represents an effective technique for enhancing healthy adults' executive functions is still controversial. Therefore, the main objective of this systematic review is to assess whether the existing EEG-NFT studies targeting executive functions have provided reliable evidence for NFT effectiveness. To this end, we conducted a qualitative analysis of the literature since the limited number of retrieved studies did not allow us meta-analytical comparisons. Moreover, a second aim was to identify optimal frequencies as NFT targets for specifically improving executive functions. Overall, our systematic review provides promising evidence for NFT effectiveness in boosting healthy adults' executive functions. However, more rigorous NFT studies are required in order to overcome the methodological weaknesses that we encountered in our qualitative analysis.

These compounds induce both non-fatal and fatal adverse effects and despite the enhanced regulation, they are continuously synthesized and are being sold in the illegal drug market, including 1-phenylcyclohexan-1-amine hydrochloride (PCA). Therefore, we evaluated its abuse potential through the conditioned-place preference (CPP), self-administration, and locomotor sensitization paradigms. Pretreatment with SCH 2 3390 and haloperidol was also performed during a CPP test. We used ELISA to measure dopamine (DA) levels and western blotting to determine effects on the DA-related proteins as well as on phosphorylated CREB, deltaFosB, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Finally, we examined the effects on brain wave activity using electroencephalography (EEG). PCA induced CPP in mice and was self-administered by rats, suggesting that PCA has rewarding and reinforcing properties. PCA increased locomotor of mice on the first treatment and challenge days. SCH 23390 and haloperidol blocked the CPP. PCA altered the DA, tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine D1 and D2 receptors as well as p-CREB and deltaFosB. Also, PCA altered the delta and gamma waves in the brain, which were then normalized by SCH 2 3390 and haloperidol. The present findings indicate that PCA may induce abuse potential through the dopaminergic system and probably accompanied with alterations in brain wave activity which is similar to that of other psychotomimetic NMDA antagonists. We advocate thorough monitoring of PCP analogs as they pose potential harm to public health.

To conveniently quantify this alignment (termed ?speech tracking?) many studies consider the broadband speech envelope, which combines acoustic fluctuations across the spectral range. Using EEG recordings, we show that using this broadband envelope can provide a distorted picture on speech encoding. We systematically investigated the encoding of spectrally-limited speech-derived envelopes presented by individual and multiple noise carriers in the human brain. Tracking in the 1 to 6 Hz EEG bands differentially reflected low (0.2 0.83 kHz) and high (2.66 8 kHz) frequency speech-derived envelopes. This was independent of the specific carrier frequency but sensitive to attentional manipulations, and may reflect the context-dependent emphasis of information from distinct spectral ranges of the speech envelope in low frequency brain activity. As low and high frequency speech envelopes relate to distinct phonemic features, our results suggest that functionally distinct processes contribute to speech tracking in the same EEG bands, and are easily confounded when considering the broadband speech envelope.

A tool largely employed in the investigation of brain networks is the electroencephalogram (EEG). Given the cerebral complexity and dynamism, many nonlinear approaches have been applied to explore age-related brain electrical activity modulation detected by the EEG: one of them is the entropy, which measures the disorder of a system. The present study had the aim to investigate aging influence on brain dynamics applying Approximate Entropy (ApEn) parameter to resting state EEG data of 68 healthy adult participants, divided with respect to their age in two groups, focusing on several specialized brain regions. Results showed that elderly participants present higher ApEn values than younger participants in the central, parietal and occipital areas, confirming the hypothesis that aging is characterized by an evolution of brain dynamics. Such findings may reflect a reduced synchronization of the neural networks cyclic activity, due to the reduction of cerebral connections typically found in aging process. Understanding the dynamics of brain networks by applying the entropy parameter could be useful for developing appropriate and personalized rehabilitation programs and for future studies on neurodegenerative diseases.

However, there was little knowledge about the effective frequency parameter of RVS which could impact task performance in visuo-spatial selective attention. Thus, here, we addressed this question by investigating the modulating effects of RVSs in different attention-related frequency bands, i.e., alpha (10 Hz) and gamma band (40 Hz). Sixteen participants were recruited to perform a modified visuo-spatial selective attention task. They were required to identify the orientation of target-triangle in visual search arrays while undergoing different RVS backgrounds. By analyzing the acquired behavioral and EEG data, we observed that, compared with control group (no RVS), 40 Hz RVS led to significantly shorter reaction time (RT) while 10 Hz RVS did not bring obvious behavioral consequences. In addition, although both 10 and 40 Hz RVS led to a global enhancement of SSVEP spectrum in the gamma band, 40 Hz RVS led to even larger 40 Hz SSVEP spectrum in prefrontal cortex. Our findings indicate that 40 Hz RVS has an effectively enhancing effect on selective attention and support the crucial role of prefrontal area in selective attention.

Although mounting evidence suggests that individuals with aMCI have additional cognitive alterations including deficits in cognitive control, few have examined if EMCI and LMCI differ on processes other than episodic memory. Using a semantic Go/NoGo task, we examined differences in cognitive control between EMCI and LMCI on behavioral (accuracy and reaction time) and neural (scalp-recorded event-related oscillations in theta and alpha band) measures. Although no behavioral differences were observed between the EMCI and LMCI groups, differences in neural oscillations were observed. The LMCI group had higher theta synchronization on Go trials at central electrodes compared to the EMCI group. In addition, the EMCI group showed differences in theta power at central electrodes and alpha power at central and centm-parietal electrodes between Go and NoGo trials, while the LMCI group did not exhibit such differences. These findings suggest that while behavioral differences may not be observable, neural changes underlying cognitive control processes may differentiate EMCI and LMCI stages and may be useful to understand the trajectory of aMCI in future studies.

Impaired WM affects routine daily activities and is observed in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). This study investigated neural oscillations associated with different WM phases, to determine the specific neural activity linked with the phases of WM impairment. Methods: Patients with TLE (n = 52) and healthy volunteers (n = 35) completed a WM task, during which 34-channel electroencephalogram signals were recorded. Characteristic neural oscillation patterns during each WM phase were compared between the 2 groups. Results: Patients with TLE showed decreased theta power during the encoding phase of WM, which was associated with reduced accuracy in the WM task. Altered theta power in the frontal region of the brain during the encoding phase was associated with a longer reaction time. Conclusions: Alterations in theta oscillation are related to WM impairment in patients with TLE and may serve as an early marker for evaluating WM deficits. Significance: This study provides an early marker for evaluating WM deficits in TLE. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The thermal discomfort defined in this study considers both thermal displeasure induced by step-changes and thermal discomfort induced by temperature ramping. A total of 108 people in their 20s and 30s participated in the experiments. The subjects experienced uncomfortable thermal environmental changes and changes in EEG were measured accordingly. The EEG data were divided into four frequency bands, namely; theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-40 Hz) waves for analysis. By examining the thermal-displeasure EEGs, we observed that when thermal displeasure was induced by heat, the relative theta power decreased and the relative beta and gamma powers increase. Furthermore, the relative theta power decreased when thermal displeasure was induced by cold. By examining the thermal-discomfort EEGs, we observed that all the EEG power values increase when thermal discomfort results from either heat or cold. Based on these experimental results, the brainwaves can be utilized to increase the prediction accuracy of individual thermal comfort by the conventional comfort model that is based on physical quantities, such as, temperature, humidity, air velocity, metabolic rate, and clothing insulation.

Our goal was to see if particular patterns within the snippet induced higher levels of cognitive load, and if the collected EEG data might provide more detailed insights than performance measures. Our results suggest that while cognitive load can be an influence on code comprehension performance, other human factors, such as a tendency to forget certain programming rules or to misread what the code is asking them to do may also play a role, particularly for novice programmers. We conclude that: (1) different types of code patterns can affect programmers' cognitive processes in disparate ways, (2) neither self-reported data nor brainwave activity alone is a reliable indicator of programmers' level of comprehension for all types of code snippets, (3) EEG techniques could be useful to better understand the relationships between program comprehension, code patterns and cognitive processes, and (4) tests like ours could be useful to identify crucial learning gaps in novice programmers, which, in turn can be leveraged to improve programming tools and teaching strategies.

Although a dreaming experience implies bodily changes at many organ, system, and timescale levels, the entity and causal role of such peripheral changes in a conscious dream experience are unknown. We performed a comprehensive, causal, multivariate analysis of physiological signals acquired during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep at night, including high-density electroencephalography and peripheral dynamics including electrocardiography and blood pressure. In this preliminary study, we investigated multiple recalls and nonrecalls of dream experiences using data from nine healthy volunteers. The aim was not only to investigate the changes in central and autonomic dynamics associated with dream recalls and nonrecalls, but also to characterize the central-peripheral dynamical and (causal) directional interactions, and the temporal relations of the related arousals upon awakening. We uncovered a brain-body network that drives a conscious dreaming experience that acts with specific interaction and time delays. Such a network is sustained by the blood pressure dynamics and the increasing functional information transfer from the neural heartbeat regulation to the brain. We conclude that bodily changes play a crucial and causative role in a conscious dream experience during REM sleep.

Identification of AD in early stage gives rise to efficient treatment in dementia. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is considered as a conversion stage. Reducing EEG complexity can be used as a marker to detect AD. The aim of this study is to develop a 3-way diagnostic classification using EEG complexity in the detection of MCI/AD in clinical practice. This study also investigates the effects of different eyes states, i.e. eyes-open, eyes-closed on classification performance. Methods: EEG recordings from 85 AD, 85 MCI subjects, and 85 Healthy Controls with eyes-open and eyes-closed are analyzed. Permutation Entropy (PE) values are computed from frontal, central, parietal, temporal, and occipital regions for each EEG epoch. Distribution of PE values are visualized to observe discrimination of MCI/AD with HC. Visual investigations are combined with statistical analysis using ANOVA to determine whether groups are significant or not. Multinomial Logistic Regression model is applied to feature sets in order to classify participants individually. Results: Distribution of measured PE shows that EEG complexity is lower in AD and higher in HC group. MCI group is observed as an intermediate form due to heterogeneous values. Results from 3-way classification indicate that F1-scores and rates of sensitivity and specificity achieve the highest overall discrimination rates reaching up to 100% for at TP8 for eyes-closed condition; and C3, C4, T8, O2 electrodes for eyes-open condition. Classification of HC from both patient groups is achieved best. Eyes-open state increases discrimination of MCI and AD. Conclusions: This nonlinear EEG methodology study contributes to literature with high discrimination rates for identification of AD. PE is recommended as a practical diagnostic neuro-marker for AD studies. Resting state EEG at eyes-open condition can be more advantageous over eyes-closed EEG recordings for diagnosis of AD.

Neural oscillations are electrobiomarkers of the connectivity state within systems. A single-systemic administration of ketamine, a non-competitive NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist, transiently reproduces the oscillopathies with a clinical picture reminiscent of the psychosis prodrome. This acute pharmacological model may help the research and development of innovative treatments against psychotic transition. Transcranial electrical stimulation is recognized as an appropriate non-invasive therapeutic modality since it can increase cognitive performance and modulate neural oscillations with little or no side effects. Therefore, our objective was to set up, in the sedated adult rat, a stimulation method that is able to normalize ketamine-induced increase in gamma frequency (30-80 Hz) oscillations and decrease in sigma frequency (10-17 Hz) oscillations. Unilateral and bipolar frontoparietal (FP), transcranial anodal stimulation by direct current (<+1 mA) was applied in ketamine-treated rats. A concomitant bilateral electroencephalographic recording of the parietal cortex measured the stimulation effects on its spontaneously occurring oscillations. A 5 min FP anodal tDCS immediately and quickly reduced, significantly with an intensity-effect relationship, the ketamine-induced gamma hyperactivity, and sigma hypoactivity at least in the bilateral parietal cortex. A duration effect was also recorded. The tDCS also tended to diminish the ketamine-induced delta hypoactivity. These preliminary neurophysiological findings are promising for developing a therapeutic proof-of-concept against neuropsychiatric disorders.

CEPS is also sufficiently adaptable to be used for other time series physiological data such as EEG (electroencephalography), postural sway or temperature measurements. Methods: Data were collected from a convenience sample of nine healthy adults in a pilot for a larger study investigating the effects on vagal tone of breathing paced at various different rates, part of a development programme for a home training stress reduction system. Results: The current version of CEPS focuses on those complexity and entropy measures that appear most frequently in the literature, together with some recently introduced entropy measures which may have advantages over those that are more established. Ten methods of estimating data complexity are currently included, and some 28 entropy measures. The GUI also includes a section for data pre-processing and standard ancillary methods to enable parameter estimation of embedding dimension m and time delay tau ('tau') where required. The software is freely available under version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPLv3) for non-commercial users. CEPS can be downloaded from Bitbucket. In our illustration on PB, most complexity and entropy measures decreased significantly in response to breathing at 7 breaths per minute, differentiating more clearly than conventional linear, time- and frequency-domain measures between breathing states. In contrast, Higuchi fractal dimension increased during paced breathing. Conclusions: We have developed CEPS software as a physiological data visualiser able to integrate state of the art techniques. The interface is designed for clinical research and has a structure designed for integrating new tools.

MRI-related anxiety can induce slow BOLD oscillations coupled with cardiac oscillations	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Anxiety; Cardiac-interval oscillations; fMRI; Pacemaker-like activity; Slow BOLD oscillations	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; RESTING-STATE; BRAIN; FREQUENCY; NEURONS; ORIGIN; EEG; HRV; HZ	Objective: Although about 1-2% of MRI examinations must be aborted due to anxiety, there is little research on how MRI-related anxiety affects BOLD signals in resting states. Methods: We re-analyzed cardiac beat-to beat interval (RRI) and BOLD signals of 23 healthy fMRI participants in four resting states by calculation of phase-coupling in the 0.07-0.13 Hz band and determination of positive time delays (pTDs; RRI leading neural BOLD oscillations) and negative time delays (nTDs; RRI lagging behind vascular BOLD oscillations). State anxiety of each subject was assigned to either a low anxiety (LA) or a high anxiety (HA, with most participants exhibiting moderate anxiety symptoms) category based on the inside scanner assessed anxiety score. Results: Although anxiety strongly differed between HA and LA categories, no significant difference was found for nTDs. In contrast, pTDs indicating neural BOLD oscillations exhibited a significant cumulation in the high anxiety category. Conclusions: Findings may suggest that vascular BOLD oscillations related to slow cerebral blood circulation are of about similar intensity during low/no and elevated anxiety. In contrast, neural BOLD oscillations, which might be associated with a central rhythm generating mechanism (pacemaker-like activity), appear to be significantly intensified during elevated anxiety. Significance: The study provides evidence that fMRI-related anxiety can activate a central rhythm generating mechanism very likely located in the brain stem, associated with slow neural BOLD oscillation.

Aripiprazole monotherapy is a recommended option for the treatment of mania in BD. The electrophysiological markers of treatment response to aripiprazole could be potentially identified by quantitative Electroencephalography (qEEG). Methods: Twenty-four patients with BD were analysed retrospectively. Based on the percentage reduction in Young Mania Rating Scale, they were classified as responders (N = 14) and non-responders (N = 10) to aripiprazole monotherapy. Their resting-state qEEG recordings were examined. Spectral power across all frequency bands were calculated. Absolute powers for all frequency bands were compared between these groups. Results: Independent sample Mann-Whitney U test revealed that patients who did not respond to aripiprazole had greater gamma power than aripiprazole treatment responders. Conclusions: Based on the present findings, it can be proposed that excess in gamma power could be the electrophysiological biomarkers of unresponsiveness to aripiprazole treatment in BD.

We report that dentate spike type 2 (DSM) events initiated by medial entorhinal cortex II (MECII)-> dentate gyrus (DG) inputs promote SG(dom) and change excitation-inhibition coordinated discharge in DG, CA3, and CA1, whereas type 1 (DSL) events initiated by lateral entorhinal cortex II (LECII)-> DG inputs do not. Just before SG(dom), LECII-originating SG oscillations in DG and CA3-originating SG oscillations in CA1 phase and frequency synchronize at the DSM peak when discharge within DG and CA3 increases to promote excitation-inhibition cofiring within and across the DG -> CA3 -> CA1 pathway. This optimizes discharge for the 5-10 ms DG-to-CA1 neuro-transmission that SG(dom) initiates. DSM properties identify extrahippocampal control of SG(dom) and a cortico-hippocampal mechanism that switches between memory-related modes of information processing.

J	Rawls, E; Lamm, C				Rawls, Eric; Lamm, Connie			The aversion positivity: Mediofrontal cortical potentials reflect parametric aversive prediction errors and drive behavioral modification following negative reinforcement	CORTEX			English	Article						Feedback-related negativity (FRN); Reward positivity (RewP); Prediction error; Reinforcement learning; Negative reinforcement; Value; Salience; Signed; Unsigned	FEEDBACK-RELATED NEGATIVITY; MASS UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS; REWARD POSITIVITY; NEURAL SYSTEM; THETA; EEG; COMPONENTS; SENSITIVITY; ADAPTATION; DOPAMINE	Reinforcement learning capitalizes on prediction errors (PEs), representing the deviation of received outcomes from expected outcomes. Mediofrontal event-related potentials (ERPs), in particular the feedback-related negativity (FRN)/reward positivity (RewP), are related to PE signaling, but there is disagreement as to whether the FRN/RewP encode signed or unsigned PEs. PE encoding can potentially be dissected by time-frequency analysis, as frontal theta [4-8 Hz] might represent poor outcomes, while central delta [1-3 Hz] might instead represent rewarding outcomes. However, cortical PE signaling in negative reinforcement is still poorly understood, and the role of cortical PE representations in behavioral reinforcement learning following negative reinforcement is relatively unexplored. We recorded EEG while participants completed a task with matched positive and negative reinforcement outcome modalities, with parametrically manipulated single-trial outcomes producing positive and negative PEs. We first demonstrated that PEs systematically influence future behavior in both positive and negative reinforcement conditions. In negative reinforcement conditions, mediofrontal ERPs positively signaled unsigned PEs in a time window encompassing the P2 potential, and negatively signaled signed PEs for a time window encompassing the FRN/RewP and frontal P3 (an "aversion positivity"). Central delta power increased parametrically with increasingly aversive outcomes, contributing to the "aversion positivity". Finally, negative reinforcement ERPs correlated with RTs on the following trial, suggesting cortical PEs guide behavioral adaptations. Positive reinforcement PEs did not influence ERP or time-frequency activity, despite significant behavioral effects. These results demonstrate that mediofrontal PE signals are a mechanism underlying negative reinforcement learning, and that delta power increases for aversive outcomes might contribute to the "aversion positivity."

Our automatic sleep stage classification method contained preprocessing based on independent component analysis, feature extraction including spectral features, spectral edge frequency features, absolute spectral power, statistical features, Hjorth features, maximum-minimum distance and energy features, and a modified ReliefF feature selection. Finally, a support vector machine was employed to classify four states (awake, light sleep [LS], slow-wave sleep [SWS] and rapid eye movement [REM]). The overall accuracy of the Sleep-EDF database reached 90.10 ? 2.68% with a kappa coefficient of 0.87 ? 0.04. Furthermore, a depression recognition method was developed to distinguish the patients with depression from healthy subjects. Specifically, according to the differences in sleep patterns between the two groups, REM latency, sleep latency, LS proportion, SWS proportion, sleep maintenance and arousal times were employed in this study. Sleep data from 12 healthy individuals and 19 patients with depression were applied to the system. The accuracy of the recognition results reached 95.24%, thus verifying the feasibility of our approach.

Combining Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning for EEG Scalp Topograms Classification	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG topograms; convolutional neural network; CNN; ambiguous stimuli; pre-trained decoder	IMAGERY; ADAPTATION; CORTEX	Incorporating brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) into daily life requires reducing the reliance of decoding algorithms on the calibration or enabling calibration with the minimal burden on the user. A potential solution could be a pre-trained decoder demonstrating a reasonable accuracy on the naive operators. Addressing this issue, we considered ambiguous stimuli classification tasks and trained an artificial neural network to classify brain responses to the stimuli of low and high ambiguity. We built a pre-trained classifier utilizing time-frequency features corresponding to the fundamental neurophysiological processes shared between subjects. To extract these features, we statistically contrasted electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral power between the classes in the representative group of subjects. As a result, the pre-trained classifier achieved 74% accuracy on the data of newly recruited subjects. Analysis of the literature suggested that a pre-trained classifier could help naive users to start using BCI bypassing training and further increased accuracy during the feedback session. Thus, our results contribute to using BCI during paralysis or limb amputation when there is no explicit user-generated kinematic output to properly train a decoder. In machine learning, our approach may facilitate the development of transfer learning (TL) methods for addressing the cross-subject problem. It allows extracting the interpretable feature subspace from the source data (the representative group of subjects) related to the target data (a naive user), preventing the negative transfer in the cross-subject tasks.

Complex nonlinear behaviours have been shown from the single neuron level to the system level. For decades, linear connectivity analysis methods, such as correlation, coherence and Granger causality, have been extensively used to assess the neural connectivities and input-output interconnections in neural systems. Recent studies indicate that these linear methods can only capture a certain amount of neural activities and functional relationships, and therefore cannot describe neural behaviours in a precise or complete way. In this review, we highlight recent advances in nonlinear system identification of neural systems, corresponding time and frequency domain analysis, and novel neural connectivity measures based on nonlinear system identification techniques. We argue that nonlinear modelling and analysis are necessary to study neuronal processing and signal transfer in neural systems quantitatively. These approaches can hopefully provide new insights to advance our understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms underlying neural functions. These nonlinear approaches also have the potential to produce sensitive biomarkers to facilitate the development of precision diagnostic tools for evaluating neurological disorders and the effects of targeted intervention.

Neuronal biomarkers of Parkinson's disease are present in healthy aging	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Resting state EEG; Healthy aging; Parkinson's disease; PAC; Beta burst	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; BASAL GANGLIA; PATHOLOGICAL SYNCHRONIZATION; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; BETA-ACTIVITY; BOLD SIGNAL; OSCILLATIONS; AGE	The prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) increases with aging and both processes share similar cellular mechanisms and alterations in the dopaminergic system. Yet it remains to be investigated whether aging can also demonstrate electrophysiological neuronal signatures typically associated with PD. Previous work has shown that phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between the phase of beta oscillations and the amplitude of gamma oscillations as well as beta bursts features can serve as electrophysiological biomarkers for PD. Here we hypothesize that these metrics are also present in apparently healthy elderly subjects. Using resting state multichannel EEG measurements, we show that PAC between beta oscillation and broadband gamma activity (50-150 Hz) is elevated in a group of elderly (59-77 years) compared to young volunteers (20-35 years) without PD. Importantly, the increase of PAC is statistically significant even after ruling out confounds relating to changes in spectral power and non-sinusoidal shape of beta oscillation. Moreover, a trend for a higher percentage of longer beta bursts (> 0.2 s) along with the increase in their incidence rate is also observed for elderly subjects. Using inverse modeling, we further show that elevated PAC and longer beta bursts are most pronounced in the sensorimotor areas. Moreover, we show that PAC and longer beta bursts might reflect distinct mechanisms, since their spatial patterns only partially overlap and the correlation between them is weak. Taken together, our findings provide novel evidence that electrophysiological biomarkers of PD may already occur in apparently healthy elderly subjects. We hypothesize that PAC and beta bursts characteristics in aging might reflect a pre-clinical state of PD and suggest their predictive value to be tested in prospective longitudinal studies.

CORTEX			English	Article						Face categorization; Head orientation; EEG; Frequency-tagging	TEMPORAL CORTEX; VIEWPOINT DEPENDENCE; HUMAN BRAIN; VIEW; RECOGNITION; NEURONS; ADAPTATION; STIMULATION; IDENTITY; OBJECTS	Whether human categorization of visual stimuli as faces is optimal for full-front views, best revealing diagnostic features but lacking depth cues, remains largely unknown. To address this question, we presented 16 human observers with unsegmented natural images of different living and non-living objects at a fast rate (f = 12 Hz), with natural face images appearing at f/9 = 1.33 Hz. Faces posing all full-front or at 3/4 side view angles appeared in separate sequences. Robust frequency-tagged 1.33 Hz (and harmonic) occipito-temporal electroencephalographic (EEG) responses reflecting face-selective neural activity did not differ in overall amplitude between full-front and 3/4 side views. Despite this, alternating between full-front and 3/4 side views within a sequence led to significant responses at specific harmonics of .67 Hz (f/18), objectively isolating view-dependent face-selective responses over occipito-temporal regions. Critically, a time-domain analysis showed that these view-dependent face-selective responses reflected only an earlier response to full-front than 3/4 side views by 8-13 ms. Overall, these findings indicate that the face-selective neural representation is as robust for 3/4 side faces as for full-front faces in the human brain, but full-front views provide a slightly earlier processing-time advantage as compared to rotated face views.

However, the antiepileptic effect causing network reorganization has rarely been studied. Here, we assessed the impact of rTMS on functional network connectivity (FNC) in resting functional networks (RSNs) and their relation to treatment response. Fourteen patients with medically intractable epilepsy received inhibitive rTMS with a figure-of-eight coil over the vertex for 10 days spread across two weeks. We designed a 6-week follow-up phase divided into four time points to investigate FNC and rTMS-induced timing-dependent plasticity, such as seizure frequency and abnormal interictal discharges on electroencephalography (EEG). For psychiatric comorbidities, the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) were applied to measure depression and anxiety before and after rTMS. FNC was also compared to that of a cohort of 17 healthy control subjects. The after-effects of rTMS included all subjects that achieved the significant decrease rate of more than 50% in interictal epileptiform discharges and seizure frequency, 12 (14) patients with the reduction rate above 50% compared to the baseline, as well as emotional improvements in depression and anxiety (p < 0.05). In the analysis of RSNs, we found a higher synchronization between the sensorimotor network (SMN) and posterior default-mode network (pDMN) in epileptic patients than in healthy controls. In contrast to pre-rTMS, the results demonstrated a weaker FNC between the anterior DMN (aDMN) and SMN after rTMS, while the FNC between the aDMN and dorsal attention network (DAN) was greater (p < 0.05, FDR corrected). Importantly, the depressive score was anticorrelated with the FNC of the aDMN-SMN (r = -0.67, p = 0.0022), which was markedly different in the good and bad response groups treated with rTMS (p = 0.0115). Based on the vertex suppression by rTMS, it is possible to achieve temporary clinical efficacy by modulating network reorganization in the DMN and SMN for patients with refractory epilepsy.

J	Kamrud, A; Borghetti, B; Kabban, CS				Kamrud, Alexander; Borghetti, Brett; Schubert Kabban, Christine			The Effects of Individual Differences, Non-Stationarity, and the Importance of Data Partitioning Decisions for Training and Testing of EEG Cross-Participant Models	SENSORS			English	Article						EEG; deep learning; non-stationarity; individual differences; inter-subject variability; covariate shift; cross-participant; inter-participant	COVARIATE SHIFT; OSCILLATIONS	EEG-based deep learning models have trended toward models that are designed to perform classification on any individual (cross-participant models). However, because EEG varies across participants due to non-stationarity and individual differences, certain guidelines must be followed for partitioning data into training, validation, and testing sets, in order for cross-participant models to avoid overestimation of model accuracy. Despite this necessity, the majority of EEG-based cross-participant models have not adopted such guidelines. Furthermore, some data repositories may unwittingly contribute to the problem by providing partitioned test and non-test datasets for reasons such as competition support. In this study, we demonstrate how improper dataset partitioning and the resulting improper training, validation, and testing of a cross-participant model leads to overestimated model accuracy. We demonstrate this mathematically, and empirically, using five publicly available datasets. To build the cross-participant models for these datasets, we replicate published results and demonstrate how the model accuracies are significantly reduced when proper EEG cross-participant model guidelines are followed. Our empirical results show that by not following these guidelines, error rates of cross-participant models can be underestimated between 35% and 3900%. This misrepresentation of model performance for the general population potentially slows scientific progress toward truly high-performing classification models.

A noise-robust sparse approach to the time-frequency representation of visual evoked potentials	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Renyi entropy; Synchroextracting transform; Synchrosqueezing transform; Time-frequency representation; Visual evoked potentials; Wavelets	SLEEP STAGES CLASSIFICATION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; CHIRPLET TRANSFORM; SEIZURE DETECTION; EEG SIGNALS; LOCALIZATION; SPECTRUM	Background: Visual evoked potential (VEP) offers a promising research strategy in the effort to characterise brain disorders. Pertinent signal processing techniques enable the development of potential applications of VEP. A joint time-frequency (TF) representation provides more comprehensive information about the underlying complex structures of these signals than individual time or frequency analysis. However, this representation comes at the expense of low TF resolution, increased data volume, poor energy concentration and increased computational time. Owing to the high non-stationarity and low signal-to-noise ratio of VEP, a TF representation that retains only the pertinent components is indispensable. Method: The objective of this study is to investigate and demonstrate the ability of various TF approaches to provide an energy-concentrated and sparse TF representation of VEP. The performance of each method has been assessed for its energy concentration and reconstruction ability on both simulated and real VEPs. Renyi entropy, computation time and correlation coefficient are chosen as the performance measures for the assessment. Results: In comparison with the other state-of-the-art approaches, Synchroextracting transform (SET) exhibits the lowest Renyi entropy and the highest correlation coefficient, thereby ensuring a compact TF representation for the better characterisation of VEP signals. These results are also statistically verified through the Friedman test ( p < 0.001). Conclusion: SET assures a powerful TF framework with improved energy concentration at a faster pace while remaining invertible and preserving vital information.

J	Martinez-Canada, P; Ness, TV; Einevoll, GT; Fellin, T; Panzeri, S				Martinez-Canada, Pablo; Ness, Torbjorn V.; Einevoll, Gaute T.; Fellin, Tommaso; Panzeri, Stefano			Computation of the electroencephalogram (EEG) from network models of point neurons	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; PARVALBUMIN-POSITIVE INTERNEURONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; TRAVELING-WAVES; MECHANISMS; FREQUENCY; DYNAMICS; SYNCHRONIZATION; SIMULATION; EXCITATION/INHIBITION	Author summary Networks of point neurons are widely used to model neural dynamics. Their output, however, cannot be directly compared to the electroencephalogram (EEG), which is one of the most used tools to non-invasively measure brain activity. To allow a direct integration between neural network theory and empirical EEG data, here we derived a new mathematical expression, termed EEG proxy, which estimates with high accuracy the EEG based simply on the variables available from simulations of point-neuron network models. To compare and validate these EEG proxies, we computed a realistic ground-truth EEG produced by a network of simulated neurons with realistic 3D morphologies that receive the same synaptic input of the simpler network of point neurons. The new obtained EEG proxies outperformed previous approaches and worked well under a wide range of network configurations with different cell morphologies, distribution of presynaptic inputs, position of the recording electrode and spatial extension of the network. The new proxies approximated well both EEG spectra and EEG evoked potentials. Our work provides important mathematical tools that allow a better interpretation of experimentally measured EEGs in terms of neural models of brain function. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a major tool for non-invasively studying brain function and dysfunction. Comparing experimentally recorded EEGs with neural network models is important to better interpret EEGs in terms of neural mechanisms. Most current neural network models use networks of simple point neurons. They capture important properties of cortical dynamics, and are numerically or analytically tractable. However, point neurons cannot generate an EEG, as EEG generation requires spatially separated transmembrane currents. Here, we explored how to compute an accurate approximation of a rodent's EEG with quantities defined in point-neuron network models. We constructed different approximations (or proxies) of the EEG signal that can be computed from networks of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) point neurons, such as firing rates, membrane potentials, and combinations of synaptic currents. We then evaluated how well each proxy reconstructed a ground-truth EEG obtained when the synaptic currents of the LIF model network were fed into a three-dimensional network model of multicompartmental neurons with realistic morphologies. Proxies based on linear combinations of AMPA and GABA currents performed better than proxies based on firing rates or membrane potentials. A new class of proxies, based on an optimized linear combination of time-shifted AMPA and GABA currents, provided the most accurate estimate of the EEG over a wide range of network states. The new linear proxies explained 85-95% of the variance of the ground-truth EEG for a wide range of network configurations including different cell morphologies, distributions of presynaptic inputs, positions of the recording electrode, and spatial extensions of the network. Non-linear EEG proxies using a convolutional neural network (CNN) on synaptic currents increased proxy performance by a further 2-8%. Our proxies can be used to easily calculate a biologically realistic EEG signal directly from point-neuron simulations thus facilitating a quantitative comparison between computational models and experimental EEG recordings.

We here establish a long-sought link between large-scale neural communications in electrophysiology and behavioral success in the control of attention in difficult listening situations. In an age-varying sample of N = 154 individuals, we find that connectivity between intrinsic neural oscillations extracted from source-reconstructed electroencephalography is regulated according to the listener's goal during a challenging dual-talker task. These dynamics occur as spatially organized modulations in power-envelope correlations of alpha and low-beta neural oscillations during approximately 2-s intervals most critical for listening behavior relative to resting-state baseline. First, left frontoparietal low-beta connectivity (16 to 24 Hz) increased during anticipation and processing of spatial-attention cue before speech presentation. Second, posterior alpha connectivity (7 to 11 Hz) decreased during comprehension of competing speech, particularly around target-word presentation. Connectivity dynamics of these networks were predictive of individual differences in the speed and accuracy of target-word identification, respectively, but proved unconfounded by changes in neural oscillatory activity strength. Successful adaptation to a listening challenge thus latches onto 2 distinct yet complementary neural systems: a beta-tuned frontoparietal network enabling the flexible adaptation to attentive listening state and an alpha-tuned posterior network supporting attention to speech.

Over 15 million patients with epilepsy worldwide do not respond to drugs. Successful surgical treatment requires complete removal or disconnection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ), brain region(s) where seizures originate. Unfortunately, surgical success rates vary between 30 and 70% because no clinically validated biological marker of the SOZ exists. We develop and retrospectively validate a new electroencephalogram (EEG) marker-neural fragility-in a retrospective analysis of 91 patients by using neural fragility of the annotated SOZ as a metric to predict surgical outcomes. Fragility predicts 43 out of 47 surgical failures, with an overall prediction accuracy of 76% compared with the accuracy of clinicians at 48% (successful outcomes). In failed outcomes, we identify fragile regions that were untreated. When compared to 20 EEG features proposed as SOZ markers, fragility outperformed in predictive power and interpretability, which suggests neural fragility as an EEG biomarker of the SOZ.

J	Pretel, J; Torres, JJ; Marro, J				Pretel, Jorge; Torres, Joaquin J.; Marro, Joaquin			EEGs Disclose Significant Brain Activity Correlated with Synaptic Fickleness	BIOLOGY-BASEL			English	Article						EEG time series; synaptic plasticity; modulations and explosive transitions in brain waves	NEURONS; ENCEPHALOPATHY; RELEASE; RHYTHMS; MODEL	Simple Summary In this study, we explore the emergence of oscillatory behavior similar to the signals of brain activity observed in electroencephalograms (EEGs) using a network of synaptic relations mingling excitatory and inhibitory neuron nodes. We identify abrupt variations on that activity brought about by swift synaptic mediations. These changes are originated by the slowdown of the activity of inhibitory neuron populations due to synaptic depression. The latter generates an imbalance between excitation and inhibition causing a quick explosive increase of excitatory activity, which turns out to be a (first-order) phase transition among different oscillatory states. Interestingly enough, near this transition, our model system exhibits oscillatory activity with a strong component in the delta-theta domain that coexist with fast oscillations and happens to be similar to the observed delta-gamma and theta-gamma modulation in actual brains. Our findings here help to understand actual brain activity data in terms of nonequilibrium phase transitions theory. We here study a network of synaptic relations mingling excitatory and inhibitory neuron nodes that displays oscillations quite similar to electroencephalogram (EEG) brain waves, and identify abrupt variations brought about by swift synaptic mediations. We thus conclude that corresponding changes in EEG series surely come from the slowdown of the activity in neuron populations due to synaptic restrictions. The latter happens to generate an imbalance between excitation and inhibition causing a quick explosive increase of excitatory activity, which turns out to be a (first-order) transition among dynamic mental phases. Moreover, near this phase transition, our model system exhibits waves with a strong component in the so-called delta-theta domain that coexist with fast oscillations. These findings provide a simple explanation for the observed delta-gamma and theta-gamma modulation in actual brains, and open a serious and versatile path to understand deeply large amounts of apparently erratic, easily accessible brain data.

Modulation of Peak Alpha Frequency Oscillations During Working Memory Is Greater in Females Than Males	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha oscillations; EEG &#8211; electroencephalogram; peak alpha frequency; sex differences; working memory	EEG-ALPHA; GENDER SIMILARITIES; BACKGROUND ACTIVITY; MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; PERFORMANCE; THETA; POWER; INFORMATION; VARIABILITY; MAINTENANCE	Peak alpha frequency is known to vary not just between individuals, but also within an individual over time. While variance in this metric between individuals has been tied to working memory performance, less understood are how short timescale modulations of peak alpha frequency during task performance may facilitate behavior. This gap in understanding may be bridged by consideration of a key difference between individuals: sex. Inconsistent findings in the literature regarding the relationship between peak alpha frequency and cognitive performance, as well as known sex-related-differences in peak alpha frequency and its modulation motivated our hypothesis that cognitive and neural processes underlying working memory-modulation of peak alpha frequency in particular-may differ based upon sex. Targeting sex as a predictive factor, we analyzed the EEG data of participants recorded while they performed four versions of a visual spatial working memory task. A significant difference between groups was present: females modulated peak alpha frequency more than males. Task performance did not differ by sex, yet a relationship between accuracy and peak alpha frequency was present in males, but not in females. These findings highlight the importance of considering sex as a factor in the study of oscillatory activity, particularly to further understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie working memory.

However, it remains unclear how neural responses in the sensorimotor, cognitive, and affective subsystems vary dynamically in the first few hundreds of milliseconds to generate racial ingroup favoritism in empathy for pain. We recorded magnetoencephalography signals to pain and neutral expressions of Asian and white faces from Chinese adults during judgments of racial identity of each face. We found that pain compared to neutral expressions of same-race faces induced early increased alpha oscillations in the precuneus/parietal cortices followed by increased alpha-band oscillations in the left anterior insula and temporoparietal junction. Pain compared to neutral expressions of other-race faces, however, induced early suppression of alpha-band oscillations in the bilateral sensorimotor cortices and left insular cortex. Moreover, decreased functional connectivity between the left sensorimotor cortex and left anterior insula predicted reduced subjective feelings of other-race suffering. Our results unraveled distinct patterns of modulations of neural dynamics of sensorimotor, affective, and cognitive components of empathy by interracial relationships between an observer and a target person, which provide possible brain mechanisms for understanding racial ingroup favoritism in social behavior.

Methods: Fifteen mild upper limb paretic stroke patients and age-matched healthy controls were included. Repeated trials of finger tapping around the 10th and 100th days after stroke onset were recorded with a 128-channel EEG. Power spectra and Inter Trial Coherence (ITC) calculations were synchronized to tappings. ITC was correlated with motor performance. Results: ITC, in low frequency bands, designates the motor related bioelectric activity in channel space in both healthy subjects and patients. Ten days after stroke onset, delta-theta ITC was severely reduced compared to baseline, while three months later ITC reorganized partially over the ipsilesional central parietal areas reflecting the improvement of motor networks. Decreased ITC in the central-parietal area remained significant compared to controls. Delta band ITC over the dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex correlates with the performance on Nine Hole Peg Test. At post-recovery, non-paretic hand tappings show significantly decreased delta-theta ITC over the supplementary motor area, which reflects network remodeling. Conclusions: Inter Trial Coherence is a useful measure of brain reorganization during stroke recovery. Significance: Delta-theta ITC is a sensitive indicator of impaired motor execution.

To examine the characteristics of neural dynamics related to such inhibition of habitual behaviors, we used a modified rock-paper-scissors (RPS) task that consisted of a basic, a lose-, and a win-conditioned game. Spectral and phase synchrony analyses were conducted to examine the acquired electroencephalogram signals across the entire brain during all RPS tasks. Temporal variations in frontal theta power activities were directly in line with the stream of RPS procedures in accordance with the task conditions. The lose-conditioned RPS task gave rise to increases in the local frontal power and global phase-synchronized pairs of theta oscillations. The activation of the global phase-synchronized network preceded the activation of frontal theta power. These results demonstrate that the frontal regions play a pivotal role in the inhibition of habitual behaviors-stereotyped and ingrained stimulus-response mappings that have been established over time. This study suggests that frontal theta oscillations may be engaged during the cognitive inhibition of habitual behaviors and that these oscillations characterize the degree of cognitive load required to inhibit habitual behaviors.

Aim of the study was to investigate, through a single trial analysis of the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the cortical sources of EEG rhythms, whether there are EEG markers, which can predict trial-by-trial the subject's performance as measured by the reaction time (RT). 20 healthy adult volunteers performed a specific visuomotor task while continuously recorded with a 64 electrodes EEG. For each single trial, the PSD of the cortical sources of EEG rhythms was obtained from EEG data to cortical current density time series in 12 regions of interest at Brodmann areas level. Results showed a statistically significant increase of posterior and limbic alpha 1 and of frontal beta 2 power, and a reduction of frontal and limbic delta and of temporal alpha 1 power, during triggering stimulus presentation for better performance, namely faster responses. At single trial level, correlation analyses between RTs and significant PSD, revealed positive correlations in frontal delta, temporal alpha 1, and limbic delta bands, and negative ones in frontal beta 2, parietal alpha 1, and occipital alpha 1 bands. Furthermore, the subject's faster responses have been found as correlated with the similarity between the PSD values in parietal and occipital alpha 1. Predicting individual's performance at single trial level, might be extremely useful in the clinical context, since it could allow to launch rehabilitative therapies in the most efficient brain state, avoiding useless interventions.

There is a need of interpretable computational intelligence techniques and new brain states decoding for more understandable interpretation of the sensory, cognitive, and motor brain processing. We propose a general-purpose fuzzy software system shell for developing a custom EEG BCI system. It relies on the bursts of the ongoing EEG frequency power synchronization/desynchronization at scalp level and supports quick BCI setup by linguistic features, ad hoc fuzzy membership construction, explainable IF-THEN rules, and the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT), which makes the BCI system device and service independent. It has a potential for designing both passive and event-related BCIs with options for visual representation at scalp-source level in response to time. The feasibility of the proposed system has been proven by real experiments and bursts for beta and gamma frequency power have been detected in real time in response to evoked visuospatial selective attention. The presence of the proposed new brain state decoding can be used as a feasible metric for interpretation of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the passive or evoked neural oscillations.

J	Baena, D; Cantero, JL; Atienza, M				Baena, Daniel; Cantero, Jose L.; Atienza, Mercedes			Stability of neural encoding moderates the contribution of sleep and repeated testing to memory consolidation	NEUROBIOLOGY OF LEARNING AND MEMORY			English	Article						EEG pattern similarity; Memory consolidation; Differentiation; Generalization; Sleep; Slow oscillation-spindle coupling	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; PATTERN SIMILARITY; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; RETRIEVAL NETWORK; SPINDLES; HIPPOCAMPAL; REACTIVATION; HUMANS; SYSTEMS; TRACE	There is evidence suggesting that online consolidation during retrieval-mediated learning interacts with offline consolidation during subsequent sleep to transform memory. Here we investigate whether this interaction persists when retrieval-mediated learning follows post-training sleep and whether the direction of this interaction is conditioned by the quality of encoding resulting from manipulation of the amount of sleep on the previous night. The quality of encoding was determined by computing the degree of similarity between EEG-activity patterns across restudy of face pairs in two groups of young participants, one who slept the last 4 h of the pre-training night, and another who slept 8 h. The offline consolidation was assessed by computing the degree of coupling between slow oscillations (SOs) and spindles (SPs) during post-training sleep, while the online consolidation was evaluated by determining the degree of similarity between EEG-activity patterns recorded during the study phase and during repeated recognition of either the same face pair (i.e., specific similarity) or face pairs sharing sex and profession (i.e., categorical similarity) to evaluate differentiation and generalization, respectively. The study and recognition phases were separated by a night of normal sleep duration. Mixed-effects models revealed that the stability of neural encoding moderated the relationship between sleep- and retrieval-mediated consolidation processes over left frontal regions. For memories showing lower encoding stability, the enhanced SO-SP coupling was associated with increased reinstatement of category-specific encoding-related activity at the expense of content-specific activity, whilst the opposite occurred for memories showing greater encoding stability. Overall, these results suggest that offline consolidation during post-training sleep interacts with online consolidation during retrieval the next day to favor the reorganization of memory contents, by increasing specificity of stronger memories and generalization of the weaker ones.

The indicators of emotional status were involuntary reactions of the summary skin potential (SSP) and arbitrary clicks by subjects on the "like" or "dislike" buttons while listening to melodies. The frequency of arbitrary button clicks serves as an indicator of the degree of differentiation (detail) of the conscious perception of various elements of the melody. By digital processing of the SSP, its derivatives were obtained - heart rate, median frequency and the RMS amplitude of the SSP as functions of time, etc. The temporal dynamics of these indicators turned out to be more intense compared to the frequency of pressing, which is explained by the specificity of the interaction between conscious and unconscious levels of perceptions. In connection with the use of several indicators of continuous emotional dynamics, there is a need for their integral representation. An example of such integration is given for two indicators in the form of individual approximating ellipses. In the future, it is planned to use modern computer graphics to solve the problem.

For example, alpha activity development is a vision-dependent mechanism. Indeed, studies report no alpha activity is present in blind adults. Nevertheless, studies have not investigated the developmental trajectory of this activity in infants and children with blindness. Here, we hypothesize that the difference in neural activity of blind compared to sighted subjects is: absent at birth, progressive with age, specifically occipital and linked to a gradual motor impairment. Therefore, we consider spectral power of resting-state EEG and its association with motor impairment indices, in blind subjects and in sighted controls between 0 and 11 years of age. Blind subjects show posterior alpha activity during the first three years of life, although weaker and slower maturing compared to sighted subjects. The first great differentiation between blind and sighted subjects occurs between 3 and 6 years of age. Starting in this period, reduced alpha activity increases the probability of motor impairment in blind subjects, likely because of impaired perception/interaction. These results show that visual experience mediates the neural mechanisms generating alpha oscillations during the first years of life, suggesting that it is a sensitive period for the plasticity of this process.

Computational characteristics of interictal EEG as objective markers of epileptic spasms	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Infantile spasms; West syndrome; Detrended fluctuation analysis; Long-range temporal correlations; Functional connectivity; Entropy	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; INFANTILE SPASMS; TREATMENT RESPONSE; WEST SYNDROME; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURONAL NETWORKS; HYPSARRHYTHMIA; FREQUENCY; ACTH; OSCILLATIONS	Objective: Favorable neurodevelopmental outcomes in epileptic spasms (ES) are tied to early diagnosis and prompt treatment, but uncertainty in the identification of the disease can delay this process. Therefore, we investigated five categories of computational electroencephalographic (EEG) measures as markers of ES. Methods: We measured 1) amplitude, 2) power spectra, 3) Shannon entropy and permutation entropy, 4) long-range temporal correlations, via detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and 5) functional connectivity using cross-correlation and phase lag index (PLI). EEG data were analyzed from ES patients (n = 40 patients) and healthy controls (n = 20 subjects), with multiple blinded measurements during wakefulness and sleep for each patient. Results: In ES patients, EEG amplitude was significantly higher in all electrodes when compared to controls. Shannon and permutation entropy were lower in ES patients than control subjects. The DFA intercept values in ES patients were significantly higher than control subjects, while DFA exponent values were not significantly different between the groups. EEG functional connectivity networks in ES patients were significantly stronger than controls when based on both cross-correlation and PLI. Significance for all statistical tests was p < 0.05, adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure as appropriate. Finally, using logistic regression, a multi-attribute classifier was derived that accurately distinguished cases from controls (area under curve of 0.96). Conclusions: Computational EEG features successfully distinguish ES patients from controls in a large, blinded study. Significance: These objective EEG markers, in combination with other clinical factors, may speed the diagnosis and treatment of the disease, thereby improving long-term outcomes.

A nap normalized both EEG and performance changes. We now ascertain whether extensive visual declarative learning produces results similar to motor learning. Thus, during the morning, we recorded high-density EEG in well rested young healthy subjects that learned the order of different visual sequence task (VSEQ) for three one-hour blocks. Afterward, a group of subjects took a nap and another rested quietly. Between each VSEQ block, we recorded spontaneous EEG (sEEG) at rest and assessed performance in a motor test and a visual working memory test that shares similarities with VSEQ. We found that after the third block, VSEQ induced local theta power increases in the sEEG over a right temporo-parietal area that was engaged during the task. This local theta increase was preceded by increases in alpha and beta power over the same area and was paralleled by performance decline in the visual working memory test. Only after the nap, VSEQ learning rate improved and performance in the visual working memory test was restored, together with partial normalization of the local sEEG changes. These results suggest that intensive learning, like motor learning, produces local theta power increases, possibly reflecting local neuronal fatigue. Sleep may be necessary to resolve neuronal fatigue and its effects on learning and performance.	[Ricci, Serena; Tatti, Elisa; Nelson, Aaron B.; Panday, Priya; Chen, Henry; Ghilardi, M.

The emotional response to olfactory stimuli implies the activation of a complex cascade of events triggered by structures lying in the limbic system. However, little is known about how this activation is projected up to cerebral cortex and how different cortical areas dynamically interact each other. Approach. In this study, we acquired EEG from human participants performing a passive odor-perception task with odorants conveying positive, neutral and negative valence. A novel methodological pipeline integrating global field power (GFP), independent component analysis (ICA), dipole source localization was applied to estimate effective connectivity in the challenging scenario of single-trial low-synchronized stimulation. Main results. We identified the brain network and the neural paths, elicited at different frequency bands, i.e. theta(4 - 7Hz), alpha(8 - 12Hz) beta(13 - 30Hz), involved in odor valence processing. This brain network includes the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the cingulate gyrus (CgG), the superior temporal gyrus (STG), the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu) and the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG). It was analyzed using a time-varying multivariate autoregressive model to resolve time-frequency causal interactions. Specifically, the OFC acts as the main node for odor perception and evaluation of pleasant and unpleasant stimuli, whereas no specific path was observed for a neutral stimulus. Significance. The results introduce new evidences on the role of the OFC during hedonic perception and underpin its specificity during the odor valence assessment. Our findings suggest that, after the odor onset different, bidirectional interactions occur between the OFC and other brain regions associated with emotion recognition/categorization and memory according to the stimulus valence. This outcome unveils how the hedonic olfactory network dynamically changes based on odor valence.

The core idea is to learn plausible computational and biological representations by correlating human neural activity and natural images. Thus, we first propose a model, EEG-ChannelNet, to learn a brain manifold for EEG classification. After verifying that visual information can be extracted from EEG data, we introduce a multimodal approach that uses deep image and EEG encoders, trained in a siamese configuration, for learning a joint manifold that maximizes a compatibility measure between visual features and brain representations. We then carry out image classification and saliency detection on the learned manifold. Performance analyses show that our approach satisfactorily decodes visual information from neural signals. This, in turn, can be used to effectively supervise the training of deep learning models, as demonstrated by the high performance of image classification and saliency detection on out-of-training classes. The obtained results show that the learned brain-visual features lead to improved performance and simultaneously bring deep models more in line with cognitive neuroscience work related to visual perception and attention.

The alpha rhythm (similar to 10 Hz) is the dominant resting state electrical cycle and each person has a propensity toward a particular frequency of oscillation for this rhythm. This individual alpha peak frequency (IAPF) is hypothesized to be central to visual perceptual processes and may have downstream influences on cognitive functions such as attention, working memory, or problem solving. In the current study we sought to determine whether IAPF was slower in schizophrenia, and whether lower IAPF predicted deficits in visual perception and cognition that are often observed in schizophrenia. Eyes-closed resting state EEG activity, visual attention, and global cognitive functioning were assessed in individuals with schizophrenia (N = 104) and a group of healthy controls (N = 101). Compared to controls, the schizophrenia group showed slower IAPF and was associated with poorer discrimination of visual targets and nontargets on a computerized attention task, as well as impaired global cognition measured using neuropsychological tests across groups. Notably, disruptions in visual attention fully mediated the relationship between IAPF and global cognition across groups. The current findings demonstrate that slower alpha oscillatory cycling accounts for global cognitive deficits in schizophrenia by way of impairments in perceptual discrimination measured during a visual attention task.

However, the use of mathematical models for this purpose is relatively unexplored. The present study investigates the effects of three different auditory stimuli on cerebral biopotentials by means of mathematical functions. The effects of acoustic stimuli (S1, S2, and S3) on cerebral activity were evaluated by electroencephalographic (EEG) recording on 21 subjects for 20 minutes of stimulation, with a 5-minute period of silence before and after stimulation. For the construction of the mathematical models used for the study of the EEG rhythms, we used the Box-Jenkins methodology. Characteristic mathematical models were obtained for the main frequency bands and were expressed by 2 constant functions, 8 first-degree functions, a second-degree function, a fourth-degree function, 6 recursive functions, and 4 periodic functions. The values obtained for the variance estimator are low, demonstrating that the obtained models are correct. The resulting mathematical models allow us to objectively compare the EEG response to the three stimuli, both between the stimuli itself and between each stimulus and the period before stimulation.

Patients with DD often manifest a left-sided FAA: relatively higher alpha power in the left versus right frontal lobe. Recently, however, multiple studies failed to confirm this effect, questioning its reproducibility. Our purpose is to thoroughly test the validity of FAA in depression by conducting a multiverse analysis - running many related analyses and testing the sensitivity of the effect to changes in the analytical approach - on data from five independent studies. Only 13 of the 270 analyses revealed significant results. We conclude the paper by discussing theoretical assumptions underlying the FAA and suggest a list of guidelines for improving and expanding the EEG data analysis in future FAA studies.

Cortical and Striatal Electroencephalograms and Apomorphine Effects in the FUS Mouse Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						ALS progression; dopamine; EEG; frequency spectrum; primary motor cortex; putamen	AGE-DEPENDENT CHANGES; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; BASAL GANGLIA; DOPAMINERGIC-NEURONS; MECHANISMS; RECEPTOR; BINDING; HYPEREXCITABILITY; OSCILLATIONS; PLASTICITY	Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by degeneration of motor neurons resulting in muscle atrophy. In contrast to the lower motor neurons, the role of upper (cortical) neurons in ALS is yet unclear. Maturation of locomotor networks is supported by dopaminergic (DA) projections from substantia nigra to the spinal cord and striatum. Objective: To examine the contribution of DA mediation in the striatum-cortex networks in ALS progression. Methods: We studied electroencephalogram (EEG) from striatal putamen (Pt) and primary motor cortex (M1) in Delta FUS(1-359)-transgenic (Tg) mice, a model of ALS. EEG from M1 and Pt were recorded in freely moving young (2-month-old) and older (5-month-old) Tg and non-transgenic (nTg) mice. EEG spectra were analyzed for 30 min before and for 60 min after systemic injection of a DA mimetic, apomorphine (APO), and saline. Results: In young Tg versus nTg mice, baseline EEG spectra in M1 were comparable, whereas in Pt, beta activity in Tg mice was enhanced. In older Tg versus nTg mice, beta dominated in EEG from both M1 and Pt, whereas theta and delta 2 activities were reduced. In younger Tg versus nTg mice, APO increased theta and decreased beta 2 predominantly in M1. In older mice, APO effects in these frequency bands were inversed and accompanied by enhanced delta 2 and attenuated alpha in Tg versus nTg mice. Conclusion: We suggest that revealed EEG modifications in Delta FUS(1-359)-transgenic mice are associated with early alterations in the striatum-cortex interrelations and DA transmission followed by adaptive intracerebral transformations.

Differences in Rhythmic Neural Activity Supporting the Temporal and Spatial Cueing of Attention	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						attentional orienting; magnetoencephalography; neural oscillations; spatial attention; temporal attention	ALPHA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; DIRECTING ATTENTION; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; PHASE ENTRAINMENT; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; VISUAL-ATTENTION; EEG	The neural processes serving the orienting of attention toward goal-relevant stimuli are generally examined with informative cues that direct visual attention to a spatial location. However, cues predicting the temporal emergence of an object are also known to be effective in attentional orienting but are implemented less often. Differences in the neural oscillatory dynamics supporting these divergent types of attentional orienting have only rarely been examined. In this study, we utilized magnetoencephalography and an adapted Posner cueing task to investigate the spectral specificity of neural oscillations underlying these different types of attentional orienting (i.e., spatial vs. temporal). We found a spectral dissociation of attentional cueing, such that alpha (10-16 Hz) oscillations were central to spatial orienting and theta (3-6 Hz) oscillations were critical to temporal orienting. Specifically, we observed robust decreases in alpha power during spatial orienting in key attention areas (i.e., lateral occipital, posterior cingulate, and hippocampus), along with strong theta increases during temporal orienting in the primary visual cortex. These results suggest that the oscillatory dynamics supporting attentional orienting are spectrally and anatomically specific, such that spatial orienting is served by stronger alpha oscillations in attention regions, whereas temporal orienting is associated with stronger theta responses in visual sensory regions.

These abilities have been associated with brain oscillations, especially parietal gamma and alpha bands, but it is yet unknown whether these oscillations also modulate attention and inhibitory abilities. To test this, we compared parietal gamma-transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to alpha-tACS and to a non-stimulation condition (Sham) in 51 young participants. Stimulation was coupled with a WM task probing memory-based attention and inhibitory abilities by means of probabilistic retrospective cues, including informative (valid), uninformative (invalid) and neutral. Our results show that relative to alpha and sham stimulation, parietal gamma-tACS significantly increased working memory recall precision. Additional post hoc analyses also revealed strong individual variability before and following stimulation; low-baseline performers showed no significant changes in performance following both gamma and alpha-tACS relative to sham. In contrast, in high-baseline performers gamma- (but not alpha) tACS selectively and significantly improved misbinding-feature errors as well as memory precision, particularly in uninformative (invalid) cues which rely more strongly on attentional abilities. We concluded that parietal gamma oscillations, therefore, modulate working memory recall processes, although baseline performance may further influence the effect of stimulation.

For three weeks they stayed in the water filled tub without bodily support in supine position while isolated by waterproof material (this procedure is known as dry immersion - DI). During this period, they performed computer mouse pointing task and corresponding brain activity was evaluated by means of EEG: movement related and cognitive event-related potentials as well as resting state electroencephalogram were registered). Pointing task was performed before DI and at the time after initial period of adaptation - at the 5th and 17th days of DI. No deterioration of pointing task performance was found. Movement related potentials were not changed as well as cognitive peak P3, and only N1 peak significantly decreased at the 17th day of DI. Occipital alpha EEG also became significantly more pronounced at the 17th day of DI. Dry immersion procedure is thought to reproduce space flight physiological effects quite well, due to the DI specific feature - support withdrawal. Thus, results obtained indicate that support withdrawal also affects brain functioning in a specific way: increased alpha EEG is accompanied by altered visual processing (as indexed by diminished N1). Although these alterations are not sufficient to disrupt well learned mouse pointing task.

However, it has been remained to be unclear how midfrontal theta and occipital gamma oscillations, which are associated with high-level cognitive functions, would be involved in this process to facilitate performance. Here we addressed this fundamental open question in healthy young adults by measuring high-density cortical activity during a precision force-matching task. We manipulated the amount of error by changing visual feedback gain (low, medium, and high visual gains) and analyzed event-related spectral perturbations. Increasing the visual feedback gain resulted in a decrease in force error and variability. There was an increase in theta synchronization in the midfrontal area and also in beta desynchronization in the sensorimotor and posterior parietal areas with higher visual feedback gains. Gamma de/synchronization was not evident during the task. In addition, we found a moderation effect of midfrontal theta on the positive relationship between the beta oscillations and force error. Subsequent simple slope analysis indicated that the effect of beta oscillations on force error was weaker when midfrontal theta was high. Our findings suggest that the midfrontal area signals the increased need of cognitive control to refine behavior by modulating the visuomotor processing at theta frequencies.

It is assumed that mental templates of expected sensory input are created and compared to actual input, which can be matching or not. When such mental templates are held in working memory, cross-frequency phase synchronization (CFS) between theta and gamma band activity has been proposed to serve matching processes between prediction and sensation. We investigated how this is affected by the number of activated templates that could be matched by comparing conditions where participants had to keep either one or multiple templates in mind for successful visual search. We found a transient CFS between EEG theta and gamma activity in an early time window around 150 ms after search display presentation, in right hemispheric parietal cortex. Our results suggest that for single template conditions, stronger transient theta-gamma CFS at posterior sites contralateral to target presentation can be observed than for multiple templates. This can be interpreted as evidence to the idea of sequential attentional templates. But mainly, it is understood in line with previous theoretical accounts strongly arguing for transient synchronization between posterior theta and gamma phase as a neural correlate of matching incoming sensory information with contents from working memory and as evidence for limitations in memory matching during multiple template search.

Applications range from the brain (EEG), the heart (ECG) and the financial markets (bid prices), to the sun (solar intensity readings) and river flows. HVGs have also been extended to image-based pattern recognition. Efficient and scalable online HVG construction is vital to extending HVG-based time series analysis to long, streaming, and distributed real-world time series data. The fastest scalable method for constructing HVGs today is the binary search tree (BST) encoding-decoding algorithm, which is O(n log n) in time series length for balanced data such as noise. However, in practice BST is highly sensitive to the geometric structure of a time series and its performance degrades significantly towards O(n(2)) when data possess long term dependencies or when the sample frequency is high, which occur regularly in practice. To avoid these problems we leverage an O(n) ordered rooted tree representation of time series that is (graph) dual to the HVG. We demonstrate that this representation leads to an algorithm for HVG construction that is agnostic with respect to the geometry and auto-correlations of the underlying data. Moreover, it possesses an efficient branch fusion operation for tree merging, leading to the idea of a bipartite HVG introduced in this paper, which allows HVGs for very large time series to be constructed efficiently in parallel. After introducing our method and algorithms for parallel construction of HVGs we report on experimental benchmarks comparing their real-world performance to existing approaches on long time series. On data sampled from fractional Brownian motions, deterministic chaotic systems, brain EEG recordings, and the financial markets, our dual tree algorithms significantly outperform previous methods.

Enhanced contralateral theta oscillations and N170 amplitudes in occipitotemporal scalp regions underlie attentional bias to fearful faces	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ERP; Attentional bias; Fearful faces; Theta; N170	OPEN-SOURCE TOOLBOX; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; BASAL FOREBRAIN; HUMAN AMYGDALA; TIME-COURSE; THREAT; PERCEPTION; LOCATION	Attending toward fearful faces and other threatening stimuli increase the chance of survival. The dot-probe task is a commonly used measure of spatial attention. Event-related potentials (ERPs) have been found to be a reliable measure of attentional bias. The dot-probe literature suggests that posterior contralateral N170 amplitudes are more enhanced by fearful faces compared to ipsilateral amplitudes. However, ERP methods remove non-phase locked frequencies, which provides additional information about neural activity. Specifically, theta oscillations (5-7 Hz) have been linked to attentional processing. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between posterior contralateral theta oscillations and N170 amplitudes in the dot-probe task. A modified dot-probe task was used with fear and neutral facial expressions and EEG data was recorded from 33 electrodes. The ERP and time-frequency data were extracted from the P7 and P8 electrodes (left and right occipitotemporal regions). This study found enhanced N170 amplitude and theta oscillations in the electrodes posterior contralateral to the fearful face. Contralateral N170 amplitudes and theta oscillations were related such that greater N170 amplitudes were associated with greater theta oscillations. The results indicated that increased contralateral N170 and theta oscillations are related to each other and underlie attentional bias to fearful faces.

We performed a systematic review to summarize evidence on markers extracted from interictal, visually normal resting-state EEG in adults with idiopathic epilepsy or psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Studies were selected from 5 databases and evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. 26 studies were identified, 19 focusing on people with epilepsy, 6 on people with PNES, and one comparing epilepsy and PNES directly. Results suggest that oscillations along the theta frequency (4-8 Hz) may have a relevant role in idiopathic epilepsy, whereas in PNES there was no evident trend. However, studies were subject to a number of methodological limitations potentially introducing bias. There was often a lack of appropriate reporting and high heterogeneity. Results were not appropriate for quantitative synthesis. We identify and discuss the challenges that must be addressed for valid resting-state EEG markers of epilepsy and PNES to be developed.

We used a network neuroscience approach to analyze both large-scale topological characteristics of the whole brain as well as local brain network characteristics. The characteristic path length, modularity, and cluster coefficient for different EEG frequency bands (alpha, high and low; beta1 and beta2, and theta) were calculated to estimate large-scale topological integration and segregation properties of the brain networks. Betweenness centrality, nodal clustering coefficient, and local connectivity strength were calculated as local network characteristics. We showed that global network integration measures in the alpha band were positively correlated with non-verbal intelligence, especially with the more difficult part of the test (Raven's total scores and E series), and the ability to operate with verbal information (the "Conclusions" verbal subtest). At the same time, individual differences in non-verbal intelligence (Raven's total score and C series), and vocabulary subtest of the verbal intelligence tests, were negatively correlated with the network segregation measures. Our results show that resting-state EEG functional connectivity can reveal the functional architecture associated with an individual difference in cognitive performance.

Monitoring Brain State and Behavioral Performance during Repetitive Visual Stimulation	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						ambiguous stimuli; Necker cubes; classification task; EEG analysis; wavelet analysis; decision time; perceptual errors; time-on-task effect	PERCEPTUAL DECISION-MAKING; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS	We tested whether changes in prestimulus neural activity predict behavioral performance (decision time and errors) during a prolonged visual task. The task was to classify ambiguous stimuli-Necker cubes; manipulating the degree of ambiguity from low ambiguity (LA) to high ambiguity (HA) changed the task difficulty. First, we assumed that the observer's state changes over time, which leads to a change in the prestimulus brain activity. Second, we supposed that the prestimulus state produces a different effect on behavioral performance depending on the task demands. Monitoring behavioral responses, we revealed that the observer's decision time decreased for both LA and HA stimuli during the task performance. The number of perceptual errors lowered for HA, but not for LA stimuli. EEG analysis revealed an increase in the prestimulus 9-11 Hz EEG power with task time. Finally, we found associations between the behavioral and neural estimates. The prestimulus EEG power negatively correlated with the decision time for LA stimuli and the erroneous responses rate for HA stimuli. The obtained results confirm that monitoring prestimulus EEG power enables predicting perceptual performance on the behavioral level. The observed different time-on-task effects on the LA and HA stimuli processing may shed light on the features of ambiguous perception.

Methods Seventy-four healthy adults participated in polysomnographic recordings on two consecutive nights. Conventional sleep variables were assessed according to standard criteria. Sleep-stage continuity and dynamics were evaluated by sleep runs and transitions, respectively. These variables were compared between the two nights. Electroencephalographic and cardiac activities were subjected to frequency domain analyses. Cycle-by-cycle analysis was performed for the above variables in 34 subjects with four sleep cycles and compared between the two nights. Results Conventional sleep variables reflected lower sleep quality in the adaptation night than in the experimental night. Bouts of stage N1 and stage N2 were shorter, and bouts of stage Wake were longer in the adaptation night than in the experimental night, but there was no difference in stage N3 or stage REM. The normalized transition probability from stage N2 to stage N1 was higher and that from stage N2 to N3 was lower in the adaptation night, whereas that from stage N3 to other stages did not differ between the nights. Cycle-by-cycle analysis revealed that sleep-stage distribution and cortical beta EEG power differed between the two nights in the first sleep cycle. However, the HF amplitude of the heart rate variability was lower over the four sleep cycles in the adaptation night than in the experimental night. Conclusion The results suggest the distinct vulnerability of the autonomic adaptation processes within the central nervous system in young healthy subjects while sleeping in a sleep laboratory for the first time.

J	Cohen, MX				Cohen, Michael X.			A data-driven method to identify frequency boundaries in multichannel electrophysiology data	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; Oscillations; Frequency; Alpha; Theta; Gamma; Spatial pattern; Covariance; Narrowband; Dbscan; Clustering	THETA OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA	Background: Electrophysiological recordings of the brain often exhibit neural oscillations, defined as narrowband bumps that deviate from the background power spectrum. These narrowband dynamics are grouped into frequency ranges, and the study of how activities in these ranges are related to cognition and disease is a major part of the neuroscience corpus. Frequency ranges are nearly always defined according to integer boundaries, such as 4-8 Hz for the theta band and 8-12 Hz for the alpha band. New method: A data-driven multivariate method is presented to identify empirical frequency boundaries based on clustering of spatiotemporal similarities across a range of frequencies. The method, termed gedBounds, identifies patterns in covariance matrices that maximally separate narrowband from broadband activity, and then identifies clusters in the correlation matrix of those spatial patterns over all frequencies, using the dbscan clustering algorithm. Those clusters are empirically derived frequency bands, from which boundaries can be extracted. Results: gedBounds recovers ground truth results in simulated data with high accuracy. The method was tested on EEG resting-state data from Parkinson's patients and control, and several features of the frequency components differed between patients and controls. Comparison with existing methods: The proposed method offers higher precision in defining subject-specific frequency boundaries compared to the current standard approach. Conclusions: gedBounds can increase the precision and feature extraction of spectral dynamics in electrophysiology data.

The system comprises a control unit, power unit, output unit, and actuator. The control unit adjusts stimulation parameters, particularly the signal intensity and frequency. The power unit produces high voltages for generating the magnetic field, whereas the output unit transmits the energy generated according to the signal from the control unit to the actuator. A spiral coil actuator generates the magnetic field. To validate the effectiveness of the system, preliminary experiments on 10 male adults without neurological disorders (23.2 +/- 3.05 years) were conducted. Magnetic field stimuli were presented to the right palm of the subjects at three different frequencies (10, 30, and 50 Hz), and corresponding electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were measured simultaneously. Event-related potential (ERP) analysis showed that N100 and P300 components were identified in somatosensory areas. Subjective evaluations revealed that feelings such as "tingling," "trembling," "tapping," and "percussing" were induced. Moreover, as the stimulus frequency changes, differences may occur in induced feeling. The system uses a time-varying magnetic field, which not only induces tactile stimulation without contact but also has trans-object characteristics that can present tactile sensations, even when there is an obstacle between an actuator and skin.

Intracranial EEG Biomarkers for Seizure Lateralization in Rapidly-Bisynchronous Epilepsy After Laser Corpus Callosotomy	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						high-frequency oscillation; interictal epileptiform discharge; phase-locked high gamma; epilepsy surgery; corpus callosotomy	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN TEMPORAL-LOBE; HIGH-GAMMA; PRESURGICAL EVALUATION; BRAIN; CORTEX; ONSET; ROBUST; EPILEPTOGENICITY; LOCALIZATION	Objective: It has been asserted that high-frequency analysis of intracranial EEG (iEEG) data may yield information useful in localizing epileptogenic foci. Methods: We tested whether proposed biomarkers could predict lateralization based on iEEG data collected prior to corpus callosotomy (CC) in three patients with bisynchronous epilepsy, whose seizures lateralized definitively post-CC. Lateralization data derived from algorithmically-computed ictal phase-locked high gamma (PLHG), high gamma amplitude (HGA), and low-frequency (filtered) line length (LFLL), as well as interictal high-frequency oscillation (HFO) and interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) rate metrics were compared against ground-truth lateralization from post-CC ictal iEEG. Results: Pre-CC unilateral IEDs were more frequent on the more-pathologic side in all subjects. HFO rate predicted lateralization in one subject, but was sensitive to detection threshold. On pre-CC data, no ictal metric showed better predictive power than any other. All post-corpus callosotomy seizures lateralized to the pathological hemisphere using PLHG, HGA, and LFLL metrics. Conclusions: While quantitative metrics of IED rate and ictal HGA, PHLG, and LFLL all accurately lateralize based on post-CC iEEG, only IED rate consistently did so based on pre-CC data. Significance: Quantitative analysis of IEDs may be useful in lateralizing seizure pathology. More work is needed to develop reliable techniques for high-frequency iEEG analysis.

We investigated natural frequencies induced by TMS in left and right homologous dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC) and related hemispheric differences. In 12 healthy young adults, single-pulse TMS was delivered in different blocks close to F3 and F4 channels to target left and right DLPFC. An occipital site near PO3 was stimulated as control. TMS-related spectral perturbation analyses were performed on recorded EEG data. A widespread unspecific increase in theta power was observed for all stimulation sites. However, occipital TMS induced greater alpha activity and a 10.58 Hz natural frequency, while TMS over the left and right DLPFC resulted in similar beta band modulations and a natural frequency of 18.77 and 18.5 Hz, respectively. In particular, TMS-related specific increase in beta activity was stronger for the right than the left DLPFC. The right DLPFC is more specifically tuned to its natural beta frequency when it is directly stimulated by TMS than with TMS over the left counterpart (or a posterior region), while the left DLPFC increases its beta activity more similarly irrespective of whether it is directly stimulated or through right homologous stimulation. These results yield important implications for both basic neuroscience research on inter-hemispheric prefrontal interactions and clinical applications.

The mechanism of epileptogenic network generation causing hypsarrhythmia of WS is unknown. We hypothesized that Modulation index (MI) [strength of phase amplitude coupling] and Synchronization likelihood (SL) [degree of connectivity] could interrogate the epileptogenic network in hypsarrhythmia of WS secondary to PAIS. Methods: We analyzed interictal scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in 10 WS and 11 FE patients with unilateral PAIS. MI between gamma (30-70 Hz) and slow waves (3-4 Hz) was calculated to measure phase-amplitude coupling. SL between electrode pairs was analyzed in 9-frequency bands (5-delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) to examine inter-and intra-hemispheric connectivity. Results: MI was higher in affected hemispheres in WS (p = 0.006); no differences observed in FE. Interhemispheric SL of 3-delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma bands was significantly higher in WS (p < 0.001). In WS, modified Z-Score of intra-hemispheric SL values in 3-delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma in the affected hemispheres were significantly higher than those in the unaffected hemispheres (p < 0.001) as well as 0.5-4 Hz (p = 0.004). Conclusions: The significantly higher modulation in affected hemisphere and stronger inter-and intrahemispheric connectivity generate hypsarrhythmia of WS secondary to PAIS. Significance: Epileptogenic cortical-subcortical transcallosal networks from affected hemisphere postPAIS provokes infantile spasms. (c) 2021 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

J	Ghosh, P; Roy, D; Banerjee, A				Ghosh, Priyanka; Roy, Dipanjan; Banerjee, Arpan			Organization of directed functional connectivity among nodes of ventral attention network reveals the common network mechanisms underlying saliency processing across distinct spatial and spatio-temporal scales	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Ventral attention network; Saliency; EEG; Alpha oscillations; Source-localization; Granger causality; Spatio-temporal tasks	RIGHT TEMPOROPARIETAL JUNCTION; GRANGER CAUSALITY; EXOGENOUS ATTENTION; SOCIAL-INTERACTION; BRAIN NETWORKS; ALPHA; SUPPRESSION; DORSAL; CORTEX; SYSTEMS	Previous neuroimaging studies have extensively evaluated the structural and functional connectivity of the Ventral Attention Network (VAN) and its role in reorienting attention in the presence of a salient (pop-out) stimulus. However, a detailed understanding of the "directed " functional connectivity within the VAN during the process of reorientation remains elusive. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have not adequately addressed this issue due to a lack of appropriate temporal resolution required to capture this dynamic process. The present study investigates the neural changes associated with processing salient distractors operating at a slow and a fast time scale using custom-designed experiment involving visual search on static images and dynamic motion tracking, respectively. We recorded high-density scalp electroencephalography (EEG) from healthy human volunteers, obtained saliency-specific behavioral and spectral changes during the tasks, localized the sources underlying the spectral power modulations with individual-specific structural MRI scans, reconstructed the waveforms of the sources and finally, investigated the causal relationships between the sources using spectral Granger-Geweke Causality (GGC). We found that salient stimuli processing, across tasks with varying spatio-temporal complexities, involves a characteristic modulation in the alpha frequency band which is executed primarily by the nodes of the VAN constituting the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), the insula and the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC). The directed functional connectivity results further revealed the presence of bidirectional interactions among prominent nodes of right-lateralized VAN, corresponding only to the trials with saliency. Thus, our study elucidates the invariant network mechanisms for processing saliency in visual attention tasks across diverse time-scales.

Scale-specific dynamics of high-amplitude bursts in EEG capture behaviorally meaningful variability	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neural avalanches; Power-law; Electroencephalography; Emotional image viewing; Task-evoked functional reorganization	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; NEURONAL AVALANCHES; EMOTION REGULATION; CORTICAL NETWORKS; FRONTAL THETA; HUMAN BRAIN; CRITICALITY; OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; FMRI	Cascading high-amplitude bursts in neural activity, termed avalanches, are thought to provide insight into the complex spatially distributed interactions in neural systems. In human neuroimaging, for example, avalanches occurring during resting-state show scale-invariant dynamics, supporting the hypothesis that the brain operates near a critical point that enables long range spatial communication. In fact, it has been suggested that such scale-invariant dynamics, characterized by a power-law distribution in these avalanches, are universal in neural systems and emerge through a common mechanism. While the analysis of avalanches and subsequent criticality is increasingly seen as a framework for using complex systems theory to understand brain function, it is unclear how the framework would account for the omnipresent cognitive variability, whether across individuals or tasks. To address this, we analyzed avalanches in the EEG activity of healthy humans during rest as well as two distinct task conditions that varied in cognitive demands and produced behavioral measures unique to each individual. In both rest and task conditions we observed that avalanche dynamics demonstrate scale-invariant characteristics, but differ in their specific features, demonstrating individual variability. Using a new metric we call normalized engagement , which estimates the likelihood for a brain region to produce high-amplitude bursts, we also investigated regional features of avalanche dynamics. Normalized engagement showed not only the expected individual and task dependent variability, but also scale-specificity that correlated with individual behavior. Our results suggest that the study of avalanches in human brain activity provides a tool to assess cognitive variability. Our findings expand our understanding of avalanche features and are supportive of the emerging theoretical idea that the dynamics of an active human brain operate close to a critical-like region and not a singular critical-state.

However, the mechanisms of these inter-system interactions have yet to be well-characterized. Here, we employ directed functional connectivity networks estimated from source-localized EEG to uncover how brain regions across the olfactory, emotion and reward systems integrate organically into cross-system communities. Using the integration coefficient, a graph theoretic measure, we quantified the effect of exposure to fragrance stimuli of different hedonic values (high vs low pleasantness levels) on inter-systems interactions. Our analysis focused on beta band activity (13-30 Hz), which is known to facilitate integration of cortical areas involved in sensory perception. Higher-pleasantness stimuli induced elevated integration for the reward system, but not for the emotion and olfactory systems. Furthermore, the nodes of reward system showed more outward connections to the emotion and olfactory systems than inward connections from the respective systems. These results suggest the centrality of the reward system-supported by beta oscillations-in actively coordinating multi-system interactivity to give rise to hedonic experiences during olfactory perception.

Evidence suggests that anaesthesia might have a direct effect on synaptic metabolic processes, and this relates to anaesthesia sensitivity. We explored elements of synaptic transmission looking for possible contributions to the anaesthetised EEG and how it may modulate anaesthesia sensitivity. Methods: We developed a Hodgkin -Huxley-type neural network computer simulation capable of mimicking anaesthetic prolongation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), and capable of altering postsynaptic ion homeostasis and neurotransmitter recycling. We examined their interactions on simulated electrocorticography (sECoG), and compared these with published anaesthesia EEG spectra. Results: The sECoG spectra from the model were comparable with published normal awake EEG spectra. Prolongation of IPSP duration in the model caused inhibition of high frequencies and saturation of low frequencies with a peak in keeping with current evidence. IPSP prolongation alone was unable to reproduce alpha rhythms or the generalised increase in EEG power found with anaesthesia. Adding inhibition of postsynaptic ion homeostasis to IPSP prolongation helped retain alpha rhythms, increased sECoG power, and antagonised the slow-wave saturation peak in a dose dependent fashion that appeared dependent on the postsynaptic membrane potential, providing a plausible mechanism for how metabolic changes can modulate anaesthesia sensitivity. Conclusions: Our model suggests how metabolic processes can modulate anaesthesia and produce non-receptor dependent drug sensitivity.

J	Ozbek, L				Ozbek, Levent			A study on decomposing EEGs during sleep into frequency components and revealing spindles using Kalman filter	CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS			English	Article						EEG; Sleep; Spindle; Kalman filter; Extended Kalman filter; Adaptive Kalman filter		Sleep scoring in psychiatry is one of the important issues for classification of diseases, investigation of sleep patterns and also appropriate treatment practices. Sleep specialists usually perform manual sleep stage scoring by visually examining the patient's neurophysiological signals collected in sleep laborato-ries. This is not only very difficult but also very time consuming and easing to make mistake task. Sleep spindles are characteristic electroencephalogram (EEG) signatures of the sleep of stage-2 non-rapid eye movement. Spindles taking place in sleep regulation and cognitive functions may represent biomarkers of a neuropsychiatric disease. Sleep spindles, which are considered to have an important role in enhancing sleep duration, are characteristic waveforms seen in the non-REM sleep phase. The detection and analysis of the waveforms of the spindles, as well as determining the time and duration of the spindles, are very important to fully understand the process of sleep. However, as the spindles have transient properties compared to background EEG signals, it becomes difficult to analyze and distinguish them visually. There are automatic spindle detection methods (ASDM). But there is no consensus on the usage of these au-tomated methods since they are not robust especially in different characteristics of the spindles. In this study, raw sleep EEG data is taken as a time-series data and it is used without any pre-processing (with-out filtering). Adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF), a recursive estimation method, is used to separate this time series data into trend, cycle and drift components. In the zones where the psychiatrist or an expert in sleep scoring specifies the occurrence of the spindles, the trend and cycle values obtained by using AEKF are also indicating the occurrences of the spindles very clearly in the same zones. Also, the estimation of the cycle gives some information about the starting point of the spindle. Just by viewing both raw data and trend and cycle components, the expert can easily recognize whether there is a spindle or not. Therefore, the main contribution of this article is to suggest a more effective methodology for de-tecting spindles. The estimation results support the methodology used in this article. Such a finding also shows that the nonlinear state-space model and the AEKF can be properly applied in similar frameworks. In particular, this study separates EEG signals into trend and cycle components, where the methodology allows for system parameters and the components to be estimated simultaneously. Since the methodol-ogy allows for the parameters to vary over time, observing the time patterns of the estimated parameters have the potential to reveal further information about the sleep process.

However, it remains unclear whether congruency monitoring can occur at the motor level and the extent to which expertise contributes. Here, we examined the behavioral performance and electrophysiological brain activity of individuals with and without domain-specific expertise when judging the action congruency of occluded video clips of a snowboard halfpipe trick and normal walking. For the halfpipe trick, experts exhibited better task performance and greater midline theta oscillations before possible incongruency compared with controls. Source reconstruction for the theta oscillation revealed a stronger activation in the middle and superior frontal gyrus for experts in response to incongruency compared with controls. Incongruent halfpipe actions elicited a higher N400 amplitude in experts compared with congruent actions, while no such differences were observed in controls. Source reconstruction revealed the activation in the board frontal regions and middle temporal gyrus for experts. These findings suggest that congruency monitoring can occur at the motor level during action observations and is modulated by individual expertise. The modulation of expertise reflects in the special N400 effect and midline theta oscillation.

A role for the cortex in sleep-wake regulation	NATURE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							LOCAL SLEEP; REM-SLEEP; EEG; DEPRIVATION; DYNAMICS; NETWORK; CONNECTIVITY; MECHANISMS; ABSENCE; ORIGIN	The conventional view is that the cortex generates brain oscillations, while subcortical structures control global sleep-wake switching. This study shows that the cortex plays an important role in both global state control and sleep homeostasis. Cortical and subcortical circuitry are thought to play distinct roles in the generation of sleep oscillations and global state control, respectively. Here we silenced a subset of neocortical layer 5 pyramidal and archicortical dentate gyrus granule cells in male mice by ablating SNAP25. This markedly increased wakefulness and reduced rebound of electroencephalographic slow-wave activity after sleep deprivation, suggesting a role for the cortex in both vigilance state control and sleep homeostasis.

We investigate the differences between the neural correlates of imagined nasal and bilabial consonants (distinct phonological categories). Mean phase coherence is used as a metric for measuring the phase synchronisation between pairs of electrodes in six cortical regions (auditory, motor, prefrontal, sensorimotor, somatosensory and premotor) during the imagery of nasal and bilabial consonants. Statistically significant difference at 95% confidence interval is observed in beta and lower-gamma bands in various cortical regions. Our observations are inline with the directions into velocities of articulators and dual stream prediction models and support the hypothesis that phonological categories not only exist in articulated speech but can also be distinguished from the EEG of imagined speech.
