Visuospatial alpha and gamma oscillations scale with the severity of cognitive dysfunction in patients on the Alzheimer's disease spectrum	ALZHEIMERS RESEARCH & THERAPY			English	Article						Neural oscillations; Visuospatial processing; Magnetoencephalography; Source imaging; Alzheimer's disease	EVENT-RELATED OSCILLATIONS; AMYLOID PET; EEG; MEG; BIOMARKER; CHILDREN; STATE	Background Entrainment of neural oscillations in occipital cortices by external rhythmic visual stimuli has been proposed as a novel therapy for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite this increased interest in visual neural oscillations in AD, little is known regarding their role in AD-related cognitive impairment and in particular during visuospatial processing. Methods We used source-imaged magnetoencephalography (MEG) and an established visuospatial processing task to elicit multi-spectral neuronal responses in 35 biomarker-confirmed patients on the AD spectrum and 20 biomarker-negative older adults. Neuronal oscillatory responses were imaged to the level of the cortex, and group classifications and neurocognitive relationships were modeled using logistic and linear regression, respectively. Results Visuospatial neuronal oscillations in the theta, alpha, and gamma ranges significantly predicted the classification of patients on the AD spectrum. Importantly, the direction of these effects differed by response frequency, such that patients on the AD spectrum exhibited weaker alpha-frequency responses in lateral occipital regions, and stronger gamma-frequency responses in the primary visual cortex, as compared to biomarker-negative older adults. In addition, alpha and gamma, but not theta, oscillations robustly predicted cognitive status (i.e., MoCA and MMSE scores), such that patients with neural responses that deviated more from those of healthy older adults exhibited poorer cognitive performance. Conclusions We find that the multi-spectral neural dynamics supporting visuospatial processing differentiate patients on the AD spectrum from cognitively normal, biomarker-negative older adults. Oscillations in the alpha and gamma bands also relate to cognitive status in ways that are informative for emerging clinical interventions.

Previous studies have mainly researched these responses in the temporal domain; hence, non-phase-locked or induced neural activities may have been ignored. Event-related potential (ERP) and time-frequency (TF) information, combined with clinical and cognitive profiles, may provide an insight into the pathophysiology and psychopathology of the CHR stage. The 104 CHR individuals who completed cognitive assessments and ERP tests were recruited and followed up between 2016 and 2018. Individuals with CHR were classified by three clinical subtypes demonstrated before, specifically 32 from Cluster-1 (characterized by extensive negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, at the highest risk for conversion to psychosis), 34 from Cluster-2 (characterized by thought and behavioral disorganization, with moderate cognitive impairment), and 38 from Cluster-3 (characterized by the mildest symptoms and cognitive deficits). Electroencephalograms were recorded during the auditory oddball paradigm. The P300 ERPs were analyzed in the temporal domain. The event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) and inter-trial coherence (ITC) were acquired by TF analysis. A reduced P300 response to target tones was noted in Cluster-1 relative to the other two clusters. Moreover, the P300 amplitude of Cluster-1 was associated with speed of processing (SoP) scores. Furthermore, the P300 amplitude of Cluster-3 was significantly correlated with verbal and visual learning scores. In the TF analysis, decreased delta ERSP and ITC were observed in Cluster-1; delta ITC was associated with SoP scores in Cluster-3. The results indicate relatively disrupted oddball responses in a certain CHR subtype and a close affinity between these electrophysiological indexes and attention, working memory, and declarative memory within different CHR clusters. These findings suggest that the auditory oddball response is a potential neurophysiological marker for distinct clinical subtypes of CHR.

Despite their clinical relevance, their mechanisms of generation remain poorly understood. It is assumed that brain activity switches abruptly, unpredictably, and supposedly randomly to these epileptic transients. We aim to study the period preceding these epileptic discharges, to extract potential proepileptogenic mechanisms supporting their expression. Methods We used multisite intracortical recordings from patients who underwent intracranial monitoring for refractory epilepsy, the majority of whom had a mesial temporal lobe seizure onset zone. Our objective was to evaluate the existence of proepileptogenic windows before interictal epileptic discharges. We tested whether the amplitude and phase synchronization of slow oscillations (.5-4 Hz and 4-7 Hz) increase before epileptic discharges and whether the latter are phase-locked to slow oscillations. Then, we tested whether the phase-locking of neuronal activity (assessed by high-gamma activity, 60-160 Hz) to slow oscillations increases before epileptic discharges to provide a potential mechanism linking slow oscillations to interictal activities. Results Changes in widespread slow oscillations anticipate upcoming epileptic discharges. The network extends beyond the irritative zone, but the increase in amplitude and phase synchronization is rather specific to the irritative zone. In contrast, epileptic discharges are phase-locked to widespread slow oscillations and the degree of phase-locking tends to be higher outside the irritative zone. Then, within the irritative zone only, we observe an increased coupling between slow oscillations and neuronal discharges before epileptic discharges. Significance Our results show that epileptic discharges occur during vulnerable time windows set up by a specific phase of slow oscillations. The specificity of these permissive windows is further reinforced by the increased coupling of neuronal activity to slow oscillations. These findings contribute to our understanding of epilepsy as a distributed oscillopathy and open avenues for future neuromodulation strategies aiming at disrupting proepileptic mechanisms.

Forty-five healthy subjects were randomly divided into moderate-intensity aerobic exercise [70% heart rate reserve (HRR)], low-intensity aerobic exercise (50% HRR), or control groups (sitting). Aerobic exercise was performed with cycling. Pressure pain threshold (PPT), heat pain threshold (HPT), event-related potential (ERP) induced by contact heat stimulus and pain scoring were measured before and after the intervention. We found that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise can increase the PPT (rectus femoris: t = -2.71, p = 0.017; tibialis anterior muscle: t = -2.36, p = 0.033) and HPT (tibialis anterior muscle: t = -2.219, p = 0.044) of proximal intervention sites rather than distal sites, and decreased pain scorings of contact heat stimulus. After moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, alpha oscillation power reflecting the central descending inhibitory function was enhanced (t = -2.31, p < 0.05). Low-intensity aerobic exercise mainly reduced the pain unpleasantness rating (Block 1: t = 2.415, p = 0.030; Block 2: t = 3.287, p = 0.005; Block 4: t = 2.646, p = 0.019; Block 5: t = 2.567, p = 0.022). Aerobic exercise had an overall EIH effect. Its hypoalgesic effect was related to exercise intensity and affected by the site and type of pain stimulus. Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise effectively reduced the sensitivity to various painful stimuli, and low-intensity aerobic exercise selectively inhibited the negative emotional pain response. The hypoalgesic mechanism of aerobic exercise involves the enhancement of the central descending inhibitory function.

Existing studies, however, often lack appropriate control groups or fail to assess whether electrophysiological activity has been successfully regulated. The current study is a randomized controlled trial comparing changes in brain activity and pain during NFB with those of a sham-control group. Methods An experimental pain paradigm in healthy participants was used to provide optimal control of pain sensation. Twenty four healthy participants were blind randomized to receive either 10 x NFB (with real EEG feedback) or 10 x sham (with false EEG feedback) sessions during noxious cold stimulation. Prior to actual NFB training, training protocols were individually determined for each participant based on a comparison of an initial 32-channel qEEG assessment administered at both baseline and during an experimental pain task. Each individual protocol was based on the electrode site and frequency band that showed the greatest change in amplitude during pain, with alpha or theta up-regulation at various electrode sites (especially Pz) the most common protocols chosen. During the NFB sessions themselves, pain was assessed at multiple times during each session on a 0-10 rating scale, and ANOVA was used to examine changes in pain ratings and EEG amplitude both across and during sessions for both NFB and sham groups. Results For pain, ANOVA trend analysis found a significant general linear decrease in pain across the 10 sessions (p = 0.015). However, no significant main or interaction effects of group were observed suggesting decreases in pain occurred independently of NFB. For EEG, there was a significant During Session X Group interaction (p = 0.004), which indicated that EEG amplitude at the training site was significantly closer to the target amplitude for the NFB compared to the sham group during painful stimulation, but this was only the case at the beginning of the cold task. Conclusion While these results must be interpreted within the context of an experimental pain model, they underline the importance of including an appropriate comparison group to avoid attributing naturally occurring changes to therapeutic effects.

Several studies found signs of inter-subject brain activity coordination, such as power and phase synchronization or information flow. This hyper-brain coordination is frequently studied in paradigms which induce rhythms or even synchronization, e.g., by mirroring movements, turn-based activity in card or economic games, or joint music making. It is therefore interesting to figure out in how far coordinated brain activity may be induced by a rhythmicity in the task and/or the sensory feedback that the partners receive. We therefore studied the EEG brain activity of dyads in a task that required the smooth pursuit of a target and did not involve any extrinsic rhythms. Partners controlled orthogonal axes of the two-dimensional motion of an object that had to be kept on the target. Using several methods for analyzing hyper-brain coupling, we could not detect signs of coordinated brain activity. However, we found several brain regions in which the frequency-specific activity significantly correlated with the objective task performance, the subjective experience thereof, and of the collaboration. Activity in these regions has been linked to motor control, sensorimotor integration, executive control and emotional processing. Our results suggest that neural correlates of intersubjectivity encompass large parts of brain areas that are considered to be involved in sensorimotor control without necessarily coordinating their activity across agents.

However, the main limitation of the SSVEP speller is the low communication rates caused by extra input time for gaze shifting and waiting. In this study, a novel spelling method using the word as an input unit is proposed, which saves the waiting time between two consecutive characters. SSVEP features are extracted from continuous EEG signals containing different frequencies using filter bank canonical correlation analysis (FBCCA) with sliding multi-window strategy. Both offline and online experiments have been conducted with ten participants by a 40-character speller. The average accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR) of the proposed word speller reached 90.72 +/- 7.27% and 220.40 +/- 22.68 bits/min respectively at a 1.2 s time window, higher than the traditional character-based speller with 87.52 +/- 6.19% accuracy and 155.60 +/- 16.01 bits/min ITR. The improvements demonstrated the efficiency of the sliding multi-window strategy for an SSVEP-based word speller.

FEATURES OF BIOELECTRIC ACTIVITY OF THE CEREBRAL CORTEX AND THINKING DISORDERS IN CHILDREN WITH VARIOUS BORDERLINE DISORDERS OF RESIDUAL ORGANIC GENESIS	EKSPERIMENTALNAYA PSIKHOLOGIYA			Russian	Article						borderline mental disorders in children; disorders of thinking; functional parameters of the cerebral cortex; EEG; bioelectric activity of the cerebral cortex; electroencephalography	ATTENTION	The article presents the results of a study of the features of cognitive function and bioelectric activity cerebral cortex in children with borderline mental disorders of residually organic genesis. 80 children participated with the following diagnoses: organic emotionally labile [asthenic] disorder [F 06.06]; inorganic enuresis [F 98.0], encopresis [F 98.1], stereotypical motor disorders [F 98.4], other specified emotional and behavioral disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood [F 98.8]. The features of bioelectric activity of the cerebral cortex, the ability to spatial analysis and synthesis, arithmetic counting, assimilation of logical and grammatical structures, the presence of viscosity, detail and diversity intellectual activity were studied in children. Data of electroencephalographic examinations were compared with the results of psychodiagnostic methods using the methods of mathematical statistics. Differences of bioelectric activity and features of thinking in children were investigated depending on features of boundary disorder. It is shown that on the background of asthenization more pronounced cognitive impairment is observed. Children with asthenic disorders [06.06] have the largest scatter of data than patients with enuresis [F98.0], encopresis [F 98.1], stereotypical movement disorders [F 98.4], disorders of behavior [F 98.8]. At the same time, on average, they have the most significant violations of thinking, what happens against the background of increasing spectral power of low-frequency activity of delta and theta rhythms in general, as well as of delta rhythm in the frontal part of the brain. Increase of low-frequency activity in the frontal lobes of both hemispheres leads to more pronounced disorders of thinking, than similar changes in the temporal, parietal, occipital regions of the right hemisphere and speech zones of the left hemisphere. In the first case, they are manifested in violations of spatial analysis and synthesis, viscosity, detail and diversity of thinking, as well as in difficulties in the semantic and symbolic activity, in the assimilation of logical and grammatical structures and arithmetic. In the second case - only in violations of spatial analysis and synthesis, viscosity, detail and diversity of thinking.

THE ASSOCIATION OF PERSONALITY AND CULTURE WITH DMN CONNECTIVITY DURING SELF AND OTHER-REFERENTIAL PROCESSING	PSIKHOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL			Russian	Article						personality; cultural values; social cognition; default mode network; EEG; alpha oscillations; connectivity	DEFAULT MODE; BRAIN; ATTENTION; VERSION	In this study, the effect of personality and cultural variables on DMN connectivity, as measured based on EEG data, was investigated during evaluation of the self and other people. In high agreeableness, intellect, and emotional intelligence scorers, DMN connectivity was lower, whereas in high neuroticism and collectivism scorers it was higher during self-evaluation, as compared to evaluation of other people. One may suggest that self-evaluation, as compared to evaluation of other people, needs less cognitive resources in the former and more resources in the latter case. This evidence sheds new light on some personality- and culture-related behavioral patterns during social interactions.	[Knyazev, G. G.; Bocharov, A., V; Savostyanov, A.

In the area of physiological signal processing for prosthesis control, scenarios where a signal decomposition analysis are required: the wavelet decomposition (WD) has been seen to be the favoured time-frequency approach for the decomposition of non-stationary signals. From a research perspective, the WD in certain cases has allowed for a more accurate motion intent decoding process following feature extraction and classification. Despite this, there is yet to be a widespread adaptation of the WD in a practical setting due to perceived computational complexity. Here, for neuromuscular (electromyography) and brainwave (electroencephalography) signals acquired from a transhumeral amputee, a computationally efficient time domain signal decomposition method based on a series of heuristics was applied to process the acquired signals before feature extraction. The results showed an improvement in motion intent decoding prowess for the proposed time-domain-based signal decomposition across four different classifiers for both the neuromuscular and brain wave signals when compared to the WD and the raw signal.

Spontaneous Fluctuations in Oscillatory Brain State Cause Differences in Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Effects Within and Between Individuals	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS); inter-and intra-subject variability; neuronal oscillations; multimodal TMS; closed-loop TMS	THETA-BURST STIMULATION; ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; LARGE-SCALE ANALYSIS; EARLY VISUAL-CORTEX; INTERINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; INTRAINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY; TEMPORAL CHARACTERISTICS; CORTICOSPINAL VOLLEYS	Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can cause measurable effects on neural activity and behavioral performance in healthy volunteers. In addition, TMS is increasingly used in clinical practice for treating various neuropsychiatric disorders. Unfortunately, TMS-induced effects show large intra- and inter-subject variability, hindering its reliability, and efficacy. One possible source of this variability may be the spontaneous fluctuations of neuronal oscillations. We present recent studies using multimodal TMS including TMS-EMG (electromyography), TMS-tACS (transcranial alternating current stimulation), and concurrent TMS-EEG-fMRI (electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging), to evaluate how individual oscillatory brain state affects TMS signal propagation within targeted networks. We demonstrate how the spontaneous oscillatory state at the time of TMS influences both immediate and longer-lasting TMS effects. These findings indicate that at least part of the variability in TMS efficacy may be attributable to the current practice of ignoring (spontaneous) oscillatory fluctuations during TMS. Ignoring this state-dependent spread of activity may cause great individual variability which so far is poorly understood and has proven impossible to control. We therefore also compare two technical solutions to directly account for oscillatory state during TMS, namely, to use (a) tACS to externally control these oscillatory states and then apply TMS at the optimal (controlled) brain state, or (b) oscillatory state-triggered TMS (closed-loop TMS). The described multimodal TMS approaches are paramount for establishing more robust TMS effects, and to allow enhanced control over the individual outcome of TMS interventions aimed at modulating information flow in the brain to achieve desirable changes in cognition, mood, and behavior.

Although there is ample evidence suggesting that neural interactions are directional, conventional PAC measures mostly quantify the cross-frequency coupling, failing to provide information on the direction of interactions. In this paper, we introduce a Granger causality (GC) based approach to estimate the direction of PAC. This approach infers the directionality of cross-frequency coupling by computing GC between the instantaneous phase and amplitude components extracted from the signal through a complex time-frequency (t-f) distribution, known as the Reduced Interference Distribution (RID)-Rihaczek. The method is evaluated on both simulated and real electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The results demonstrate that the proposed GC based directional PAC measure can infer the direction of neural interactions across frequency bands.	[Munia, Tamanna T.

Previous researchers have modeled attention as an internal rhythm that may entrain to first-order regularity from rhythmic events to prioritize information selection at specific time points. Using the attentional blink paradigm, here we show that higherorder regularity based on rhythmic organization of contextual features (pitch, color, or motion) may serve as a temporal frame to recompose the dynamic profile of visual temporal attention. Critically, such attentional reframing effect is well predicted by cortical entrainment to the higher-order contextual structure at the delta band as well as its coupling with the stimulus-driven alpha power. These results suggest that the human brain involuntarily exploits multiscale regularities in rhythmic contexts to recompose dynamic attending in visual perception, and highlight neural entrainment as a central mechanism for optimizing our conscious experience of the world in the time dimension.

It relies on the combination of partial directed coherence with a constrained low-rank canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. With such combination being established, the most dominating directed graph structures underlying each time window of intracerebral electroencephalographic signals are optimally inferred. Obtained time and frequency signatures of inferred brain networks allow respectively to track the time evolution of these networks and to define frequency bands on which they are operating. Besides, the proposed method allows also to track brain connectivity networks through several epileptic seizures of the same patient. Understanding the most dominating directed graph structures over epileptic seizures and investigating their behavior over time and frequency plans are henceforth possible. Since only few but the the most important directed connections in the graph structure are of interest and also for a meaningful interpretation of obtained signatures to be guaranteed, the low-rank canonical polyadic tensor decomposition is prompted respectively by the sparsity and the non-negativity constraints on the tensor loading matrices. The main objective of this contribution is to propose a new way of tracking brain networks in the context of epileptic iEEG data by identifying the most dominant effective connectivity patterns underlying the observed iEEG signals at each time window. The performance of the proposed method is firstly evaluated on simulated data imitating brain activities and secondly on real intracerebral electroencephalographic signals obtained from an epileptic patient. The partial directed coherence-based tensor has been decomposed into space, time, and frequency signatures in accordance with the expected ground truth for each consecutive sequence of the simulated data. The method is also in accordance with the clinical expertise for iEEG epileptic signals, where the signatures were investigated through a simultaneous multi-seizure analysis.

This highly integrative function encompasses sensorimotor, cognitive, and executive processes that jointly mediate active exploration and spatial learning. However, most neuroimaging approaches in humans are based on static, motion-constrained paradigms and they do not account for all these processes, in particular multisensory integration. Following the Mobile Brain/Body Imaging approach, we aimed to explore the cortical correlates of landmark-based navigation in actively behaving young adults, solving a Y-maze task in immersive virtual reality. EEG analysis identified a set of brain areas matching state-of-the-art brain imaging literature of landmark-based navigation. Spatial behavior in mobile conditions additionally involved sensorimotor areas related to motor execution and proprioception usually overlooked in static fMRI paradigms. Expectedly, we located a cortical source in or near the posterior cingulate, in line with the engagement of the retrosplenial complex in spatial reorientation. Consistent with its role in visuo-spatial processing and coding, we observed an alpha-power desynchronization while participants gathered visual information. We also hypothesized behavior-dependent modulations of the cortical signal during navigation. Despite finding few differences between the encoding and retrieval phases of the task, we identified transient time-frequency patterns attributed, for instance, to attentional demand, as reflected in the alpha/gamma range, or memory workload in the delta/theta range. We confirmed that combining mobile high-density EEG and biometric measures can help unravel the brain structures and the neural modulations subtending ecological landmark-based navigation.

ABM involves a specific brain network of interacting regions that store and retrieve life experiences. Deficits in ABM are early symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and serve as relevant predictors of disease progression. The possibility to modify the neural substrates of ABM opens exciting avenues for the development of therapeutic approaches. Beyond a summary of the causal role of brain oscillations in ABM, we propose a new approach of modulating brain oscillations using personalized tACS with the possibility of reducing ABM deficits. We suggest that human experimental studies using cognitive tasks, EEG, and tACS can have future translational clinical implications.

Increased Entropy of Gamma Oscillations in the Frontal Region during Meditation	2021 43RD ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE & BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (IEEE EMBC)	NOV 01-05, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, IEEE, Elsevier, Inst Engn & Technol			ALTERED STATES; EEG	Meditation practices are considered mental training and have increasingly received attention from the scientific community due to their potential psychological and physical health benefits. We compared the EEG data recorded from long-term rajayoga practitioners during different meditative and non-meditative periods Minimum variance modified fuzzy entropy (MVMFE) is computed for each EEG band for all channels of a given lobe. The means across all the channel entropy values were obtained and compared during meditative and non-meditative states. Meditators showed higher frontal entropy in the lower gamma band (25-45Hz) during the meditative states. Independent component analysis was applied to ensure that muscle or eye artifacts did not contribute to the gamma activity. Our results extend previous findings on the changes in entropy observed in long-term meditators during rajayoga practice. Gamma band in EEG is implicated in cognitive processes requiring high-level processing such as attention, learning, memory control, and retrieval. Gamma activity is also suggested as a potential biomarker for therapeutic progress in patients with clinical depression. Based on our findings, there is an excellent possibility to utilize the practice of meditation as a training tool to strengthen the neural circuits, where age-related degeneration is making its pathological impact.

Classification of Phonological Categories in Imagined Speech using Phase Synchronization Measure	2021 43RD ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE & BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (IEEE EMBC)	NOV 01-05, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, IEEE, Elsevier, Inst Engn & Technol			OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; EEG	Phonological categories in articulated speech are defined based on the place and manner of articulation. In this work, we investigate whether the phonological categories of the prompts imagined during speech imagery lead to differences in phase synchronization in various cortical regions that can be discriminated from the EEG captured during the imagination. Nasal and bilabial consonant are the two phonological categories considered due to their differences in both place and manner of articulation. Mean phase coherence (MPC) is used for measuring the phase synchronization and shallow neural network (NN) is used as the classifier. As a benchmark, we have also designed another NN based on statistical parameters extracted from imagined speech EEG. The NN trained on MPC values in the beta band gives classification results superior to NN trained on alpha band MPC values, gamma band MPC values and statistical parameters extracted from the EEG. Clinical relevance: Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a promising tool for aiding differently-abled people and for neurorehabilitation. One of the challenges in designing speech imagery based BCI is the identification of speech prompts that can lead to distinct neural activations. We have shown that nasal and blilabial consonants lead to dissimilar activations. Hence prompts orthogonal in these phonological categories are good choices as speech imagery prompts.

This is illustrated by the central tendency effect: When estimating a range of intervals, short intervals are overestimated, whereas long intervals are underestimated to reduce the overall estimation error. Most models of interval timing ascribe this effect to the weighting of the current interval with previous memory traces after the interval has been perceived. Alternatively, the perception of the duration could already be flexibly tuned to its temporal context. We investigated this hypothesis using an interval reproduction task in which human participants (both sexes) reproduced a shorter and longer interval range. As expected, reproductions were biased toward the subjective mean of each presented range. EEG analyses showed that temporal context indeed affected neural dynamics during the perception phase. Specifically, longer previous durations decreased contingent negative variation and P2 amplitude and increased beta power. In addition, multivariate pattern analysis showed that it is possible to decode context from the transient EEG signal quickly after both onset and offset of the perception phase. Together, these results suggest that temporal context creates dynamic expectations which actively affect the perception of duration.

However, the mechanisms underlying this cultural difference remain unclear. Here, we addressed this gap by testing 32 Taiwanese and 32 American young adults, who indicated whether their self-esteem would change in various episodes involving success or failure. We monitored their electroencephalogram (EEG) and assessed upper-alpha band power in response to the outcome information. An increase in upper-alpha power indicates internally directed attention; therefore, it is an index of self-referential processing when assessed during a judgment about the self. As predicted, Americans judged that their self-esteem (but not another's) would increase more after a success than it would decrease after a failure, thereby showing the previously observed self-enhancing pattern. Taiwanese tended to show the opposite pattern, self-criticism. Notably, Americans, but not Taiwanese, showed an increase in upper-alpha band power in response to the self's successes (vs. failures). This bias in the EEG index of self-referential processing predicted the cultural difference in self-enhancement (vs. criticism). The role of self-referential processing in self-enhancement is discussed.

Performance Analysis in Higher-Order IIR Filter Structures with Application to EEG Signal	CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Retiming; Infinite impulse response (IIR) filter; Data flow graph (DFG); Critical path delay (CPD)		This paper investigates the analysis of critical path delay in various infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filter structure implementations. The critical path delay increases with the order of filter increasing in all conventional structures. So, it is needed to reduce the critical path delay for the faster realization of a digital filter in real-time processing. This paper proposed the rules for taking efficient cutset to retime the higherorder IIR filter structure. By applying this proposed retiming/pipelining techniques to EEG preprocessing filter, the critical path delay is 28%, 23% and 18% more reduced as compared to the traditional retiming in direct form, parallel and lattice-ladder structure, respectively. These newly retimed structures are simulated in MATLAB Simulink and converted to fixed-point arithmetic for the synthesis of structures on Virtex-5 implementation. The results in different structures show that the allpass-based IIR structures has the lowest critical path delay and lowest computational complexity as compared to the conventional structures. Also, the proposed retimed structure has a smaller slice-delay product and support the largest maximum sampling frequency but requires more slice lookup tables (LUTs) than a conventional structure.

However, the spectral properties of the brain meso-scale remain mostly unexplored. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated how the meso-scale structure is organized across the frequency domain. We analyzed the resting state activity of healthy participants with source-localized high-density electroencephalography signals. Then, we inferred the community structure using weighted stochastic block-model (WSBM) to capture the landscape of meso-scale structures across the frequency domain. We found that different meso-scale modalities co-exist and are diversely organized over the frequency spectrum. Specifically, we found a core-periphery structure dominance, but we also highlighted a selective increase of disassortativity in the low frequency bands (<8 Hz), and of assortativity in the high frequency band (30-50 Hz). We further described other features of the meso-scale organization by identifying those brain regions which, at the same time, (a) exhibited the highest degree of assortativity, disassortativity, and core-peripheriness (i.e., participation) and (b) were consistently assigned to the same community, irrespective from the granularity imposed by WSBM (i.e., granularity-invariance). In conclusion, we observed that the brain spontaneous activity shows frequency-specific meso-scale organization, which may support spatially distributed and local information processing.

We report that the spatiotemporal dynamics of strong regional synchronization measured as maximal EEG spectral power-referred to as activation-and strong regional desynchronization measured as minimal EEG spectral power-referred to as suppression-are characterized by the spatial segregation of small-scale and large-scale networks. Specifically, small-scale spectral-power activations and suppressions involving only 2-7% (1-4 of 60) of EEG scalp sites were prolonged (relative to stochastic dynamics) and consistently co-localized in a frequency specific manner. For example, the small-scale networks for theta, alpha, beta(1), and beta(2) bands (4-30 Hz) consistently included frontal sites when the eyes were closed, whereas the small-scale network for gamma band (31-55 Hz) consistently clustered in medial-central-posterior sites whether the eyes were open or closed. Large-scale activations and suppressions involving over 17-30% (10-18 of 60) of EEG sites were also prolonged and generally clustered in regions complementary to where small-scale activations and suppressions clustered. In contrast, intermediate-scale activations and suppressions (involving 7-17% of EEG sites) tended to follow stochastic dynamics and were less consistently localized. These results suggest that strong synchronizations and desynchronizations tend to occur in small-scale and large-scale networks that are spatially segregated and frequency specific. These synchronization networks may broadly segregate the relatively independent and highly cooperative oscillatory processes while phase realignments fine-tune the network configurations based on behavioral demands.

Methods: Electro-encephalography (EEG) signals were recorded in PD and control groups during speech vowel production and button press tasks in response to temporally predictable and unpredictable visual stimuli. Results: Motor reaction times were slower in PD vs. control group independent of stimulus timing and movement modality. This effect was accompanied by stronger desynchronizations of low beta (13- 18 Hz) and high beta (18-25 Hz) band neural oscillations in PD vs. control prior to the onset of speech and hand movement. In addition, pre-movement desynchronization of beta band oscillations were correlated with motor reaction time in control subjects with faster responses associated with weaker beta band desynchronizations during the planning phase of movement. However, no such effect was found in the PD group. Conclusions: We suggest that the aberrant pattern of beta band desynchronization is a neural correlate of speech and upper limb motor timing deficits as a result of cortico-striatal pathology in PD. Significance: These findings motivate interventions targeted toward normalizing beta band activities for improving speech and upper limb movement timing in PD.

This research project studies the causal relationships between fluctuations of an autonomic process marker like the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and the proposed EEG band power time series (BPts). To verify the existence of directional causal relationships, using Granger Causality (GC) test between HRV and BPts. Analyses were performed using two databases, of 9 and 14 subjects respectively. Experiments consisted of spontaneous breathing and a controlled breathing task (CBT). GC was tested over Intrinsinc Mode Functions of HRV derived from Empirical Mode Decomposition and BPts computed over alpha, beta and gamma bands. Positive GC tests were observed through each experimental task, channels, IMFs, EEG band, and direction. The largest number of positive GC relationships were found from BPts to HRV when testing, higher EEG band and IMF with lower spectral content. Opposite direction achieves lower total counts, but more related with IMFs of higher spectral content. Its presence also suggests that some homeostatic condition alters the BPts course given its increment under the CBT. It is important to notice that in both cases y band achieves larger values for almost all of the studied conditions. Suggesting that such band has an important influence over HRV, but alterations on breathing condition also produce changes on BPts evolution, suggesting that the closed loop for homeostatic control alters neural dynamics at cortical level.

Initial strength of a memory appears to be an important boundary condition in determining which memories are consolidated during sleep. However, the role of consolidation-mediating oscillations, such as sleep spindles and slow oscillations, in this preferential consolidation has not been explored. Here, 54 human participants (76% female) studied pairs of words to three distinct encoding strengths, with recall being tested immediately following learning and again 6 h later. Thirty-six had a 2 h nap opportunity following learning, while the remaining 18 remained awake throughout. Results showed that, across 6 h awake, weakly encoded memories deteriorated the fastest. In the nap group, however, this effect was attenuated, with forgetting rates equivalent across encoding strengths. Within the nap group, consolidation of weakly encoded items was associated with fast sleep spindle density during non-rapid eye movement sleep. Moreover, sleep spindles that were coupled to slow oscillations predicted the consolidation of weak memories independently of uncoupled sleep spindles. These relationships were unique to weakly encoded items, with spindles not correlating with memory for intermediate or strong items. This suggests that sleep spindles facilitate memory consolidation, guided in part by memory strength.

We present the multi-modal data set containing cardiovascular (blood pressure, blood flow, electrocardiogram) and brain electrical activities to derive electroencephalogram (EEG) biomarkers of corticothalamic communication under normal, sedation, and hypoxic/ischemic conditions with ensuing recovery. We provide technical validation using EEGLAB. We also delineate the corresponding changes in the electrocardiogram (ECG)-derived heart rate variability (HRV) with the potential for future in-depth analyses of joint EEG-ECG dynamics. We review an open-source methodology to derive signatures of coupling between the ECoG and electrothalamogram (EThG) signals contained in the presented data set to better characterize the dynamics of thalamocortical communication during these clinically relevant states. The data set is presented in full band sampled at 2000 Hz, so the additional potential exists for insights from the full-band EEG and high-frequency oscillations under the bespoke experimental conditions. Future studies on the dataset may contribute to the development of new brain monitoring technologies, which will facilitate the prevention of neurological injuries.

Although EEG signals have a high temporal resolution and can provide relatively stable results, the process of constructing and analyzing brain functional networks is inevitably complicated by high time complexity. Our goal in this research was to distinguish the brain function networks of schizophrenia patients from those of healthy participants during working memory tasks. Consequently, we utilized a method involving microstates, which are each characterized by a unique topography of electric potentials over an entire channel array, to reduce the dimension of the EEG signals during working memory tasks and then compared and analyzed the brain functional networks using the microstates time series (MTS) and original time series (OTS) of the schizophrenia patients and healthy individuals. We found that the right frontal and parietaloccipital regions neurons of the schizophrenia patients were less active than those of the healthy participants during working memory tasks. Notably, compared with OTS, the time needed to construct the brain functional networks was significantly reduced by using MTS. In conclusion, our results show that, like OTS, MTS can well distinguish the brain functional network of schizophrenia patients from those of healthy individuals during working memory tasks while greatly decreasing time complexity. MTS can thus provide a method for characterizing the original time series for the construction and analysis of EEG brain functional networks. (C) 2020 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To investigate the dynamical encoding of image statistics in the human brain, we measured visual evoked potentials (VEPs) for 166 natural textures and their synthetic versions, and performed a reverse-correlation analysis of the VEPs and representative texture statistics of the image. The analysis revealed occipital VEP components strongly correlated with particular texture statistics. VEPs correlated with low-level statistics, such as subband SDs, emerged rapidly from 100 to 250 ms in a spatial frequency dependent manner. VEPs correlated with higher-order statistics, such as subband kurtosis and cross-band correlations, were observed at slightly later times. Moreover, these robust correlations enabled us to inversely estimate texture statistics from VEP signals via linear regression and to reconstruct texture images that appear similar to those synthesized with the original statistics. Additionally, we found significant differences in VEPs at 200-300 ms between some natural textures and their Portilla-Simoncelli (PS) synthesized versions, even though they shared almost identical texture statistics. This differential VEP was related to the perceptual "unnaturalness" of PS-synthesized textures. These results suggest that the visual cortex rapidly encodes image statistics hidden in natural textures specifically enough to predict the visual appearance of a texture, while it also represents high-level information beyond image statistics, and that electroencephalography can be used to decode these cortical signals.

The electroencephalogram is a promising physiological approach to assessing the online mental effort. In this study, we investigate the EEG indicators of mental effort while solving scientific problems. By manipulating the complexity of the scientific problem, the level of mental effort also changes. With the increase of mental effort, theta synchronization in the frontal region and lower alpha desynchronization in the parietal and occipital regions significantly increase. Also, upper alpha desynchronization demonstrates a widespread enhancement across the whole brain. According to the functional topography of brain activity in the theta and alpha frequency, our results suggest that the mental effort while solving scientific problems is related to working memory, visuospatial processing, semantic processing and magnitude manipulation. This study suggests the reliability of EEG to evaluate the mental effort in an educational context and provides valuable insights into improving the problem-solving abilities of students in educational practice.

The current study aimed to conceptually replicate these results. Methods: In the iSPOT-D sub-sample (n = 402), suicide ideators and low-risk individuals were identified. Confining analyses to females only, differences between low-risk individuals and suicide ideators were tested for using the electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency bands SMR (Sensori-Motor-Rhythm; 12 15 Hz), beta (14.5-30 Hz), beta I (14.5 20 Hz), beta II (20 25 Hz), beta III (25 30 Hz), gamma I (31 49 Hz) using LORETA-software. Results: None of the tested frequency bands showed to be significantly different between suicide ideators and low-risk individuals. Conclusions: The current study could not conceptually replicate the earlier published results. Several reasons could explain this non-replication, among which possible electromyographic (EMG) contamination in the beta/gamma band in the original study.

Measuring the effects of sleep on epileptogenicity with multifrequency entropy	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Epilepsy; Entropy; BECTS; Sleep	BENIGN FOCAL EPILEPSY; HEMISPHERIC LATERALIZATION; CENTROTEMPORAL SPIKES; ROLANDIC EPILEPSY; EEG COMPLEXITY; NREM SLEEP; CHILDHOOD; CHILDREN; OSCILLATIONS; IMPAIRMENT	Objective: We demonstrate that multifrequency entropy gives insight into the relationship between epileptogenicity and sleep, and forms the basis for an improved measure of medical assessment of sleep impairment in epilepsy patients. Methods: Multifrequency entropy was computed from electroencephalography measurements taken from 31 children with Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes and 31 non-epileptic controls while awake and during sleep. Values were compared in the epileptic zone and away from the epileptic zone in various sleep stages. Results: We find that (I) in lower frequencies, multifrequency entropy decreases during non-rapid eye movement sleep stages when compared with wakefulness in a general population of pediatric patients, (II) patients with Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes had lower multifrequency entropy across stages of sleep and wakefulness, and (III) the epileptic regions of the brain exhibit lower multifrequency entropy patterns than the rest of the brain in epilepsy patients. Conclusions: Our results show that multifrequency entropy decreases during sleep, particularly sleep stage 2, confirming, in a pediatric population, an association between sleep, lower multifrequency entropy, and increased likelihood of seizure. Significance: We observed a correlation between lowered multifrequency entropy and increased epileptogenicity that lays preliminary groundwork for the detection of a digital biomarker for epileptogenicity.

Infant neural responses to rhythmic stimuli may offer a solution, as neural tracking of rhythm is atypical in children with developmental language disorders. However, infant brain recordings are noisy. As a first step to developing accurate neural biomarkers, we investigate whether infant brain responses to rhythmic stimuli can be classified reliably using EEG from 95 eight-week-old infants listening to natural stimuli (repeated syllables or drumbeats). Both Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) approaches were employed. Applied to one infant at a time, the CNN discriminated syllables from drumbeats with a mean AUC of 0.87, against two levels of noise. The SVM classified with AUC 0.95 and 0.86 respectively, showing reduced performance as noise increased. Our proof-of-concept modelling opens the way to the development of clinical biomarkers for language disorders related to rhythmic entrainment.

Whether high-pain sensitive (HPS) individuals exhibit a more pronounced PAF response to pain than low-pain sensitive (LPS) individuals is unclear. As a pain model, twenty-four participants received nerve growth factor injections into a wrist extensor muscle at Day 0, Day 2, and Day 4. At Day 4, a subgroup of twelve participants also undertook eccentric wrist exercise to induce additional pain. Pain numerical rating scale (NRS) scores and electroencephalography were recorded at Day 0 (before injection), Day 4, and Day 6 for 3 minutes (eyes closed) with wrist at rest (Resting-state) and extension (Contraction-state). The average pain NRS scores in contraction-state across Days were used to divide participants into HPS (NRS-scores >= 2) and LPS groups. PAF was calculated by frequency decomposition of electroencephalographic recordings. Compared with Day 0, contraction NRS-scores only increased in HPS-group at Day 4 and Day 6 (P < .001). PAF in Contraction-state decreased in both groups at Day 6 compared with Day 0 (P = .011). Across days, HPS-group showed faster PAF than LPS-group during Resting-state and Contraction state (P < .04). Average pain NRS-scores across days during Contraction-states correlated with PAF at Day 0 (P = .012). Pain NRS-scores were associated with PAF during Contraction-state at Day 4 and Day 6 (P < .05). Perspective: PAF was slowed during long-lasting movement-related pain in both groups, suggesting a widespread change in cortical excitability independent of the pain sensitivity. Moreover, HPS individuals showed faster PAF than LPS individuals during muscle pain, which may reflect a different cognitive, emotional, or attentional response to muscle pain among individuals.

We evaluated whether defining abnormal HFO rates by statistical comparison to region-specific physiological HFO rates observed in the healthy brain improves identification of the epileptic focus and surgical outcome prediction. Methods We detected HFOs in 151 consecutive patients who underwent stereo-electroencephalography and subsequent resective epilepsy surgery at two tertiary epilepsy centers. We compared how HFOs identified the resection cavity and predicted seizure-free outcome using two thresholds from the literature (HFO rate > 1/min; 50% of the total number of a patient's HFOs) and three thresholds based on normative rates from the Montreal Neurological Institute Open iEEG Atlas (): global Atlas threshold, regional Atlas threshold, and regional + 10% threshold after regional Atlas correction. Results Using ripples, the regional + 10% threshold performed best for focus identification (77.3% accuracy, 27% sensitivity, 97.1% specificity, 80.6% positive predictive value [PPV], 78.2% negative predictive value [NPV]) and outcome prediction (69.5% accuracy, 58.6% sensitivity, 76.3% specificity, 60.7% PPV, 74.7% NPV). This was an improvement for focus identification (+1.1% accuracy, +17.0% PPV; p < .001) and outcome prediction (+12.0% sensitivity, +1.0% PPV; p = .05) compared to the 50% threshold. The improvement was particularly marked for foci in cortex, where physiological ripples are frequent (outcome: +35.3% sensitivity, +5.3% PPV; p = .014). In these cases, the regional + 10% threshold outperformed fast ripple rate > 1/min (+3.6% accuracy, +26.5% sensitivity, +21.6% PPV; p < .001) and seizure onset zone (+13.5% accuracy, +29.4% sensitivity, +17.0% PPV; p < .05-.01) for outcome prediction. Normalization did not improve the performance of fast ripples. Significance Defining abnormal HFO rates by statistical comparison to rates in healthy tissue overcomes an important weakness in the clinical use of ripples. It improves focus identification and outcome prediction compared to standard HFO measures, increasing their clinical applicability.	[Zweiphenning, Willemiek J. E.

However, it remains unknown how our knowledge about the environment shapes how it is perceived. In this training study, we evaluated whether motor and function knowledge about novel objects affects visual object processing. Forty-three participants associated a usage or function to a novel object in interactive virtual reality while their EEG was recorded. Both usage and function influenced the mu-band (8-12 Hz) rhythms, suggesting that motor and function object information influence motor processing during object recognition. Learning the usage also prevented the reduction of the theta-band (4-8 Hz) rhythms recorded over the posterior cortical areas, suggesting a predominant top-down influence of tool use information on visuo-motor pathways. The modulation being specifically induced by learning an object usage, the results support further the embodied cognition approach rather than the reasoning-based approach of object processing.

Specifically, pMFC power and pMFC-LPFC synchronization correlate with cognitive control in sustained-attention-related tasks, but the causal relationships remain unknown. In the present study, we first analyzed the correlation between EEG theta oscillations (characterized by time-frequency power and phase-based connectivity) and the level of sustained attention (Experiment 1) and then utilized transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to modulate theta oscillations and in turn observed its effects on sustained attention (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, two time-frequency regions of interest (ROIs) were determined, in which high/low time-frequency power and high/low phase-based connectivity corresponded to high/low-level sustained attention. In Experiment 2, time-frequency power and phase-based connectivity of theta oscillations were compared between the sham and tACS groups within the time-frequency ROIs determined in Experiment 1. Results showed that phase-based connectivity between pMFC and LPFC significantly decreased in the tACS group compared with the sham group during the first five minutes of the poststimulation period. Moreover, a marginal trend existed that sustained attention was downregulated by tACS in the same time interval, suggesting that theta phase synchronization between pMFC and LPFC may play a causal role in sustained attention.

J	Katyal, S; Goldin, P				Katyal, Sucharit; Goldin, Philippe			Alpha and theta oscillations are inversely related to progressive levels of meditation depth	NEUROSCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS			English	Article						attention; consciousness; mindfulness; meditation; EEG; psychophysiology	MINDFULNESS; AWARENESS; EEG; ATTENTION	Meditation training is proposed to enhance mental well-being by modulating neural activity, particularly alpha and theta brain oscillations, and autonomic activity. Although such enhancement also depends on the quality of meditation, little is known about how these neural and physiological changes relate to meditation quality. One model characterizes meditation quality as five increasing levels of 'depth': hindrances, relaxation, concentration, transpersonal qualities and nonduality. We investigated the neural oscillatory (theta, alpha, beta and gamma) and physiological (respiration rate, heart rate and heart rate variability) correlates of the self-reported meditation depth in long-term meditators (LTMs) and meditation-naive controls (CTLs). To determine the neural and physiological correlates of meditation depth, we modelled the change in the slope of the relationship between self-reported experiential degree at each of the five depth levels and the multiple neural and physiological measures. CTLs reported experiencing more 'hindrances' than LTMs, while LTMs reported more 'transpersonal qualities' and 'nonduality' compared to CTLs, confirming the experiential manipulation of meditation depth. We found that in both groups, theta (4-6 Hz) and alpha (7-13 Hz) oscillations were related to meditation depth in a precisely opposite manner. The theta amplitude positively correlated with 'hindrances' and increasingly negatively correlated with increasing meditation depth levels. Alpha amplitude negatively correlated with 'hindrances' and increasingly positively with increasing depth levels. The increase in the inverse association between theta and meditation depth occurred over different scalp locations in the two groups-frontal midline in LTMs and frontal lateral in CTLs-possibly reflecting the downregulation of two different aspects of executive processing-monitoring and attention regulation, respectively-during deep meditation. These results suggest a functional dissociation of the two classical neural signatures of meditation training, namely, alpha and theta oscillations. Moreover, while essential for overcoming 'hindrances', executive neural processing appears to be downregulated during deeper meditation experiences.

In the visual cortex reliable gamma oscillations can be recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) in the majority of individuals, which makes visual gamma an attractive candidate for biomarkers of brain disorders associated with E/I imbalance. Little is known, however, about if/how these oscillations reflect individual differences in neural excitability and associated sensory/perceptual phenomena. The power of visual gamma response (GR) changes nonlinearly with increasing stimulation intensity: it increases with transition from static to slowly drifting high-contrast grating and then attenuates with further increase in the drift rate. In a recent MEG study we found that the GR attenuation predicted sensitivity to sensory stimuli in everyday life in neurotypical adult men and in men with autism spectrum disorders. Here, we replicated these results in neurotypical female participants. The GR enhancement with transition from static to slowly drifting grating did not correlate significantly with the sensory sensitivity measures. These findings suggest that weak velocity-related attenuation of the GR is a reliable neural concomitant of visual hypersensitivity and that the degree of GR attenuation may provide useful information about E/I balance in the visual cortex.

Therefore, the processed EEG (pEEG) provides the anesthesiologist with the estimated anesthesia level. The commonly used approaches track the changes from a fast- and a low-amplitude EEG during wakefulness to a slow- and a high-amplitude EEG under general anesthesia. However, besides these changes, another EEG feature, a strong oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-12 Hz), develops in the frontal EEG. Strong alpha-band activity during general anesthesia seems to reflect an appropriate anesthetic level for certain anesthetics, but the way the common pEEG approaches react to changes in the alpha-band activity is not well explained. Hence, we investigated the impact of an artificial alpha-band modulation on pEEG approaches used in anesthesia research. METHODS: We performed our analyses based on 30 seconds of simulated sedation (n = 25) EEG, simulated anesthesia (n = 25) EEG, and EEG episodes from 20 patients extracted from a steady state that showed a clearly identifiable alpha peak in the density spectral array (DSA) and a state entropy (GE Healthcare) around 50, indicative of adequate anesthesia. From these traces, we isolated the alpha activity by band-pass filtering (8-12 Hz) and added this alpha activity to or subtracted it from the signals in a stepwise manner. For each of the original and modified signals, the following pEEG values were calculated: (1) spectral edge frequency (SEF95), (2) beta ratio, (3) spectral entropy (SpEntr), (4) approximate entropy (ApEn), and (5) permutation entropy (PeEn). RESULTS: The pEEG approaches showed different reactions to the alpha-band modification that depended on the data set and the amplification step. The beta ratio and PeEn decreased with increasing alpha activity for all data sets, indicating a deepening of anesthesia. The other pEEG approaches behaved nonuniformly. SEF95, SpEntr, and ApEn decreased with increasing alpha for the simulated anesthesia data (arousal) but decreased for simulated sedation. For the patient EEG, ApEn indicated an arousal, and SEF95 and SpEntr showed a nonuniform change. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the alpha-band activity lead to different reactions for different pEEG approaches. Hence, the presence of strong oscillatory alpha activity that reflects an adequate level of anesthesia may be interpreted differently, by an either increasing (arousal) or decreasing (deepening) pEEG value. This could complicate anesthesia navigation and prevent the adjustment to an adequate, alpha-dominant anesthesia level, when titrating by the pEEG values.

Odor identity can be extracted from the reciprocal connectivity between olfactory bulb and piriform cortex in humans	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Olfactory bulb; Piriform cortex; Odor object; Electrobulbogram; Support vector machine	GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; COMMUNICATION; NETWORK; BRAIN; FEEDFORWARD; MECHANISM; FEEDBACK	Neuronal oscillations route external and internal information across brain regions. In the olfactory system, the two central nodes -the olfactory bulb (OB) and the piriform cortex (PC) -communicate with each other via neural oscillations to shape the olfactory percept. Communication between these nodes have been well characterized in non-human animals but less is known about their role in the human olfactory system. Using a recently developed and validated EEG-based method to extract signals from the OB and PC sources, we show in healthy human participants that there is a bottom-up information flow from the OB to the PC in the beta and gamma frequency bands, while top-down information from the PC to the OB is facilitated by delta and theta oscillations. Importantly, we demonstrate that there was enough information to decipher odor identity above chance from the low gamma in the OB-PC oscillatory circuit as early as 100 ms after odor onset. These data further our understanding of the critical role of bidirectional information flow in human sensory systems to produce perception. However, future studies are needed to determine what specific odor information is extracted and communicated in the information exchange.

To comprehend entire sentences, segments consisting of multiple words need to be memorized for at least a while. However, it has been noted previously that we struggle to memorize segments longer than approximately 2.7 s. We hypothesized that electrophysiological processing cycles within the delta band (<4 Hz) underlie this time constraint. Participants' EEG was recorded while they listened to temporarily ambiguous sentences. By manipulating the speech rate, we aimed at biasing participants' interpretation: At a slow rate, segmentation after 2.7 s would trigger a correct interpretation. In contrast, at a fast rate, segmentation after 2.7 s would trigger a wrong interpretation and thus an error later in the sentence. In line with the suggested time constraint, the phase of the delta-band oscillation at the critical point in the sentence mirrored segmentation on the level of single trials, as indicated by the amplitude of the P600 event-related brain potential (ERP) later in the sentence. The correlation between upstream delta-band phase and downstream P600 amplitude implies that segmentation took place when an underlying neural oscillator had reached a specific angle within its cycle, determining comprehension. We conclude that delta-band oscillations set an endogenous time constraint on segmentation.

Separate lines of research indicate that non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is characterised by electroencephalographic slow oscillations (SO), sleep spindles, and phase-amplitude coupling of these oscillations (SO-spindle coupling), as well as an increase in high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), reflecting enhanced parasympathetic activity. The present study aimed to investigate further the potential coordination between brain and heart oscillations during NREM sleep. Data were derived from one sleep laboratory night with polysomnographic monitoring in 45 healthy participants (22 male, 23 female; mean age 37 years). The associations between the strength (modulation index [MI]) and phase direction of SO-spindle coupling (circular measure) and HF-HRV during NREM sleep were investigated using linear modelling. First, a significant SO-spindle coupling (MI) was observed for all participants during NREM sleep, with spindle peaks preferentially occurring during the SO upstate (phase direction). Second, linear model analyses of NREM sleep showed a significant relationship between the MI and HF-HRV (F = 20.1, r(2) = 0.30, p < 0.001) and a tentative circular-linear correlation between phase direction and HF-HRV (F = 3.07, r(2) = 0.12, p = 0.056). We demonstrated a co-ordination between SO-spindle phase-amplitude coupling and HF-HRV during NREM sleep, presumably related to parallel central nervous and peripheral vegetative arousal systems regulation. Further investigating the fine-graded co-ordination of brain and heart oscillations might improve our understanding of the links between sleep and cardiovascular health.

However, to date, there have been few studies conducted on how movements under different emotions influence human brain activity and cortico-muscular coupling (CMC). New methods: In this study, for the first time, electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram physiological electrical signals were used to explore this relationship. We performed frequency domain and nonlinear dynamics analyses on EEG signals and used transfer entropy to explore the CMC associated with the emotionmovement relationship. To study the transmission of information between different brain regions, we also constructed a functional brain network and calculated various network metrics using graph theory. Results: We found that, compared with a neutral emotional state, movements made during happy and sad emotions had increased CMC strength and EEG power and complexity. The functional brain network metrics of these three emotional states were also different. Comparison with existing methods: Much of the emotion-movement relationship research has been based on subjective expression and external performance. Our research method, however, focused on the processing of physiological electrical signals, which contain a wealth of information and can objectively reveal the inner mechanisms of the emotion-movement relationship. Conclusions: Different emotional states can have a significant influence on human movement. This study presents a detailed introduction to brain activity and CMC.

Application of a convolutional neural network for fully-automated detection of spike ripples in the scalp electroencephalogram	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; high frequency oscillations; ripples; convolutional neural network	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SEIZURE-ONSET ZONE; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHY; MECHANISMS; BIOMARKERS; REMISSION; EVENTS	Background: A reliable biomarker to identify cortical tissue responsible for generating epileptic seizures is required to guide prognosis and treatment in epilepsy. Combined spike ripple events are a promising biomarker for epileptogenic tissue that currently require expert review for accurate identification. This expert review is time consuming and subjective, limiting reproducibility and high-throughput applications. New method: To address this limitation, we develop a fully-automated method for spike ripple detection. The method consists of a convolutional neural network trained to compute the probability that a spectrogram image contains a spike ripple. Results: We validate the proposed spike ripple detector on expert-labeled data and show that this detector accurately separates subjects with low and high seizure risks. Comparison with Existing Method: The proposed method performs as well as existing methods that require manual validation of candidate spike ripple events. The introduction of a fully automated method reduces subjectivity and increases rigor and reproducibility of this epilepsy biomarker. Conclusion: We introduce and validate a fully-automated spike ripple detector to support utilization of this epilepsy biomarker in clinical and translational work.

Reducing A beta has been considered a major AD treatment strategy in pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Impairment of gamma oscillations, which play an important role in perception and cognitive function, has been shown in mouse AD models and human patients. Recently, the therapeutic effect of gamma entrainment in AD mouse models has been reported. Given that ultrasound is an emerging neuromodulation modality, we investigated the effect of ultrasound stimulation pulsed at gamma frequency (40 Hz) in an AD mouse model. Methods: We implanted electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes and a piezo-ceramic disc ultrasound transducer on the skull surface of 6-month-old 5xFAD and wild-type control mice (n = 12 and 6, respectively). Six 5xFAD mice were treated with two-hour ultrasound stimulation at 40 Hz daily for two weeks, and the other six mice received sham treatment. Soluble and insoluble A beta levels in the brain were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Spontaneous EEG gamma power was computed by wavelet analysis, and the brain connectivity was examined with phase-locking value and cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling. Results: We found that the total A beta 42 levels, especially insoluble A beta 42, in the treatment group decreased in pre- and infra-limbic cortex (PIL) compared to that of the sham treatment group. A reduction in the number of A beta plaques was also observed in the hippocampus. There was no increase in microbleeding in the transcranial ultrasound stimulation (tUS) group. In addition, the length and number of microglial processes decreased in PIL and hippocampus. Encelphalographic spontaneous gamma power was increased, and cross-frequency coupling was normalized, implying functional improvement after tUS stimulation. Conclusion: These results suggest that the transcranial ultrasound-based gamma-band entrainment technique can be an effective therapy for AD by reducing the A beta load and improving brain connectivity.

However, their efficacy is limited and, consequently, the symptoms persist into adulthood. Critical for this lack of efficacy is the still ongoing debate about the core deficit in dyslexia and its underlying neurobiological causes. There is ample evidence on phonological as well as auditory temporal processing deficits in dyslexia and, on the other hand, cortical gamma oscillations in the auditory cortex as functionally relevant for the extraction of linguistically meaningful information units from the acoustic signal. The present work aims to shed more light on the link between auditory gamma oscillations, phonological awareness, and literacy skills in dyslexia. By mean of EEG, individual gamma frequencies were assessed in a group of children and adolescents diagnosed with dyslexia as well as in an age-matched control group with typical literacy skills. Furthermore, phonological awareness was assessed in both groups, while in dyslexic participants also reading and writing performance was measured. We found significantly lower gamma peak frequencies as well as lower phonological awareness scores in dyslexic participants compared to age-matched controls. Additionally, results showed a positive correlation between the individual gamma frequency and phonological awareness. Our data suggest a hierarchical structure of neural gamma oscillations, phonological awareness, and literacy skills. Thereby, the results emphasize altered gamma oscillation not only as a core deficit in dyslexia but also as a potential target for future causal interventions. We discuss these findings considering non-invasive brain stimulation techniques and suggest transcranial alternating current stimulation as a promising approach to normalize dysfunctional oscillations in dyslexia.

PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha oscillations; attention; cognitive control; error processing; pupillometry	INTEGRATIVE THEORY; ERROR; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; THETA	This study investigated whether detection of a performance mistake is followed by adaptive or detrimental effects on subsequent attention and performance. Using a Stroop task with spatial cueing, along with simultaneous EEG and pupillary measurements, we examined evidence bearing on two alternative hypotheses: maladaptive arousal and adaptive control. Error detection, indexed by the error-related negativity ERP component, was followed by pupil dilation and suppression of EEG oscillations in the alpha band, two indices of arousal that were associated with one another on a trial-by-trial basis. On the trials following errors, there was neural evidence of enhanced spatial cueing, manifested in greater hemispheric activation contralateral to the cued visual field. However, this post-error enhancement was not followed by changes in Stroop or spatial cueing effects in performance, nor by increased attentional cueing effects in ERP responses to targets. Rather, performance tended to be slower and less accurate following errors compared to correct trials, and higher post-response arousal, indexed by larger pupils, predicted next-trial slowing and decreased P2 amplitude to targets. Results favor the maladaptive arousal account of post-error cognitive control and offer only limited support for adaptive control.

The goal of this study was to scrutinize the role of alpha oscillations in communication within a cortico-cerebellar network implicated in motor sequence learning. To this end, we conducted two EEG experiments using a serial reaction time task. In the first experiment, we explored changes in alpha power and cross-channel alpha coherence as subjects learned a motor sequence. We found a gradual decrease in spectral alpha power over left premotor cortex (PMC) and sensorimotor cortex (SM1) during learning blocks. In addition, alpha coherence between left PMC/SM1 and left cerebellar crus I was specifically decreased during sequence learning, possibly reflecting a functional decoupling in the broader motor learning network. In the second experiment in a different cohort, we applied 10Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a method shown to entrain local oscillatory activity, to left M1 (lM1) and right cerebellum (rCB) during sequence learning. We observed a tendency for diminished learning following rCB tACS compared to sham, but not following lM1 tACS. Learning-related alpha power following rCB tACS was increased in left PMC, possibly reflecting increase in local inhibitory neural activity. Importantly, learning-specific alpha coherence between left PMC and right cerebellar lobule VIIb was enhanced following rCB tACS. These findings provide strong evidence for a causal role of alpha oscillations in controlling information transfer in a premotor-cerebellar loop during motor sequence learning. Our findings are consistent with a model in which sequence learning may be impaired by enhancing premotor cortical alpha oscillation via external modulation of cerebellar oscillations.

Altered Sleep-Related Consolidation and Neurocognitive Comorbidity in CECTS	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						neuroplasticity; active system consolidation; neuronal oscillations; sleep electrophysiology; memory	BENIGN CHILDHOOD EPILEPSY; CENTROTEMPORAL SPIKES BECTS; MICRORNA-328 BINDING-SITE; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; EEG CHARACTERISTICS; SPINDLE EVOLUTION; CHILDREN; ONSET; REACTIVATION	Our aim is to use neurophysiological sleep-related consolidation (SRC) phenomena to identify putative pathophysiological mechanisms in CECTS linked to diffuse neurocognitive deficits. We argue that there are numerous studies on the association between seizure aspects and neurocognitive functioning but not as many on interictal variables and neurocognitive deficits. We suggest two additional foci. First, the interictal presentation in CECTS and second, neuronal oscillations involved in SRC processes. Existing data on mechanisms through which interictal epileptiform spikes (IES) impact upon SRC indicate that they have the potential to: (a) perturb cross-regional coupling of neuronal oscillations, (b) mimic consolidation processes, (c) alter the precision of the spatiotemporal coupling of oscillations, and (d) variably impact upon SRC performance. Sleep spindles merit systematic study in CECTS in order to clarify: (a) the state of the slow oscillations (SOs) with which they coordinate, (b) the precision of slow oscillation-spindle coupling, and (c) whether their developmental trajectories differ from those of healthy children. We subsequently review studies on the associations between IES load during NREM sleep and SRC performance in childhood epilepsy. We then use sleep consolidation neurophysiological processes and their interplay with IES to help clarify the diffuse neurocognitive deficits that have been empirically documented in CECTS. We claim that studying SRC in CECTS will help to clarify pathophysiological mechanisms toward diverse neurocognitive deficits. Future developments could include close links between the fields of epilepsy and sleep, as well as new therapeutic neurostimulation targets. At the clinical level, children diagnosed with CECTS could benefit from close monitoring with respect to epilepsy, sleep and neurocognitive functions.

Oxytocin reduces romantic rejection-induced pain in online speed-dating as revealed by decreased frontal-midline theta oscillations	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Analgesic effect; Electroencephalography; Intranasal oxytocin; Social pain; Source localization; Theta oscillation	INTRANASAL OXYTOCIN; SOCIAL EXCLUSION; BRAIN RESPONSES; BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; DOUBLE-BLIND; EMOTION; METAANALYSIS; SENSITIVITY; MODULATION; OSTRACISM	Background: Romantic rejection is an emotionally distressful experience profoundly affecting life, possibly leading to mental illness or suicide. Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide widely implicated in reducing physical pain and negative emotions; however, whether OT has an effect on reducing intense social pain (e.g., romantic rejection) remains unknown. Here, we tested the effect of OT on social pain and investigated its role in the outcome evaluation phase of social decision-making. Methods: Electroencephalographic recordings were obtained between August 2nd and October 20th, 2020 in Shenzhen University from 61 healthy participants in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a betweensubject design. We defined frontal-midline theta oscillation as a neural signature of social pain and assessed self-reported pleasantness ratings for four possible romantic outcomes in an online speed-dating task. Results: In the placebo group, greater theta power was induced by romantic rejection, being associated with rejection distress. This pattern was not observed in the OT group, where romantic rejection induced significantly decreased theta power compared to the placebo group; in the OT group, there was no association between theta power and rejection distress. Furthermore, the frontal-midline theta oscillation could be source-localized to brain areas overlapping with the physical-social pain matrix (i.e., somatosensory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, frontal pole, and supplementary motor area). Conclusions: OT relieves social pain caused by romantic rejection, reflected in decreased frontal-midline theta oscillations and a diminished connection between theta power and rejection distress. These findings can help understand and harness OT's pain-reducing effect on social pain.

J	Boran, E; Stieglitz, L; Sarnthein, J				Boran, Ece; Stieglitz, Lennart; Sarnthein, Johannes			Epileptic High-Frequency Oscillations in Intracranial EEG Are Not Confounded by Cognitive Tasks	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						epilepsy surgery; seizure onset zone; epileptogenic zone; medial temporal lobe; working memory; emotional processing; hippocampus; amygdala	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; FAST RIPPLES; SCALP EEG; EPILEPTOGENICITY; HIPPOCAMPUS; RESECTION; AMYGDALA; HFO	Rationale: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial EEG (iEEG) are used to delineate the epileptogenic zone during presurgical diagnostic assessment in patients with epilepsy. HFOs are historically divided into ripples (80-250 Hz), fast ripples (FR, >250 Hz), and their co-occurrence (FRandR). In a previous study, we had validated the rate of FRandRs during deep sleep to predict seizure outcome. Here, we ask whether epileptic FRandRs might be confounded by physiological FRandRs that are unrelated to epilepsy. Methods: We recorded iEEG in the medial temporal lobe MTL (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala) in 17 patients while they performed cognitive tasks. The three cognitive tasks addressed verbal working memory, visual working memory, and emotional processing. In our previous studies, these tasks activated the MTL. We re-analyzed the data of these studies with the automated detector that focuses on the co-occurrence of ripples and FRs (FRandR). Results: For each task, we identified those channels in which the HFO rate was modulated during the task condition compared to the control condition. However, the number of these channels did not exceed the chance level. Interestingly, even during wakefulness, the HFO rate was higher for channels within the seizure onset zone (SOZ) than for channels outside the SOZ. Conclusion: Our prospective definition of an epileptic HFO, the FRandR, is not confounded by physiological HFOs that might be elicited by our cognitive tasks. This is reassuring for the clinical use of FRandR as a biomarker of the EZ.

Most studies addressing this question use highly controlled tasks with homogenous subject pools. In an effort to take a more naturalistic approach, we collaborated with art institutions to crowdsource neuroscience data: Over the course of 5 years, we collected electroencephalogram (EEG) data from thousands of museum and festival visitors who volunteered to engage in a 10-min face-to-face interaction. Pairs of participants with various levels of familiarity sat inside the Mutual Wave Machine-an artistic neurofeedback installation that translates real-time correlations of each pair's EEG activity into light patterns. Because such inter-participant EEG correlations are prone to noise contamination, in subsequent offline analyses we computed inter-brain coupling using Imaginary Coherence and Projected Power Correlations, two synchrony metrics that are largely immune to instantaneous, noise-driven correlations. When applying these methods to two subsets of recorded data with the most consistent protocols, we found that pairs' trait empathy, social closeness, engagement, and social behavior (joint action and eye contact) consistently predicted the extent to which their brain activity became synchronized, most prominently in low alpha (similar to 7-10 Hz) and beta (similar to 20-22 Hz) oscillations. These findings support an account where shared engagement and joint action drive coupled neural activity and behavior during dynamic, naturalistic social interactions. To our knowledge, this work constitutes a first demonstration that an interdisciplinary, real-world, crowdsourcing neuroscience approach may provide a promising method to collect large, rich datasets pertaining to real-life face-to-face interactions. Additionally, it is a demonstration of how the general public can participate and engage in the scientific process outside of the laboratory. Institutions such as museums, galleries, or any other organization where the public actively engages out of self-motivation, can help facilitate this type of citizen science research, and support the collection of large datasets under scientifically controlled experimental conditions. To further enhance the public interest for the out-of-the-lab experimental approach, the data and results of this study are disseminated through a website tailored to the general public (wp.nyu.edu/mutualwavemachine).

Important molecular targets of general anesthetics have been identified, but the neural circuits underlying the discrete end points of general anesthesia remain incompletely understood. General anesthesia and natural sleep share the common feature of reversible unconsciousness, and recent developments in neuroscience have enabled elegant studies that investigate the brain nuclei and neural circuits underlying this important end point. A common approach to measure cortical activity across the brain is electroencephalogram (EEG), which can reflect local neuronal activity as well as connectivity among brain regions. The EEG oscillations observed during general anesthesia depend greatly on the anesthetic agent as well as dosing, and only some resemble those observed during sleep. For example, the EEG oscillations during dexmedetomidine sedation are similar to those of stage 2 nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, but high doses of propofol and ether anesthetics produce burst suppression, a pattern that is never observed during natural sleep. Sleep is primarily driven by withdrawal of subcortical excitation to the cortex, but anesthetics can directly act at both subcortical and cortical targets. While some anesthetics appear to activate specific sleep-active regions to induce unconsciousness, not all sleep-active regions play a significant role in anesthesia. Anesthetics also inhibit cortical neurons, and it is likely that each class of anesthetic drugs produces a distinct combination of subcortical and cortical effects that lead to unconsciousness. Conversely, arousal circuits that promote wakefulness are involved in anesthetic emergence and activating them can induce emergence and accelerate recovery of consciousness. Modern neuroscience techniques that enable the manipulation of specific neural circuits have led to new insights into the neural circuitry underlying general anesthesia and sleep. In the coming years, we will continue to better understand the mechanisms that generate these distinct states of reversible unconsciousness.

J	Gyurkovics, M; Levita, L				Gyurkovics, Mate; Levita, Liat			Dynamic Adjustments of Midfrontal Control Signals in Adults and Adolescents	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						adolescence; cognitive control; cognitive development; midfrontal theta oscillations		During task performance, our level of cognitive control is dynamically adjusted to task demands as reflected, for example, by the congruency sequence effect (CSE) in conflict tasks. Although brain areas related to cognitive control show protracted maturation across adolescence, previous studies found that adolescents show similar behavioral CSE5 to adults. In the present study, we investigated whether there are age-related changes in the neural underpinnings of dynamic control adjustments using electroencephalography. Early adolescents (ages 12-14, N= 30) and young adults (ages 25-27, N= 29) completed a confound-minimized flanker task optimized for the detection of sequential control adjustments. The CSE was observed in midfrontal theta power thought to capture anterior cingulate cortex-mediated monitoring processes but was not modulated significantly by age. Adolescents, however, showed a smaller congruency effect in the power and cross-trial temporal consistency of midfrontal theta oscillations than adults. No age differences were observed in phase-based connectivity between midfrontal and lateral frontal regions in the theta band. These findings provide strong support for the role of midfrontal theta oscillations in conflict monitoring and reactive control and suggest that the cognitive system of early adolescents initially responds less reliably to the occurrence of conflict than that of adults.

Effects of changes in end-tidal PO2 and PCO2 on neural responses during rest and sustained attention	PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS			English	Article						arterial blood gasses; attention; EEG; neural oscillations; neurovascular coupling; P3 ERP	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA; CARBON-DIOXIDE; INTERMITTENT HYPOXIA; DOPPLER ULTRASOUND; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; VASCULAR-RESPONSE; HIGH-ALTITUDE; HYPERCAPNIA; ACTIVATION	Impairments of cognitive function during alterations in arterial blood gases (e.g., high-altitude hypoxia) may result from the disruption of neurovascular coupling; however, the link between changes in arterial blood gases, cognition, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) is poorly understood. To interrogate this link. we developed a multimodal empirical strategy capable of monitoring neural correlates of cognition and CBF simultaneously. Human participants performed a sustained attention task during hypoxia, hypercapnia, hypocapnia, and normoxia while electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and CBF (middle and posterior cerebral arteries; transcranial Doppler ultrasound) were simultaneously measured. The protocol alternated between rest and engaging in a visual target detection task that required participants to monitor a sequence of brief-duration colored circles and detect infrequent, longer duration circles (targets). The target detection task was overlaid on a large, circular checkerboard that provided robust visual stimulation. Spectral decomposition and event-related potential (ERP) analyses were applied to the EEG data to investigate spontaneous and task-specific fluctuations in neural activity. There were three main sets of findings: (1) spontaneous alpha oscillatory activity was modulated as a function of arterial CO2 (hypocapnia and hypercapnia), (2) task-related neurovascular coupling was disrupted by all arterial blood gas manipulations, and (3) changes in task-related alpha and theta band activity and attenuation of the P3 ERP component amplitude were observed during hypocapnia. Since alpha and theta are linked with suppression of visual processing and executive control and P3 amplitude with task difficulty, these data suggest that transient arterial blood gas changes can modulate multiple stages of cognitive information processing.

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether the discrimination of Same (matched) and Different (unmatched) syllable pairs elicit different patterns of sensorimotor activity as stimuli are processed in working memory. Raw EEG data recorded from 42 participants were decomposed with independent component analysis to identify bilateral sensorimotor mu rhythms from 36 subjects. Time frequency decomposition of mu rhythms revealed concurrent event related desynchronization (ERD) in alpha and beta frequency bands across the peri- and post-stimulus time periods, which were interpreted as evidence of sensorimotor contributions to working memory encoding and maintenance. Left hemisphere alpha/beta ERD was stronger in Different trials than Same trials during the post-stimulus period, while right hemisphere alpha/beta ERD was stronger in Same trials than Different trials. A between-hemispheres contrast revealed no differences during Same trials, while post-stimulus alpha/beta ERD was stronger in the left hemisphere than the right during Different trials. Results were interpreted to suggest that predictive coding mechanisms lead to repetition suppression effects in Same trials. Mismatches arising from predictive coding mechanisms in Different trials shift subsequent working memory processing to the speech-dominant left hemisphere. Findings clarify how sensorimotor activity differentially supports working memory encoding and maintenance stages during speech discrimination tasks and have potential to inform sensorimotor models of speech perception and working memory.

Entraining brain alpha activity through noninvasive visual stimulation has been shown to reduce experimental pain in healthy volunteers. Neural oscillations entrainment offers a potential noninvasive and nonpharmacological intervention for patients with chronic pain, which can be delivered in the home setting and has the potential to reduce use of medications. However, evidence supporting its use in patients with chronic pain is lacking. This study explores whether (a) alpha entrainment increase alpha power in patients and (b) whether this increase in alpha correlates with analgesia. In total, 28 patients with chronic pain sat in a comfortable position and underwent 4-min visual stimulation using customised goggles at 10 Hz (alpha) and 7 Hz (control) frequency blocks in a randomised cross-over design. 64-channel electroencephalography and 11-point numeric rating scale pain intensity and pain unpleasantness scores were recorded before and after stimulation. Electroencephalography analysis revealed frontal alpha power was significantly higher when stimulating at 10 Hz when compared to 7 Hz. There was a significant positive correlation between increased frontal alpha and reduction in pain intensity (r = 0.33; P < 0.05) and pain unpleasantness (r = 0.40; P < 0.05) in the 10 Hz block. This study provides the first proof of concept that changes in alpha power resulting from entrainment correlate with an analgesic response in patients with chronic pain. Further studies are warranted to investigate dose-response parameters and equivalence to analgesia provided by medications.

The testing of connectivity estimators is still an open issue because of the lack of a ground-truth in real data. Existing solutions such as the generation of simulated data based on a manually imposed connectivity pattern or mass oscillators can model only a few real cases with limited number of signals and spectral properties that do not reflect those of real brain activity. Furthermore, the generation of time series reproducing non-ideal and non-stationary ground-truth models is still missing. In this work, we present the SEED-G toolbox for the generation of pseudo-EEG data with imposed connectivity patterns, overcoming the existing limitations and enabling control of several parameters for data simulation according to the user's needs.

The outcome measures included plasma melatonin levels, sleep architecture, and the sleep EEG power ratio.Results: Compared with healthy controls, MDD patients presented abnormalities in the diurnal rhythm of melatonin secretion, including peak phase delayed 3 h and a decrease in plasma melatonin levels at night and an increase at daytime, accompanied by sleep disturbances, a decrease in low-frequency bands and an increase in high-frequency bands, and the dominant right-side brain activity. Several of these abnormalities (abnormalities in the diurnal rhythm of melatonin secretion, partial sleep architecture parameters) persisted for at least the 8-week testing period.Conclusions: Eight weeks of treatment with escitalopram significantly improved subjective sleep perception and depressive symptoms of patients with MDD, and partially improved objective sleep parameters, while the improvement of circadian rhythm of melatonin was limited.

The brain age index (BAI) is a machine learning model that quantifies deviations in brain activity during sleep relative to healthy individuals of the same age. High BAI was previously found to be associated with neurological, psychiatric, cardiometabolic diseases, and reduced life expectancy among people without HIV. Here, we estimated the effect of HIV infection on BAI by comparing PLWH and HIV- controls. Methods: Clinical data and sleep EEGs from 43 PLWH on antiretroviral therapy (HIV+) and 3,155 controls (HIV-) were collected from Massachusetts General Hospital. The effect of HIV infection on BAI, and on individual EEG features, was estimated using causal inference. Results: The average effect of HIV on BAI was estimated to be +3.35 years (p < 0.01, 95% CI = [0.67, 5.92]) using doubly robust estimation. Compared to HIV- controls, HIV+ participants exhibited a reduction in delta band power during deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. Conclusion: We provide causal evidence that HIV contributes to advanced brain aging reflected in sleep EEG. A better understanding is greatly needed of potential therapeutic targets to mitigate the effect of HIV on brain health, potentially including sleep disorders and cardiovascular disease	[Leone, Michael J.; Sun, Haoqi; Boutros, Christine L.; Ye, Elissa; Sullivan, Lee; Robbins, Gregory K.; Mukerji, Shibani S.; Westover, M.

This seemingly worthless sentence is an informal description of the hairy ball theorem, an invaluable mathematical weapon that has been proven useful to describe a variety of physical/biological processes/phenomena in terms of topology, rather than classical cause/effect relationships. In this paper we will focus on the electrical brain field-electroencephalogram (EEG). As a starting point we consider the recently-raised observation that, when electromagnetic oscillations propagate with a spherical wave front, there must be at least one point of the tangential components of the vector fields where the electromagnetic field vanishes. We show how this description holds also for the electric waves produced by the brain and detectable by EEG. Once located these zero-points in EEG traces, we confirm that they are able to modify the electric wave fronts detectable in the brain. This sheds new light on the functional features of a nonlinear, metastable nervous system at the edge of chaos, based on the neuroscientific model of Operational Architectonics of brain-mind functioning. As an example of practical application of this theorem, we provide testable previsions, suggesting the proper location of transcranial magnetic stimulation's coils to improve the clinical outcomes of drug-resistant epilepsy.

Whether similar attentional rhythms exist in other sensory modalities, however, is not yet clear. We therefore adapted and extended an established paradigm to investigate visual and potential auditory attentional rhythms, as well as possible interactions, on both a behavioural (detection performance, N = 33) and a neural level (EEG, N = 18). The results during unimodal attention demonstrate that both visual- and auditory-target detection fluctuate at frequencies of approximately 4-8 Hz, confirming that attentional rhythms are not specific to visual processing. The EEG recordings provided evidence of oscillatory activity that underlies these behavioural effects. At right and left occipital EEG electrodes, we detected counter-phasic theta-band activity (4-8 Hz), mirroring behavioural evidence of alternating sampling between the objects presented right and left of central fixation, respectively. Similarly, alpha-band activity as a signature of relatively suppressed sensory encoding showed a theta-rhythmic, counter-phasic change in power. Moreover, these theta-rhythmic changes in alpha power were predictive of behavioural performance in both sensory modalities. Overall, the present findings provide a new perspective on the multimodal rhythmicity of attention.

We compared SPD variations between 15 fibromyalgia (FM) women in use of opioid in the last three months (73.33% used tramadol) with 32 non-users. EEG data were obtained with Eyes Open (EO) and Eyes Closed (EC) resting state. SPD peak amplitudes between EO-EC were smaller in opioid users in central theta, central beta, and parietal beta, and at parietal delta. However, these variations were positive for opioid users. Multivariate analyses of variance (ANOVAs) revealed that EO-EC variations in parietal delta were negatively correlated with the disability due to pain, and central and parietal beta activity variations were positively correlated with worse sleep quality. These clinical variables explained from 12.5 to 17.2% of SPD variance. In addition, central beta showed 67% sensitivity / 72% specificity and parietal beta showed 73% sensitivity/62% specificity in discriminating opioid users from non-users. These findings suggest oscillations in EEG might be a sensitive surrogate marker to screen FM opioid users and a promising tool to understand the effects of opioid use and how these effects relate to functional and sleep-related symptoms.

It remains unknown whether or not different neurobiological markers underlying depression symptoms in BD depression and major depression disorder (MDD). Methods: 24 patients with BD depression and 20 healthy controls were included. Participants underwent evaluation with the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS), followed by the classical gambling paradigm, while undergoing 64-channel electroencephalography. The waveform of feedback-related negativity (FRN) was extracted from the 250-350 ms time-window after participants received feedback regarding loss or gain. Eventrelated potential datasets were obtained using time-frequency analysis. Results: (1) The TEPS scores of the patients were significantly lower than those of the controls [t (42) = 5.16, p < 0.01]. (2) The event of loss elicited a deeper FRN in patients than that in controls [t (42) = 2.19, p < 0.05], while no difference was observed in the event of gains (t (42) = 1.12, p > 0.05). (3) Theta power rooted in FRN in patients was significantly higher in loss than in gain [F (1,42) = 30.32, p < 0.01]. (4) Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) illustrated the interaction effect of theta power in gain/loss between two groups [F (1,42) = 3.59, p = 0.06]. Limitation: Our study did not analyze the effect of different drugs which might affect our results. Conclusion: The enhanced reflection of negative feedback was consistent with the negative bias, impulse control impairment, and emotional dysregulation observed in the bipolar disorder spectrum. We suggested that the extreme theta power generated from the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC) might be the main component of abnormal FRN.

They are most commonly observed over areas generating seizures and increase in occurrence during the ictal compared to the interictal period. It has been hypothesized that their rate correlates with the severity of epilepsy and seizure in affected individuals. In the present study, it was aimed to investigate whether the HFO count mirrors the observed behavioral seizure severity using a kainate rat model for temporal lobe epilepsy. Seizures were selected during the chronic epilepsy phase of this model and classified by behavioral severity according to the Racine scale. Seizures with Racine scale 5&6 were considered generalized and severe. HFOs were marked in 24 seizures during a preictal, ictal, and postictal EEG segment. The duration covered by the HFO during these different segments was analyzed and compared between mild and severe seizures. HFOs were significantly increased during ictal periods (p < 0.001) and significantly decreased during postictal periods (p < 0.03) compared to the ictal segment. Ictal ripples (p = 0.04) as well as fast ripples (p = 0.02) were significantly higher in severe seizures compared to mild seizures. The present study demonstrates that ictal HFO occurrence mirrors seizure severity in a chronic focal epilepsy model in rats. This is similar to recent observations in patients with refractory mesio-temporal lobe epilepsy. Moreover, postictal HFO decrease might reflect postictal inhibition of epileptic activity. Overall results provide additional evidence that HFOs can be used as biomarkers for measuring seizure severity in epilepsy.

Alpha oscillations in visuospatial attention	TRENDS IN NEUROSCIENCES			English	Review							SPATIAL ATTENTION; DISCRIMINATION PERFORMANCE; LOCAL ENTRAINMENT; EEG OSCILLATIONS; PHASE; SUPPRESSION; MODULATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; EXCITABILITY; INHIBITION	A well-established finding in the literature of human studies is that alpha activity (rhythmical brain activity around 10 Hz) shows retinotopic amplitude modulation during shifts in visual attention. Thus, it has long been argued that alpha amplitude modulation might play a crucial role in attention-driven alterations in visual information processing. Recently, there has been a revival of the topic, driven in part by new studies directly investigating the possible causal relationship between alpha activity and responses to visual input, both neuronally and perceptually. Here, we discuss evidence for and against a causal role of alpha activity in visual attentional processing. We conclude with hypotheses regarding the mechanisms by which top-down-modulated alpha activity in the parietal cortex might select visual information for attentive processing.

It is unclear whether there are differences in the neural mechanisms of conceptual and lexical retrieval when spreading activation through semantic memory is initiated by verbal or nonverbal settings. The same twenty participants took part in two EEG experiments. The first experiment examined conceptual and lexical retrieval following nonverbal settings, whereas the second experiment was a replication of previous studies examining conceptual and lexical retrieval following verbal settings. Target pictures were presented after constraining and nonconstraining contexts. In the nonverbal settings, contexts were provided as two priming pictures (e.g., constraining: nest, feather; nonconstraining: anchor, lipstick; target picture: BIRD). In the verbal settings, contexts were provided as sentences (e.g., constraining: "The farmer milked a ..."; nonconstraining: "The child drew a ..."; target picture: COW). Target pictures were named faster following constraining contexts in both experiments, indicating that conceptual preparation starts before target picture onset in constraining conditions. In the verbal experiment, we replicated the alpha-beta power decreases in constraining relative to nonconstraining conditions before target picture onset. No such power decreases were found in the nonverbal experiment. Power decreases in constraining relative to nonconstraining conditions were significantly different between experiments. Our findings suggest that participants engage in conceptual preparation following verbal and nonverbal settings, albeit differently. The retrieval of a target word, initiated by verbal settings, is associated with alphabeta power decreases. By contrast, broad conceptual preparation alone, prompted by nonverbal settings, does not seem enough to elicit alpha-beta power decreases. These findings have implications for theories of oscillations and semantic memory.

Furthermore, to assess whether F-HFOs are enhanced in photosensitive epileptic patients and if they might be proposed as a putative non-provocative biomarker of photosensitivity. Methods: We studied 19 photosensitive patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy, and 22 controls matched for demographic features. We extracted F-HFOs from the broadband scalp flash-visual evoked potential (b F-VEP) through appropriate filtering. We measured F-HFO amplitude, number and latency. Also, we carried out a timefrequency domain spectral F-HFO analysis. Inter-group statistics was performed. Within-groups, F-HFO features were correlated to the b F-VEP. Results: The N3-N3I wave of the b F-VEP was significantly (p = 0.01) larger in patients compared to controls. The same was true for the inter-group F-HFO amplitude (p = 0.01). F-HFOs showed two main spectral peaks (-88 and -125 Hz), whose power was greater (p = 0.001) in patients than in controls. The -88 Hz peak power exceeded the upper normal range in 15/19 patients. Patients showed a significant (p = 0.04) correlation between the -88 Hz peak power and the size of the N3-N3I wave. Significance: A simplified F-HFO measurement proved feasible. In patients, F-HFOs were enhanced in terms of both size and spectral power, suggesting a role in the generation of the photoparoxysmal response. Some spectral features of the F-HFOs may be proposed as a putative non-provocative marker of epileptic photosensitivity.

This ability grows as brain networks develop depending on the experience; thus, being able to appropriately detect external stimuli is of great importance. The alpha band is known to be related to detection and perception of salient stimuli; however, there are few studies that have examined the role of alpha oscillations in ToM. The aim of the study is to investigate relation of alpha coherence and power to ToM. Methods: Eyes open resting state EEG was recorded from each participant. After a period of time, the participants were invited to complete ToM test. ToM ability measured by the Theory of Mind-Humor Comprehension and Appreciation Test (ToM-HCAT). Coherence and power values for the candidate connection groups were calculated in the alpha band (8-13 Hz; n=45). Results: The hypoconnectivity in the right posterior area was related to a better ToM ability (rs(42)=-0.395, p=0.008). The correlation was preserved only in males rs(18)=-0.522, p=0.018, and there was not a significant relation for females rs(22)=-0.335, p=0.110. Conclusion: We showed that the ToM ability was related to alpha coherence dimensionally within healthy population. Although the direct relation of alpha coherence with the ToM ability is unclear, it is highly possible that attention plays a mediatory role between neural network development and the capacity of this network to process social cognition.

Given tremendous developmental changes in SP and SO morphology, it remains elusive whether across childhood the same mechanisms as identified in adults are functional. Based on topography and frequency, we characterize slow and fast SPs and their temporal coupling to SOs in 24 pre-school children. Further, we ask whether slow and fast SPs and their modulation during SOs are associated with behavioral indicators of declarative memory consolidation as suggested by the literature on adults. Employing an individually tailored approach, we reliably identify an inherent, development-specific fast centro-parietal SP type, nested in the adult-like slow SP frequency range, along with a dominant slow frontal SP type. Further, we provide evidence that the modulation of fast centro-parietal SPs during SOs is already present in pre-school children. However, the temporal coordination between fast centro-parietal SPs and SOs is weaker and less precise than expected from research on adults. While we do not find evidence for a critical contribution of SP-SO coupling for memory consolidation, crucially, slow frontal and fast centro-parietal SPs are each differentially related to sleep-associated consolidation of items of varying quality. Whereas a higher number of slow frontal SPs is associated with stronger maintenance of medium-quality memories, a higher number of fast centro-parietal SPs is linked to a greater gain of low-quality items. Our results demonstrate two functionally relevant inherent SP types in pre-school children although SP-SO coupling is not yet fully mature.

Phase Resetting in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex Subserves Childhood Attention and Is Impaired by Epilepsy	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						ADHD; Attention; oscillations; phase resetting	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TRANSITORY COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; DISTINCT NEURAL CIRCUITS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; PRESTIMULUS ALPHA; EEG DISCHARGES; CHILDREN; NETWORK; DORSAL; SET	The neural mechanisms that underlie selective attention in children are poorly understood. By administering a set-shifting task to children with intracranial electrodes stereotactically implanted within anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) for epilepsy monitoring, we demonstrate that selective attention in a set-shifting task is dependent upon theta-band phase resetting immediately following stimulus onset and that the preferred theta phase angle is predictive of reaction time during attentional shift. We also observe selective enhancement of oscillatory coupling between the ACC and the dorsal attention network and decoupling with the default mode network during task performance. When transient focal epileptic activity occurs around the time of stimulus onset, phase resetting is impaired, connectivity changes with attentional and default mode networks are abolished, and reaction times are prolonged. The results of the present work highlight the fundamental mechanistic role of oscillatory phase in ACC in supporting attentional circuitry and present novel opportunities to remediate attention deficits in children with epilepsy.

It is unclear, however, whether the STN oscillations are related to cortical activity in a bottom-up manner. To assess resting-state subcortico-cortical interactions, we recorded simultaneous scalp electroencephalographic activity and local field potentials in the STN (LFP-STN) in 11 patients with Parkinson's disease implanted with deep brain stimulation electrodes in the on-medication state during rest. We assessed the cross-structural phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between the STN and cortical activity within a wide frequency range of 1 to 100 Hz. The PAC was dominant between the delta/theta STN phase and beta/gamma cortical amplitude in most investigated scalp regions and between the delta cortical phase and theta/alpha STN amplitude in the frontal and temporal regions. The cross-frequency linkage between the slow oscillations of the LFP-STN activity and the amplitude of the scalp-recorded cortical activity at rest was demonstrated, and similar involvement of the left and right STNs in the coupling was observed. Our results suggest that the STN plays a role in both bottom-up and top-down processes within the subcortico-cortical circuitries of the human brain during the resting state. A relative left-right symmetry in the STN-cortex functional linkage was suggested. Practical treatment studies would be necessary to assess whether unilateral stimulation of the STN might be sufficient for treatment of Parkinson's disease.

J	Magosso, E; Ricci, G; Ursino, M				Magosso, Elisa; Ricci, Giulia; Ursino, Mauro			Alpha and theta mechanisms operating in internal-external attention competition	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; Alpha and theta power; Mental math task; Visual distractors; Inhibition; Top-down and bottom-up influences; Granger Causality		Attention is the ability to prioritize a set of information at expense of others and can be internally-or externally-oriented. Alpha and theta oscillations have been extensively implicated in attention. However, it is unclear how these oscillations operate when sensory distractors are presented continuously during task-relevant internal processes, in close-to-real-life conditions. Here, EEG signals from healthy participants were obtained at rest and in three attentional conditions, characterized by the execution of a mental math task (internal attention), presentation of pictures on a monitor (external attention), and task execution under the distracting action of picture presentation (internal-external competition). Alpha and theta power were investigated at scalp level and at some cortical regions of interest (ROIs); moreover, functional directed connectivity was estimated via spectral Granger Causality. Results show that frontal midline theta was distinctive of mental task execution and was more prominent during competition compared to internal attention alone, possibly reflecting higher executive control; anterior cingulate cortex appeared as mainly involved and causally connected to distant (temporal/occipital) regions. Alpha power in visual ROIs strongly decreased in external attention alone, while it assumed values close to rest during competition, reflecting reduced visual engagement against distractors; connectivity results suggested that bidirectional alpha influences between frontal and visual regions could contribute to reduce visual interference in internal attention. This study can help to understand how our brain copes with internal-external attention competition, a condition intrinsic in the human sensory-cognitive interplay, and to elucidate the relationships between brain oscillations and attentional functions/dysfunctions in daily tasks.

Thus, this work employs a comprehensive DG-CA3 network model of the hippocampus so as to explore the neuronal correlation between glutamatergic synapse loss and abnormal firing rhythm associated with AD from the perspective of neurocomputation. The neuropathological condition of glutamatergic synapse loss caused by the reduction of Shank3 protein in AD patients is imitated by decreasing glutamatergic excitatory synapse strength between different neurons. By means of power spectral analysis and dynamics technique, the numerical results reveal that excitability of pyramidal neuron as well as oriens lacunosum-moleculare (O-LM) cell in CA3 region is strongly degraded by the decrease of NMDA or AMPA-type glutamatergic excitatory synapse strength. Moreover, the relative power together with the peak of relative power density within alpha band is also diminished by decreasing glutamatergic synapse strength. These findings accord with the electrophysiological experiment of EEG that there is a decrease of alpha rhythm for AD patients, on the same time, they could highlight the significance of glutamatergic synapse loss in the pathogenesis of AD.

Here, we focused on pre-stimulus neural activity during sentence reading to examine text type-dependent attentional bias in anticipation of written stimuli, capitalizing on the functional relevance of brain oscillations in the alpha (8-12 Hz) frequency range. Two sex- and age-matched groups of participants (n = 24 each) read identical sentences on a screen at a fixed perconstituent presentation rate while their electroencephalogram was recorded; the groups were differentially instructed to read "sentences" (genre-neutral condition) or "verses from poems" (poetry condition). Relative alpha power (pre-cue vs. post-cue) in pre-stimulus time windows was greater in the poetry condition than in the genre-neutral condition. This finding constitutes initial evidence for genre-specific cognitive adjustments that precede processing proper, and potentially links current theories of discourse comprehension to current theories of brain function.

Commonly, it is assumed that both are reflected similarly in evoked brain potentials, that is, larger amplitudes are associated with a stronger percept of a stimulus. We tested this assumption in a somatosensory discrimination task in humans, simultaneously assessing (i) single-trial excitatory post-synaptic currents inferred from short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), (ii) pre-stimulus alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz), and (iii) peripheral nerve measures. Fluctuations of neural excitability shaped the perceived stimulus intensity already during the very first cortical response (at similar to 20 ms) yet demonstrating opposite neural signatures as compared to the effect of presented stimulus intensity. We reconcile this discrepancy via a common framework based on the modulation of electro-chemical membrane gradients linking neural states and responses, which calls for reconsidering conventional interpretations of brain potential magnitudes in stimulus intensity encoding.

Dynamic Electrode-to-Image (DETI) mapping reveals the human brain's spatiotemporal code of visual information	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							SPATIAL-FREQUENCY SELECTIVITY; EVOKED POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; OBJECT RECOGNITION; NATURAL IMAGES; ORIENTATION; CELLS; ORGANIZATION; SUPPRESSION; INHIBITION	A number of neuroimaging techniques have been employed to understand how visual information is transformed along the visual pathway. Although each technique has spatial and temporal limitations, they can each provide important insights into the visual code. While the BOLD signal of fMRI can be quite informative, the visual code is not static and this can be obscured by fMRI's poor temporal resolution. In this study, we leveraged the high temporal resolution of EEG to develop an encoding technique based on the distribution of responses generated by a population of real-world scenes. This approach maps neural signals to each pixel within a given image and reveals location-specific transformations of the visual code, providing a spatiotemporal signature for the image at each electrode. Our analyses of the mapping results revealed that scenes undergo a series of nonuniform transformations that prioritize different spatial frequencies at different regions of scenes over time. This mapping technique offers a potential avenue for future studies to explore how dynamic feedforward and recurrent processes inform and refine high-level representations of our visual world.

Within an EEG-adapted inattentional blindness task, the current study sought to examine whether this relationship holds for conscious awareness of stimuli under conditions of inattentional blindness. Noticing rates of the task-irrelevant unexpected stimulus were correlated with a significant decrease in alpha power over bilateral parietal-occipital areas during the pre-stimulus interval, and a significant decrease in alpha power over parietal-occipital regions in the right hemisphere during the post-stimulus interval. Findings are taken to imply alpha-band neural activity represents a valid correlate of consciousness that is not confounded by task relevancy or the need for report.

Optimal temporal integration between the senses is mediated by oscillatory properties of neural activity. Previous research showed reduced temporal sensitivity to multisensory events in schizotypy, a personality trait linked to schizophrenia. Here we used the tactileinduced Double-Flash-Illusion (tDFI) to investigate the tactile-to-visual temporal sensitivity in schizotypy, as indexed by the temporal window of illusion (TWI) and its neural underpinnings. We measured EEG oscillations within the beta band, recently shown to correlate with the tDFI. We found individuals with higher schizotypal traits to have wider TWI and slower beta waves accounting for the temporal window within which they perceive the illusion. Our results indicate reduced tactile-to-visual temporal sensitivity to mediate the effect of slowed oscillatory beta activity on schizotypal personality traits. We conclude that slowed oscillatory patterns might constitute an early marker for psychosis proneness.

We present RoLDSIS (regression on low-dimension spanned input space), a regression technique based on dimensionality reduction that constrains the solution to the subspace spanned by the available observations. This avoids regularization parameters in the regression procedure, as needed in shrinkage regression methods. Results We applied RoLDSIS to the EEG data collected in a phonemic identification experiment. In the experiment, morphed syllables in the continuum /da/-/ta/ were presented as acoustic stimuli to the participants and the event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded and then represented as a set of features in the time-frequency domain via the discrete wavelet transform. Each set of stimuli was chosen from a preliminary identification task executed by the participant. Physical and psychophysical attributes were associated to each stimulus. RoLDSIS was then used to infer the neurophysiological axes, in the feature space, associated with each attribute. We show that these axes can be reliably estimated and that their separation is correlated with the individual strength of phonemic categorization. The results provided by RoLDSIS are interpretable in the time-frequency domain and may be used to infer the neurophysiological correlates of phonemic categorization. A comparison with commonly used regularized regression techniques was carried out by cross-validation. Conclusion The prediction errors obtained by RoLDSIS are comparable to those obtained with Ridge Regression and smaller than those obtained with LASSO and SPLS. However, RoLDSIS achieves this without the need for cross-validation, a procedure that requires the extraction of a large amount of observations from the data and, consequently, a decreased signal-to-noise ratio when averaging trials. We show that, even though RoLDSIS is a simple technique, it is suitable for the processing and interpretation of neurophysiological signals.

A guideline for linking brain wave findings to the various aspects of discrete perception	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain rhythms; consciousness; discrete perception; EEG; temporal structure	ILLUSORY MOTION REVERSAL; STATE TRANSITIONS; WHEEL ILLUSION; TIME; OSCILLATIONS; PHASE; CONSCIOUSNESS; SIMULTANEITY; POWER; EEG	Brain waves, determined by electrical and magnetic brain recordings (e.g., EEG and MEG), and fluctuating behavioral responses, determined by response time or accuracy measures, are frequently taken to support discrete perception. For example, it has been proposed that humans experience only one conscious percept per brain wave (e.g., during one alpha cycle). However, the proposed link between brain waves and discrete perception is typically rather vague. More importantly, there are many models and aspects of discrete perception and it is often not apparent in what theoretical framework brain wave findings are interpreted and to what specific aspects of discrete perception they relate. Here, we review different approaches to discrete perception and highlight issues with particular interpretations. We then discuss how certain findings on brain waves may relate to certain aspects of discrete perception. The main purpose of this meta-contribution is to give a short overview of discrete models of perception and to illustrate the need to make explicit what aspects of discrete theories are addressed by what aspects of brain wave findings.

A Comparison of Closed Loop vs. Fixed Frequency tACS on Modulating Brain Oscillations and Visual Detection	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						transcranial alternating current stimulation; alpha; EEG; closed loop; visual perception	ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; MOTOR SYSTEM; MEMORY; THETA	Transcranial alternating current stimulation has emerged as an effective tool for the exploration of brain oscillations. By applying a weak alternating current between electrodes placed on the scalp matched to the endogenous frequency, tACS enables the specific modulation of targeted brain oscillations This results in alterations in cognitive functions or persistent physiological changes. Most studies that utilize tACS determine a fixed stimulation frequency prior to the stimulation that is kept constant throughout the experiment. Yet it is known that brain rhythms can encounter shifts in their endogenous frequency. This could potentially move the ongoing brain oscillations into a frequency region where it is no longer affected by the stimulation, thereby decreasing or negating the effect of tACS. Such an effect of a mismatch between stimulation frequency and endogenous frequency on the outcome of stimulation has been shown before for the parietal alpha-activity. In this study, we employed an intermittent closed loop stimulation protocol, where the stimulation is divided into short epochs, between which an EEG is recorded and rapidly analyzed to determine a new stimulation frequency for the next stimulation epoch. This stimulation protocol was tested in a three-group study against a classical fixed stimulation protocol and a sham-treatment. We targeted the parietal alpha rhythm and hypothesized that this setup will ensure a constant close match between the frequencies of tACS and alpha activity. This closer match should lead to an increased modulation of detection of visual luminance changes depending on the phase of the tACS and an increased rise in alpha peak power post stimulation when compared to a protocol with fixed pre-determined stimulation frequency. Contrary to our hypothesis, our results show that only a fixed stimulation protocol leads to a persistent increase in post-stimulation alpha power as compared to sham. Furthermore, in none of the stimulated groups significant modulation of detection performance occurred. While the lack of behavioral effects is inconclusive due to the short selection of different phase bins and trials, the physiological results suggest that a constant stimulation with a fixed frequency is actually beneficial, when the goal is to produce persistent synaptic changes.

Common practice is to reconstruct these networks separately for different frequency bands and to treat them independently. Recent evidence suggests that this separation may be inadequate, as there can be significant coupling between frequency bands (interlayer connectivity). A multilayer network approach offers a solution to analyze frequency-specific networks in one framework. We propose to use a recently developed network reconstruction method in conjunction with phase oscillator models to estimate interlayer connectivity that optimally fits the empirical data. This approach determines interlayer connectivity based on observed frequency-specific time series of the phase and a connectome derived from diffusion weighted imaging. The performance of this interlayer reconstruction method was evaluated in-silico. Our reconstruction of the underlying interlayer connectivity agreed to very high degree with the ground truth. Subsequently, we applied our method to empirical resting-state MEG data obtained from healthy subjects and reconstructed two-layered networks consisting of either alpha-to-beta or theta-to-gamma band connectivity. Our analysis revealed that interlayer connectivity is dominated by a multiplex structure, i.e. by one-to-one interactions for both alpha-to-beta band and theta-to-gamma band networks. For theta-gamma band networks, we also found a plenitude of interlayer connections between distant nodes, though weaker connectivity relative to the one-to-one connections. Our work is an stepping stone towards the identification of interdependencies across frequency-specific networks. Our results lay the ground for the use of the promising multilayer framework in this field with more-informed and justified interlayer connections.				prejaas.tewarie@nottingham.ac.uk		Byrne, Aine/0000-0002-8424-8710; Prasse, Bastian/0000-0002-7935-9109; Daffertshofer, Andreas/0000-0001-9107-3552	Medical Research Council [MR/M006301/1, MR/K005464/1]	Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission)	This work was funded by a Medical Research Council New Investigator Research Grant (MR/M006301/1) awarded to MJB.

Looking more closely at compact EEGs, algorithms have been implemented in such devices that can measure the attention and other affective states of the user. No information about these algorithms is available; are these feature classification algorithms accurate? An experiment was conducted with 23 subjects who utilized a pedagogical agent to learn the syntax of the programming language Java while having their attention measured by the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2. Using a concurrent validity approach, the attention values measured were compared to band powers, as well as measures of task performance. The results of the experiment were in part successful and supportive of the claim that the EEG device's attention algorithm does in fact represent a user's attention accurately. The results of the analysis based on raw data captured from the device were consistent with previous literature. Inconclusive results were obtained relating to task performance and attention.

We hypothesize that the interictal high frequency 'background' data, which has received little attention but represents the majority of the EEG record, also may contain additional, novel information for identifying the EZ. We analysed intracranial EEG (30-500Hz frequency range) acquired from 24 patients who underwent resective surgery. We computed 38 quantitative features based on all usable, interictal data (63-307h per subject), excluding all detected HFOs. We assessed association between each feature and the seizure onset zone (SOZ) and resected volume (RV) using logistic regression. A pathology score per channel was also created via principle component analysis and logistic regression, using hold-out-one-patient cross-validation to avoid in-sample training. Association of the pathology score with the SOZ and RV was quantified using an asymmetry measure. Many features were associated with the SOZ: 23/38 features had odds ratios >1.3 or <0.7 and 17/38 had odds ratios different than zero with high significance (P < 0.001/39, logistic regression with Bonferroni Correction). The pathology score, the rate of HFOs, and their channel-wise product were each strongly associated with the SOZ [median asymmetry >= 0.44, good surgery outcome patients; median asymmetry >= 0.40, patients with other outcomes; 95% confidence interval (CI) > 0.27 in both cases]. The pathology score and the channel-wise product also had higher asymmetry with respect to the SOZ than the HFO rate alone (median difference in asymmetry >= 0.18, 95% CI >0.05). These results support that the high frequency background data contains useful information for determining the EZ, distinct and complementary to information from detected HFOs. The concordance between the high frequency activity pathology score and the rate of HFOs appears to be a better biomarker of epileptic tissue than either measure alone.

Critical and Ictal Phases in Simulated EEG Signals on a Small-World Network	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						epilepsy; epileptic seizures; epileptogensis; small-world networks; simulation-computers; neuron; criticality; phase transition	EPILEPSY	Healthy brain function is marked by neuronal network dynamics at or near the critical phase, which separates regimes of instability and stasis. A failure to remain at this critical point can lead to neurological disorders such as epilepsy, which is associated with pathological synchronization of neuronal oscillations. Using full Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) simulations on a Small-World Network, we are able to generate synthetic electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with intervals corresponding to seizure (ictal) or non-seizure (interictal) states that can occur based on the hyperexcitability of the artificial neurons and the strength and topology of the synaptic connections between them. These interictal simulations can be further classified into scale-free critical phases and disjoint subcritical exponential phases. By changing the HH parameters, we can model seizures due to a variety of causes, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), congenital channelopathies, and idiopathic etiologies, as well as the effects of anticonvulsant drugs. The results of this work may be used to help identify parameters from actual patient EEG or electrocorticographic (ECoG) data associated with ictogenesis, as well as generating simulated data for training machine-learning seizure prediction algorithms.

Nonstationary of EEG data and long BCIs' calibration time are main problems that affect the practicability of MIBCI. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, i.e. spatio-time-frequency joint sparse optimization algorithm with transfer learning (STFSTL) to achieve satisfactory classification accuracy with small training set. By introducing artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), the algorithm optimized parameters in spatial domain, time domain and frequency domain simultaneously. The similarity between data was measured by Euclidean distance. Through instanced-based transfer learning, the source data which was most similar to the target data was selected as the auxiliary data to train the target classifier. We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm on three data sets, including a private data set and two public data sets. The classification accuracy of the proposed algorithm with one fifth of the training data was higher than that of five other algorithms. Paired t-test analysis revealed that the accuracy of STFSTL and that of five other algorithms were significantly different. The experimental results suggested that the proposed algorithm with less target data can effectively achieve higher classification accuracy than traditional algorithms. It's likely to have a broad application prospect in MI-BCI.

This reactivation is orchestrated by the interplay of sleep slow oscillations, spindles, and theta, which are in turn modulated by certain neurotransmitters like GABA to enable long-lasting plastic changes in the memory store. Here we asked whether the GABAergic system and associated changes in sleep oscillations are functionally related to memory reactivation during sleep. We administered the GABA(A) agonist zolpidem (10 mg) in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. To specifically focus on the effects on memory reactivation during sleep, we experimentally induced such reactivations by targeted memory reactivation (TMR) with learning-associated reminder cues presented during post-learning slow-wave sleep (SWS). Zolpidem significantly enhanced memory performance with TMR during sleep compared with placebo. Zolpidem also increased the coupling of fast spindles and theta to slow oscillations, although overall the power of slow spindles and theta was reduced compared with placebo. In an uncorrected exploratory analysis, memory performance was associated with slow spindle responses to TMR in the zolpidem condition, whereas it was associated with fast spindle responses in placebo. These findings provide tentative first evidence that GABAergic activity may be functionally implicated in memory reactivation processes during sleep, possibly via its effects on slow oscillations, spindles and theta as well as their interplay.

EEG was recorded as healthy adults encoded either a sequence of one (low load) or four (high load) dot locations on a grid and rehearsed them until a free recall response was collected later in the trial. During the rehearsal period of the WM task, participants observed videos of a speaker describing objects in which half of the trials included semantically related co-speech gestures (congruent), and the other half included semantically unrelated gestures (incongruent). Discourse processing was indexed by oscillatory EEG activity in the alpha and beta bands during the videos. Across all participants, effects of speech and gesture incongruity were more evident in low load trials than in high load trials. Effects were also modulated by individual differences in visuospatial WM capacity. These data suggest visuospatial WM resources are recruited in the comprehension of multimodal discourse.

The study involved 43 volunteers (26 women) aged from 18 to 34 years, the individual characteristics of emotion regulation strategies were measured by using the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (J. Gross), and the total electrical activity of the brain (EEG) during presentation negative, positive and neutral sentences was analyzed. In order to distract attention from the emotional content of sentences, subjects were given a task to search for a syntax mistake. The search for a syntax mistake had to be performed as quickly as possible, while the presence of the emotional content in the sentence was not emphasized. We revealed that Cognitive reappraisal positively correlated with theta rhythm in interval from 100 ms to 300 ms during the presentation of negative sentences which did not contain a syntax mistake. Also, Suppression of emotions positively correlated with the beta rhythm in the range from 100 ms to 1300 ms during the presentation of positive sentences with a syntax mistake.

This study critically examined this account by recording intracranial EEG from an array of depth electrodes within ATL, IPL, and two regions within the semantic control network, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), while 17 participants with refractory epilepsy completed a semantic relatedness judgment task. We observed a significant difference between relation types in ATL and IPL approximately 600-800 ms after trial presentation, and no significant differences in IFG or pMTG. Within this time window, alpha and theta suppression indexing cognitive effort and memory retrieval was observed in ATL for taxonomic trials and in IPL for thematic trials. These results suggest taxonomic specialization in ATL and thematic specialization in IPL, consistent with the dual-hub account of semantic cognition. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Temporal integration on the neuronal level can be measured by the brain's intrinsic neural timescale using the auto-correlation window (ACW) and power-law exponent (PLE). Our goal was to relate intrinsic neural time-scales (ACW, PLE), as a proxy of temporal integration on the neuronal level, to temporal integration related to self-disorder on psychological (Enfacement illusion task in electroencephalography) and phenomenological (Examination of Anomalous Self-Experience [EASE]) levels. SCZ participants exhibited prolonged ACW and higher PLE during the self-referential task (Enfacement illusion), but not during the non-self-referential task (auditory oddball). The degree of ACW/ PLE change during task relative to rest was significantly reduced in self-referential task in SCZ. A moderation model showed that low and high ACW/PLE exerted differential impact on the relationship of self- disorder (EASE) and negative symptoms (PANSS). In sum, we demonstrate abnormal prolongation in intrinsic neural time-scale during self-reference in SCZ including its relation to basic self-disorder and negative symptoms. Our results point to abnormal relation of self and temporal integration at the core of SCZ constituting a "common currency" of neuronal, psychological, and phenomenological levels.

How the brain negotiates divergent executive processing demands: Evidence of network reorganization in fleeting brain states	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Network dynamics; Hidden Markov Modeling; Performance; Stress; Evaluative threat	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EMOTION; MECHANISMS; STRESS; OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY; THETA; MEG; INTEGRATION	During performance in everyday contexts, multiple networks draw from shared executive resources to maintain attention, regulate arousal, and solve problems. At times, requirements for attention and self-regulation appear to be in competition. How does the brain attempt to resolve conflicts arising from such divergent processing demands? Here we demonstrate that the brain is capable of managing multiple processes via rapidly cycling between functional brain states over time, as it is typically regarded. Treating the brain as a complex system, comprising relationships within and between functional networks, we implemented Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM) on electroencephalographic (EEG) data to identify nonlinear brain states in both intra and internetwork synchrony that produced better performance for women subjects who were tasked with solving difficult problems under autobiographically-relevant, evaluative stress. Prior work often found that emotion-regulation and default mode network (ERN and DMN) activity conflicted with the frontoparietal network's (FPN) ability to facilitate executive functioning necessary for problem solving. Contrastingly, we discovered that fleeting, nonlinear states dominated by FPN and ERN internetwork synchrony supported optimum performance generally, while during stress, states dominated by ERN and DMN intranetwork synchrony were more important for performance. These results imply that the brain may be capable of resolving competing processes through networks' cooperative dynamics. Further, data suggests a novel role for DMN as a mechanism for integrating external threats with internal, self-referent processing during evaluative stress within the observed population.

We analyzed intracerebral electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings from externalized DBS electrodes targeted bilaterally in the anterior nuclei of the thalamus (ANT) in 12 patients (six responders, six nonresponders) with more than 1 year of follow-up care. In the bipolar local field potentials of the EEG, spectral power (PW) and power spectral entropy (PSE) were calculated in the passbands 1-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-20, 20-45, 65-80, 80-200 and 200-500 Hz. The most significant differences between responders and nonresponders were observed in the BRIDGE area (bipolar recordings with one contact within the ANT and the second contact in adjacent tissue). In responders, PW was significantly decreased in the frequency bands of 65-80, 80-200, and 200-500 Hz (p < .05); PSE was significantly increased in all frequency bands (p < .05) except for 200-500 Hz (p = .06). The local EEG characteristics of ANT recorded after implantation may play a significant role in DBS response prediction.

It is unclear how the brain dynamics change in adult moyamoya disease (MMD). We used BOLD-fMRI for LRTC analysis from 16 hemorrhagic (HMMD) and 34 ischemic (IMMD) patients and 25 healthy controls. Afterwards, they were examined by EEG recordings in the eyes-closed (EC), eyes-open (EO), and working memory (WM) states. The EEG data of 11 HMMD and 13 IMMD patients and 21 healthy controls were in good quality for analysis. Regarding the 4 metrics of neural avalanches (e.g., size (alpha), duration (beta), kappa value, and branching parameter (sigma)), both MMD subtypes exhibited subcritical states in the EC state. When switching to the WM state, HMMD remained inactive, while IMMD surpassed controls and became supercritical (p<0.05). Regarding LRTC, the amplitude envelope in the EC state was more analogous to random noise in the MMD patients than in controls. During state transitions, LRTC decreased sharply in the controls but remained chaotic in the MMD individuals (p<0.05). The spatial LRTC reduction distribution based on both EEG and fMRI in the EC state implied that, compared with controls, the two MMD subtypes might exhibit mutually independent but partially overlapping patterns. The regions showing decreased LRTC in both EEG and fMRI were the left supplemental motor area of HMMD and right pre-/postcentral gyrus and right inferior temporal gyrus of IMMD. This study not only sheds light on the decayed critical dynamics of MMD in both the resting and task states for the first time but also proposes several EEG and fMRI features to identify its two subtypes.

Psychological and Electrophysiological Correlates of Word Learning Success	PSYCHOLOGY IN RUSSIA-STATE OF THE ART			English	Article						word learning; semantics; EEG; alpha oscillations; ERP; ambiguity tolerance; BIS/BAS scales	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; BEHAVIORAL ACTIVATION; LEXICAL CONSOLIDATION; AMBIGUITY TOLERANCE; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SCALING BEHAVIOR; VOCABULARY; ATTENTION; MEMORY	Background. A rich vocabulary supports human achievements in socio-economic activities, education, and communication. It is therefore important to clarify the nature of language acquisition as a complex multidimensional process. However, both the psychological and neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning language learning, as well as the links between them, are still poorly understood. Objective. This study aims to explore the psychological and neurophysiological correlates of successful word acquisition in a person's native language. Design. Thirty adults read sentences with novel nouns, following which the participants' electroencephalograms were recorded during a word-reading task. Event-related potentials in response to novel words and alpha oscillation parameters (amplitude, variability, and long-range temporal correlation dynamics) were analyzed. Learning outcomes were assessed at the lexical and semantic levels. Psychological variables measured using Amthauer's test (verbal abilities), BIS/BAS scales (motivation), and the MSTAT-1 (ambiguity tolerance) and alpha oscillation parameters were factored. Results. Better recognition of novel words was related to two factors which had high factor loadings for all measured alpha oscillation parameters, indicating the role of attention networks and respective neural activity for enabling information processing. More successful learners had lower P200 amplitude, which also suggests higher attention-system involvement. Another factor predicted better acquisition of word meanings for less ambiguity-tolerant students, while the factor which pooled logical conceptual thinking ability and persistence in goal-reaching, positively correlated with acquisition of both word forms and meanings. Conclusion. The psychological factors predominantly correlated with word-learning success in semantic tasks, while neurophysiological variables were linked to performance in the recognition task.

We hypothesized that sharing a painful experience induces brain-to-brain synchronization and mutual empathy for each other's pain between pain-takers and pain-observers, which then leads to enhanced social bonding. To test this hypoth-esis, we adopted an electroencephalographic (EEG) hyper-scanning technique to assess neuronal and behavioral activity during a Pain-Sharing task in which high-or low-intensity pain stimulation was randomly delivered to one participant of a dyad on different experimental trials. Single-brain analysis showed that sensorimotor - oscillation power was suppressed more when expecting high-intensity pain than when expecting low-intensity pain similarly for self-directed or partner-directed pain. Dual-brain analysis revealed that expecting high-intensity pain induced greater brain-to-brain synchronization of sensorimotor-oscillation phases between pain-takers and pain-observers than did expecting low-intensity pain. Mediation analysis further revealed that brain-to-brain syn-chronization of sensorimotor-oscillations mediated the effects of pain-stimulation intensity on mutual affective sharing for partner-directed pain. This mutual affective empathy during the task predicted the social bonding, as indexed by prosocial inclinations measured after the task. These results support the hypothesis that sharing a painful experience triggers emotional resonance between pairs of individuals through brain-to-brain synchro-nization of neuronal -oscillations recorded over the sensorimotor cortex, and this emotional resonance further strengthens social bonds and motivates prosocial behavior within pairs of individuals.

Sensory Features and Bi-directional EEG Connectivity in Young Autistic Males	JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL AND PHYSICAL DISABILITIES			English	Article						Brain connectivity; Granger Causality; Autism; Sensory features; Behaviour; Sensory profile	DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; PROCESSING ABNORMALITIES; CHILDHOOD AUTISM; CHILDREN; COHERENCE; OSCILLATIONS; INTEGRATION; POTENTIALS; NETWORK	Several lines of research suggest that autism is a neurological phenomenon, but the precise associations between neurological activity and the key diagnostic symptoms of autism are yet to be completely clarified. This study examined EEG connectivity and Sensory Features (SF) in a sample of young autistic males by examining bi-directional neural connectivity between separate brain regions as the key potential correlate of SF. Forty male autistic participants aged between 6 and 17 years, with an IQ of at least 70, underwent EEG measurements of their Frontal, Occipital and Temporal region responses to low-, medium-, and high-intensity audiovisual stimulus conditions. EEG connectivity data were analysed via Granger Causality. SF was measured via parent responses about their sons on the Child Sensory Profile (2(nd) ed.) (CSP-2). There were significant (p < .05) correlations between right hemisphere Frontal and Temporal connectivity and CSP-2 dominant scores, largely due to lower Temporal-to-Frontal than Frontal-to-Temporal connectivity. There were no significant correlations between general CSP-2 scores and EEG connectivity data collected during audiovisual stimuli. These results confirm and extend previous findings by adding bi-directional connectivity as an index of brain activity to other studies that used only uni-directional connectivity data when measuring SF. Although there may be a discrepancy between the kinds of information collected via instruments such as the CSP-2 and actual brain electrical connectivity across major regions, these results hold implications for the use of brain-training interventions with autistic boys.

However, dance activities differ not only in their movement styles and repertoires but also in their methods and cognitive processes. The present study examines how practicing contact improvisation-a form of dance in which small groups use physical contact and transferred weight to fluently and jointly move together without choreography-predicts this effect independent of other kinds of dance practice. In line with recent work on EEG correlates of creative cognition. we also examine changes in alpha power while contact improvising compared with performing a set choreography. EEG was recorded while participants (N = 18) with a range of types and amounts of weekly dance practice completed an action observation/ imitation task, and performed a set choreography and contact improvisation with the experimenter using their right arm. Supporting previous findings from the literature, the amount of practice of choreographed dance trended toward predicting greater MRD while observing actions compared with a rest condition; in addition, the amount of practice of contact improvisation significantly predicted this and with a larger effect size. We also report evidence of differences in posterior alpha between choreographed and improvisation performances, suggesting participants overall engaged more visual imagery while improvising compared with performing the choreography. We explain why these findings bear on the ability to improvise and discuss their meaning within the context of work on the neural correlates of creativity.

A systematic review and perspective	NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS			English	Review						Spontaneous gamma-band activity; Resting-state; EEG; MEG-recordings; Schizophrenia; Ketamine; MK-801; PCP; E; I imbalance	RECEPTOR HYPOFUNCTION MODEL; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PARVALBUMIN INTERNEURONS; KETAMINE; CONNECTIVITY; POWER; GLUTAMATE; ABERRANT; NETWORK	NMDA-R hypofunctioninig is a core pathophysiological mechanism in schizophrenia. However, it is unclear whether the physiological changes observed following NMDA-R antagonist administration are consistent with gamma-band alterations in schizophrenia. This systematic review examined the effects of NMDA-R antagonists on the amplitude of spontaneous gamma-band activity and functional connectivity obtained from preclinical (n = 24) and human (n = 9) studies and compared these data to resting-state EEG/MEG-measurements in schizophrenia patients (n = 27). Overall, the majority of preclinical and human studies observed increased gamma-band power following acute administration of NMDA-R antagonists. However, the direction of gamma-band power alterations in schizophrenia were inconsistent, which involved upregulation (n = 10), decreases (n = 7), and no changes (n = 8) in spectral power. Five out of 6 preclinical studies observed increased connectivit y , while in healthy controls receiving Ketamine and in schizophrenia patients the direction of connectivity results was also inconsistent. Accordingly, the effects of NMDA-R hypofunctioning on gamma-band oscillations are different than pathophysiological signatures observed in schizophrenia. The implications of these findings for current E/I balance models of schizophrenia are discussed.

Animal research indicates that slow waves may involve complex interactions within and between cortical and subcortical structures. Conventional EEG in humans, however, has a low spatial resolution and is unable to accurately describe changes in the activity of subcortical and deep cortical structures. To overcome these limitations, here we took advantage of simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings to map cortical and subcortical hemodynamic (BOLD) fluctuations time-locked to slow waves of light sleep. Recordings were performed in twenty healthy adults during an afternoon nap. Slow waves were associated with BOLD-signal increases in the posterior brainstem and in portions of thalamus and cerebellum characterized by preferential functional connectivity with limbic and somatomotor areas, respectively. At the cortical level, significant BOLD-signal decreases were instead found in several areas, including insula and somatomotor cortex. Specifically, a slow signal increase preceded slow-wave onset and was followed by a delayed, stronger signal decrease. Similar hemodynamic changes were found to occur at different delays across most cortical brain areas, mirroring the propagation of electrophysiological slow waves, from centro-frontal to inferior temporo-occipital cortices. Finally, we found that the amplitude of electrophysiological slow waves was positively related to the magnitude and inversely related to the delay of cortical and subcortical BOLD-signal changes.

Albeit both sleep and memory alterations have been observed in Developmental Dyslexia (DD), their relation in this population has been scarcely investigated, particularly concerning topographical aspects. The study aimed to compare sleep topography and associated sleep-related declarative memory consolidation in participants with DD and normal readers (NR). Eleven participants with DD and 18 NR (9-14 years old) underwent a whole-night polysomnography. They were administered a word pair task before and after sleep to assess for declarative memory consolidation. Memory performance and sleep features (macro and microstructural) were compared between the groups, and the intercorrelations between consolidation rate and sleep measures were assessed. DD showed a deeper worsening in memory after sleep compared to NR and reduced slow spindles in occipito-parietal and left fronto-central areas. Our results suggest specific alterations in local sleep EEG (i.e., sleep spindles) and in sleep-dependent memory consolidation processes in DD. We highlight the importance of a topographical approach, which might shed light on potential alteration in regional cortical oscillation dynamics in DD. The latter might represent a target for therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing cognitive functioning in DD.

A better mechanistic understanding and new treatment approaches are urgently needed. In the brain, pain has been associated with neural oscillations at alpha and gamma frequencies, which can be targeted using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). Thus, we investigated the potential of tACS to modulate pain and pain-related autonomic activity in an experimental model of chronic pain in 29 healthy participants. In 6 recording sessions, participants completed a tonic heat pain paradigm and simultaneously received tACS over prefrontal or somatosensory cortices at alpha or gamma frequencies or sham tACS. Concurrently, pain ratings and autonomic responses were collected. Using the present setup, tACS did not modulate pain or autonomic responses. Bayesian statistics confirmed a lack of tACS effects in most conditions. The only exception was alpha tACS over somatosensory cortex where evidence was inconclusive. Taken together, we did not find significant tACS effects on tonic experimental pain in healthy humans. Based on our present and previous findings, further studies might apply refined stimulation protocols targeting somatosensory alpha oscillations. Perspective: Modulating brain oscillations is a promising approach for the treatment of pain. We therefore applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to modulate experimental pain in healthy participants. However, tACS did not modulate pain, autonomic responses, or EEG oscillations. These findings help to shape future tACS studies for the treatment of pain. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

This phenomenon is known as "subliminal perception." Such capacity is often assumed to be relatively automatic in nature and rely on stimulus-driven activity in low-level cortical areas. Instead, here we asked to what extent neural activity before stimulus presentation influences subliminal perception. We asked participants to discriminate the location of a briefly presented low-contrast visual stimulus and then rate how well they saw the stimulus. Consistent with previous studies, participants correctly discriminated with slightly above chance-level accuracy the location of a stimulus they reported not seeing. Signal detection analyses indicated that while subjects categorized their percepts as "unconscious," their capacity to discriminate these stimuli lay on the same continuum as conscious vision. We show that the accuracy of discriminating the location of a subliminal stimulus could be predicted with relatively high accuracy (AUC = 0.70) based on lateralized electroencephalographic (EEG) activity before the stimulus, the hemifield where the stimulus was presented, and the accuracy of previous trial's discrimination response. Altogether, our results suggest that rather than being a separate unconscious capacity, subliminal perception is based on similar processes as conscious vision.

Oscillatory Correlates of Intentional Forgetting: The Role of Theta and Alpha Power in Item-Method Directed Forgetting	ENEURO			English	Article						alpha power; directed forgetting; EEG oscillations; recognition memory; theta power	BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; BAND POWER; EEG; INHIBITION; REHEARSAL; FMRI; MECHANISMS; WITHDRAWAL; DYNAMICS	Results from item-method directed forgetting suggest that individuals are able to intentionally forget processed information. Most research suggests that either selective rehearsal of to-be-remembered or inhibitory control of to-be-forgotten information is accountable for the effects of intentional forgetting. Some research, however, hypothesized that the time to process information mediates the underlying mechanism. To test this hypothesis, the current study investigated associations between oscillatory power in theta (3-7.5 Hz) and alpha frequencies (8-13 Hz) and intentional forgetting in human participants and explored whether or not these mechanisms depended on processing time. Previously, theta power was shown to be associated with the creation of episodic memory traces and alpha power with inhibition. We therefore expected to find associations between these neural signatures and behavioral effects. Consistent with our hypotheses, we revealed increased theta power for to-be-remembered and increased alpha power for to-be-forgotten information and that the effects of activity in both frequency bands were influenced by the time individuals were given for processing the memory cue. These results suggest that not one but two mechanisms, rehearsal and inhibitory control, are accountable for item-method directed forgetting, both with different temporal profiles.

Candidate genes, such as POLG, PARS2, CARS2, FARS2, NARS2, and GABRB2 are distinguished and registered following research on large cohorts that portray the clinical phenotype in such patients using expanded access to whole-exome sequencing (WES). In this study, we aimed to better understand the electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics and clinical phenotype of different genotypes of the Alpers' syndrome, which are currently insufficiently studied. We conducted a study on seven patients with Alpers' syndrome who received treatment in Beijing Children's Hospital and had a detailed clinical EEG. Furthermore, a substantial literature search of the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, PubMed, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials EMBASE was also conducted, which revealed a total of 22 reported cases between January 2008 to January 2021. We analyzed 29 cases of Alpers' syndrome caused by different gene variants, of which 22 cases were related to POLG gene mutation and 7 cases were related to PARS2, CARS2, FARS2, NARS2, and GABRB2 gene mutation, and found that patients with distinctive pathogenic variants exhibited comparable phenotypes and similar EEG patterns. And we defined EEG characteristics found specifically in Alpers' syndrome. Rhythmic high-amplitude delta with superimposed (poly) spikes (RHADS) is a characteristic EEG finding in the early stages of Alpers' syndrome and is a kind of epileptic phenomenon, which can provide clues for the early diagnosis of the disease.

Ernst and Paulus proposed a three-stage temporal division of this process: 1) the assessment and formation of preferences among possible options; 2) the selection and execution of an action; and 3) the experience or evaluation of an outcome. Each stage involves the participation of several brain regions, including the prefrontal, parietal, and temporal cortices. There are reports of distinct functionalities of these cortices for each stage of decision-making, but those studies focus on individual stages and do not provide any direct comparisons among them. Therefore, using a task that allows the clear temporal separation of the three stages of decisionmaking, we characterized the electroencephalographic activity (EEG) of those cortices in 30 healthy righthanded men during preference changes that occurred while performing a decision-making task. As the trials progressed, the preference for the stimulus shifted towards maximizing gains on the task. Forty trials sufficed to maintain these behavioral changes. Specific EEG patterns for each stage of decision-making were obtained, and it was possible to associate them with the cognitive processes involved in each one. These EEG data support the temporal division of the decision-making process proposed by Ernest and Paulus and show that the task designed could be a useful tool for determining behavioral and cerebral changes associated with stimuli preference during decision-making.

Individuals with amnestic MCI are several-fold more likely to develop AD than the general population. Therefore, MCI comprises a well-detectable, early stage time-point for therapeutic intervention and strategic prevention. Based on common electroencephalographical (EEG) pattern changes seen in individuals with MCI, we postulated that EEG-based neurofeedback could help improve the memory performance of patients with MCI. Memory performance is of particular importance in these patients, since memory decline is the most prominent symptom in most patients with MCI, and is the most predictive symptom for cognitive deterioration and the development of AD. Methods: In order to improve the memory performance of patients with MCI we used a system of EEG-based neurofeedback in an attempt to reverse alterations of the EEG that are known to be common in patients with MCI. Our protocol comprised the provision of positive feedback in order to enhance the activity level of the upper alpha band. Participants were divided to two groups receiving either neurofeedback training to enhance the upper alpha frequency (Experimental group) or random feedbacks (Sham group) Results: We witnessed a significant improvement in memory performance in subjects in the experimental group compared to those in the sham group. This improvement was maintained for at least 1 month. Conclusions: Neurofeedback may be a promising and affordable novel approach for treating the decline in memory witnessed in patients with MCI.

In the proposed translational approach, we studied the connectivity between premotor (PMC) and primary motor cortex (M1) by recording high-density electroencephalography in humans and between caudal (CFA) and rostral forelimb (RFA) areas by recording multi-site extracellular activity in mice to obtain spectral power, functional and effective connectivity. We identified a significantly higher spectral power in beta- and gamma-bands in M1compared to PMC and similarly in mice CFA layers (L) 2/3 and 5 compared to RFA. We found a strong functional beta-band connectivity between PMC and M1 in humans and between CFA L6 and RFA L5 in mice. We observed that in both humans and mice the direction of information flow mediated by beta- and gamma-band oscillations was predominantly from PMC toward M1 and from RFA to CFA, respectively. Combining spectral power, functional and effective connectivity, we revealed clear similarities between human PMC-M1 connections and mice RFA-CFA network. We propose that reciprocal connectivity of mice RFA-CFA circuitry presents a suitable model for analysis of motor control and physiological PMC-M1 functioning or pathological transformations within this network.

Moreover, the spectral characteristics of cortical activity showed significant differences in different walking conditions. However, whether brain connectivity presents a significant difference during rats walking under different behavior conditions has yet to be verified. Similarly, whether brain connectivity can be used in locomotion detection remains unknown. To address those concerns, we recorded locomotion and implanted electroencephalography signals in freely moving rats performing two kinds of task conditions (upslope and downslope walking). The Granger causality method was used to determine brain functional directed connectivity in rats during these processes. Machine learning algorithms were then used to categorize the two walking states, based on functional directed connectivity. We found significant differences in brain functional directed connectivity varied between upslope and downslope walking. Moreover, locomotion detection based on brain connectivity achieved the highest accuracy (91.45%), sensitivity (90.93%), specificity (91.3%), and F1-score (91.43%). Specifically, the classification results indicated that connectivity features in the high gamma band contained the most discriminative information with respect to locomotion detection in rats, with the support vector machine classifier exhibiting the most efficient performance. Our study not only suggests that brain functional directed connectivity in rats showed significant differences in various behavioral contexts but also proposed a method for classifying the locomotion states of rat walking, based on brain functional directed connectivity. These findings elucidate the characteristics of neural information interaction between various cortical areas in freely walking rats.

Studies have suggested that low-frequency (LF) to high-frequency (HF) cross-frequency coupling (CFC) is a useful biomarker for localizing epileptogenic tissues. However, it remains unclear whether the LF or HF coordinated CFC network hubs are more critical in determining the treatment outcome. We hypothesize that HF hubs are primarily responsible for seizure dynamics. Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) recordings of 36 seizures from 16 intractable epilepsy patients were analyzed. We propose a new approach to model the temporal-spatial-spectral dynamics of CFC networks. Graph measures are then used to characterize the HF and LF hubs. In the patient group with Engel Class (EC) I outcome, the strength of HF hubs was significantly higher inside the resected regions during the early and middle stages of seizure, while such a significant difference was not observed in the EC III group and only for the early stage in the EC II group. For the LF hubs, a significant difference was identified at the late stage and only in the EC I group. Our findings suggest that HF hubs increase at early and middle stages of the ictal interval while LF hubs increase activity at the late stages. In addition, HF hubs can predict treatment outcomes more precisely, compared to the LF hubs of the CFC network. The proposed method promises to identify more accurate targets for surgical interventions or neuromodulation therapies.

Prior efforts resulted to fairly accurate but unstable models. This article investigates what ensemble method is most suitable for developing an ensemble trust classifier model for assessing users trust in technology with psychophysiological signals. Using a self-driving car game, a within subject four condition experiment was implemented. During which 31 participant were involved, and multimodal psychophysiological data (EEG, ECG, EDA, and Facial-EMG) were recorded. An exhaustive 172 features from time and frequency domain were extracted. Six carefully selected algorithms were combined for developing ensemble trust classifier models using each of the four ensemble methods (voting, bagging, stacking, boosting). The result indicated that the Stack ensemble method was more superior, despite voting method dominating prior studies.	[Ben.

A composite score combining each of these units of analysis correlated with self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms, with only theta-gamma coupling independently predicted anxiety/depressive symptoms. Results confirm prior findings on the association between WM and anxiety/depression, although the majority of this variance was explained by frontal theta-gamma coupling during WM demands.

The used network topology is a scale-free network with constant node degree. The dopamine-modulated type Izikhevich neuron model is used for modeling the striatal region, consisting of fast-spiking interneurons, D1 and D2 type dopamine expressing medium spiny neurons. On the other hand, the ordinary Izikhevich neuron model is used in the modeling of extrastriatal basal ganglia (BG) regions where globus pallidus (GP) subregion neurons have also dopamine-dependent parameters. The thalamic region of the network is mass modeled including inhibitory input from basal ganglia. Depending on the decrease of synaptic connections and dopamine level, the synchronization among basal ganglia neuron populations is investigated. The effect of synaptic delay on synchronization is also considered. It is observed that the decrease of dopamine neurotransmitter and decrease in the number of synaptic connections cause an increased synchronous activity in BG. Also, slowing in theta and alpha bands in thalamus EEG signals is observed. This shows the causal relation between synchronization and power shifting to lower frequency components in the case of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD).

In a first experiment, we setup an ecological paradigm measuring EEG on a musician in free improvised concerts with an audience, followed by retrospective rating of the mental state of the improviser. We introduce Subjective Temporal Resolution (STR), a retrospective rating assessing the instantaneous quantization of subjective timing of the improviser. We identified high and low STR states using Hidden Markov Models in two performances, and were able to decode those states using supervised learning on instantaneous EEG power spectrum, showing increases in theta and alpha power with high STR values. In a second experiment, we found an increase of theta and beta power when experimentally manipulating STR in a musical improvisation imagery experiment. These results are interpreted with respect to previous research on flow state in creativity, as well as with the temporal processing literature. We suggest that a component of the subjective state of musical improvisation may be reflected in an underlying mechanism related to the subjective quantization of time. We also demonstrate the feasibility of single case studies of musical improvisation using brain activity measurements and retrospective reports, by obtaining consistent results across multiple sessions.

However, there is so far little evidence of classical glutamatergic plasticity induced by this replay. Rather, we have previously reported that blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors does not affect sleep-dependent consolidation of declarative memory. Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in memory processing during sleep. Methods: In two placebo-controlled within-subject crossover experiments with 20 healthy humans each, we used fenobam to block mGluR5 during sleep. In Experiment I, participants learned word-pairs (declarative task) and a finger sequence (procedural task) in the evening, then received the drug and recall was tested the next morning. To cover possible effects on synaptic renormalization processes during sleep, in Experiment II participants learned new word-pairs in the morning after sleep. Results/outcomes: Surprisingly, fenobam neither reduced retention of memory across sleep nor new learning after sleep, although it severely altered sleep architecture and memory-relevant EEG oscillations. In NonREM sleep, fenobam suppressed 12-15 Hz spindles but augmented 2-4 Hz delta waves, whereas in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep it suppressed 4-8 Hz theta and 16-22 Hz beta waves. Notably, under fenobam NonREM spindles became more consistently phase-coupled to the slow oscillation. Conclusions/interpretations: Our findings indicate that mGluR5-related plasticity is not essential for memory processing during sleep, even though mGlurR5 are strongly implicated in the regulation of the cardinal sleep oscillations.

One news that was text-written with two different expression types (emotional expression vs. neutral expression) was adopted as an experiment material in the study, and changes in cortical activity during news reporting reading tasks were examined with electroencephalograms, sampled from nine sites and four channels and analyzed with weighted phase lag index (wPLI) based on brain functional connectivity (FC) method. The results show that emotional discourses caused a stronger cortical brain activity and more robust brain FC (beta oscillations); besides, reading emotionalized expression consumed more attention resources but fewer cognitive resources, which may impede further rational thinking of the audiences.

However, a prerequisite for any such biomarker is robust reliability, which for magnetoencephalography (MEG) and many other imaging modalities has not been established. In this study, we examined the reliability of visual (Experiment 1) and somatosensory gating (Experiment 2) responses in 19 healthy adults who repeated these experiments for three visits spaced 18 months apart. Visual oscillatory and somatosensory oscillatory and evoked responses were imaged, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were computed to examine the long-term reliability of these responses. In Experiment 1, ICCs showed good reliability for visual theta and alpha responses in occipital cortices, but poor reliability for gamma responses. In Experiment 2, the time series of somatosensory gamma and evoked responses in the contralateral somatosensory cortex showed good reliability. Finally, analyses of spontaneous baseline activity indicated excellent reliability for occipital alpha, moderate reliability for occipital theta, and poor reliability for visual/somatosensory gamma activity. Overall, MEG responses to visual and somatosensory stimuli show a high degree of reliability across 3 years and therefore may be stable indicators of sensory processing long term and thereby of potential interest as biomarkers of disease.

Whether the synchrony of intrinsic alpha rhythms in the occipital cortex can be entrained by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an open question. We applied 4-pulse, 10-Hz rhythmic TMS to entrain intrinsic alpha oscillators targeting right V1/V2, and tested four predictions with concurrent electroencephalogram (EEG): (1) progressive enhancement of entrainment across time windows, (2) output frequency specificity, (3) dependence on the intrinsic oscillation phase, and (4) input frequency specificity to individual alpha frequency (IAF) in the neural signatures. Two control conditions with an equal number of pulses and duration were arrhythmic-active and rhythmic-sham stimulation. The results confirmed the first three predictions. Rhythmic TMS bursts significantly entrained local neural activity. Near the stimulation site, evoked oscillation amplitude and intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) were increased for 2 and 3 cycles, respectively, after the last TMS pulse. Critically, ITPC following entrainment positively correlated with IAF rather than with the degree of similarity between IAF and the input frequency (10 Hz). Thus, we entrained alpha-band activity in occipital cortex for similar to 3 cycles (similar to 300 ms), and IAF predicts the strength of entrained occipital alpha phase synchrony indexed by ITPC.

The lack of a clear understanding of its underlying neurophysiological mechanism has resulted in limited effectiveness of the current treatment options. In this study, we investigated EEG features over (pre-)supplementary motor area and primary motor cortex during a simple cue-based ankle dorsiflexion movement. These features include movement-related cortical potentials (0.05-5 Hz) and brain oscillations (1-50 Hz). Electromyogram signal from the tibialis anterior muscle of the dominant foot was used to determine the movement onset. The EEG features before, during and following the onset of the movement were compared among three groups of participants: patients with freezing (N = 14, 11 males), patients without freezing (N = 14, 13 males) and healthy age-matched controls (N = 13, 10 males) with 15 recorded trials for each individual. Additionally, Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait were separated into mild (N = 7) and severe cases (N = 5), so that EEG features associated with freezing severity could be investigated. The results indicated significant differences between patients with severe freezing of gait compared to healthy controls and patients without freezing of gait. In addition, patients with mild and severe freezing represented cortical activity differences. For patients with freezing, the initial component of movement-related cortical potential is significantly lower than that of the healthy controls (P = 0.002) and is affected by the severity of freezing. Furthermore, a striking absence of beta frequency band (12-35 Hz) desynchronization was observed in patients with freezing, especially low-beta frequency band over Cz, before the movement, which was also associated with the severity of the freezing of gait. Low-beta (13-20 Hz) and high-beta (21-35 Hz) frequency band activities represented unique features for each group. Beta event-related desynchronization over Cz present in healthy controls prior to movement onset, was partially replaced by the theta band (4-8 Hz) synchrony in patients with freezing. Patients with severe freezing also represented some level of theta band synchronization over contralateral supplementary motor area. This suggests the involvement of cognitive processing over the motor cortex in controlling cue-based voluntary movement as a compensatory mechanism associated with freezing of gait. The EEG features identified in this study are indicative of important freezing of gait clinical characteristics such as severity and contribute to a better understanding of the underlying neurophysiology of the mysterious phenomenon of freezing of gait. Karimi et al. report that the severity of freezing of gait is associated with features of movement-related cortical potentials over the primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area. They also report that low- and high-beta activities and the presence of theta band synchronizations before movement execution are brain oscillations affected by freezing of gait severity.

However, neural mechanisms involved in the retrieval of stored information of such associations and memory in the RSC remain unclear. To investigate the neural mechanisms underlying these processes, RSC neurons and local field potentials (LFPs) were simultaneously recorded from well-trained rats performing a cue-reward association task. In the task, simultaneous presentation of two multimodal conditioned stimuli (configural CSs) predicted a reward outcome opposite to that associated with the individual presentation of each elemental CS. Here, we show neurophysiological evidence that the RSC is involved in stimulus-stimulus association where configural CSs are discriminated from each elementary CS that is a constituent of the configural CSs, and that memory retrieval of rewarding CSs is associated with theta oscillation of RSC neurons during CS presentation, which is phase-locked to LFP theta cycles. The results suggest that cue (elementary and configural CSs)-reinforcement associations are stored in the RSC neural circuits, and are retrieved in synchronization with LFP theta rhythm.

Synchronization between Keyboard Typing and Neural Oscillations	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							FRONTAL THETA; SPEECH; DISSOCIATE; DYNAMICS; PHASE	Rhythmic neural activity synchronizes with certain rhythmic behaviors, such as breathing, sniffing, saccades, and speech. The extent to which neural oscillations synchronize with higher-level and more complex behaviors is largely unknown. Here, we investigated electrophysiological synchronization with keyboard typing, which is an omnipresent behavior daily engaged by an uncountably large number of people. Keyboard typing is rhythmic, with frequency characteristics roughly the same as neural oscillatory dynamics associated with cognitive control, notably through midfrontal theta (4-7 Hz) oscillations. We tested the hypothesis that synchronization occurs between typing and midfrontal theta and breaks down when errors are committed. Thirty healthy participants typed words and sentences on a keyboard without visual feedback, while EEG was recorded. Typing rhythmicity was investigated by interkeystroke interval analyses and by a kernel density estimation method. We used a multivariate spatial filtering technique to investigate frequency-specific synchronization between typing and neuronal oscillations. Our results demonstrate theta rhythmicity in typing (around 6.5 Hz) through the two different behavioral analyses. Synchronization between typing and neuronal oscillations occurred at frequencies ranging from 4 to 15 Hz, but to a larger extent for lower frequencies. However, peak synchronization frequency was idiosyncratic across participants, therefore not specific to theta nor to midfrontal regions, and correlated somewhat with peak typing frequency. Errors and trials associated with stronger cognitive control were not associated with changes in synchronization at any frequency. As a whole, this study shows that brain-behavior synchronization does occur during keyboard typing but is not specific to midfrontal theta.

Neural oscillations underlying selective attention follow sexually divergent developmental trajectories during adolescence	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Development; Flanker effect; Magnetoencephalography (MEG); Oscillations; Sex effects	RESPONSE COMPETITION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; BRAIN ACTIVITY; FRONTAL-LOBE; DYNAMICS; THETA; MEG; ALPHA; EEG; MECHANISMS	Selective attention processes are critical to everyday functioning and are known to develop through at least young adulthood. Although numerous investigations have studied the maturation of attention systems in the brain, these studies have largely focused on the spatial configuration of these systems; there is a paucity of research on the neural oscillatory dynamics serving selective attention, particularly among youth. Herein, we examined the developmental trajectory of neural oscillatory activity serving selective attention in 53 typically developing youth age 9-to-16 years-old. Participants completed the classic arrow-based flanker task during magnetoencephalography, and the resulting data were imaged in the time-frequency domain. Flanker interference significantly modulated theta and alpha/beta oscillations within prefrontal, mid-cingulate, cuneus, and occipital regions. Interference-related neural activity also increased with age in the temporoparietal junction and the rostral anterior cingulate. Sex-specific effects indicated that females had greater theta interference activity in the anterior insula, whereas males showed differential effects in theta and alpha/beta oscillations across frontoparietal regions. Finally, males showed age-related changes in alpha/beta interference in the cuneus and middle frontal gyrus, which predicted improved behavioral performance. Taken together, these data suggest sexually-divergent developmental trajectories underlying selective attention in youth.

It plays an important functional role in neural information processing and cognition. Thus, we propose a novel method based on the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence and correlation matrix. The method takes the amplitude distributions of the HFO located in the corresponding phase bins of the LFO as multichannel inputs to construct a correlation matrix, where the elements are calculated based on the JS divergence between pairs of amplitude distributions. Then, the omega complexity extracted from the correlation matrix is used to estimate the PAC strength. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively reflect the PAC strength and slightly vary with the data length. Moreover, it outperforms five frequently used algorithms in the performance against additive white Gaussian noise and spike noise and the ability of detecting PAC in wide frequency ranges. To validate our proposed method with real data, it was applied to analyze the local field potential recorded from the dorsomedial striatum in a male Sprague-Dawley rat. It can replicate previous results obtained with other PAC metrics. In conclusion, these results suggest that our proposed method is a powerful tool for measuring the PAC between neural oscillations.

J	Gwon, D; Ahn, M				Gwon, Daeun; Ahn, Minkyu			Alpha and high gamma phase amplitude coupling during motor imagery and weighted cross-frequency coupling to extract discriminative cross-frequency patterns	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Motor imagery; Alpha; High gamma; Cross frequency coupling; Phase amplitude coupling	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; FINGER MOVEMENTS; CORTEX; PERFORMANCE; SYNCHRONIZATION; REPRESENTATION; COMMUNICATION; INVOLVEMENT	Motor imagery modulates specific neural oscillations like actual movement does. Representatively, suppression of the alpha power (e.g., event-related desynchronization [ERD]) is the typical pattern of motor imagery in the motor cortex. However, in addition to this amplitude-based feature, the coupling across frequencies includes important information about the brain functions and the existence of such complex information has been reported in various invasive studies. Yet, the interaction across multiple frequencies during motor imagery processing is still unclear and has not been widely studied, particularly concerning the non-invasive signals. In this study, we provide empirical evidence of the comodulation between the phase of alpha rhythm and the amplitude of high gamma rhythm during the motor imagery process. We used electroencephalography (EEG) in our investigation during the imagination of left-or right-hand movement recorded from 52 healthy subjects, and quantified the ERD of alpha and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) which is a relative change of modulation index to the base line period (before the cue). As a result, we found that the coupling between the phase of alpha (8-12 Hz) and the amplitude of high gamma (70-120 Hz) and this PAC decreases during motor imagery and then rebounds to the baseline like alpha ERD ( r = 0.29 to 0.42). This correlation between PAC and ERD was particularly stronger in the ipsilateral area. In addition, trials that demonstrated higher alpha power during the ready period (before the cue) showed a larger ERD during motor imagery and similarly, trials with higher modulation index during the ready period yielded a greater decrease in PAC during imagery. In the classification analysis, we found that the effective phase frequency that showed better decoding accuracy in left and right-hand imagery, varied across subjects. Motivated by result, we proposed a weighted cross-frequency coupling (WCFC) method that extracts the maximal discriminative feature by combining band power and CFC. In the evaluation, WCFC with only two electrodes yielded a performance comparable to the conventional algorithm with 64 electrodes in classifying left and right-hand motor imagery. These results indicate that the phase-amplitude frequency plays an important role in motor imagery, and that optimizing this frequency ranges is crucial for extracting information features to decode the motor imagery types.

We identify target memories by their neural oscillatory signatures, as shown in recent human episodic memory paradigms. Our model comprises three plausible components for the binding of temporal content, where each component imposes unique limitations on the encoding and representation of that content. A cortical component actively represents sequences through the disruption of an intrinsically generated alpha rhythm, where a desynchronisation marks information-rich operations as the literature predicts. A binding component converts each event into a discrete index, enabling repetitions through a sparse encoding of events. A timing component - consisting of an oscillatory "ticking clock" made up of hierarchical synfire chains - discretely indexes a moment in time. By encoding the absolute timing between discretised events, we show how one can use cortical desynchronisations to dynamically detect unique temporal signatures as they are reactivated in the brain. We validate this model by simulating a series of events where sequences are uniquely identifiable by analysing phasic information, as several recent EEG/MEG studies have shown. As such, we show how one can encode and retrieve complete episodic memories where the quality of such memories is modulated by the following: alpha gate keepers to content representation; binding limitations that induce a blink in temporal perception; and nested oscillations that provide preferential learning phases in order to temporally sequence events.

New research efforts are showing a promising future for the prediction and preemption of imminent seizures, and with those efforts, a vast and diverse set of features have been proposed for seizure prediction algorithms. However, the data-driven discovery of nonsinusoidal waveforms for seizure prediction is lacking in the literature, which is in stark contrast with recent works that show the close connection between the waveform morphology of neural oscillations and the physiology and pathophysiology of the brain, and especially its use in effectively discriminating between normal and abnormal oscillations in electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings of epileptic patients. Here, we explore a scalable, energy-guided waveform search strategy on spatially-projected continuous multi-day ECoG data sets. Our work shows that data-driven waveform learning methods have the potential to not only contribute features with predictive power for seizure prediction, but also to facilitate the discovery of oscillatory patterns that could contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology and etiology of seizures.

Endogenous memory reactivation during sleep in humans is clocked by slow oscillation-spindle complexes	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							CLOSED-LOOP STIMULATION; BENEFITS; BRAIN	Sleep is thought to support memory consolidation via reactivation of prior experiences, with particular electrophysiological sleep signatures (slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles) gating the information flow between relevant brain areas. However, empirical evidence for a role of endogenous memory reactivation (i.e., without experimentally delivered memory cues) for consolidation in humans is lacking. Here, we devised a paradigm in which participants acquired associative memories before taking a nap. Multivariate decoding was then used to capture endogenous memory reactivation during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in surface EEG recordings. Our results reveal reactivation of learning material during SO-spindle complexes, with the precision of SO-spindle coupling predicting reactivation strength. Critically, reactivation strength (i.e. classifier evidence in favor of the previously studied stimulus category) in turn predicts the level of consolidation across participants. These results elucidate the memory function of sleep in humans and emphasize the importance of SOs and spindles in clocking endogenous consolidation processes. Sleep after learning helps to strengthen new memories. Here, the authors link this memory benefit to the reactivation of learning experiences when two endogenous sleep rhythms-slow oscillations and sleep spindles-coincide.

The present study uses electroencephalogram (EEG) and subjective measures to investigate if noise-canceling technologies can fade out external distractions and free up mental resources. Therefore, participants had to solve spoken arithmetic tasks that were read out via headphones in three sound environments: a quiet environment (no noise), a noisy environment (noise), and a noisy environment but with active noise-canceling headphones (noise-canceling). Our results of brain activity partially confirm an assumed lower mental load in no noise and noise-canceling compared to noise test condition. The mean P300 activation at Cz resulted in a significant differentiation between the no noise and the other two test conditions. Subjective data indicate an improved situation for the participants when using the noise-canceling technology compared to "normal" headphones but shows no significant discrimination. The present results provide a foundation for further investigations into the relationship between noise-canceling technology and mental workload. Additionally, we give recommendations for an adaptation of the test design for future studies.

J	Zhang, L; Chen, D; Chen, PL; Li, WG; Li, XL				Zhang, Lei; Chen, Dan; Chen, Peilu; Li, Weiguang; Li, Xiaoli			Dual-CNN based multi-modal sleep scoring with temporal correlation driven fine-tuning	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Sleep scoring framework; Multi-modal classification; Temporal correlation; EEG; Polysomnography	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; DECOMPOSITION; FUSION; PHASE; MEG	Examination of dysfunctional brain dynamics often needs to tackle the difficulties of analyzing neural data of multiple modalities as recordings from a single source (such as EEG) do not always suffice in characterizing the brain states of interest. A typical example is sleep scoring from Polysomnography (PSG) for evaluation of sleep disorder, which has long been an onerous task and constantly results in unstable performance. Despite numerous successes achieved by the deep learning technologies recently booming along this direction, a grand challenge still remains: how to enable a stable solution to characterize the sleep stages (brain states) with temporal correlations embedded in the multi-modal recordings mainly from the brain activities without the support of sufficient a priori knowledge of the subjects. Aiming at the challenge, this study develops a deep learning framework for multi-modal sleep scoring. The framework uses a "dual-CNN" to simultaneously process inputs of two forms, i.e., temporal or time- frequency. The inputs of each branch may either consist of organized epochs of multiple modalities or their time-frequency representations. The fused deep features of the original multi-modal dataset will then be derived. The correlation of the original consecutive epochs embedded in the deep features can be reinforced through an RNN layer to aid classification with the final results fine-tuned by a customized Markov chain model, which considers the temporal correlations embedded in the deep features to amortize the potential bias resulted from the imbalance of brain states represented by the features. A case study of sleep scoring has been performed against a public Sleep-EDF dataset. Experimental results indicate that 1) the multi-modal features generated by the dual-CNN model help in significantly improve the accuracy of neural data classification; 2) the overall framework outperforms the state-ofthe-art counterparts with an accuracy of 84.9% achieved in sleep scoring.

Such cognitive offloading can enhance subsequent memory performance, as referred to the saving-enhanced memory effect (Storm & Stone, 2015). The cognitive mechanisms of this effect are not clear to date, however similarities to list-method directed forgetting (LMDF) have been stated. Here, we examined in 52 participants the electrophysiological (EEG) correlates of the saving-enhanced memory effect and compared our results to earlier LMDF findings (Hanslmayr et al., 2012). For this purpose, EEG alpha power and alpha phase synchrony during the encoding of two word lists were compared as a function of saving or no-saving. We hypothesised that if saving-enhanced memory was related to LMDF, saving in comparison to no-saving between lists should reduce alpha power and alpha phase synchrony during List 2 encoding, two effects that have been related to List 2 encoding benefits and List 1 inhibition in the earlier LMDF work. The results showed no statistically significant saving-enhanced memory effect and no significant effects in EEG alpha power or alpha phase synchrony. Possible explanations for and implications of these non-significant findings are discussed.

To date, there is no practical device or method that allows us to generate a quantitative pain index. In recent years, studies related to pain and its measurement have been reported, which have used brain activity as a biological marker of pain based on various methodologies. Therefore, the purpose of this survey article is to concentrate the tools and methods that use brain activity to study two types of physical pain: 1) chronic, as a result of a clinical condition; and, 2) acute physical induced by a painful stimulus. The survey analyzes the elements involved in evaluating these types of pain, considering the number of subjects, the EEG setting, the stimulus applied, the pain perception test used, the software for analysis and processing, and additional resources. The results present a systematic classification of the information; it contains the techniques and technologies that have been used for the study of pain. Finally, the article concludes identifying opportunity areas as quantitative pain measurement tools based on brain activity analysis to understand, adapt, or monitor the treatment responses.

Altering Facial Movements Abolishes Neural Mirroring of Facial Expressions	COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Facial mimicry; Facial expression; Mu rhythm; Sensorimotor simulation	EEG MU RHYTHM; SENSORIMOTOR SIMULATION; EMOTION RECOGNITION; MIMICRY; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; FEEDBACK; OSCILLATIONS; SUPPRESSION; MODULATION	People tend to automatically imitate others' facial expressions of emotion. That reaction, termed "facial mimicry" has been linked to sensorimotor simulation-a process in which the observer's brain recreates and mirrors the emotional experience of the other person, potentially enabling empathy and deep, motivated processing of social signals. However, the neural mechanisms that underlie sensorimotor simulation remain unclear. This study tests how interfering with facial mimicry by asking participants to hold a pen in their mouth influences the activity of the human mirror neuron system, indexed by the desynchronization of the EEG mu rhythm. This response arises from sensorimotor brain areas during observed and executed movements and has been linked with empathy. We recorded EEG during passive viewing of dynamic facial expressions of anger, fear, and happiness, as well as nonbiological moving objects. We examine mu desynchronization under conditions of free versus altered facial mimicry and show that desynchronization is present when adult participants can freely move but not when their facial movements are inhibited. Our findings highlight the importance of motor activity and facial expression in emotion communication. They also have important implications for behaviors that involve occupying or hiding the lower part of the face.

Despite intensive investigations on PES, the adaptive nature of PES remains unresolved. Mere, we systematically examined this issue by manipulating response-stimulus intervals (RSIs) and examining their influence on behaviors and neural dynamics of PES. Behavioral and electrophysiological (EEG) measures were recorded while male and female human participants performed a four-choice flanker task as RSIs were manipulated. Behaviorally, PES showed maladaptive features at short RSIs but some adaptive features at long RSIs. EEG results indicated that RSIs did not affect basic error-related processing. indexed by the same pattern in the contrasts between flanker errors and correct responses on the error-related negativity (ERN). error positivity (Pe), or theta band, no matter at short or long RSIs. However, RSIs significantly influenced postflanker error attentional adjustment, motor inhibition, and sensory sensitivity. At short RSIs, compared with postcorrect trials, postflanker error trials elicited larger beta band power and smaller P1 amplitude but did not affect alpha band power, suggesting that motor processing was inhibited, and subsequent sensory processing was impaired, but no attentional adjustment occurred. By contrast, at long RSIs, postflanker error trials led to smaller alpha and beta band power but did not affect P1 amplitude, indicating that attentional adjustment but not motor inhibition occurred, and sensory processing was not impaired. Together with behavioral results, the current study demonstrated that PES was adaptive at long RSIs but maladaptive at short RSIs. We further discuss the role of central resources in the adaptability of PES.

In animal models few studies have characterized and analyzed cerebral rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle in early ages, in relation to adulthood. Since the analysis of sleep in early ages can be used as a predictive model of brain development and the subsequent emergence of neural disturbances in adults, we performed a study on late neonatal mice, an age not previously characterized. We acquired longitudinal 24 h electroencephalogram and electromyogram recordings and performed time and spectral analyses. We compared both age groups and found that late neonates: (i) spent more time in wakefulness and less time in non-rapid eye movement sleep, (ii) showed an increased relative band power in delta, which, however, reduced in theta during each behavioral state, (iii) showed a reduced relative band power in beta during wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement sleep, and (iv) manifested an increased total power over all frequencies. The data presented here might have implications expanding our knowledge of cerebral rhythms in early ages for identification of potential biomarkers in preclinical models of neurodegeneration.

We aimed to clarify and visualize how HFAs are modulated by the phase of low-frequency bands during seizures. Methods: We used intracranial electrodes to record seizures of focal epilepsy (12 focal-to-bilateral tonicclonic seizures and three focal-aware seizures in seven patients). The synchronization index, representing PAC, was used to analyze the coupling between the amplitude of ripples (80-250 Hz) and the phase of lower frequencies. We created a video in which the intracranial electrode contacts were scaled linearly to the power changes of ripple. Results: The main low frequency band modulating ictal-ripple activities was the 0 band (4-8 Hz), and after completion of ictal-ripple burst, d (1-4 Hz)-ripple PAC occurred. The ripple power increased simultaneously with rhythmic fluctuations from the seizure onset zone, and spread to other regions. Conclusions: Ripple activities during seizure evolution were modulated by the 0 phase. The PAC phenomenon was visualized as rhythmic fluctuations. Significance: Ripple power associated with seizure evolution increased and spread with fluctuations. The 0 oscillations related to the fluctuations might represent the common neurophysiological processing involved in seizure generation. (c) 2021 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Associations between self-reported spontaneous thought and temporal sequences of EEG microstates	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						EEG; Microstates; Mind wandering; Resting state; Sequence analysis; Spontaneous thought	DYNAMICS; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; EXPERIENCE; ATTENTION; NETWORKS; ALPHA; SIZE	Thought dynamically evolves from one moment to the next even in the absence of external stimulation. The extent to which patterns of spontaneous thought covary with time-varying fluctuations in intrinsic brain activity is of great interest but remains unknown. We conducted novel analyses of data originally reported by Portnova et al. (2019) to examine associations between the intrinsic dynamics of EEG microstates and self-reported thought measured using the Amsterdam Resting-State Questionnaire (ARSQ). Accordingly, the millisecond fluctuations of microstates were associated with specific dimensions of thought. We evaluated the reliability of these findings by combining our results with those of another study using meta-analysis. Importantly, we extended this investigation using multivariate methods to evaluate multidimensional thought profiles of individuals and their links to sequences of successive microstates. Thought profiles were identified based on hierarchical clustering of ARSQ ratings and were distinguished in terms of the temporal ordering of successive microstates based on sequence analytic methods. These findings demonstrate the relevance of assessing spontaneous thought for understanding intrinsic brain activity and the novel use of sequence analysis for characterizing microstate dynamics. Integrating the phenomenological view from within remains crucial for understanding the functional significance of intrinsic large-scale neurodynamics.

According to the expert-performance approach, we took an idiosyncratic perspective analyzing the mental imagery of an experienced two-time Olympic athlete to verify whether different instructional modalities of imagery (i.e., guided vs. self-produced) and different scripts (e.g., training or competition environment) could differently involve brain activity. The subject listened to each previously recorded script taken from two existing questionnaires concerning imagery ability in sport and then was asked to imagine the scene for a minute. During the task, brain waves were monitored using EEG (32-channel g. Nautilus). Our findings indicate that guided imagery might induce higher high alpha and SMR (usually associated with selective attention), whereas self-produced imagery might facilitate higher low alpha (associated with global resting state and relaxation). Results are discussed in light of the neural efficiency hypothesis as a marker of optimal performance and transient hypofrontality as a marker of flow state. Practical mental training recommendations are presented.

Subjects were composed of 20 elderly people who were over 60 years old and had no disease. They were subjected to WBV of 30Hz and strength intensity of 20 (total 5 sets, 20s/set, rest time: 20s, except for the final set). The subjects were grouped into two groups. One group of 11 subjects was WBVSt (WBV of upright stance) and the other group of nine subjects was WBVSq (WBV of squat posture). In the WBVSt group, the subjects were requested to maintain a standing position, whereas those in the WBVSq group were asked to perform 60(degrees)-knee flexion squat at 2s intervals during WBV stimulation. In this study, the electromyography (EMG) was measured on the right and left erector spinae, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, tibialis anterior to evaluate lower limb muscle activity and postural stability during timed up and go (TUG) test before and after WBV. The EEG was measured on frontal (F3, F4, F7, F8), central (Cz, C3, C4), temporal (T3, T4, T5, T6), parietal (P3, P4), and occipital (O1, O2) lobes to evaluate brain activity during the check of mini-mental state examination for dementia screening (MMSE-DS) before and after WBV. The results of this study showed improved postural stability and muscle activation for the healthy elderly during lower limb and WVB exercises. The WBVSq group showed higher changes in TUG-test (p<0.05) and iEMG analysis by EMG (p>0.05) compared with the WBVSt group. However, there was no significant change in MMSE-DS (p>0.05). Because of the increase in relative SMR power by EEG, the central (C4), frontal (F7) and parietal (P3, P4) lobes were activated in WBVSt group (p<0.05); however, all regions, except the parietal lobe, were activated in WBVSq group (p>0.05). Lower limb exercise with WBV stimulation improved postural stability, lower limb muscle, and brain activation for the elderly. These results may be helpful to the protocol of exercise using WBV for the healthy elderly.

J	Hubbard, RJ; Sahakyan, L				Hubbard, Ryan J.; Sahakyan, Lili			Separable neural mechanisms support intentional forgetting and thought substitution	CORTEX			English	Article						Memory; Forgetting; EEG	CONTEXT-CHANGE ACCOUNT; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; THETA OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ERP; INHIBITION; FMRI; TRANSFORMATION; INSTRUCTIONS	Psychological and neuroscientific experiments have established that people can intentionally forget information via different strategies: direct suppression and thought substitution. However, few studies have directly compared the effectiveness of these strategies in forgetting specific items, and it remains an open question if the neural mechanisms supporting these strategies differ. Here, we developed a novel item-method directed forgetting paradigm with Remember, Forget, and Imagine cues, and recorded EEG to directly compare these strategies. Behaviorally, Forget and Imagine cues produced similar forgetting compared to Remember cues, but through separable neural processes; Forget cues elicited frontal oscillatory power changes that were predictive of future forgetting, whereas item-cue representational similarity was predictive of later accuracy for Imagine cues. These results suggest that both strategies can lead to intentional forgetting, but directed forgetting may rely on frontally-mediated suppression, while thought substitution may lead to contextual shifting, impairing successful retrieval.

Our previous research using event-related potentials (ERPs) has revealed patterns of neural activity that distinguish ethical decision making from decisions that do not involve an ethical component. In the current study, we sought to gain insight into the locus of the effect of ethical decision making on the posterior N2 component of the ERPs. The ERP data revealed that the N2 was greater in amplitude for control trials relative to ethical violation trials, and time-frequency analyses revealed that this resulted from a reduction in phase-locked activity across trials rather than a decrease in EEG power. These findings may indicate that ethical decision making related to information security is associated with a greater inward focus of attention than is the case for decision making on control trials.

The role of cognitive control and top-down processes in object affordances	ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS			English	Article						Cognitive control; EEG; Object affordance; Theta power; Time-frequency; Event-related potential; VEP; Attention		A widely held though debatable claim is that the picture of an object like a frying pan automatically elicits features of a left/right-handed grasp action even in perceptual tasks that make no demands on the observer to consider the graspable properties of the depicted object. Here, we sought to further elucidate this claim by relying on a methodology that allowed us to distinguish between the influence of motor versus spatial codes on the selection of a left/right-handed response while electroencephalographic data were recorded. In our experiment, participants classified images of frying pans as upright or inverted using a left/right key press or by making a left/right-handed reach-and-grasp action towards a centrally located response element while we recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) data. In line with previous evidence (Bub, Masson, & van Noordenne, Journal of Experiment Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 47(1), 53-80, 2021), these two modes of responding generated distinct correspondence effects on performance induced by the same set of images. In terms of our EEG data, we found that neither motor (the lateralized readiness potential) nor visual (N100 and P100) potentials were sensitive to handle-response hand correspondence. However, an exploratory theta analysis revealed that changes in frontal theta power mirrored the different correspondence effects evoked by the image on key press responses versus reach and grasp actions. Importantly, our results provide a link between these disparate effects and the engagement of cognitive control, highlighting a possible role of top-down control processes in separating motor features from the task-irrelevant features of an object, and thus in claims regarding object affordances more generally.

Correlations between neural activity during encoding and subsequent retrieval performance have implicated such "subsequent memory effects" (SMEs) as important for understanding the neural basis of memory formation. Uncontrolled variability in external factors that also predict memory performance. however, confounds the interpretation of these effects. By controlling for a comprehensive set of external variables, we investigated the extent to which neural correlates of successful memory encoding reflect variability in endogenous brain states. We show that external variables that reliably predict memory performance have relatively small effects on electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of successful memory encoding. Instead, the brain activity that is diagnostic of successful encoding primarily reflects fluctuations in endogenous neural activity. These findings link neural activity during learning to endogenous states that drive variability in human cognition.

Biological indexes of ER in childhood that predict behavior are valuable for clinical applications and our understanding of affective neurodevelopment. Delta-beta correlation (DBC), or the coupling between resting state slow-wave (delta) and fast-wave (beta) neural oscillations derived from EEG, may be a metric of the functional coherence between subcortical and cortical neural circuitry implicated in ER. Yet, little is understood about how DBC corresponds to observed ER during emotional challenges. To address this question, in the present study, resting-state EEG was recorded to generate DBC when children were 5-7 years old (T1) and again two years later (T2). Children also completed two emotionally challenging behavioral tasks [delay of gratification (DoG) task and waiting task (WT)] from which observed ER strategies were subsequently coded. Results showed that higher DBC was associated with greater use of adaptive, and relatively active, ER strategies. Specifically, higher frontal DBC at T1 longitudinally predicted greater use of the ER strategy alternative activity engagement and greater parent-reported positive ER at T2. These findings add to growing evidence supporting the use of resting state DBC as a neurophysiological index of ER with clinically and developmentally relevant predictive power.

This attentional focus is achieved by the modulation of sensory neuronal excitability through alpha power. Failure to modulate alpha power and to inhibit distracting information has been reported in older adults during attention and working memory tasks. Given that alpha power during encoding can predict subsequent memory performance, aberrant oscillatory modulations might play a role in age-related memory deficits. However, it is unknown whether there are age-related differences in memory performance or alpha modulation when encoding targets with distraction. Here we show that both older and younger adults are able to encode targets paired with distractors and that the level of alpha power modulation during encoding predicted recognition success. Even though older adults showed signs of higher distractibility, this did not harm their episodic memory for target information. Also, we demonstrate that older adults only modulated alpha power during high distraction, both by enhancing target processing and inhibiting distractor processing. These results indicate that both younger and older adults are able to employ the same inhibitory control mechanisms successfully, but that older adults fail to call upon these when distraction is minimal. The findings of this study give us more insight into the mechanisms involved in memory encoding across the lifespan.

The present study aims investigating the electrophysiological (EEG) correlates underlying the use of affective, social and informative gestures during gesture observation by an encoder (who observed to reproduce the gestures successively) and decoder (who simply observed the gestures). Mirroring mechanisms were considered for a gesture observation task. Results showed an increase of frontal alpha, delta, and theta brain responsiveness and intra-brain connectivity for affective and social gestures; and of posterior (temporo-parietal) alpha activity and alpha and delta intra-brain connectivity for informative ones. Concerning inter-agents' role, similar responses were found for all gestures. Regarding gesture valence, an increase of delta and theta activity was observed for positive gestures on the left cerebral side. This study, therefore, revealed the function of gestures' type and valence in influencing individuals' brain activity, showing the presence of mirroring mechanisms underlying gesture observation.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying aggression and retaliation remain unclear. Previous studies on social intentions are confounded by a low-level response-related brain activity. Using an Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface combined with the Chicken Game, our study examined the neural dynamics of aggression and retaliation after controlling for nonessential response-related neural signals. Our results show that aggression is associated with reduced alpha event-related desynchronization (alpha-ERD), indicating reduced mental effort. Moreover, retaliation and tit-for-tat strategy use are also linked with smaller alpha-ERD. Our study provides a novel method to minimize motor confounds and demonstrates that choosing aggression and retaliation is less effortful in social conflicts.

Ictal activity captured by intracranial EEG has traditionally been interpreted to suggest that the underlying cortex is actively involved in seizures. Here, we hypothesize that such activity instead reflects propagated activity from a relatively focal seizure source, even during later time points when ictal activity is more widespread. We used the time differences observed between ictal discharges in adjacent electrodes to estimate the location of the hypothesized focal source and demonstrated that the seizure source, localized in this manner, closely matches the clinically and neurophysiologically determined brain region giving rise to seizures. Moreover, we determined this focal source to be a dynamic entity that moves and evolves over the time course of a seizure. Our results offer an interpretation of ictal activity observed by intracranial EEG that challenges the traditional conceptualization of the seizure source.

Cognitive control and WM are probably based on overlapping neurophysiological mechanisms. For example, thetaband activity (TBA) plays an important role in both functions. For cognitive control processes, it is known that different aspects of information about stimulus content, motor processes and stimulus-response relationships are encoded simultaneously in the TBA. All this information is probably processed during WM gating processes and must be controlled during them. However, direct data for this are lacking. This question is investigated in this study by combining methods of EEG temporal signal decomposition, time-frequency decomposition and beamforming. We show that portions of stimulus-related information, motor response-related information and information related to the interaction between the stimulus and motor responses in the TBA are influenced in parallel and to a similar extent by WM gate opening and gate closing processes. Nevertheless, it is stimulus-related information in the theta signal in particular that modulates behavioural performance in WM-gating. The data suggest that the identified processes are implemented in specific neuroanatomical structures. In particular, the medial frontal cortex, temporal cortical regions and insular cortex are involved in these dynamics. The study shows that principles of information coding relevant to cognitive control processes are also crucial for understanding WM gating. (c) 2021 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These frequency bands are coupled, such that the higher oscillation frequencies are nested (phase-amplitude coupled) on the lower frequencies, resulting in a 1/f power spectrum. The changes in the 1/f slope of the power spectrum in tinnitus patients are unexplored. Deviations from the 1/f pattern also reflect a change toward a more lattice (steeper slope) or random network (flatter slope) and relate to the amount of information in a network. In this study, we investigate the 1/f slope in the resting-state EEGs of tinnitus patients and relate these findings to proposed tinnitus mechanisms. Our data show that tinnitus is characterized by a slope that is flattened in comparison to the control group and that the tinnitus loudness percept correlates the steepness of the slope of the power spectrum in resting-state EEG signals for the left auditory cortex and left parahippocampus. The steepness of the slope is predominantly related to an increase in theta activity and its minor increase in gamma activity, suggesting that the slope is deviating toward white noise. These results should motivate further research into this hitherto elusive form of brain activity that resides behind the mask of the universal 1/f power spectrum observed across nature.

Associations of Hyperactivity and Inattention Scores with Theta and Beta Oscillatory Dynamics of EEG in Stop-Signal Task in Healthy Children 7-10 Years Old	BIOLOGY-BASEL			English	Article						Stop-Signal task; theta oscillations; beta oscillations; ADHD; hyperactivity; inattention; children	ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; QUANTITATIVE EEG; EXECUTION; ADHD; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY; ADOLESCENTS; VIGILANCE; ANXIETY; DRIVE	Most studies on ADHD have been focused on the comparisons between healthy subjects and clinical patients. The dimensional approaches propose that the main pathological behavioral domains are distributed in the normal population and not only in individual categories of people (as assumed in traditional schemes of comparisons between patients and controls). In the current study, we used a similar approach to identify potential markers of ADHD by studying the EEG dynamics of healthy children with a natural variability in hyperactivity and inattention scores during performance of the Stop-Signal task. We found that hyperactivity/inattention scores were positively associated with RT variability. Hyperactivity/inattention scores were negatively associated with an increase in beta spectral power in the first 200 ms and positively associated with an increase in theta rhythm at about 300 ms after presentation of the Go stimulus. It has been hypothesized that such results imply insufficient vigilance in the early stages of perception and subsequent compensatory enhancing of attention to the stimulus in children with higher hyperactivity and inattention scores. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the associations between the natural variability in hyperactivity and inattention scores, as well as their combination with EEG oscillatory responses in the Stop-Signal task in a sample of healthy children. During performance, the Stop-Signal task EEGs were recorded in 94 Caucasian children (40 girls) from 7 to 10 years. Hyperactivity/inattention and inattention scores positively correlated with RT variability. Hyperactivity/inattention and inattention scores negatively correlated with an increase in beta spectral power in the first 200 ms after presentation of the Go stimulus. Such results are in line with the lack of arousal model in ADHD children and can be associated with less sensory arousal in the early stages of perception in children with symptoms of inattention. The subsequent greater increase in theta rhythm at about 300 ms after presentation of the Go stimulus in children with higher inattention scores may be associated with increased attention processes and compensation for insufficient vigilance in the early stages of perception.

Graph energy based centrality measures to detect epileptogenic focal invasive EEG electrodes	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						Epilepsy; Epileptogenic zone; Graph theory; Centrality; EEG; Laplacian centrality	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; INFORMATION-FLOW; BRAIN NETWORKS; SYNCHRONIZATION; ZONE; CONNECTIVITY; LOCALIZATION; COHERENCE	Purpose: Medically intractable epilepsy can be treated with surgical interventions, which require localization of the cortical region where seizures start. This region is referred to as the epileptogenic zone (EZ). Good surgical outcomes depend on an exact localization of the EZ. Methods: We propose a graph theoretical approach providing a novel method to localize the epileptogenic zone using invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The proposed methods employ centrality determination using three graph energies, namely simple graph energy, Laplacian energy, and distance energy. Centrality values of invasive EEG electrodes from 19 patients were analyzed at different frequency bands and at different time points. K-means clustering was used to distinguish focal (electrodes placed in the epileptogenic zone) from non-focal electrodes using the centrality values obtained. Results: Focal electrodes show higher centrality values when compared to non-focal electrodes. All three graph energy based centrality measures proposed show maximum f-score and accuracy during the early seizure phase in the gamma frequency band. Among the three proposed methods, simple graph energy based centrality outperforms Laplacian centrality and distance energy based centrality and also other related and competitive methods available in the literature in terms of accuracy and f-score. Conclusion: Graph energy based centrality measures are useful parameters for the delineation of the epileptogenic zone. Among the three centrality measures examined, simple graph energy based centrality proved best suited for this purpose.	[Nithin, G.; Sathidevi, P. S.; Ameer, P.

However, idiographic model parameters, such as working memory capacity, often need to be estimated from specific tasks, making them dependent on task-specific assumptions. Here, we explore the possibility that idiographic parameters reflect an individual's biology and can be identified from task-free neuroimaging measures. To test this hypothesis, we correlated a reliable behavioral trait, the individual rate of forgetting in long-term memory, with a readily available task-free neuroimaging measure, the resting-state EEG spectrum. Using an established, adaptive fact-learning procedure, the rate of forgetting for verbal and visual materials was measured in a sample of 50 undergraduates from whom we also collected eyes-closed resting-state EEG data. Statistical analyses revealed that the individual rates of forgetting were significantly correlated across verbal and visual materials. Importantly, both rates correlated with resting-state power levels in the low (13-15 Hz) and upper (15-17 Hz) portion of the beta frequency bands. These correlations were particularly strong for visuospatial materials, were distributed over multiple fronto-parietal locations, and remained significant even after a correction for multiple comparisons (False Discovery Rate) and after robust correlation methods were applied. These results suggest that computational models could be individually tailored for prediction using idiographic parameter values derived from inexpensive, task-free imaging recordings.

The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and the PICALM and CLU alleles described as conferring risk or protective effects on AD patients and healthy controls. For this purpose, EEG activity was acquired from: 18 AD patients and 12 controls carrying risk alleles of both PICALM and CLU genes, and 35 AD patients and 12 controls carrying both protective alleles. Relative power (RP) in the conventional EEG frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) was computed to quantify the brain activity at source level. In addition, spatial entropy (SE) was calculated in each band to characterize the regional distribution of the RP values throughout the brain. Statistically significant differences in global RP and SE at beta band (p-values < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test) were found between genotypes in the AD group. Furthermore, RP showed statistically significant differences in 58 cortical regions out of the 68 analyzed in AD. No statistically significant differences were found in the control group at any frequency band. Our results suggest that PICALM and CLU AD-inducing genotypes are involved in physiological processes related to disruption in beta power, which may be associated with physiological disturbances such as alterations in beta-amyloid and neurotransmitter metabolism.

Many people were caught in anxiety and panic, which also prevents people from fully concentrating on their normal lives. However, the current common neurofeedback therapies used to solve the problem of lack of attention cannot fully deal with the differences in each individual. In addition, direct contact between the patient and the doctor also increases the risk of virus transmission during treatment. This article combines neurofeedback and IoT to establish an adaptive attention adjustment method. IoT connects patients and doctors remotely, reducing the direct contact between them. In order to adapt to individual differences, the feedback indicators of each individual are individually calibrated. In addition, the proportional, integral, and derivative controller was used to adjust the difficulty of the feedback task to adapt to each individual's self-regulation ability and provide the individual with a higher level of regulation. We also designed adaptive attention adjustment experiments for different individuals. The results show that through adaptive feedback training, the individual's feedback indicator has dropped by 77.90%, and the individual can adjust his attention state to the individual's optimal baseline threshold, and the oscillation error gradually reduces to the expected threshold range. This method can cope with the differences between different individuals and provide each individual with the same level of feedback regulation. In the future, this study may provide a general adjuvant treatment for other mental illnesses.

Twitches emerge postnatally during quiet sleep in human infants and are synchronized with sleep spindles	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							EARLY MOTOR-ACTIVITY; RAPID EYE-MOVEMENTS; ACTIVATION; BURSTS; STROKE; STATES	In humans and other mammals, the stillness of sleep is punctuated by bursts of rapid eye movements (REMs) and myoclonic twitches of the limbs.(1) Like the spontaneous activity that arises from the sensory periphery in other modalities (e.g., retinal waves),(2) sensory feedback arising from twitches is well suited to drive activity dependent development of the sensorimotor system.(3) It is partly because of the behavioral activation of REM sleep that this state is also called active sleep (AS), in contrast with the behavioral quiescence that gives quiet sleep (QS)-the second major stage of sleep-its name. In human infants, for which AS occupies 8 h of each day,(4) twitching helps to identify the state;(5-8) nonetheless, we know little about the structure and functions of twitching across development. Recently, in sleeping infants,(9) we documented a shift in the temporal expression of twitching beginning around 3 months of age that suggested a qualitative change in how twitches are produced. Here, we combine behavioral analysis with high-density electroencephalography (EEG) to demonstrate that this shift reflects the emergence of limb twitches during QS. Twitches during QS are not only unaccompanied by REMs, but they also occur synchronously with sleep spindles, a hallmark of QS. As QS-related twitching increases with age, sleep spindle rate also increases along the sensorimotor strip. The emerging synchrony between subcortically generated twitches and cortical oscillations suggests the development of functional connectivity among distant sensorimotor structures, with potential implications for detecting and explaining atypical developmental trajectories.

Z-score neurofeedback, heart rate variability biofeedback, and brain coaching for older adults with memory concerns	RESTORATIVE NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Z-score neurofeedback; heart rate variability biofeedback; QEEG; mild cognitive impairment; memory	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; SLEEP QUALITY INDEX; MEDITERRANEAN DIET; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; EEG-NEUROFEEDBACK; HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME; VITAMIN-D; SCREENING TOOL; OF-LIFE; DEMENTIA	Background: The three-month, multi-domain Memory Boot Camp program incorporates z-score neurofeedback (NFB), heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback, and one-on-one coaching to teach memory skills and encourage behavior change in diet, sleep, physical fitness, and stress reduction. Objective: This prospective trial evaluates the Memory Boot Camp program for adults ages 55 to 85 with symptoms of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and subjective memory complaints. Methods: Participants were evaluated via the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), NeuroTrax Global Cognitive Score, measures of anxiety, depression, sleep, quality of life, quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG), and HRV parameters at four timepoints: baseline, pre-program, post-program, and follow-up. The trial included a three-month waiting period between baseline and pre-program, such that each participant acted as their own control, and follow-up took place six months after completion of the program. Results: Participants' MoCA scores and self-reported measures of anxiety, depression, sleep quality, and quality of life improved after treatment, and these changes were maintained at follow-up. Physiological changes in HRV parameters after treatment were not significant, however, breathing rate and QEEG parameters were improved at post-program and maintained at follow-up. Finally, participants' improvement in MoCA score over the treatment period was correlated with their improvement in two brain oscillation parameters targeted by the z-score NFB protocol: relative power of delta and relative power of theta. Conclusions: Trial results suggest that the Memory Boot Camp program is a promising treatment strategy for older adults with symptoms of MCI and subjective memory complaints.

Longitudinal studies have reported morphological changes in cortical thickness and volume in selected brain regions due to meditation practice, which is interpreted as an evidence its effectiveness beyond the subjective self reporting. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography to quantify the changes in brain activity during meditation practice represents a challenge, as no clear hypothesis about the spatial or temporal pattern of such changes is available to date. In this article we consider MEG data collected during meditation sessions of experienced Buddhist monks practicing focused attention (Samatha) and open monitoring (Vipassana) meditation, contrasted by resting state with eyes closed. The MEG data are first mapped to time series of brain activity averaged over brain regions corresponding to a standard Destrieux brain atlas. Next, by bootstrapping and spectral analysis, the data are mapped to matrices representing random samples of power spectral densities in alpha, beta, gamma, and theta frequency bands. We use linear discriminant analysis to demonstrate that the samples corresponding to different meditative or resting states contain enough fingerprints of the brain state to allow a separation between different states, and we identify the brain regions that appear to contribute to the separation. Our findings suggest that the cingulate cortex, insular cortex and some of the internal structures, most notably the accumbens, the caudate and the putamen nuclei, the thalamus and the amygdalae stand out as separating regions, which seems to correlate well with earlier findings based on longitudinal studies.

The mixed model analysis assessed the utility of intracranial EEG (iEEG) predictor variables, including the seizure-onset zone (SOZ), modulation index (MI), and naming-related high gamma activity. Modulation index, quantifying the coupling between high-frequency activity at >80 Hz and local slow wave at 3-4 Hz, effectively functions as a surrogate marker of the burden of interictal spike-and-slow-wave discharges. The mixed model specifically incorporated 'subtraction-MI', defined as the subtraction of mean z-score normalized MI across all preserved sites from that across all resected sites. Auditory naming-related high-gamma activity at 70-110 Hz is a biomarker to characterize the underlying language and speech function. The model incorporated 'maximum resected high gamma', defined as the high-gamma percent change largest among sites included in the resected language-dominant hemispheric region. The model also incorporated the clinical and imaging profiles of given patients. The analysis revealed that complete removal of SOZ (p = 0.003) and younger patient age (p = 0.040) were independently associated with greater satisfaction. Neither 'subtraction-MI' nor 'maximum naming-related high-gamma' showed a significant and independent association with longterm satisfaction in our patient cohort. The observed impact of complete resection of SOZ and early surgery can be considered when counseling candidates for epilepsy surgery. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Studies in humans investigating the neural foundations of spatial navigation traditionally use stationary, desk-top protocols revealing the hippocampus, parahippocampal place area (PPA), and retrosplenial complex to be involved in navigation. However, brain dynamics, while freely navigating the real world remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we developed a novel paradigm, the AudioMaze, in which participants freely explore a room-sized virtual maze, while EEG is recorded synchronized to motion capture. Participants (n = 16) were blindfolded and explored different mazes, each in three successive trials, using their right hand as a probe to "feel" for virtual maze walls. When their hand "neared" a virtual wall, they received directional noise feedback. Evidence for spatial learning include shortening of time spent and an increase of movement velocity as the same maze was repeatedly explored. Theta-band EEG power in or near the right lingual gyrus, the posterior portion of the PPA, decreased across trials, potentially reflecting the spatial learning. Effective connectivity analysis revealed directed information flow from the lingual gyrus to the midcingulate cortex, which may indicate an updating process that integrates spatial information with future action. To conclude, we found behavioral evidence of navigational learning in a sparse-AR environment, and a neural correlate of navigational learning was found near the lingual gyrus.

J	Luo, CH; VanRullen, R; Alamia, A				Luo, Canhuang; VanRullen, Rufin; Alamia, Andrea			Conscious perception and perceptual echoes:a binocular rivalry study	NEUROSCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS			English	Article						perceptual echoes; binocular rivalry; EEG oscillations; conscious perception; travelling waves	ATTENTIONAL MODULATION; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS	Alpha rhythms (similar to 10Hz) in the human brain are classically associated with idling activities, being predominantly observed during quiet restfulness with closed eyes. However, recent studies demonstrated that alpha (similar to 10Hz) rhythms can directly relate to visual stimulation, resulting in oscillations, which can last for as long as one second. This alpha reverberation, dubbed perceptual echoes (PE), suggests that the visual system actively samples and processes visual information within the alpha-band frequency. Although PE have been linked to various visual functions, their underlying mechanisms and functional role are not completely understood. In this study, we investigated the relationship between conscious perception and the generation and the amplitude of PE. Specifically, we displayed two coloured Gabor patches with different orientations on opposite sides of the screen, and using a set of dichoptic mirrors, we induced a binocular rivalry between the two stimuli. We asked participants to continuously report which one of two Gabor patches they consciously perceived, while recording their EEG signals. Importantly, the luminance of each patch fluctuated randomly over time, generating random sequences from which we estimated two impulse-response functions (IRFs) reflecting the PE generated by the perceived (dominant) and non-perceived (suppressed) stimulus, respectively. We found that the alpha power of the PE generated by the consciously perceived stimulus was comparable with that of the PE generated during monocular vision (control condition) and higher than the PE induced by the suppressed stimulus. Moreover, confirming previous findings, we found that all PEs propagated as a travelling wave from posterior to frontal brain regions, irrespective of conscious perception. All in all our results demonstrate a correlation between conscious perception and PE, suggesting that the synchronization of neural activity plays an important role in visual sampling and conscious perception.

However, it remains unclear whether and how the interaction between the two processes is altered in individuals with MCI. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) data from 30 older adults with MCI and 30 demographically matched healthy controls (HCs) when they were performing a perceptual decision-making task, in which we manipulated the cognitive load involved in task-relevant top-down processing and the surprise level involved in task-irrelevant bottom-up processing. We found the significant group difference in the interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes. HCs showed enlarged P3 and strengthened event-related microstate C on high (vs. low) surprise level trials under high cognitive load, while there was no such surprise effect suggesting distraction under low cognitive load. In contrast, participants with MCI showed increased P2 and P3 amplitudes and strengthened microstates C and D on high (vs. low) surprise level trials under low cognitive load yet no surprise effect under high load. These results suggested that participants with MCI were distracted by task-irrelevant information under low cognitive load, while under high load, they might experience a passive inhibition on the task-irrelevant bottom-up processing because of the exhaustion of attentional resources; in addition, this altered interaction observed in the MCI group occurred at the stages of selective attention and uncertainty reduction.

However, the neural underpinnings of decision-making processes during the pursuit of dating interactions are unclear. In the present study, we used a novel online speed dating paradigm where participants (undergraduate students, N = 25, aged 18-25 years, 52% female) received direct information about acceptance or rejection of their various speed dates. We recorded EEG measurements during speed dating feedback anticipation and feedback processing stages to examine the stimulus preceding negativity (SPN) and feedback-related brain activity (Reward Positivity, RewP, and theta oscillatory power). The results indicated that the SPN was larger when participants anticipated interest versus disinterest from their speed dates. A larger RewP was observed when participants received interest from their speed dates. Theta power was increased when participants received rejection from their speed dates. This theta response could be source-localized to brain areas that overlap with the physical pain matrix (anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the supplementary motor area). This study demonstrates that decision-making processes-as evident in a speed date experiment-are characterized by distinct neurophysiological responses during anticipating an evaluation and processing thereof. Our results corroborate the involvement of the SPN in reward anticipation, RewP in reward processing and mid-frontal theta power in processing of negative social-evaluative feedback. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the neurocognitive mechanisms implicated in decision-making processes when pursuing dating relationships.

Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) has recently gained importance in analyzing brain functions. Its high temporal resolution and spatial specificity make it a powerful tool to investigate the strength, direction, and spectral content of brain networks interactions, especially when these connections are stimulus-evoked. However, choosing the best approach to evaluate the flow of information is not trivial, due to the lack of validated methods explicitly designed for SEEG. Approach. We propose a novel non-parametric statistical test for event-related causality (ERC) assessment on SEEG recordings. Here, we refer to the ERC as the causality evoked by a particular part of the stimulus (a response window (RW)). We also present a data surrogation method to evaluate the performance of a causality estimation algorithm. We finally validated our pipeline using surrogate SEEG data derived from an experimentally collected dataset, and compared the most used and successful measures to estimate effective connectivity, belonging to the Geweke-Granger causality framework. Main results. Here we show that our workflow correctly identified all the directed connections in the RW of the surrogate data and prove the robustness of the procedure against synthetic noise with amplitude exceeding physiological-plausible values. Among the causality measures tested, partial directed coherence performed best. Significance. This is the first non-parametric statistical test for ERC estimation explicitly designed for SEEG datasets. The pipeline, in principle, can also be applied to the analysis of any type of time-varying estimator, if there exists a clearly defined RW.

The ability of electrically stimulated tissue to generate beta and gamma range oscillations, called rapid-discharges, is a frequent indication of an epileptogenic zone. However, a limit of intracranial stimulation is the fixed physical location and number of implanted electrodes, leaving numerous clinically and functionally relevant brain regions unexplored. Here, we demonstrate an alternative technique relying exclusively on non-penetrating surface electrodes, namely an orientation-tunable form of temporally interfering (TI) electric fields to target the CA3 of the mouse hippocampus which focally evokes seizure-like events (SLEs) having the characteristic frequencies of rapid-discharges, but without the necessity of the implanted electrodes. The orientation of the topical electrodes with respect to the orientation of the hippocampus is demonstrated to strongly control the threshold for evoking SLEs. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of Pulse-width-modulation of square waves as an alternative to sine waves for TI stimulation. An orientation-dependent analysis of classic implanted electrodes to evoke SLEs in the hippocampus is subsequently utilized to support the results of the minimally invasive temporally interfering fields. The principles of orientation-tunable TI stimulation seen here can be generally applicable in a wide range of other excitable tissues and brain regions, overcoming several limitations of fixed electrodes which penetrate tissue and overcoming several limitations of other non-invasive stimulation methods in epilepsy, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

It has been characterized as a multidimensional concept, primarily comprising two dimensions: valence and arousal. Existing studies have demonstrated that emotional experience exerts a powerful impact on auditory processing in terms of valence. However, it has also been shown that while negative emotion can improve auditory perception in healthy subjects, patients with depression show deficits in auditory perception. We thus speculated that both arousal and valence jointly modulate auditory perception. To examine the emotion-driven effects on the auditory response, we induced positive, negative, and neutral emotional states in healthy subjects and collected auditory steady-state response (ASSR) evoked by a 40-Hz chirp sound. We calculated peak-to-peak amplitude (PPA) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) of evoked ASSRs and observed that the positive emotions significantly enhanced brain responses to auditory stimuli (p < 0.001), but that ASSRs in a negative state were not significantly enhanced compared with the neutral state. Subsequently, regression analysis showed a significant positive multiple linear relationship between the PPA and ratings of two emotional dimensions, indicating that arousal and valence jointly regulated the auditory cortex's synchronous oscillation, rather than the valence in isolation, offering the potential to clarify the conflicting results surrounding the role of negative emotions in auditory responses. Because depression is generally characterized by low arousal and low valence in actual life, whereas the negative emotion evoked under laboratory conditions is always with low valence but high arousal.

Methods: Seventeen TSC patients who underwent preoperative SEEG examination and resective epilepsy surgery were retrospectively enrolled. They were divided into two groups according to the seizure control at 1-year postoperative follow-up. The occurrence frequencies of FRs were automatically counted, and the FR rate was calculated. The high FR rate was defined as FR rate >= 0.5. According to different positions, the contacts' locations were divided into three groups: inner of the tubers, the junction region of the tubers, and out of the tubers. The influence factors of postoperative seizure freedom were also analyzed. Results: Twelve patients reached postoperative seizure freedom at 1-year follow-up. In total, FRs were found in 24.2% of the contacts and 67.1% of the tubers in all assessed patients. There were 47 high FR rate contacts localized in the junction region of the tubers, which was 62.7% of the 75 high FR rate contacts in total and was 8.4% of the total 561 contacts localized in the junction region of the tubers. Total removal of epileptogenic tubers and total resection of the high FR rate tubers/contacts were associated with postoperative seizure freedom (P < 0.05). Conclusion: FRs could be extensively detected in TSC patients using SEEG, and high FR rate contacts were mostly localized in the junction region of the epileptogenic tuber, which could aid in the localization of epileptogenic tubers.

Computational modelling of brain dynamics has already provided valuable insights into the neural circuitry involved in generating this state. Current theories for the origin of electroencephalographic (EEG) features in brain activity under GABAergic anaesthetic drugs have been proposed through modelling results. While much attention has been paid to describing alpha and delta oscillations, burst suppression, paradoxical excitation and the possibility of hysteresis during transitions to and from unconscious state, these models have focused only on the role of the thalamocortical system. Recent empirical findings suggest that anaesthetic drugs may act directly on the neural circuitry regulating sleep and wake states and circadian rhythms in the hypothalamus. Coupled with the common behavioural features found in physiological sleep and general anaesthesia, this evidence serves as a foundation for the 'shared circuits hypothesis' which proposes that anaesthetic-induced unconsciousness arises predominantly through modulation of the hypothalamic sleep-wake switch. This paper reviews the key findings from computational models describing brain states during the administration of anaesthetic drugs, with a focus on those enhancing GABAergic inhibition given their widespread use in practice and that almost all models of anaesthesia have focused on these drugs. We draw physiological and behavioural links between brain states during sleep and anaesthesia, and aim to highlight the importance of computational modelling in advancing our understanding of anaesthesia by considering sleep and circadian mechanisms in generating unconsciousness in future work.

In the social domain, we imagine other individuals while recalling our encounters with them or modelling alternative social interactions in future. Many studies using imaging and neurophysiological techniques have shown several similarities in brain activity between visual imagery and visual perception, and have identified frontoparietal, occipital and temporal neural components of visual imagery. However, the neural connectivity between these regions during visual imagery of socially relevant stimuli has not been studied. Here we used electroencephalography to investigate neural connectivity and its dynamics between frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal electrodes during visual imagery of faces. We found that voluntary visual imagery of faces is associated with long-range phase synchronisation in the gamma frequency range between frontoparietal electrode pairs and between occipitoparietal electrode pairs. In contrast, no effect of imagery was observed in the connectivity between occipitotemporal electrode pairs. Gamma range synchronisation between occipitoparietal electrode pairs predicted subjective ratings of the contour definition of imagined faces. Furthermore, we found that visual imagery of faces is associated with an increase of short-range frontal synchronisation in the theta frequency range, which temporally preceded the long-range increase in the gamma synchronisation. We speculate that the local frontal synchrony in the theta frequency range might be associated with an effortful top-down mnemonic reactivation of faces. In contrast, the long-range connectivity in the gamma frequency range along the fronto-parieto-occipital axis might be related to the endogenous binding and subjective clarity of facial visual features.

However, previous small studies have limited generalizability, leaving associations between OSA severity measures and spindle metrics uncertain. This study examined cross-sectional associations between OSA severity measures and spindle metrics among a large population-based sample of men. Methods Community-dwelling men with no previous OSA diagnosis underwent home-based polysomnography. All-night EEG (F4-M1) recordings were processed for artifacts and spindle events identified using previously validated algorithms. Spindle metrics of interest included frequency (Hz), amplitude (mu V-2), overall density (11-16 Hz), slow density (11-13 Hz), and fast density (13-16 Hz) (number/minute). Multivariable linear regression models controlling for demographic, biomedical, and behavioral confounders were used to examine cross-sectional associations between OSA severity measures and spindle metrics. Results In adjusted analyses, higher apnea-hypopnea index (AHI/h, as a continuous variable) and percentage total sleep time with oxygen saturation <90% (TST90) were associated with decreased slow spindle density (AHI, B = -0.003, p = 0.032; TST90, B = -0.004, p = 0.047) but increased frequency (AHI, B = 0.002, p = 0.009; TST90, B = 0.002, p = 0.043). Higher TST90 was also associated with greater spindle amplitude (N2 sleep, B = 0.04, p = 0.011; N3 sleep, B = 0.11, p < 0.001). Furthermore, higher arousal index was associated with greater spindle amplitude during N2 sleep (B = 0.31, p < 0.001) but decreased overall density (B = -1.27, p = 0.030) and fast density (B = -4.36, p = 0.028) during N3 sleep. Conclusions Among this large population-based sample of men, OSA severity measures were independently associated with spindle abnormalities. Further population studies are needed to determine associations between spindle metrics and functional outcomes.

Non-invasive quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) recordings can be used to analyze various factors in sports psychology. Method: In this context, sports-related psychological factors were used to estimate the performance of Thai professional female soccer players before a competition. The QEEG recordings of thirty-two players were recorded three times: twice before a competition (once a week) and a week after a competition. Four factors of sports psychology were estimated and observed: anxiety, perceptual response to an acute bout of brain activity, assertiveness, and brain central fatigue. A brain topographic map (absolute power) and brain connectivity (coherence and amplitude asymmetry) data were used to analyze sports-related psychological factors. These factors were measurable based on the brain activity of the athletes and could be used to evaluate their performance during competitions by using QEEG values. Results: Sports-related psychological performance was estimated by Pearson's correlation coefficients, which revealed that a quick perceptual response to an acute bout of brain activity could predict an athlete's performance during competition (r =.584, p =.000). Additionally, Spearman's correlation coefficients were used to estimate athletes performance. The results revealed a strong relationship (r(s) =.634, p =.000), which was derived from the summation of anxiety and perceptual response to an acute bout of brain activity. Conclusion: Consequently, the results of the present study can provide information to help staff coaches to choose the best performing players, representing an alternative method for accurately selecting key players in the competitive sports community.

Indeed, even if many core characteristics of sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy and non-rapid eye movement parasomnias have been clarified, some crucial points remain controversial, and the overlap of the behavioural patterns between these disorders represents a diagnostic challenge. In this work, we focused on segments of multichannel sleep electroencephalogram free from clinical episodes, from two groups of subjects affected by sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (N = 15) and non-rapid eye movement parasomnias (N = 16), respectively. We examined sleep stages N2 and N3 of the first part of the night (cycles 1 and 2), and assessed the existence of differences in the periodic and aperiodic components of the electroencephalogram power spectra between the two groups, using the Fitting Oscillations & One Over f (FOOOF) toolbox. A significant difference in the gamma frequency band was found, with an increased relative power in sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy subjects, during both N2 (p < .001) and N3 (p < .001), and a significant higher slope of the aperiodic component in non-rapid eye movement parasomnias, compared with sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy, during N3 (p = .012). We suggest that the relative power of the gamma band and the slope extracted from the aperiodic component of the electroencephalogram signal may be helpful to characterize differences between subjects affected by non-rapid eye movement parasomnias and those affected by sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy.

Pathophysiology has not yet been clarified and very little research has been performed using objective polysomnographic measures with inconsistent results. The main aim of our study was to find whether higher REM sleep fragmentation is consistent with the theory of state dissociation or whether signs of dissociation can be detected by spectral analysis. Methods: A total of 19 participants in the RISP group and 19 age- and gender-matched participants in the control group underwent two consecutive full-night video-polysomnography recordings with 19-channel electroencephalography. Apart from sleep macrostructure, other REM sleep characteristics such as REM sleep arousal index, percentage of wakefulness and stage shifts within REM sleep period were analyzed, as well as power spectral analysis during REM sleep. Results: No difference was found in the macrostructural parameters of REM sleep (percentage of REM sleep and REM latency). Similarly, no significant difference was detected in REM sleep fragmentation (assessed by REM sleep arousal index, percentage of wakefulness and stage shifts within REM sleep). Power spectral analysis showed higher bifrontal beta activity in the RISP group during REM sleep. Conclusions: The results showed an underlying persistent trait of higher cortical activity that may predispose patients with sleep paralysis to be more likely to experience recurrent episodes, without any apparent macrostructural features including higher REM sleep fragmentation.

To date, it remains unclear whether these deficits arise from dysfunctional linguistic knowledge, or dysfunctional predictions derived from the linguistic context. Alternatively, the deficits could be a result of dysfunctional neural tracking of auditory information resulting in decreased auditory information fidelity and even distorted information. Here, we discuss possible ways for clinical neuroscientists to employ neural tracking methodology to independently characterize deficiencies on the auditory-sensory and abstract linguistic levels. This might lead to a mechanistic understanding of the deficits underlying language related disorder(s) in schizophrenia. We propose to combine naturalistic stimulation, measures of speech-brain synchronization, and computational modeling of abstract linguistic knowledge and predictions. These independent but likely interacting assessments may be exploited for an objective and differential diagnosis of schizophrenia, as well as a better understanding of the disorder on the functional level-illustrating the potential of neural tracking methodology as translational tool in a range of psychotic populations.

Chronic, non-malignant disorders of the brain are often coupled to pathological neuronal activity patterns. In addition to the characteristic behavioral symptoms, these disturbances are giving rise to both transient and persistent changes of various brain rhythms. Increasing evidence support the causal role of these "oscillopathies" in the phenotypic emergence of the disease symptoms, identifying neuronal network oscillations as potential therapeutic targets. While the kinetics of pharmacological therapy is not suitable to compensate the disease related fine-scale disturbances of network oscillations, external biophysical modalities (e.g., electrical stimulation) can alter spike timing in a temporally precise manner. These perturbations can warp rhythmic oscillatory patterns via resonance or entrainment. Properly timed phasic stimuli can even switch between the stable states of networks acting as multistable oscillators, substantially changing the emergent oscillatory patterns. Novel transcranial electric stimulation (TES) approaches offer more reliable neuronal control by allowing higher intensities with tolerable side-effect profiles. This precise temporal steerability combined with the non- or minimally invasive nature of these novel TES interventions make them promising therapeutic candidates for functional disorders of the brain. Here we review the key experimental findings and theoretical background concerning various pathological aspects of neuronal network activity leading to the generation of epileptic seizures. The conceptual and practical state of the art of temporally targeted brain stimulation is discussed focusing on the prevention and early termination of epileptic seizures.

However, it has also been regarded as a toxic and aversive substance to several aquatic organisms, including fish. This study sought to assess the eugenol-induced behavioural alterations and its seizurogenic potential to fish. Moreover, a distinctive methodology for an in vivo evaluation of the brain activity was also presented. Prior to the evaluation of eugenol-induced responses, fish were exposed to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), to characterize any seizure-like patterns. Antagonizing responses to PTZ were assessed in fish receiving diazepam (BDZ) and subsequently exposed to PTZ. Tambaqui fish juveniles, Colossoma macropomum (15.8 +/- 2.8 g) were used as models and assayed as follows: (i) fish exposed to PTZ (15 mM) and (ii) fish receiving a dose of BDZ (10 mg Kg(-1)) and later exposed to PTZ (15 mM) (BDZ-PTZ group). Thereafter, fish were evaluated throughout (iii) eugenol exposure at 65 mu L L-1 (ethanolic solution) and recovery. Control fish and a vehicle control group (ethanol at 585 mu L L-1) were also established. PTZ baths elicited body immobilization preceded by hyperactivity in a stereotyped seizure-like behaviour with increased EEG wave amplitude and frequency. PTZ effects in the brain were attenuated by a pre-administration of BDZ. Upon eugenol exposure, tambaqui had an intense neuronal excitability, showing a clonus-like seizure behaviour, also corroborated by the EEG patterns, which were consistent with a seizure-like response. Responses of eugenol-exposed fish resembled those of the PZT-exposed animals, with epileptiform discharges. EMG was in line with the EEG modulation, showing increased tracing oscillations and higher mean amplitudes in PTZ-exposed fish whereas in BDZ-PTZ group muscle contraction was less frequent and powerful. Fish exposed to eugenol showed initially some muscle activity followed by a loss of muscle tonus over time. In summary, our results showed that upon eugenol exposure, although a time-dependent body immobilization was attained, fish presented an intense neuronal excitability comparable to that evoked by PTZ. Eugenol failed to promote depression of the CNS and therefore may be not suitable to be used for general anaesthesia of C. macropomum. As eugenol could be implicated in seizurogenesis and be potentially toxic to the fish brain, protocols suggesting the broad use of eugenol for short-term anaesthesia or euthanasia of fish should be carefully revised, as it raises important concerns in terms of ethics and fish welfare.

The dorsal attention network (DAN) and the ventral attention network (VAN) are known to support visual attention, but the influences of ocular dominance on the attention networks are unclear. We aimed to explore how visual cortical asymmetry of the attention networks correlate with neurophysiological oscillation and connectivity markers of attentional processes. METHODS. An oddball task with concentric circle stimuli of three different sizes (i.e., spot size of 5 degrees, 20 degrees, or 30 degrees of visual angle) was used to vary task difficulty. Event-related oscillations and interareal communication were tested with an electroencephalogram-based visual evoked components as a function of ocular dominance in 30 healthy subjects. RESULTS. Accuracy rates were higher in the dominant eyes compared with the nondominant eyes. Compared with the nondominant eyes, the dominant eyes had higher theta, low-alpha, and low-beta powers and lower high-alpha powers within the nodes of VAN and DAN. Furthermore, visual information processed by the dominant and nondominant eye had different fates, that is, the dominant eyes mainly relied on theta and low-alpha connectivity within both the VAN and the DAN, whereas the nondominant eyes mainly relied on theta connectivity within the VAN and high-alpha connectivity within the DAN. The difference in accuracy rate between the two eyes was correlated with the low-alpha oscillations in the anterior DAN area and low-alpha connectivity of the left DAN. CONCLUSIONS. The ocular dominance processing and interareal communication reveal a cortical asymmetry underlying attention, and this reflects a two-way modulatory mechanism within attention networks in the human brain.

The reduced level of independence and mobility of a person can affect their quality of life. Previous research used static bicycles or mirrors for stroke therapy. This work combined both static bicycle and mirror therapy for post-stroke patients. This study aimed to find quantitative EEG parameters that can be used to characterize neurological change. The expected decrease in the average relative power of delta and theta then increased alpha and beta. Twelve post-stroke patients and twelve healthy subjects were given 2 tasks: imaginary (motor imagery) and action (motor execution). The electrodes were placed on 8 points with 10-20 localization principle rules. Data were analyzed and tested using linear regression and paired t. The result showed that static bicycle and mirror combination therapy affects a subject group of right stroke patients than a subject group of left stroke patients. When given imaginary session (motor imagery), in relative power of delta-band frequency of right stroke patients decreased by -18.65 +/- 4.9% (p = 0.0001) and action session (motor execution) by -11.23 +/- 6.1% (p = 0.0035), while average relative power of theta frequency band only decreased significantly by -6.03 +/- 6.4% (p = 0.0429) an imaginary session. Then, this therapy also succeeded in enhancement relative power of alpha frequency band when given imaginary session, i.e 5.45 +/- 4.2% (p = 0.0161) and action session, i.e 6.92 +/- 4.6% (p = 0.0024). Furthermore, the relative power of the beta frequency band also increased when given an imaginary session by 19.23 +/- 9.1% (p = 0.0026) and action session by 7.29 +/- 7.5% (p = 0.0194). In conclusion, relative power, amplitude, and time (latency) of P300 and C3 to C4 ratio indicated improved health data, especially for right stroke patient subjects during therapy.

In a repeated measures observational study, we ascertained the degree of interbrain synchrony during music therapy in 10 child-parent dyads, where the children were non-speaking and living with severe motor impairments. Interbrain synchrony was quantified via measurements of spectral coherence and Granger causality between child and parent electroencephalographic (EEG) signals collected during ten 15-min music therapy sessions per dyad, where parents were present as non-participating, covert observers. Using cluster-based permutation tests, we found significant child-parent interbrain synchrony, manifesting most prominently across dyads in frontal brain regions within beta and low gamma frequencies. Specifically, significant dyadic coherence was observed contra-laterally, between child frontal right and parental frontal left regions at beta and lower gamma bands in empathy-related brain areas. Furthermore, significant Granger influences were detected bidirectionally (from child to parent and vice versa) in the same frequency bands. In all dyads, significant increases in session-specific coherence and Granger influences were observed over the time course of a music therapy session. The observed interbrain synchrony suggests a cognitive-emotional coupling during music therapy between child and parent that is responsive to change. These findings encourage further study of the socio-empathic capacity and interpersonal relationships formed between caregivers and non-speaking children with severe physical impairments.

While these two cognitive capabilities are thought to have two distinct neural origins, with neocortical alpha/beta oscillations supporting information representation and hippocampal theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling supporting mnemonic binding, evidence for a dissociation between these two neural markers is conspicuously absent. To address this, seventeen human participants completed an associative memory task that first involved processing information about three sequentially-presented stimuli, and then binding these stimuli together into a coherent memory trace, all the while undergoing MEG recordings. We found that decreases in neocortical alpha/beta power during sequence perception, but not mnemonic binding, correlated with enhanced memory performance. Hippocampal theta/gamma phase-amplitude coupling, however, showed the opposite pattern; increases during mnemonic binding (but not sequence perception) correlated with enhanced memory performance. These results demonstrate that memory-related decreases in neocortical alpha/beta power and memory-related increases in hippocampal theta/gamma phase-amplitude coupling arise at distinct stages of the memory formation process. We speculate that this temporal dissociation reflects a functional dissociation in which neocortical alpha/beta oscillations could support the processing of incoming information relevant to the memory, while hippocampal theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling could support the binding of this information into a coherent memory trace.

However, the power of pre-stimulus neural oscillations and strength of post-stimulus cortical activity that lead to conscious perception have rarely been examined in individual cortical areas. This is because most previous electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG and MEG, respectively) studies involved scalp- and sensor-level analyses. Therefore, we recorded MEG during a continuous NT somatosensory stimulus detection task and applied the reconstructed source data in order to identify cortical areas where the post-stimulus cortical activity and pre-stimulus alpha oscillation predict the conscious perception of NT somatosensory stimuli. We found that the somatosensory hierarchical processing areas, prefrontal areas and cortical areas belonging to the default mode network showed stronger cortical activity for consciously perceived trials in the post-stimulus period, but the cortical activity in primary somatosensory area (SI) is independent of conscious perception during the early stage of NT stimulus processing. In addition, we revealed that the pre-stimulus alpha oscillation only in SI is predictive of conscious perception. These findings suggest that the bottom-up stream of somatosensory information flow following SI and pre-stimulus alpha activity fluctuation in SI as a top-down modulation are crucial constituents of conscious perception.

Excellent results on seizures have been reported following unilateral RFTC performed on ictal high-frequency-discharge, fast-rhythm, and low-voltage initiation areas. Complex cases (GMNH plus other malformations of cortical development) do not have good outcomes with RFTC. Yet, there is little research studying the effect of high-frequency oscillation in locating epileptogenic zones for thermocoagulation on unilateral, DRE with bilateral GMNH. We present a case of DRE with bilateral GMNH, treated using RFTC on unilateral GMNH and the overlying cortex, guided by stereotactic electroencephalogram (SEGG), and followed up for 69 months. Twenty-four-hour EGG recordings, seizure frequency, post-RFTC MRI, and neuropsychological tests were performed once yearly. To date, this patient is seizure-free, the electroencephalogram is normal, neuropsychological problems have not been found, and the trace of RFTC has been clearly identified on MRI. His dosage of antiepileptic medication has, furthermore, been significantly reduced. It is concluded that RFTC on unilateral DRE with bilateral GMNH may achieve good long-term effects, lasting up to, and perhaps longer than, 69 months. Ictal high-frequency oscillation (fast ripple) inside the heterotopia and the overlying cortex may be the key to this successful effect.

J	Riddle, J; McFerren, A; Frohlich, F				Riddle, Justin; McFerren, Amber; Frohlich, Flavio			Causal role of cross-frequency coupling in distinct components of cognitive control	PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Review						Cross-frequency coupling; Cognitive control; Phase-amplitude coupling; EEG; Transcranial alternating current stimulation; Prefrontal cortex	OSCILLATORY DYNAMICS; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; BETA OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; TOP-DOWN; THETA; SYNCHRONIZATION; MODULATION; ATTENTION	Cognitive control is the capacity to guide motor and perceptual systems towards abstract goals. High-frequency neural oscillations related to motor activity in the beta band (13-30 Hz) and to visual processing in the gamma band (>30 Hz) are known to be modulated by cognitive control signals. One proposed mechanism for cognitive control is via cross-frequency coupling whereby low frequency network oscillations in prefrontal cortex (delta from 2-3 Hz and theta from 4-8 Hz) guide the expression of motor-related activity in action planning and guide perception-related activity in memory access. However, there is no causal evidence for cross-frequency coupling in these dissociable components of cognitive control. To address this important gap in knowledge, we delivered cross-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (CF-tACS) during performance of a task that manipulated cognitive control demands along two dimensions: the abstraction of the rules of the task (nested levels of action selection) that increased delta-beta coupling and the number of rules (set-size held in memory) that increased theta-gamma coupling. As hypothesized, we found that CF-tACS increased the targeted phaseamplitude coupling and modulated task performance of the associated cognitive control component. These findings provide causal evidence that prefrontal cortex orchestrates different components of cognitive control via two different cross-frequency coupling modalities.

Development of motion speed perception from infancy to early adulthood: a high-density EEG study of simulated forward motion through optic flow	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Motion speed perception; Optic flow; High-density EEG; Visual evoked potential (VEP); Temporal spectral evolution (TSE); Lifespan visual motion perception	FUNCTIONAL BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; RANDOM VISUAL-MOTION; CORTICAL RESPONSES; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE; SYNCHRONIZATION ERS; FULL-TERM; SPECIALIZATION; SENSITIVITY; DESYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENTS	This study investigated evoked and oscillatory brain activity in response to forward visual motion at three different ecologically valid speeds, simulated through an optic flow pattern consisting of a virtual road with moving poles at either side of it. Participants were prelocomotor infants at 4-5 months, crawling infants at 9-11 months, primary school children at 6 years, adolescents at 12 years, and young adults. N2 latencies for motion decreased significantly with age from around 400 ms in prelocomotor infants to 325 ms in crawling infants, and from 300 and 275 ms in 6- and 12-year-olds, respectively, to 250 ms in adults. Infants at 4-5 months displayed the longest latencies and appeared unable to differentiate between motion speeds. In contrast, crawling infants at 9-11 months and 6-year-old children differentiated between low, medium and high speeds, with shortest latency for low speed. Adolescents and adults displayed similar short latencies for the three motion speeds, indicating that they perceived them as equally easy to detect. Time-frequency analyses indicated that with increasing age, participants showed a progression from low- to high-frequency desynchronized oscillatory brain activity in response to visual motion. The developmental differences in motion speed perception are interpreted in terms of a combination of neurobiological development and increased experience with self-produced locomotion. Our findings suggest that motion speed perception is not fully developed until adolescence, which has implications for children's road traffic safety.

Network neuroscience makes substantial efforts to manipulate these challenges and provide real answers. For the last decade, researchers have been modelling brain structure and function via a graph or network that comprises brain regions that are either anatomically connected via tracts or functionally via a more extensive repertoire of functional associations. Network neuroscience is a relatively new multidisciplinary scientific avenue of the study of complex systems by pursuing novel ways to analyze, map, store and model the essential elements and their interactions in complex neurobiological systems, particularly the human brain, the most complex system in nature. Due to a rapid expansion of neuroimaging data sets' size and complexity, it is essential to propose and adopt new empirical tools to track dynamic patterns between neurons and brain areas and create comprehensive maps. In recent years, there is a rapid growth of scientific interest in moving functional neuroimaging analysis beyond simplified group or time-averaged approaches and sophisticated algorithms that can capture the time-varying properties of functional connectivity. We describe algorithms and network metrics that can capture the dynamic evolution of functional connectivity under this perspective. We adopt the word 'chronnectome' (integration of the Greek word 'Chronos', which means time, and connectome) to describe this specific branch of network neuroscience that explores how mutually informed brain activity correlates across time and brain space in a functional way. We also describe how good temporal mining of temporally evolved dynamic functional networks could give rise to the detection of specific brain states over which our brain evolved. This characteristic supports our complex human mind. The temporal evolution of these brain states and well-known network metrics could give rise to new analytic trends. Functional brain networks could also increase the multi-faced nature of the dynamic networks revealing complementary information. Finally, we describe a python module () which accompanies this article and contains a collection of dynamic complex network analytics and measures and demonstrates its great promise for the study of a healthy subject's repeated fMRI scans.

In this review, we compared the current state of knowledge related to the mechanisms of tACS and NFB and their effects on electroencephalogram (EEG) activity (online period/stimulation period) and on aftereffects (offline period/post/stimulation period), including the duration of their persistence and potential behavioral benefits. Since alpha bandwidth has been broadly studied in NFB and in tACS research, the studies of NFB and tACS in modulating alpha bandwidth were selected for comparing the online and offline effects of these two neuromodulation techniques. The factors responsible for variability in the responsiveness of the modulated EEG activity by tACS and NFB were analyzed and compared too. Based on the current literature related to tACS and NFB, it can be concluded that tACS and NFB differ a lot in the mechanisms responsible for their effects on an online EEG activity but they possibly share the common universal mechanisms responsible for the induction of aftereffects in the targeted stimulated EEG band, namely Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity. Many studies of both neuromodulation techniques report the aftereffects connected to the behavioral benefits. The duration of persistence of aftereffects for NFB and tACS is comparable. In relation to the factors influencing responsiveness to tACS and NFB, significantly more types of factors were analyzed in the NFB studies compared to the tACS studies. Several common factors for both tACS and NFB have been already investigated. Based on these outcomes, we propose several new research directions regarding tACS and NFB.

One candidate mechanism is a modulation of g-ami-nobutyric acid (GABA) transmission through tVNS. Two recent behavioral studies suggest that such a GABAergic effect might occur in a lateralized fashion, i.e., the GABA modulation might be stronger in the left than in the right brain hemisphere after tVNS applied to the left ear. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we tested for GABA-associated modulations in resting and event-related brain oscillations and for a lateralization of those effects in a sample of 41 healthy young adults. Our data provide substantial evidence against all hypotheses, i.e., we neither find effects of tVNS on oscillatory power nor a lateralization of effects. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Currently, standard signal staging of brain electrical activity relies on supervised processes. In this work, we propose an unsupervised data segmentation method based on time series complexity and in the cluster-weighted representation. Receiver operating characteristic curves for predicting transitions on simulated and biological datasets suggest that our model distinguishes accordingly between true and false positive transitions. The ad-vantages revealed were as follows: our method was suited for short-length signals; it was adapted to detect changes of rhythmic oscillations; and it showed no restrictive modeling conditions. Moreover, considering a calibration procedure, this method proved to be suitable for different data samples with a single threshold. This hybrid approach saves time and increases the reliability of post data analysis.

Fifteen patients with a non-affective FEP and 13 healthy controls underwent an active involuntary attention task along with an EEG acquisition. Time-frequency representations of power, phase locking, and fronto-parietal connectivity were calculated. The P3a event-related potential was extracted as well. Compared to controls, the FEP group showed reduced theta phase-locking and fronto-parietal connectivity evoked by deviant stimuli. Also, the P3a amplitude was significantly reduced. Moreover, reduced theta connectivity was associated with more severe negative symptoms within the FEP group. Reduced activity (phase-locking and connectivity) of novelty-related theta oscillations, along with P3a reduction, may represent a failure to synchronize large-scale neural populations closely related to fronto-parietal attentional networks, and might be explored as a potential biomarker of disease severity in patients with emerging psychosis, given its association with negative symptoms.

Different decisions lead to different ranges of feedback, which in turn influences subsequent decisions. However, the mechanism underlying the continuous decision-feedback process is still left unveiled. To fulfill this gap, we applied the hidden Markov model (HMM) to the gambling electroencephalogram (EEG) data to characterize the dynamics of this process. Furthermore, we explored the differences between distinct decision responses (i.e. choose large or small bets) or distinct feedback (i.e. win or loss outcomes) in corresponding phases. We demonstrated that the processing stages in decision-feedback process including strategy adjustment and visual information processing can be characterized by distinct brain networks. Moreover, time-varying networks showed, after decision response, large bet recruited more resources from right frontal and right center cortices while small bet was more related to the activation of the left frontal lobe. Concerning feedback, networks of win feedback showed a strong right frontal and right center pattern, while an information flow originating from the left frontal lobe to the middle frontal lobe was observed in loss feedback. Taken together, these findings shed light on general principles of natural decision-feedback and may contribute to the design of biologically inspired, participant-independent decision-feedback systems.

J	Orczyk, JJ; Kajikawa, Y				Orczyk, John J.; Kajikawa, Yoshinao			Magnifying Traveling Waves on the Scalp	BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY			English	Article						Traveling wave; Electroencephalography; Electrocorticography; Current source; Volume conduction	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; VISUAL-CORTEX; DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; PROPAGATION	Traveling waves appear in various signals that measure neuronal activity. Some signals measured in animals have singles-cell resolution and directly point to neuronal activity. In those cases, activation of distributed neurons forms a wave front, and the front propagates across the cortical surface. Other signals are variants of neuroelectric potentials, i.e. electroencephalography, electrocorticography and field potentials. Instead of having fine spatial resolution, these signals reflect the activity of neuronal populations via volume conduction (VC). Sources of traveling waves in neuroelectric potentials have not been well addressed so far. As animal studies show propagating activation of neurons that spread in measured areas, it is often considered that neuronal activations during scalp waves have similar trajectories of activation, spreading like scalp waves. However, traveling waves on the scalp differ from those found directly on the cortical surface in several dimensions: traveling velocity, traveling distance and areal size occupied by single polarity. We describe that the simplest sources can produce scalp waves with perceived spatial dimensions which are actually a magnification of neuronal activity emanating from local sources due to VC. This viewpoint is not a rigorous proof of our magnification concept. However, we suggest the possibility that the actual dimensions of neuronal activity producing traveling waves is not as large as the dimension of the traveling waves.

J	Garcia, JP; Dulla, CG				Garcia, Jacqueline P.; Dulla, Chris G.			Oops! ... Glutamate Did it Again	EPILEPSY CURRENTS			English	Editorial Material							TEMPORAL-LOBE; TRANSPORTERS; HIPPOCAMPUS	Astrocytic glutamate transporters are crucial for glutamate homeostasis in the brain, and dysregulation of these transporters can contribute to the development of epilepsy. Glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) is responsible for the majority of glutamate uptake in the dorsal forebrain and has been shown to be reduced at epileptic foci in patients and preclinical models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Current antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) work primarily by targeting neurons directly through suppression of excitatory neurotransmission or enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmission, which can lead to both behavioral and psychiatric side effects. This study investigates the therapeutic capacity of astrocyte-specific AAV-mediated GLT-1 expression in the intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) model of TLE. In this study, we used Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and long-term-video EEG monitoring to demonstrate that cell-type-specific upregulation of GLT-1 in astrocytes is neuroprotective at early time points during epileptogenesis, reduces seizure frequency and total time spent in seizures, and eliminates large behavioral seizures in the IHKA model of epilepsy. Our findings suggest that targeting glutamate uptake is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of epilepsy.

This study examined the effect of wind turbine noise compared with road traffic noise on sleep using quantitative electroencephalogram power spectral analysis. Twenty-three participants were exposed to 3-min samples of wind turbine noise and road traffic noise at three sound pressure levels (33, 38 and 43 dBA) in randomised order during established sleep. Acute (0-30 s) and more sustained (30-180 s) effects of noise presentations during N2 and N3 sleep were examined using spectral analysis of changes in electroencephalogram power frequency ranges across time in 5-s intervals. Both noise types produced time- and sound pressure level-dependent increases in electroencephalogram power, but with significant noise type by sound pressure level interactions in beta, alpha, theta and delta frequency bands (all p < 0.05). Wind turbine noise showed significantly lower delta, theta and beta activity immediately following noise onset compared with road traffic noise (all p < 0.05). However, alpha activity was higher for wind turbine noise played at lower sound pressure levels (33 dBA [p = 0.001] and 38 dBA [p = 0.003]) compared with traffic noise during N2 sleep. These findings support that spectral analyses show subtle effects of noise on sleep and that electroencephalogram changes following wind turbine noise and road traffic noise onset differ depending on sound pressure levels; however, these effects were mostly transient and had little impact on conventionally scored sleep. Further studies are needed to establish if electroencephalogram changes associated with modest environmental noise exposures have significant impacts on sleep quality and next-day functioning.

Enhanced arm swing improves Parkinsonian gait with EEG power modulations resembling healthy gait	PARKINSONISM & RELATED DISORDERS			English	Article						Arm swing; Supplementary motor area; Gait; EEG	SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; BASAL GANGLIA; WALKING; DISEASE; PARTICIPATION; OSCILLATIONS	Background: The supplementary motor area (SMA) is implicated in stereotypic multi-limb movements such as walking with arm swing. Gait difficulties in Parkinson's Disease (PD) include reduced arm swing, which is associated with reduced SMA activity. Objective: To test whether enhanced arm swing improves Parkinsonian gait and explore the role of the SMA in such an improvement. Methods: Cortical activity and gait characteristics were assessed by ambulant EEG, accelerometers and video recordings in 27 PD patients with self-reported gait difficulties and 35 healthy participants when walking normally. Within these two groups, 19 PD patients additionally walked with enhanced arm swing and 30 healthy participants walked without arm swing. Power changes across the EEG frequency spectrum were assessed by Event Related Spectral Perturbation analysis of recordings from Fz over the putative SMA and gait analysis was performed. Results: Baseline PD gait, characterized by reduced arm swing among other features, exhibited reduced withinstep Event Related Desynchronization (ERD)/Synchronization (ERS) alternation (Fz; 20-50Hz), accompanied by a reduced step length and walking speed. All became similar to normal gait when patients walked with enhanced arm swing. When healthy controls walked without arm swing, their alternating ERD-ERS pattern decreased, mimicking baseline PD gait. Conclusion: Enhanced arm swing may serve as a driving force to overcome impaired gait control in PD patients by restoring reduced ERD-ERS alternation over the putative SMA. Accompanied by increased step length and walking speed, this provides a neural underpinning of arm swing as an effective rehabilitation concept for improving Parkinsonian gait.

Emotion and Brain Oscillations: High Arousal is Associated with Decreases in Alpha- and Lower Beta-Band Power	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						attention; arousal; EEG; emotion; ERD	RESPONSES	The study of brain oscillations associated with emotional picture processing has revealed conflicting findings. Although many studies observed a decrease in power in the alpha- and lower beta band, some studies observed an increase. Accordingly, the main aim of the present research series was to further elucidate whether emotional stimulus processing is related to an increase or decrease in alpha/beta power. In Study 1, participants (N= 16) viewed briefly presented (150 ms) high-arousing erotic and low-arousing people pictures. Picture presentation included a passive viewing condition and an active picture categorization task. Study 2 (N= 16) replicated Study 1 with negative valence stimuli (mutilations). In Study 3 (N = 18), stimulus materials of Study 1 and 2 were used. The main finding is that high-arousing pictures (erotica and mutilations) are associated with a decrease of power in the alpha/beta band across studies and task conditions. The effect peaked in occipitoparietal sensors between 400 and 800 ms after stimulus onset. Furthermore, a late (>1000 ms) alpha/beta power increase to mutilation pictures was observed, possibly reflecting top-down inhibitory control processes. Overall, these findings suggest that brain oscillations in the alpha/beta-band may serve as a useful measure of emotional stimulus processing.

Infra-slow oscillations of the electroencephalograms potential and low-frequency components (0.04-0.15 Hz) of the interbeat intervals signal where analyzed using a sensitive method for identifying the directional coupling. The technique, based on modeling the dynamics of instantaneous phases of oscillations, made it possible to reveal the presence and quantify the directional couplings between the structures of the brain and the autonomic control of the heart rate variability. It was shown that the coupling coefficients in the frequency band of 0.04-0.15 Hz (associated mainly with sympathetic control of blood circulation), on average, decrease with falling asleep. We have also shown the asymmetry of coupling. At the same time, stronger connections were revealed in the direction from the autonomic control of the heart rate variability to the brain structures than in the opposite direction. It has been shown that the strength of such couplings decreases with increasing of sleep depth.

In so doing, this work invokes a novel idea of using delay-embedding-based nonlinear principal component analysis (DE-NLPCA) to generate synthetic time series. This idea was inspired by extracting topological representation of input space by unsupervised learning which can benefits augmentation of biomedical time series, tending to be high dimensional and morphologically complex. Different types of time series with different temporal complexity were used for evaluation. One of them was an open dataset associated with the activities of daily living, being collected from 10 healthy participants performing 186 ADL-related instances of activity while wearing 9-axis Inertial Measurement Units. Another dataset was an experimental data from healthy-brain patients undergoing operation (N = 20), being recorded from the BrainStatus device with 10 EEG channels. Considering leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, increase of up to 14.72% in classification performance (in terms of accuracy) was observed across anesthesia dataset when DE-NLPCA-based augmented data was introduced during training. It was also found that classification performance was more improved when DE-NLPCA-based technique were introduced compared to augmentation using conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). This DE-NLPCA-based approach was also shown to be able to recover time-frequency characteristics of contaminated signals.

Romantic love affects emotional processing of love-unrelated stimuli: An EEG/ERP study using a love induction task	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Romantic love; Love Induction Task; Event-related potentials; EEG alpha band	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ERP EVIDENCE; NEURAL BASIS; ASYMMETRY; ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; COVARIATION; REAPPRAISAL; PERCEPTION	The aim of the present study was to investigate (a) the neural correlates of a love induction task (LIT) including listening to love-related songs and thinking about the romantic relationship, and (b) the effects of romantic love on the emotional processing of love-unrelated stimuli during a passive viewing task. The EEG was recorded in two groups of university students: people in love (Love Group, LG, N = 22, 19 F) and people not in love (Control Group, CG, N = 20, 15 F). The LIT induced higher pleasantness and arousal in the LG than in the CG, as well as higher alpha activity in occipital-right electrodes, suggesting active mental imagery and internal focused attention. During the picture viewing task, the LG displayed larger N1 amplitudes than the CG in response to unpleasant pictures, and lower amplitudes of the late positive potential to both pleasant and unpleasant pictures at frontal sites. Overall, these results suggest an early attentional modulation of the neural responses to unpleasant, mood-incongruent cues, followed by an implicit emotional down-regulation of arousing stimuli, which might have important implications for everyday attitudes and behaviors.

Here we investigated how riding a motorcycle, an attention-demanding physical activity, affects sensory processing. To do so, we implemented the passive auditory oddball paradigm and measured the EEG response of participants as they rode a motorcycle, drove a car, and sat at rest. Specifically, we measured the N1 and mismatch negativity to auditory tones, as well as alpha power during periods of no tones. We investigated whether riding and driving modulated non-CNS metrics including heart rate and concentrations of the hormones epinephrine, cortisol, DHEA-S, and testosterone. While participants were riding, we found a decrease in N1 amplitude, increase in mismatch negativity, and decrease in relative alpha power, together suggesting enhancement of sensory processing and visual attention. Riding increased epinephrine levels, increased heart rate, and decreased the ratio of cortisol to DHEA-S. Together, these results suggest that riding increases focus, heightens the brain's passive monitoring of changes in the sensory environment, and alters HPA axis response. More generally, our findings suggest that selective attention and sensory monitoring seem to be separable neural processes.

Resting posterior alpha power and adolescent major depressive disorder	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Alpha asymmetry; Major depression; Adolescence; Rumination; Self-criticism; Anhedonia; Suicidal ideation; Suicidal behaviors	ANTERIOR CINGULATE ACTIVITY; FRONTAL EEG ASYMMETRY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; SELF-CRITICISM; LOW-RISK; ANXIETY; PATTERNS; COMORBIDITY; RELIABILITY; SEVERITY	For several decades, resting electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha oscillations have been used to characterize neurophysiological alterations related to major depressive disorder. Prior research has generally focused on frontal alpha power and asymmetry despite resting alpha being maximal over posterior electrode sites. Research in depressed adults has shown evidence of hemispheric asymmetry for posterior alpha power, however, the resting posterior alpha-depression link among adolescents remains unclear. To clarify the role of posterior alpha among depressed adolescents, the current study acquired eyes-closed 128-channel resting EEG data from 13 to 18 year-old depressed (n = 31) and healthy (n = 35) female adolescents. Results indicated a significant group by hemisphere interaction, as depressed adolescents exhibited significantly larger posterior alpha (i.e., lower brain activity) over the right versus left hemisphere, whereas healthy adolescents showed no hemispheric differences. Relatively greater alpha over the right versus left hemisphere correlated with depression symptoms, anhedonia symptoms, rumination, and self-criticism. Further, depressed adolescents had reduced overall posterior alpha compared to healthy youth; though, no associations with symptoms and related traits emerged. Resting posterior alpha may be a promising neurophysiological index of adolescent depression, and more broadly, may relate to risk factors characterized by enhanced perseveration.

The human brain provides a monitoring system that constantly controls and adjusts our actions according to our surroundings. However, when our brain's predictions about a planned action do not match the sensory inputs resulting from that action, cognitive conflict occurs. Much is known about cognitive conflict in 1D/2D environments; however, less is known about the role of movement characteristics associated with cognitive conflict in 3D environment. Hence, we devised an object selection task in a virtual reality (VR) environment to test how the velocity of hand movements impacts human brain responses. From a series of analyses of EEG recordings synchronized with motion capture, we found that the velocity of the participants' hand movements modulated the brain's response to proprioceptive feedback during the task and induced a prediction error negativity (PEN). Additionally, the PEN originates in the anterior cingulate cortex and is itself modulated by the ballistic phase of the hand's movement. These findings suggest that velocity is an essential component of integrating hand movements with visual and proprioceptive information during interactions with real and virtual objects.

Diazepam effects on local cortical neural activity during sleep in mice	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Diazepam; Benzodiazepines; Sleep; Electroencephalogram; Local field potentials; Multiunit activity	SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; EEG POWER SPECTRA; BENZODIAZEPINE USE; CHRONIC INSOMNIA; PHARMACOLOGICAL-TREATMENT; REGIONAL DIFFERENCES; ANXIETY DISORDERS; REM-SLEEP; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; METAANALYSIS	GABA-ergic neurotransmission plays a key role in sleep regulatory mechanisms and in brain oscillations during sleep. Benzodiazepines such as diazepam are known to induce sedation and promote sleep, however, EEG spectral power in slow frequencies is typically reduced after the administration of benzodiazepines or similar compounds. EEG slow waves arise from a synchronous alternation between periods of cortical network activity (ON) and silence (OFF), and represent a sensitive marker of preceding sleep-wake history. Yet it remains unclear how benzodiazepines act on cortical neural activity during sleep. To address this, we obtained chronic recordings of local field potentials and multiunit activity (MUA) from deep cortical layers of the primary motor cortex in freely behaving mice after diazepam injection. We found that the amplitude of individual LFP slow waves was significantly reduced after diazepam injection and was accompanied by a lower incidence and duration of the corresponding neuronal OFF periods. Further investigation suggested that this is due to a disruption in the synchronisation of cortical neurons. Our data suggest that the state of global sleep and local cortical synchrony can be dissociated, and that the brain state induced by benzodiazepines is qualitatively different from spontaneous physiological sleep.

However, the relationship between these indices, and their contribution to the subjective experience of attention, remains largely unknown. Participants performed a sustained (10-30 s) attention task in which rare (10%) targets were detected within continuous tactile stimulation (16 Hz). Trials were followed by attention ratings on an 8-point visual scale. Attention ratings correlated negatively with contralateral somatosensory alpha power and positively with pupil diameter. The effect of pupil diameter on attention ratings extended into the following trial, reflecting a sustained aspect of attention related to vigilance. The effect of alpha power did not carry over to the next trial and furthermore mediated the association between pupil diameter and attention ratings. Variations in steady-state amplitude reflected stimulus processing under the influence of alpha oscillations but were only weakly related to subjective ratings of attention. Together, our results show that both alpha power and pupil diameter are reflected in the subjective experience of attention, albeit on different time spans, while continuous stimulus processing might not contribute to the experience of attention.

However, full-band DC recordings may be limited by the amplifier's dynamic input range and the loss of small amplitude high-frequency signals. Recently, Neuralynx has proposed full-band recordings with inverse filtering for signal reconstruction based on hybrid AC/DC-divider RRC filters that enable only partial suppression of DC signals. However, the quality of signal reconstruction for biological signals has not yet been assessed. Here, we propose a novel digital inverse filter based on a mathematical model describing RRC filter properties, which provides high computational accuracy and versatility. Second, we propose procedures for the evaluation of the inverse filter coefficients, adapted for each recording channel to minimize the error caused by the deviation of the real values of the RRC filter elements from their nominal values. We demonstrate that this approach enables near 99% reconstruction quality of high-potassium-induced cortical spreading depolarizations (SDs), endothelin-induced ischemic negative ultraslow potentials (NUPs), and whole-cell recordings of membrane potential using RRC filters. The quality of the reconstruction was significantly higher than with the existing inverse filtering procedures. Thus, RRC filters with inverse filtering are optimal for full-band EEG recordings in various applications.

We conducted two separate experiments in which we applied rTMS over the left parietal-occipital region. Prospective electric field simulation guided the choice of the individual stimulation intensities. In the main experiment, 16 participants received rhythmic and arrhythmic rTMS bursts at between ca. 20 and 50 mv/mm peak absolute electric field intensities. In the control experiment, another group of 16 participants received sham rTMS. To characterize the aftereffects, we estimated the alpha power (8-14 Hz) changes recorded in the inter-burst intervals, i.e., from 0.2 to 10 s after rTMS. We found aftereffects lasting up to two seconds after stimulation with ca. 35 mV/mm. Relative to baseline, alpha power was significantly reduced by the arrhythmic protocol, while there was no significant change with the rhythmic protocol. We found no significant long-term, i.e., up to 10-second, differences between the rhythmic and arrhythmic stimulation, or between the rhythmic and sham protocols. Weak arrhythmic rTMS induced short-lived alpha suppression during the interburst intervals. (c) 2021 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, relatively little is known about the net effect of these changes on sensory population codes, even though perception ultimately depends on population activity. Here, we measured the EEG in human observers (male and female), and isolated stimulus-evoked activity that was phase-locked to the onset of attended and ignored visual stimuli. Using an encoding model, we reconstructed spatially selective population tuning functions from the pattern of stimulus-evoked activity across the scalp. Our EEG-based approach allowed us to measure very early visually evoked responses occurring similar to 100 ms after stimulus onset. In Experiment 1, we found that covert attention increased the amplitude of spatially tuned population responses at this early stage of sensory processing. In Experiment 2, we parametrically varied stimulus contrast to test how this effect scaled with stimulus contrast. We found that the effect of attention on the amplitude of spatially tuned responses increased with stimulus contrast, and was well described by an increase in response gain (i.e., a multiplicative scaling of the population response). Together, our results show that attention increases the gain of spatial population codes during the first wave of visual processing.

J	Diaz, GK; Vogel, EK; Awh, E				Diaz, Gisella K.; Vogel, Edward K.; Awh, Edward			Perceptual Grouping Reveals Distinct Roles for Sustained Slow Wave Activity and Alpha Oscillations in Working Memory	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CONTRALATERAL DELAY ACTIVITY; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; ACTIVITY TRACKS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; NEURAL MEASURE; EEG; REPRESENTATIONS; MODULATIONS; MECHANISMS; SIMILARITY	Multiple neural signals have been found to track the number of items stored in working memory (WM). These signals include oscillatory activity in the alpha band and slow- wave components in human EEG, both of which vary with storage loads and predict individual differences in WM capacity. However, recent evidence suggests that these two signals play distinct roles in spatial attention and item-based storage in WM. Here, we examine the hypothesis that sustained negative voltage deflections over parieto-occipital electrodes reflect the number of individuated items in WM, whereas oscillatory activity in the alpha frequency band (8-12 Hz) within the same electrodes tracks the attended positions in the visual display. We measured EEG activity while participants stored the orientation of visual elements that were either grouped by collinearity or not. This grouping manipulation altered the number of individuated items perceived while holding constant the number of locations occupied by visual stimuli. The negative slow wave tracked the number of items stored and was reduced in amplitude in the grouped condition. By contrast, oscillatory activity in the alpha frequency band tracked the number of positions occupied by the memoranda and was unaffected by perceptual grouping. Perceptual grouping, then, reduced the number of individuated representations stored in WM as reflected by the negative slow wave, whereas the location of each element was actively maintained as indicated by alpha power. These findings contribute to the emerging idea that distinct classes of EEG signals work in concert to successfully maintain online representations in WM.

This article contains an answer to this question which is based on the disclosure of neurophysiological mechanisms of one of the least understandable types of human cognitive activity. For the first time with the use of cerebral cortex electrical activity mapping, a comprehensive study of the organization of cortical neural networks and the functional state of the autonomic nervous system of female biology students engaged in intuitive thinking has been conducted. The productivity of intuitive thinking is associated with increasing the spectral power of beta2-, delta-, theta-components of the electroencephalogram. The synchronization of the activity of most frequency bands is manifested in the frontal and motor areas of the cortex, which have close connections with the basal ganglia, which are responsible for the formation of skills. In the beta1-band there are probable intrahemispheric long coherences between the anterior and posterior parts of the right hemisphere, at the frequency of beta1,2- and theta-bands of the electroencephalogram they are combined into large cellular ensembles that cover the central-parietal-temporal loci of the cortex. Synchronization of biopotentials in the delta range covers large areas of the cerebral cortex. It has been established that in intuitive thinking the female students with a low standard of efficiency had a high level of central rhythm regulation, and the female students with a high standard of efficiency had a high level of autonomous regulation. Higher performance under intuitive thinking negatively correlated with low frequency findings and positively correlated with high frequency and the value of the square root of the mean squares of the intervals between heartbeats (rMSSD) in the structure of cardiorhythm. Correlation analysis found that productive mental activity is conditioned by the specific integration of cortico-visceral processes: productive intuitive thinking is associated with the activation of autonomic regulation of heart rate variability and coherence in the evolutionarily older delta and delta-theta systems of the brain. Thus, intuition is a scientific set of skills and knowledge, and the topographic signs of synchronization of electrical processes of the cerebral cortex can serve as objective criteria for successful intuitive thinking, which allow one to predict both individual abilities and the state that contributes to their realization.

Although previous studies suggested stimulation methods to enhance sleep, a new method is required that is practical for long-term and unconstrained use by people. In this study, we used a novel closed-loop vibration stimulation method that delivers a stimulus in interaction with the intrinsic heart rhythm and examined the effects of stimulation on sleep and memory. Twelve volunteers participated in the experiment and each underwent one adaptation night and two experimental conditions-a stimulation condition (STIM) and a no-stimulation condition (SHAM). The heart rate variability analysis showed a significant increase in the normalized high frequency and the normalized low frequency significantly decreased under the STIM during the slow-wave sleep (SWS) stage. Furthermore, the synchronization ratio between the heartbeat and the stimulus significantly increased under the STIM in the SWS stage. From the electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analysis, EEG relative powers of slow-wave activity and theta frequency bands showed a significant increase during the STIM in the SWS stage. Additionally, memory retention significantly increased under the STIM compared to the SHAM. These findings suggest that the closed-loop stimulation improves the SWS-stage depth and memory retention, and further provides a new technique for sleep enhancement.

To explore the neural generators of SSRs, a unified framework solving the inverse problem for a single subject or integrating multiple subjects is indispensable. Inspired by the phenomenon that the oscillation frequency of an SSR follows that of the periodic stimulus, we consider the problem of source localization for SSRs using the Fourier components at the stimulation frequency instead of directly using the waveform in this paper. The multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) Fourier components at the stimulation frequency is shown to equal multiplying the lead field matrix (LFM) by a complex-valued vector that contains the amplitudes and phases of sources in the cortex, contaminated by spontaneous EEG and electrical noise. This complex-valued inverse problem is further solved in the framework of sparse Bayesian learning, where the non-stationarity of spontaneous EEG among epochs is considered, and the joint sparsity of complex-valued source component vectors is modeled and utilized to improve the source localization performance. Expectation-maximization (EM) is employed to give the ultimate SSR source localization algorithm. By the proposed method, not only a single subject's SSR source localization can be achieved, but also the common locations of a certain type of SSR integrating multiple subjects can be given, even when the electrode layout or number of electrodes varies among subjects. The validity and superior performance of the proposed method was verified by simulations compared with other methods. Real SSR stimulation/recording experiments were also performed, where the electric generators of 40-Hz auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) by various stimulation patterns were investigated.

Over 50 million people worldwide are affected by some form of epileptic seizures, and their accurate detection can help millions in the proper management of this condition. Increasing research in machine learning has made a great impact on biomedical signal processing and especially in electroencephalogram (EEG) data analysis. The availability of various feature extraction techniques and classification methods makes it difficult to choose the most suitable combination for resource-efficient and correct detection. This paper intends to review the relevant studies of wavelet and empirical mode decomposition-based feature extraction techniques used for seizure detection in epileptic EEG data. The articles were chosen for review based on their Journal Citation Report, feature selection methods, and classifiers used. The high-dimensional EEG data falls under the category of '3N' biosignals-nonstationary, nonlinear, and noisy; hence, two popular classifiers, namely random forest and support vector machine, were taken for review, as they are capable of handling high-dimensional data and have a low risk of over-fitting. The main metrics used are sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy; hence, some papers reviewed were excluded due to insufficient metrics. To evaluate the overall performances of the reviewed papers, a simple mean value of all metrics was used.

Delta power robustly predicts cognitive function in Angelman syndrome	ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article							THALAMOCORTICAL NEURONS; EEG ALPHA; SEIZURES; MUTATIONS; MOUSE; OSCILLATIONS; DIAGNOSIS; MODEL; UBE3A	Objective: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss of function of the maternally inherited UBE3A gene in neurons. Promising disease-modifying treatments to reinstate UBE3A expression are under development and an early measure of treatment response is critical to their deployment in clinical trials. Increased delta power in EEG recordings, reflecting abnormal neuronal synchrony, occurs in AS across species and correlates with genotype. Whether delta power provides a reliable biomarker for clinical symptoms remains unknown. Methods: We analyzed combined EEG recordings and developmental assessments in a large cohort of individuals with AS (N = 82 subjects, 133 combined EEG and cognitive assessments, 1.08-28.16 years; 32F) and evaluated delta power as a biomarker for cognitive function, as measured by the Bayley Cognitive Score. We examined the robustness of this biomarker to varying states of consciousness, recording techniques and analysis procedures. Results: Delta power predicted the Bayley Scale cognitive score (P < 10(-5), R-2 = 0.9374) after controlling for age (P < 10(-24)), genotype: age (P < 10(-11)), and repeat assessments (P < 10(-8)), with the excellent fit on cross validation (R-2 = 0.95). There were no differences in model performance across states of consciousness or bipolar versus average montages (Delta AIC < 2). Models using raw data excluding frontal channels outperformed other models (Delta AIC > 4) and predicted performance in expressive (P = 0.0209) and receptive communication (P < 10(-3)) and fine motor skills (P < 10(-4)). Interpretation: Delta power is a simple, direct measure of neuronal activity that reliably correlates with cognitive function in AS. This electrophysiological biomarker offers an objective, clinically relevant endpoint for treatment response in emerging clinical trials.

In this task, the participants have to decide which two of four rotated figures match the target figure. The dependent measures were performance speed and accuracy. In our exploratory investigation, we further examined midline frontal theta band activation, parietal alpha band activation, and parietal alpha band asymmetry in EEG as indicator for the chosen rotation strategy. Additionally, we explored the gender influence on performance and EEG activation, although a very small female sample section was given. The expected gender difference concerning performance accuracy was negated by expertise in pen and paper role-playing women, while the gender-specific difference in performance speed was preserved. Moreover, gender differences concerning electro-cortical measures revealed differences in rotation strategy, with women using top-down strategies compared to men, who were using top-down strategies and active inhibition of associative cortical areas. These strategy uses were further moderated by expertise, with higher expertise leading to more pronounced activation patters, especially during successful performance. However, due to the very limited sample size, the findings of this explorative study have to be interpreted cautiously.

In the last decades, it was subject to extensive research due to its high prevalence. Still, a quantitative description of the electrical brain activity during musculoskeletal pain is lacking. This study aimed to characterize intracranial current source density (CSD) estimations during sustained deep-tissue experimental pain. Twenty-three healthy volunteers received three types of tonic stimuli for three minutes each: computer-controlled cuff pressure (1) below pain threshold (sustained deep-tissue no-pain, SDTnP), (2) above pain threshold (sustained deep-tissue pain, SDTP) and (3) vibrotactile stimulation (VT). The CSD in response to these stimuli was calculated in seven regions of interest (ROIs) likely involved in pain processing: contralateral anterior cingulate cortex, contralateral primary somatosensory cortex, bilateral anterior insula, contralateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex and contralateral premotor cortex. Results showed that participants exhibited an overall increase in spectral power during SDTP in all seven ROIs compared to both SDTnP and VT, likely reflecting the differences in the salience of these stimuli. Moreover, we observed a difference is CSD due to the type of stimulus, likely reflecting somatosensory discrimination of stimulus intensity. These results describe the different contributions of neural oscillations within these brain regions in the processing of sustained deep-tissue pain.

Spatiotemporal Patterns of High-Frequency Activity (80-170 Hz) in Long-Term Intracranial EEG	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							OSCILLATIONS; RISK; RESECTION; SEIZURES	Objective To determine the utility of high-frequency activity (HFA) and epileptiform spikes as bio-markers for epilepsy, we examined the variability in their rates and locations using long-term ambulatory intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. Methods This study used continuous iEEG recordings obtained over an average of 1.4 years from 15 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. HFA was defined as 80- to 170-Hz events with amplitudes clearly larger than the background, which was automatically detected with a custom algorithm. The automatically detected HFA was compared with visually annotated high-frequency oscillations (HFOs). The variations of HFA rates were compared with spikes and seizures on patient-specific and electrode-specific bases. Results HFA included manually annotated HFOs and high-amplitude events occurring in the 80- to 170-Hz range without observable oscillatory behavior. HFA and spike rates had high amounts of intrapatient and interpatient variability. Rates of HFA and spikes had large variability after electrode implantation in most of the patients. Locations of HFA and spikes varied up to weeks in more than one-third of the patients. Both HFA and spike rates showed strong circadian rhythms in all patients, and some also showed multiday cycles. Furthermore, the circadian patterns of HFA and spike rates had patient-specific correlations with seizures, which tended to vary across electrodes. Conclusion Analysis of HFA and epileptiform spikes should consider postimplantation variability. HFA and epileptiform spikes, like seizures, show circadian rhythms. However, the circadian profiles can vary spatially within patients, and their correlations to seizures are patient-specific.

A Bridge between the Breath and the Brain: Synchronization of Respiration, a Pupillometric Marker of the Locus Coeruleus, and an EEG Marker of Attentional Control State	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						respiration; locus coeruleus; theta-beta ratio; eeg; coupling; synchronization; noradrenaline; pupil; breath	THETA/BETA RATIO; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; DEFAULT NETWORK; ARTERIAL PH; PUPIL SIZE; AROUSAL; NEURONS; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; REWARD	Yogic and meditative traditions have long held that the fluctuations of the breath and the mind are intimately related. While respiratory modulation of cortical activity and attentional switching are established, the extent to which electrophysiological markers of attention exhibit synchronization with respiration is unknown. To this end, we examined (1) frontal midline theta-beta ratio (TBR), an indicator of attentional control state known to correlate with mind wandering episodes and functional connectivity of the executive control network; (2) pupil diameter (PD), a known proxy measure of locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic activity; and (3) respiration for evidence of phase synchronization and information transfer (multivariate Granger causality) during quiet restful breathing. Our results indicate that both TBR and PD are simultaneously synchronized with the breath, suggesting an underlying oscillation of an attentionally relevant electrophysiological index that is phase-locked to the respiratory cycle which could have the potential to bias the attentional system into switching states. We highlight the LC's pivotal role as a coupling mechanism between respiration and TBR, and elaborate on its dual functions as both a chemosensitive respiratory nucleus and a pacemaker of the attentional system. We further suggest that an appreciation of the dynamics of this weakly coupled oscillatory system could help deepen our understanding of the traditional claim of a relationship between breathing and attention.

For example, when stimulus-action mappings vary across time or context, the brain may learn two or more stimulus-action mappings in separate modules, and additionally (at a hierarchically higher level) learn to appropriately switch between those modules. However, how the brain mechanistically coordinates neural communication to implement such hierarchical learning remains unknown. Therefore, the current study tests a recent computational model that proposed how midfrontal theta oscillations implement such hierarchical learning via the principle of binding by synchrony (Sync model). More specifically, the Sync model uses bursts at theta frequency to flexibly bind appropriate task modules by synchrony. The 64-channel EEG signal was recorded while 27 human subjects (female: 21, male: 6) performed a probabilistic reversal learning task. In line with the Sync model, postfeedback theta power showed a linear relationship with negative prediction errors, but not with positive prediction errors. This relationship was especially pronounced for subjects with better behavioral fit (measured via Akaike information criterion) of the Sync model. Also consistent with Sync model simulations, theta phase-coupling between midfrontal electrodes and temporoparietal electrodes was stronger after negative feedback. Our data suggest that the brain uses theta power and synchronization for flexibly switching between task rule modules, as is useful, for example, when multiple stimulus action mappings must be retained and used.

Dynamics of Neural Microstates in the VTA-Striatal-Prefrontal Loop during Novelty Exploration in the Rat	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						LFP microstates; object exploration; PFC; rodent; striatum; VTA	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DOPAMINE-RECEPTORS; SENSORY RESPONSES; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; CORTICAL DYNAMICS; HZ OSCILLATION; VISUAL-CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; EEG; BRAIN	Neural activity at the large-scale population level has been suggested to be consistent with a sequence of brief, quasistable spatial patterns. These "microstates" and their temporal dynamics have been linked to myriad cognitive functions and brain diseases. Most of this research has been performed using EEG, leaving many questions, such as the existence, dynamics, and behavioral relevance of microstates at the level of local field potentials (LFPs), unaddressed. Here, we adapted the standard EEG microstate analysis to triple-area LFP recordings from 192 electrodes in rats to investigate the mesoscopic dynamics of neural microstates within and across brain regions during novelty exploration. We performed simultaneous recordings from the prefrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area in male rats during awake behavior (object novelty and exploration). We found that the LFP data can be accounted for by multiple, recurring microstates that were stable for similar to 60-100 ms. The simultaneous microstate activity across brain regions revealed rhythmic patterns of coactivations, which we interpret as a novel indicator of inter-regional, mesoscale synchronization. Furthermore, these rhythmic coactivation patterns across microstates were modulated by behavioral states such as movement and exploration of a novel object. These results support the existence of a functional mesoscopic organization across multiple brain areas and present a possible link of the origin of macroscopic EEG microstates to zero-lag neuronal synchronization within and between brain areas, which is of particular interest to the human research community.

A multidisciplinary expert panel reviewed the clinical literature and reached consensus about the EEG measures consistently found as abnormal in VCI patients with dementia. As compared to cognitively unimpaired individuals, those VCI patients showed (1) smaller amplitude of resting state alpha (8-12 Hz) rhythms dominant in posterior regions; (2) widespread increases in amplitude of delta (< 4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) rhythms; and (3) delayed N20 0/P30 0 peak latencies in averaged event-related potentials, especially during the detection of auditory rare target stimuli requiring participants' responses in "oddball" paradigms. The expert panel formulated the following recommendations: (1) the above EEG measures are not specific for VCI and should not be used for its diagnosis; (2) they may be considered as "neural synchronization" biomarkers to enlighten the relationships between features of the VCI-related cerebrovascular lesions and abnormalities in neurophysiological brain mechanisms; and (3) they may be tested in future clinical trials as prognostic biomarkers and endpoints of interventions aimed at normalizing background brain excitability and vigilance in wakefulness.

As a result, we must strategically ignore some stimuli to prioritize others. Common sense suggests that foreknowledge of distractor characteristics, like location or color, might help us ignore these objects. But empirical studies have provided mixed evidence, often showing that knowing about a distractor before it appears counterintuitively leads to its attentional selection. What has looked like strategic distractor suppression in the past is now commonly explained as a product of prior experience and implicit statistical learning, and the long-standing notion the distractor suppression is reflected in alpha band oscillatory brain activity has been challenged by results appearing to link alpha to target resolution. Can we strategically, proactively suppress distractors? And, if so, does this involve alpha? Here, we use the concurrent recording of human EEG and eye movements in optimized experimental designs to identify behavior and brain activity associated with proactive distractor suppression. Results from three experiments show that knowing about distractors before they appear causes a reduction in electrophysiological indices of covert attentional selection of these objects and a reduction in the overt deployment of the eyes to the location of the objects. This control is established before the distractor appears and is predicted by the power of cue-elicited alpha activity over the visual cortex. Foreknowledge of distractor characteristics therefore leads to improved selective control, and alpha oscillations in visual cortex reflect the implementation of this strategic, proactive mechanism.

To better characterize the complex interactions within these compartments at different scales we developed a simultaneous multimodal-multiscale approach and measure their activity around the time of the IIS. We performed such measurements in an epileptic rat model (n = 43). We thus evaluated (1) synaptic dynamics by combining electrocorticography and multiunit activity recording in the time and time-frequency domain, (2) non-synaptic dynamics by recording modifications in light scattering induced by changes in the membrane configuration related to cell activity using the fast optical signal, and (3) vascular dynamics using functional near-infrared spectroscopy and, independently but simultaneously to the electrocorticography, the changes in cerebral blood flow using diffuse correlation spectroscopy. The first observed alterations in the measured signals occurred in the hemodynamic compartments a few seconds before the peak of the IIS. These hemodynamic changes were followed by changes in coherence and then synchronization between the deep and superficial neural networks in the 1 s preceding the IIS peaks. Finally, changes in light scattering before the epileptic spikes suggest a change in membrane configuration before the IIS. Our multimodal, multiscale approach highlights the complexity of (1) interactions between the various neuronal, vascular, and extracellular compartments, (2) neural interactions between various layers, (3) the synaptic mechanisms (coherence and synchronization), and (4) non-synaptic mechanisms that take place in the neuronal network around the time of the IISs in a very specific cerebral hemodynamic environment.

We investigated the heartbeatevoked cortical potential amplitude (HEP) during sleep, its association with IS, and the role of hypnotizability in such association. We performed a retrospective analysis of polysomnographic recordings of 39 healthy volunteers. Participants completed the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA), measuring IS and IA, and underwent hypnotic assessment via the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale, form A. The amplitude of the early and late HEP components was computed at EEG frontal and central sites. In both regions, the early HEP component was larger in N3 than in N2 and REM, with no difference between N2 and REM. Greater HEP amplitude at frontal than at central sites was found for the late HEP component. HEP amplitudes were not influenced by the autonomic state assessed by heart rate variability in the frequency and time domains. We report for the first time a positive correlation between the central late HEP component and MAIA dimensions, which became non-significant after removing the effects of hypnotizability. Our findings indicate that hypnotizability sustains the correlation between IS and HEP amplitude during sleep.

Various early electrographic seizure patterns differing in frequency, amplitude, and waveform of the oscillations are observed. The pattern most common in the areas of seizure propagation is the so-called theta-alpha activity (TAA), whose defining features are oscillations in the theta - alpha range and gradually increasing amplitude. A deeper understanding of the mechanism underlying the generation of the TAA pattern is however lacking. In this work we evaluate the hypothesis that the TAA patterns are caused by seizures spreading across the cortex. To do so, we perform simulations of seizure dynamics on detailed patient-derived cortical surfaces using the spreading seizure model as well as reference models with one or two homogeneous sources. We then detect the occurrences of the TAA patterns both in the simulated stereo-electroencephalographic signals and in the signals of recorded epileptic seizures from a cohort of fifty patients, and we compare the features of the groups of detected TAA patterns to assess the plausibility of the different models. Our results show that spreading seizure hypothesis is qualitatively consistent with the evidence available in the seizure recordings, and it can explain the features of the detected TAA groups best among the examined models. Author summary During evaluation, epileptic patients might be implanted with intracranial electrodes in order to gain insight into the initiation and evolution of the seizure. At the beginning of the seizure variety of electrographic patterns can appear, whose origins and significance is not yet fully understood, which makes the interpretation of the signals difficult. Here we look at one of the patterns, the so-called theta-alpha activity pattern, and propose that it can be explained by epileptic seizures gradually spreading across the cortex. To analyze this hypothesis, we compare three models of epileptic activity that can generate the theta-alpha activity pattern, and evaluate which of them is most consistent with the patterns found in the patients' recordings. We simulate the seizure activity using the detailed geometry of individual patients' brains and the location of the implanted electrodes, and we show that the spreading seizure model is most consistent with the observations. Such understanding can help the interpretation of the recordings in clinical practice, leading to better outcomes of resective surgeries.

Attentional control is needed to suppress salient distractors. Motor control is needed to suppress goal-incompatible action impulses. While previous studies mostly studied the additive effects of attentional and motor conflicts, we independently manipulated the need for attentional control (via visual distractors) and motor control (via unexpected response deviations) in an EEG study with male and female humans. We sought to find out whether these different types of control rely on the same midfrontal oscillatory mechanisms. Motor conflicts, but not attentional conflicts, elicited increases in midfrontal theta power during conflict resolution. Independent of the type of conflict, theta power was predictive of motor slowing. Connectivity analysis via phase-based synchronization indicated a widespread increase interbrain connectivity for motor conflicts, but a midfrontal-to-posterior decrease in connectivity for attentional conflicts. For each condition, we found stronger midfrontal connectivity with the parietal region contralateral to, rather than ipsilateral to, the acting hand. Parietal lateralization in connectivity was strongest for motor conflicts. Previous studies suggested that midfrontal theta oscillations might represent a general control mechanism, which aids conflict resolution independent of the conflict domain. In contrast, our results show that oscillatory theta dynamics during reactive control mostly reflect motor-related adjustments.

However, accurate interpretation of clinical outcomes requires the identification and minimisation of potential confounding factors. While several studies have indicated that the menstrual cycle also alters brain activity, most of these studies were based on visual inspection rather than objective quantitative measures. In the present study, we aimed to clarify the effect of the menstrual cycle on spontaneous neural oscillations based on quantitative magnetoencephalography (MEG) parameters. Resting-state MEG activity was recorded from 25 healthy women with normal menstrual cycles. For each woman, resting-state brain activity was acquired twice using MEG: once during their menstrual period (MP) and once outside of this period (OP). Our results indicated that the median frequency and peak alpha frequency of the power spectrum were low, whereas Shannon spectral entropy was high, during the MP. Theta intensity within the right temporal cortex and right limbic system was significantly lower during the MP than during the OP. High gamma intensity in the left parietal cortex was also significantly lower during the MP than during the OP. Similar differences were also observed in the parietal and occipital regions between the proliferative (the late part of the follicular phase) and secretory phases (luteal phase). Our findings suggest that the menstrual cycle should be considered to ensure accurate interpretation of functional neuroimaging in clinical practice.

We hypothesized that network-level coupling is more directly related to movement execution than local power changes, given the role of pathological network hypersynchrony in movement disorders such as Parkinson disease (PD). Understanding the specificity of these movement-related signals is important for designing novel therapeutics. Methods: We recorded globus pallidus internus (GPi) and motor cortical local field potentials during movement execution, passive movement observation and rest in 12 patients with PD undergoing deep brain stimulator implantation. Results: Local alpha/beta power is suppressed in the globus pallidus and motor cortex during both action execution and action observation, although less so during action observation. In contrast, pallidocortical phase synchrony and GPi and motor cortical alpha/beta-gamma PAC are suppressed only during action execution. Conclusions: The functional dissociation across tasks in pallidocortical network activity suggests a particularly important role of network coupling in motor execution. Significance: Network level recordings provide important specificity in differentiating motor behavior and may provide significant value for future closed loop therapies.

Theta rhythm is associated with memory consolidation and coding, but the trainability and effects on long-term memory of theta rhythm are unknown. This study investigated the ability to improve long-term memory using a neurofeedback (NFB) technique reflecting the theta/low-beta power ratio on an electroencephalogram (EEG). Our study consisted of three stages. First, the long-term memory of participants was measured. In the second stage, the participants in the NFB group received 3 days of theta/low-beta NFB training. In the third stage, the long-term memory was measured again. The NFB group had better episodic and semantic long-term memory than the control group and significant differences in brain activity between episodic and semantic memory during the recall tests were revealed. These findings suggest that it is possible to improve episodic and semantic long-term memory abilities through theta/low-beta NFB training.

However, the utility and translation of noninvasive HFOs, although highly desirable, is impeded by the difficulty in differentiating pathological HFOs from nonepileptiform high-frequency activities and localizing the epileptic tissue using noninvasive scalp recordings, which are typically contaminated with high noise levels. Here, we show that the consistent concurrence of HFOs with epileptiform spikes (pHFOs) provides a tractable means to identify pathological HFOs automatically, and this in turn demarks an epileptiform spike subgroup with higher epileptic relevance than the other spikes in a cohort of 25 temporal epilepsy patients (including a total of 2,967 interictal spikes and 1,477 HFO events). We found significant morphological distinctions of HFOs and spikes in the presence/absence of this concurrent status. We also demonstrated that the proposed pHFO source imaging enhanced localization of epileptogenic tissue by 162% (-5.36 mm) for concordance with surgical resection and by 186% (-12.48 mm) with seizure-onset zone determined by invasive studies, compared to conventional spike imaging, and demonstrated superior congruence with the surgical outcomes. Strikingly, the performance of spike imaging was selectively boosted by the presence of spikes with pHFOs, especially in patients with multitype spikes. Our findings suggest that concurrent HFOs and spikes reciprocally discriminate pathological activities, providing a translational tool for noninvasive presurgical diagnosis and postsurgical evaluation in vulnerable patients.

However, investigations of frontal alpha asymmetry in mood-disorders have yielded inconsistent findings. A better understanding of factors that contribute to individual differences is required to establish a useful biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of mood and stress related disorders. A novel factor is hormone concentration, as steroid hormones play a prominent role in regulating mood and stress. To investigate this question, concentrations of testosterone and estradiol were sampled. Multiple linear regression revealed that low levels of testosterone correlated with greater frontal alpha asymmetry in women. Source localization found that frontal asymmetry was driven by decreased alpha power in right inferior frontal gyrus that correlated with increased behavioral inhibition in women. Together, these findings might explain inconsistencies in previous investigation on frontal alpha asymmetry.

Since we assumed that an interpreter's attention ability improves with an increase in the number of years of experience of simultaneous interpretation, we divided the participants into two groups based on their simultaneous interpretation experience: experts with more than 15 years of experience (E group; n = 7) and beginners with <1 year (B group; n = 15). We also compared two conditions: simultaneous interpretation (SI) and shadowing (SH). We found a significant interaction in the ITC between years of SI experience (E and B groups) and tasks (SI and SH). This result demonstrates that the number of years of SI experience influences selective attention during interpretation.

Healthy participants observed painful/non-painful stimuli while brain response [oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb; HHb), and electroencephalographic cortical oscillations] was measured. Participants were divided into experimental (EXP) and control group: EXP group was required to focus on its interoceptive correlates during the task. Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) scale was administered to test empathic traits. Focusing on prefrontal cortex activity, theta band and O2Hb in the right frontal hemisphere while observing painful stimuli positively correlates in the EXP. Delta band and O2Hb in left frontal hemisphere for non painful stimuli positively correlates in controls.

Still, no previous study has actually attempted to establish a longitudinal link between them. The present study tested Basque-speaking children twice: once before reading was formally instructed (t(1); 5-6 years old) and once after they had received a full school year of reading instruction (t(2); 6-7 years old). At t(1), speech-brain coherence was recorded via EEG. At t(2), in addition to the coherence measure, reading performance was assessed. Our results show that children with larger pre-reading delta-band (<1 Hz) speech-brain coherence at right sites of the scalp performed better in the reading tasks one year later. Overall, our results provide preliminary support for a relevant contribution of right-hemisphere speech-brain coherence to successful reading development and point towards pre-reading neural coherence indexes as useful tools for the early detection of developmental reading disorders.

Cannabis is usually employed as a self-medication for the treatment of insomnia disorder. However, the effects of Cannabis on sleep depend on multiple factors such as metabolomic composition of the plant, dosage and route of administration. In the present chapter, we reviewed the main effect Cannabis on sleep. We focused on the effect of "crude or whole plant" Cannabis consumption (i.e., smoked, oral or vaporized) both in humans and experimental animal models. The data reviewed establish that Cannabis modifies sleep. Furthermore, a recent experimental study in animals suggests that vaporization (which is a recommended route for medical purposes) of Cannabis with high THC and negligible CBD, promotes NREM sleep. However, it is imperative to perform new clinical studies in order to confirm if the administration of Cannabis could be a beneficial therapy for the treatment of sleep disorders.

But no systematic review has yet compared the efficacy and safety of these two measures. Methods We conducted a systematic search on various databases to collating all available literature until 30th November 2020 with a primary objective to compare the efficacy of KD and CC in terms of the proportion of patients with complete seizure freedom, at least 75% and 50% reduction in seizure frequency at various time points after the institution of these modalities. We also attempted to compare the proportion and nature of adverse effects, impact on EEG, cognition, and behavior with these modalities. We only included original articles enrolling at least 10 patients with CC or KD for quantitative synthesis to determine a pooled estimate. We used a fixed or random effects model, depending on the degree of heterogeneity. Results We selected 23 and 7 articles describing the efficacy of CC and KD in 436 and 185 LGS patients out of 217 search items, but none of the studies compared directly these two entities. The indirect comparison between the pooled estimate of all patients with individual modalities revealed more patients with CC had seizure freedom, at least 75% and 50% reduction in seizure frequency (p=0.0001, 0.01, and 0.04 respectively). The proportion of patients with adverse effects was also higher for CC patients (p=0.01), although the proportion with serious adverse effects was not significantly different between the two modalities. Patients selected for CC were older, had higher seizure burden, more lag time after the onset of seizures, and received more number of antiseizure medications previously. Due to the availability of limited data, a firm conclusion could not be determined regarding the effect on EEG, cognition, and behavior with CC and KD. Conclusion CC is more efficacious than KD in reducing seizure frequency in patients with LGS, although it has relatively more adverse effects during the immediate perioperative period.

Building on our preliminary study reporting successful brain self-regulation using slow cortical potential (SCP) neurofeedback in offenders with psychopathy, we investigated the central nervous and autonomic peripheral changes occurring after brain self-regulation in a group of severe male offenders with psychopathy. Regarding the central nervous system, an overall suppression of the psychopathic overrepresentation of slow frequency bands was found, such as delta and theta band activity, after EEG neurofeedback. In addition, an increase in alpha band activity could be observed after the SCP self-regulation training. Electrodermal activity adaptively changed according to the regulation task, and this flexibility improved over training time. The results of this study point towards a constructive learning process and plasticity in neural and peripheral measures of offenders with psychopathy.

However, the complex electrophysiological mechanisms by which these fluctuations shape stimulus-evoked neural activity remain largely to be explored. Employing a large-scale magnetoencephalographic dataset and an electroencephalographic replication dataset, we investigate the relationship between spontaneous and evoked neural activity across a range of electrophysiological variables. We observe that for high-frequency activity, high pre-stimulus amplitudes lead to greater evoked desynchronization, while for low frequencies, high pre-stimulus amplitudes induce larger degrees of event-related synchronization. We further decompose electrophysiological power into oscillatory and scale-free components, demonstrating different patterns of spontaneous-evoked correlation for each component. Finally, we find correlations between spontaneous and evoked time-domain electrophysiological signals. Overall, we demonstrate that the dynamics of multiple electrophysiological variables exhibit distinct relationships between their spontaneous and evoked activity, a result which carries implications for experimental design and analysis in non-invasive electrophysiology. Wainio-Theberge et al employed a large-scale magnetoencephalographic dataset and an electroencephalographic replication dataset to investigate the relationship between spontaneous and evoked neural activity across a range of electrophysiological variables. They demonstrated that the dynamics of multiple electrophysiological variables exhibit distinct relationships between their spontaneous and evoked activity, which carries implications for experimental design and analysis.

Accuracy of high-frequency oscillations recorded intraoperatively for classification of epileptogenic regions	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; FAST RIPPLES; INTRACRANIAL EEG; SPIKE ACTIVITY; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHY; SLEEP; SURGERY; REMIFENTANIL; SEVOFLURANE; DISCHARGES	To see whether acute intraoperative recordings using stereo EEG (SEEG) electrodes can replace prolonged interictal intracranial EEG (iEEG) recording, making the process more efficient and safer, 10 min of iEEG were recorded following electrode implantation in 16 anesthetized patients, and 1-2 days later during non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Ripples on oscillations (RonO, 80-250 Hz), ripples on spikes (RonS), sharp-spikes, fast RonO (fRonO, 250-600 Hz), and fast RonS (fRonS) were semi-automatically detected. HFO power and frequency were compared between the conditions using a generalized linear mixed-effects model. HFO rates were compared using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with anesthesia type and SOZ as factors. A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis quantified seizure onset zone (SOZ) classification accuracy, and the scalar product was used to assess spatial reliability. Resection of contacts with the highest rate of events was compared with outcome. During sleep, all HFOs, except fRonO, were larger in amplitude compared to intraoperatively (p < 0.01). HFO frequency was also affected (p < 0.01). Anesthesia selection affected HFO and sharp-spike rates. In both conditions combined, sharp-spikes and all HFO subtypes were increased in the SOZ (p < 0.01). However, the increases were larger during the sleep recordings (p < 0.05). The area under the ROC curves for SOZ classification were significantly smaller for intraoperative sharp-spikes, fRonO, and fRonS rates (p < 0.05). HFOs and spikes were only significantly spatially reliable for a subset of the patients (p < 0.05). A failure to resect fRonO areas in the sleep recordings trended the most sensitive and accurate for predicting failure. In summary, HFO morphology is altered by anesthesia. Intraoperative SEEG recordings exhibit increased rates of HFOs in the SOZ, but their spatial distribution can differ from sleep recordings. Recording these biomarkers during non-REM sleep offers a more accurate delineation of the SOZ and possibly the epileptogenic zone.

Due to the rareness and the pathophysiology of the disease, there is no test to confirm the diagnosis of task-specific dystonia, except comprehensive observations by the experts. Evidence from neural electrophysiological data suggests that enhanced low frequency (4-12 Hz) oscillations in the subcortical structure of the globus pallidus were associated with the pathological abnormalities concerning 13 and gamma rhythms in motor areas and motor cortical network in patients with task-specific dystonia. However, whether patients with task-specific dystonia have any low-frequency abnormalities in motor cortical areas remains unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that low-frequency abnormalities are present in core motor areas and motor cortical networks in patients with task-specific dystonia during performing the non-symptomatic movements and those low-frequency abnormalities can help the diagnosis of this disease. We tested this hypothesis by using EEG, effective connectivity analysis, and a machine learning method. Fifteen patients with task-specific dystonia and 15 healthy controls were recruited. The machine learning method identified 8 aberrant movement-related network connections concerning low frequency, 13 and gamma frequencies, which enabled the separation of the data of patients from those of controls with an accuracy of 90%. Importantly, 7 of the 8 aberrant connections engaged the premotor area contralateral to the affected hand, suggesting an important role of the premotor area in the pathological abnormities. The patients exhibited significantly lower low frequency activities during the movement preparation and significantly lower 13 rhythms during movements compared with healthy controls in the core motor areas. Our findings of low frequency- and 13-related abnormalities at the cortical level and aberrant motor network could help diagnose task-specific dystonia in the clinical setting, and the importance of the contralesional premotor area suggests its diagnostic potential for task-specific dystonia.

Several methods for assessing the FA have been proposed in literature, but no studies have compared their effectiveness in a comprehensive way. In this study we first investigated whether the association between FA and valence depends on the computational methods and then, we identified the best one, namely the one giving the highest correlation with the self-reports. The investigated factors were the presence of a normalization factor, the computation in time or frequency domain and the cluster of electrodes used. All the analyses were implemented on the validated DEAP dataset. We found that the number and position of the electrodes do not influence the FA, in contrast with both the power computation method and the normalization. By using a spectrogram-based approach and by adding a normalization factor, a correlation of 0.36 between the FA and the self-reported valence was obtained.

FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						virtual reality; virtual reality induced motion sickness; VIMS; EEG; effective connectivity; SSQ; transfer entropy; predictive coding	EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; SIMULATOR SICKNESS; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; QUESTIONNAIRE; SYSTEM	Visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) is a relevant limiting factor in the use of virtual reality (VR) devices. Understanding the origin of this problem might help to develop strategies to circumvent this limitation. Previous studies have attributed VIMS to a mismatch between visual, and vestibular information, causing ambiguity of the position of the body in relation to its surrounding. Studies using EEG have shown a shift of the power spectrum to lower frequencies while VIMS is experienced. However, little is known about the relationship between the intensity of the VIMS and the changes in these power spectra. Moreover, the effect of different varieties of VIMS on the causal relationship between brain areas is largely unknown. Here, we used EEG to study 14 healthy subjects in a VR environment who were exposed to increasing levels of mismatch between vestibular and visual information. The frequency power and the bivariate transfer entropy as a measure for the information transfer were calculated. We found a direct association between increasing mismatch levels and subjective VIMS. With increasing VIMS, the proportion of slow EEG waves (especially 1-10 Hz) increases, especially in temporo-occipital regions. Furthermore, we found a general decrease in the information flow in most brain areas but especially in brain areas involved in the processing of vestibular signals and the detection of self-motion. We hypothesize that the general shift of frequency power and the decrease in information flow while experiencing high intensity VIMS represent a brain state of a reduced ability to receive, transmit and process information. We further hypothesize that the mechanism of reduced information flow is a general reaction of the brain to an unresolvable mismatch of information. This reaction aims on transforming a currently unstable model with a high prediction error into a stable model in an environment of minimal contradictory information.

The aim of this study was to clarify the effect of a stable concentration of propofol on interictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), which may contribute to identifying the epileptogenic zone intraoperatively for resection surgery. Methods. Nine patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy who underwent invasive pre-surgical evaluation with chronic subdural electrodes were recruited. Five-minute electrocorticograms during wakefulness, slow-wave sleep, and under a stable brain concentration of propofol were recorded with the same electrodes. In each patient, 1-10 pairs of electrodes were selected for both electrodes with EEG changes within 5 seconds from the ictal onset (ictal pattern for 5 seconds [IP5]) and those outside the area of IP5 with no interictal epileptiform discharges (non-epileptiform [nEPI]). The numbers of ripples (80-250 Hz) and fast ripples (>250 Hz) were measured semi-automatically using an established algorithm. Statistical testing was performed with a mixed effect model. Results. Thirty-seven pairs of electrodes from nine patients were analysed for IP5 and 29 pairs from seven patients were analysed for nEPI. The numbers of HFOs differed between the areas (1P5 and nEPI) and among the conditions (wakefulness, slow-wave sleep, propofol anaesthesia) (all p <0.01). The HFO occurrence rates were significantly higher for IP5 than those for nEPI in all conditions (for both ripples and fast ripples in all conditions; p <0.01 ). Significance. The occurrence rates of HFOs for IP5 were significantly higher than those for nEPI under propofol anaesthesia. These are fundamental findings for intraoperative HFO analysis, however, the following limitations should be considered: physiological HFOs could not be completely differentiated from pathological HFOs; in order to apply an HFO detector, an appropriate cut-off threshold is needed; an artefact of the impulse response filter appears as an HFO; and the series was comprised of a small number of heterogeneous patients.

Double-blind disruption of right inferior frontal cortex with TMS reduces right frontal beta power for action stopping	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						inhibitory control; oscillations; stop-signal task; transcranial magnetic stimulation	RESPONSE-INHIBITION; MOTOR CORTEX; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; COGNITIVE CONTROL; REPETITIVE TMS; NEURAL BASIS; EXCITABILITY; STIMULATION; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS	Stopping action depends on the integrity of the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). Electrocorticography from the rIFG shows an increase in beta power during action stopping. Scalp EEG shows a similar right frontal beta increase, but it is unknown whether this beta modulation relates to the underlying rIFG network. Demonstrating a causal relationship between the rIFG and right frontal beta in EEG during action stopping is important for putting this electrophysiological marker on a firmer footing. In a double-blind study with a true sham coil, we used fMRI-guided 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to disrupt the rIFG and to test whether this reduced right frontal beta and impaired action stopping. We found that rTMS selectively slowed stop signal reaction time (SSRT) (no effect on Go) and reduced right frontal beta (no effect on sensorimotor mu/beta related to Go); it also reduced the variance of a single-trial muscle marker of stopping. Surprisingly, sham stimulation also slowed SSRTs and reduced beta. Part of this effect, however, resulted from carryover of real stimulation in participants who received real stimulation first. A post hoc between-group comparison of those participants who received real first compared with those who received sham first showed that real stimulation reduced beta significantly more. Thus, real rTMS uniquely affected metrics of stopping in the muscle and resulted in a stronger erosion of beta. We argue that this causal test validates right frontal beta as a functional marker of action stopping. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Action stopping recruits the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) and elicits increases in right frontal beta. The present study now provides causal evidence linking these stopping-related beta oscillations to the integrity of the underlying rIFG network. One-hertz transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the rIFG impaired stopping and reduced right frontal beta during a stop-signal task. Furthermore, the effect on neural oscillations was specific to stopping-related beta, with no change in sensorimotor mu/beta corresponding to the Go response.

Electrophysiological investigation of reward anticipation and outcome evaluation during slot machine play	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Feedback related negativity (FRN); Delta oscillations; Frontal medial theta oscillations; Near miss; Frustrative nonreward		Slot machines are a popular form of gambling, offering a tractable way to experimentally model reward processes. This study used a 3-reel slot paradigm to assess psychologically distinct phases of reward processing, reflecting anticipation, and early- and late-stage outcome processing. EEG measures of winning, nearly missing (a losing outcome revealed at the final, third reel), and "totally" missing (a losing outcome revealed earlier, at the second reel) were collected from healthy adults (n=54). Condition effects were evaluated in: i) event-related potential (ERP) components reflecting anticipatory attention (stimulus preceding negativity, SPN) and outcome processing (reward positivity, RewP and late-positive potential, LPP) and ii) total power and phase synchrony of theta and delta band oscillations. Behaviorally, trial initiation was fastest after a near miss outcome and slowest after a winning outcome. As expected, a significant SPN was observed for possible wins (AA) vs. total misses (AB), consistent with reward anticipation. Larger win (AAA) vs. near miss (AAB) amplitudes were observed for the RewP; LPP amplitudes were largest for wins (AAA), intermediate for near misses (AAB), and smallest for total misses (ABC), reflecting significant early (RewP) and late-stage (LPP) outcome processing effects. There was an effect of reel position on the RewP, with larger amplitude in the final reel (AAA-AAB) relative to the 2nd-reel locked difference waves (AA-AB). Across all outcomes, near misses elicited the largest and most phase-synchronized theta responses, while wins elicited larger and more phase-synchronized delta responses than total misses, with delta band measures not distinguishing between near misses and wins. . Phase locking measures contrasting win vs. near miss delta and theta synchronization, within time windows corresponding to ERP measurements, covaried with RewP, but not SPN or LPP, amplitude. Lastly, EEG measures showed differential relationships with age and self-reported consummatory pleasure. In the context of slot machine play, where reward anticipation and attainment place minimal demands on effort and skill, ERP and time-frequency methods capture distinct neurophysiological signatures of reward anticipation and outcome processing.

Although previous studies have shown that aging is be-haviorally associated with decline in bilateral coordination, especially in AP movements, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we use kinematic measurements and electroencephalography to compare motor performance of young and older adults executing bilateral IP and AP hand movements. On the behavioral level, inter-limb synchronization was reduced during AP movements compared to IP and this reduction was stronger in the older adults. On the neural level, we found interactions between group and condition for task-related power change in different frequency bands. The interaction was driven by smaller alpha power decreases over the non-dominant cortical motor area in young adults dur -ing IP movements and larger beta power decreases over the midline region in older adults during AP movements. In addition, the decrease in inter-limb synchronization during AP movements was predicted by stronger directional connectivity in the beta-band: an effect more pronounced in older adults. Our re-sults therefore show that age-related differences in the two bilateral coordination modes are reflected on the neural level by differences in alpha and beta oscillatory power as well as interhemispheric directional connectivity.

Objective: The balance of cross-frequency coupling over within-frequency coupling can build a nonlinearity index (NI) that encapsulates the over-excitation of information flow between brain areas and across experimental time. The present study investigated for the very first time how the Greek High Phenolic Early Harvest Extra Virgin Olive Oil (HP-EH-EVOO) versus Moderate Phenolic (MP-EVOO) and Mediterranean Diet (MeDi) intervention in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) could affect their spontaneous EEG dynamic connectivity. Methods: Forty-three subjects (14 in MeDi, 16 in MP-EVOO, and 13 in HP-EH-EVOO) followed an EEG resting-state recording session (eyes-open and closed) before and after the treatment. Following our dominant coupling mode model, we built a dynamic integrated dynamic functional connectivity graph that tabulates the functional strength and the dominant coupling mode model of every pair of brain areas. Results: Signal spectrum within 1-13 Hz and theta/beta ratio have decreased in the HP-EH-EVOO group in the eyes-open condition. The intervention improved the FIDoCM across groups and conditions but was more prominent in the HP-EH-EVOO group (p < 0.001). Finally, we revealed a significant higher post-intervention reduction of NI (Delta NITotal and alpha) for the HP-EH-EVOO compared to the MP-EVOO and MeDi groups (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Long-term intervention with HP-EH-EVOO reduced the over-excitation of information flow in spontaneous brain activity and altered the signal spectrum of EEG rhythms.

Cross-Task Adaptation Effects of Bilingual Language Control on Cognitive Control: A Dual-Brain EEG Examination of Simultaneous Production and Comprehension	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article; Early Access						adaptative control; bilingual language control; cognitive control; dual-EEG; interbrain synchronization	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; EXECUTIVE CONTROL; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; CONTROL MECHANISMS; PHASE SYNCHRONY; CONFLICT; THETA; DYNAMICS; REPRESENTATION; OSCILLATIONS	For bilinguals, speaking and listening are assisted by complex control processes including conflict monitoring and inhibition. However, the extent to which these processes adapt to linguistic and situational needs has been examined separately for language production and comprehension. In the present study, we use a dual-EEG to record the carry-over effects of language control on general cognitive control in three language contexts (single-first language [L1], single-second language [L2], and mixed). Chinese learners of English were placed in dyads in which one participant was asked to name pictures while the other listened. Interleaved after each naming/listening trial were flanker trials. The results from picture naming and listening revealed higher delta and theta synchronization in the single-L2 and mixed contexts compared with the single-L1 context and higher theta synchronization in the mixed context compared with the single-L2 and single-L1 contexts. The results from the interleaved flanker trials demonstrated that inhibition was adaptively generalized in the single-L2 and mixed contexts. Altogether, the findings support the natural adaptation of language control to cognitive control and underscore the importance of linguistic context. We argue that these adaptive patterns have the potential to affect corresponding control processes across language and cognitive control tasks.

J	Zhu, L; Wu, YF				Zhu, Lian; Wu, Yufei			Love Your Country: EEG Evidence of Actor Preferences of Audiences in Patriotic Movies	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						audience emotions; actor preferences; cognitive conflict; patriotic movies; EEG	FRONTAL-MIDLINE THETA; EMOTION REGULATION; STAR POWER; P300; POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; ADOLESCENTS; AROUSAL; PROFILE; LEVEL	Movie watching is one of the common ways to spark love for the country. A good patriotic movie can arouse love and pride, encourage people to stand by their countries, and reinforce a sense of national belonging. To evoke audience emotion and enhance patriotism, the choice of actors is fundamental and is a dilemma for film producers. In this exploratory study, an electroencephalogram (EEG) with a rating task was used to investigate how actor types (i.e., skilled vs. publicity) in patriotic movies modulate the willingness of audiences to watch a film and their emotional responses. Behavioral results showed that audiences are more willing to watch patriotic movies starring skilled actors than to watch patriotic movies starring publicity actors. Furthermore, brain results indicated that smaller P3 and late positive potential (LPP) were elicited in response to skilled actors than to publicity actors in patriotic movies. A larger theta oscillation was also observed with skilled actors than with publicity actors. These findings demonstrate that the willingness of audiences to watch a movie is deeply affected by actor types in patriotic films. Specifically, skilled actors engage audiences emotionally, more so than publicity actors, and increase the popularity of patriotic movies. This study is the first to employ neuroscientific technology to study movie casting, which advances film studies with careful scientific measurements and a possible new direction.

Despite its clinical relevance, the brain signatures of the perceptual processing supporting command following have been elusive. This multimodal study investigates the temporal spectral pattern of electrical brain activity to identify features that differentiated healthy controls from patients both able and unable to follow commands. We combined evidence from behavioural assessment, functional neuroimaging during mental imagery and high-density electroencephalography collected during auditory prediction, from 21 patients and 10 controls. We used a penalised regression model to identify command following using features from electroencephalography. We identified seven well-defined spatiotemporal signatures in the delta, theta and alpha bands that together contribute to identify DoC subjects with and without the ability to follow command, and further distinguished these groups of patients from controls. A fine-grained analysis of these seven signatures enabled us to determine that increased delta modulation at the frontal sensors was the main feature in command following patients. In contrast, higher frequency theta and alpha modulations differentiated controls from both groups of patients. Our findings highlight a key role of spatiotemporally specific delta modulation in supporting cortically mediated behaviour including the ability to follow command. However, patients able to follow commands nevertheless have marked differences in brain activity in comparison with healthy volunteers.

However, the functional impact of these motor processes on cognition has been questioned. The present study aims to provide new electrophysiological (EEG) evidence concerning the role of motor processes in the comprehension and memory of action language. Participants read lists of sentences including manual-action or attentional verbs, while keeping their hands either in front of them or crossing them behind their back. Results showed that posture impacted selectively the processing of manual action sentence, and not of attentional sentences, in three different ways: 1) EEG fronto-central beta rhythms, a signature of motor processes, were desynchronized while reading action sentences in the hands-in-front posture compared to the hands-behind posture. The estimated source was the posterior cingulate cortex, involved in proprioceptive regulation. 2) Recall of nouns associated with manual sentences decreased when learning occurred in the hands-behind posture. 3) ERPs analysis revealed that the initial posture at learning modulates neural processes during subsequent recall of manual sentences in the left superior frontal gyrus, which is related to motor processes. These results provide decisive evidence for the functional involvement of embodied simulations in the encoding and retrieval of action-related language (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Previous studies showed that alpha oscillations of electroencephalogram data are correlated with subjective perceived pain. Based on this finding, this study is aimed at assessing chronic low back pain based on alpha oscillations. Multichannel electroencephalogram data were recorded from 27 subjects with chronic low back pain under the simple conditions of closing eyes or opening eyes. Spectral analyses were conducted to extract the alpha band responses, and the alpha powers were calculated for the two conditions, respectively. Normalized alpha power was calculated by subtracting the alpha power in the eyes-open condition from that in the eyes-closed condition. The correlation between the alpha power and the subjective pain intensity was evaluated in frontal, central, and posterior regions. The normalized alpha power in the central region was negatively correlated with the subjective pain intensity (R=-0.50, P=0.01), with the strongest correlation occurring at the Cz electrode (R=-0.59, P=0.04). The correlation analysis results demonstrated the possibility of using the differences of alpha spectral power between eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions as a measure for assessing chronic low back pain. The findings suggest that the normalized alpha power in the central region may be used as a measurable and quantitative indicator of chronic pain for clinical applications.

Social factors may partially skew the distribution, but it remains that left-hand dominant individuals make up approximately 40 million people in the United States alone and yet, remain underrepresented in the motor control literature. Recent research has revealed behavioral and neurological differences between populations, therein overturning assumptions of a simple hemispheric flip in motor-related activations. The present work showed differentially adaptable motor programs between populations and found fundamental differences in methods of skill acquisition highlighting underlying neural strategies unique to each population. Difference maps and descriptive metrics of coherent activation patterns showed differences in how theta oscillations were utilized. The right-hand group relied on occipital parietal lobe connectivity for visual information integration necessary to inform the motor task, while the left-hand group relied on a more frontal lobe localized cognitive based approach.

Evidence and urgency related EEG signals during dynamic decision making in humans	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PERCEPTUAL DECISION; EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION; NEURAL BASIS; MODEL; P300; MECHANISMS; REPRESENTATION; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; PARAMETERS	A successful class of models link decision-making to brain signals by assuming that evidence accumulates to a decision threshold. These evidence accumulation models have identified neuronal activity that appears to reflect sensory evidence and decision variables that drive behavior. More recently, an additional evidence-independent and time-variant signal, named urgency, has been hypothesized to accelerate decisions in the face of insufficient evidence. However, most decision-making paradigms tested with fMRI or EEG in humans have not been designed to disentangle evidence accumulation from urgency. Here we use a face-morphing decision-making task in combination with EEG and a hierarchical Bayesian model to identify neural signals related to sensory and decision variables, and to test the urgency-gating model. 40 females and 34 males took part (mean age 23.4). We find that an evoked potential time-locked to the decision, the centroparietal positivity, reflects the decision variable from the computational model. We further show that the unfolding of this signal throughout the decision process best reflects the product of sensory evidence and an evidence-independent urgency signal. Urgency varied across subjects, suggesting that it may represent an individual trait. Our results show that it is possible to use EEG to distinguish neural signals related to sensory evidence accumulation, decision variables, and urgency. These mechanisms expose principles of cognitive function in general and may have applications to the study of pathological decision-making as in impulse control and addictive disorders. Significance Statement: Perceptual decisions are often described by a class of models that assumes sensory evidence accumulates gradually over time until a decision threshold is reached. In the present study, we demonstrate that an additional urgency signal impacts how decisions are formed. This endogenous signal encourages one to respond as time elapses. We found that neural decision signals measured by EEG reflect the product of sensory evidence and an evidence-independent urgency signal. A nuanced understanding of human decisions, and the neural mechanisms that support it, can improve decision-making in many situations and potentially ameliorate dysfunction when it has gone awry.

A comparison of GABA-ergic (propofol) and non-GABA-ergic (dexmedetomidine) sedation on visual and motor cortical oscillations, using magnetoencephalography	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; Oscillations; Neurophysiology; Propofol; Dexmedetomidine; Conscious sedation	EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; GAMMA FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; ALPHA-RHYTHMS; EEG; ANESTHESIA; MOVEMENTS; RESPONSES; CORTEX; MODEL	Studying changes in cortical oscillations can help elucidate the mechanistic link between receptor physiology and the clinical effects of anaesthetic drugs. Propofol, a GABA-ergic drug produces divergent effects on visual cortical activity: increasing induced gamma-band responses (GBR) while decreasing evoked responses. Dexmedetomidine, an alpha 2- adrenergic agonist, differs from GABA-ergic sedatives both mechanistically and clinically as it allows easy arousability from deep sedation with less cognitive side-effects. Here we use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to characterize and compare the effects of GABA-ergic (propofol) and non-GABA-ergic (dexmedetomidine) sedation, on visual and motor cortical oscillations. Sixteen male participants received target-controlled infusions of propofol and dexmedetomidine, producing mild-sedation, in a placebo-controlled, cross-over study. MEG data was collected during a combined visuomotor task. The key findings were that propofol significantly enhanced visual stimulus induced GBR (44% increase in amplitude) while dexmedetomidine decreased it (40%). Propofol also decreased the amplitudes of the Mv100 (visual M100) (27%) and Mv150 (52%) visual evoked fields (VEF), whilst dexmedetomidine had no effect on these. During the motor task, neither drug had any significant effect on movement related gamma synchrony (MRGS), movement related beta de-synchronisation (MRBD) or Mm100 (movement-related M100) movement-related evoked fields (MEF), although dexmedetomidine slowed the Mm300. Dexmedetomidine increased (92%) post-movement beta synchronisation/rebound (PMBR) power while propofol reduced it (70%, statistically non-significant). Overall, dexmedetomidine and propofol, at equisedative doses, produce contrasting effects on visual induced GBR, VEF, PMBR and MEF. These findings provide a mechanistic link between the known receptor physiology of these sedative drugs with their known clinical effects and may be used to explore mechanisms of other anaesthetic drugs on human consciousness.

Phase-locked auditory stimulation of theta oscillations during rapid eye movement sleep	SLEEP			English	Article						auditory stimulation; theta; rapid eye movement sleep	CLOSED-LOOP STIMULATION; SLOW OSCILLATIONS; REM-SLEEP; ACOUSTIC STIMULATION; MEMORY REACTIVATION; EMOTIONAL MEMORY; PREFRONTAL THETA; CONSOLIDATION; ENHANCEMENT; SPINDLES	Auditory closed-loop stimulation is a non-invasive technique that has been widely used to augment slow oscillations during non-rapid eye movement sleep. Based on the principles of closed-loop stimulation, we developed a novel protocol for manipulating theta activity (3-7 Hz) in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Sixteen healthy young adults were studied in two overnight conditions: Stimulation and Sham. In the Stimulation condition, 1 s of 5 Hz amplitude-modulated white noise was delivered upon detection of two supra-threshold theta cycles throughout REM sleep. In the Sham condition, corresponding time points were marked but no stimulation was delivered. Auditory stimulation entrained EEG activity to 5 Hz and evoked a brief (similar to 0.5 s) increase in theta power. Interestingly, this initial theta surge was immediately followed by a prolonged (similar to 3 s) period of theta suppression. Stimulation also induced a prolonged (similar to 2 s) increase in beta power. Our results provide the first demonstration that the REM sleep theta rhythm can be manipulated in a targeted manner via auditory stimulation. Accordingly, auditory stimulation might offer a fruitful avenue for investigating REM sleep electrophysiology and its relationship to behavior.

BCI learning induces core-periphery reorganization in M/EEG multiplex brain networks	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						BCI training; MEG; EEG; multilayer networks; brain networks	GENDERED CITATION PATTERNS; MOTOR IMAGERY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MACHINE INTERFACES; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; EEG ALPHA; MEG; CORTEX; LOCALIZATION; PERFORMANCE	Objective. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) constitute a promising tool for communication and control. However, mastering non-invasive closed-loop systems remains a learned skill that is difficult to develop for a non-negligible proportion of users. The involved learning process induces neural changes associated with a brain network reorganization that remains poorly understood. Approach. To address this inter-subject variability, we adopted a multilayer approach to integrate brain network properties from electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic data resulting from a four-session BCI training program followed by a group of healthy subjects. Our method gives access to the contribution of each layer to multilayer network that tends to be equal with time. Main results. We show that regardless the chosen modality, a progressive increase in the integration of somatosensory areas in the alpha band was paralleled by a decrease of the integration of visual processing and working memory areas in the beta band. Notably, only brain network properties in multilayer network correlated with future BCI scores in the alpha(2) band: positively in somatosensory and decision-making related areas and negatively in associative areas. Significance. Our findings cast new light on neural processes underlying BCI training. Integrating multimodal brain network properties provides new information that correlates with behavioral performance and could be considered as a potential marker of BCI learning.

The mechanisms underlying their generation and occurrence in higher mammals are unclear. Unfortunately, anesthetic doses of pure ketamine attenuate HFO, which has precluded their investigation under anesthesia. Here, we show ketamine-xylazine (KX) anesthesia is associated with a prominent 80-130 Hz rhythm in the olfactory bulb (OB) of rats, whereas 30-65 Hz gamma power is diminished. Simultaneous LFP and thermocouple recordings revealed the 80-130 Hz rhythm was dependent on nasal respiration. This rhythm persisted despite surgical excision of the piriform cortex. Silicon probes spanning the dorsoventral aspect of the OB revealed this rhythm was strongest in ventral areas and associated with microcurrent sources about the mitral layer. Pharmacological microinfusion studies revealed dependency on excitatory-inhibitory synaptic activity, but not gap junctions. Finally, a similar rhythm occurred in the OB of KX-anesthetized cats, which shared key features with our rodent studies. We conclude that the activity we report here is driven by nasal airflow, local excitatory-inhibitory interactions, and conserved in higher mammals. Additionally, KX anesthesia is a convenient model to investigate further the mechanisms underlying wake-related ketamine-dependent HFO.

We suggest that analyzing the dynamics of mu rhythms over the course of a trial using event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) is useful for disentangling the competing hypotheses. Our findings suggest that there is automatic activation of motor and premotor areas of the brain that occurs while passively listening to speech, and that this activation is not present while listening to noise. Moreover, this activation is more strongly present in the low alpha frequencies, which are associated with attention, when participants engage in active discrimination of stimuli, and late in the trial prior to a button press.

The mechanisms underlying functional body-brain coupling, however, are poorly understood, as are the ways in which they modulate behavior. We acquired respiration and human magnetoencephalography data from a near-threshold spatial detection task to investigate the trivariate relationship between respiration, neural excitability, and performance. Respiration was found to significantly modulate perceptual sensitivity as well as posterior alpha power (8-13 Hz), a well-established proxy of cortical excitability. In turn, alpha suppression prior to detected versus undetected targets underscored the behavioral benefits of heightened excitability. Notably, respiration-locked excitability changes were maximized at a respiration phase lag of around -30 degrees and thus temporally preceded performance changes. In line with interoceptive inference accounts, these results suggest that respiration actively aligns sampling of sensory information with transient cycles of heightened excitability to facilitate performance.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, and early diagnosis is crucial to delay disease progression. The diagnosis of early PD has always been a difficult clinical problem due to the lack of reliable biomarkers. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most common clinical detection method, and studies have attempted to discover the EEG spectrum characteristics of early PD, but the reported conclusions are not uniform due to the heterogeneity of early PD patients. There is an urgent need for a more advanced algorithm to extract spectrum characteristics from EEG to satisfy the personalized requirements. Approach. The structured power spectral density with spatial distribution was used as the input of convolutional neural network (CNN). A visualization technique called gradient-weighted class activation mapping was used to extract the optimal frequency bands for identifying early PD. Based on the model visualization, we proposed a novel quantitative index of spectral characteristics, spatial-mapping relative power (SRP), to detect personalized abnormalities in the spatial spectral characteristics of EEG in early PD. Main results. We demonstrated the feasibility of applying CNN to identify the patients with early PD with an accuracy of 99.87% +/- 0.03%. The models indicated the characteristic frequency bands (high-delta (3.5-4.5 Hz) and low-alpha (7.5-11 Hz) frequency bands) that are used to identify the early PD. The SRP of these two characteristic bands in early PD patients was significantly higher than that in the control group, and the abnormalities were consistent at the group and individual levels. Significance. This study provides a novel personalized detection algorithm based on deep learning to reveal the optimal frequency bands for identifying early PD and obtain the spatial frequency characteristics of early PD. The findings of this study will provide an effective reference for the auxiliary diagnosis of early PD in clinical practice.

Hitherto, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying attentional allocation upon reward/loss associated nonsalient stimulus remain hardly investigated. The present study built the association between nonsalient stimuli and value, and tested it with a decision-making task. Consequently, we examined whether and how reward/loss-associated nonsalient stimuli (as distractors) influenced attentional allocation in a rapid serial visual presentation task. Behavioral analysis showed a significantly faster recognition of target in the loss condition compared to performance in the neutral/reward conditions. Electrophysiological results showed that rewardassociated distractors induced a significant Pd component, while loss-associated distractors induced a significantly higher theta oscillation. These results demonstrated that subjects could proactively suppress rewardassociated distractors. More importantly, we showed that attentional allocation upon reward/loss-associated nonsalient distractors is supported by distinct neural mechanisms.

However, the related modulation of cortical networks followed by behavioral changes has not been investigated. The objective of this study is to establish a relationship between BB oscillatory brain activity evoked by stimulation and a behavioral response in a short term memory task. Three Groups A, B, and C of 20 participants each received alpha (10 Hz), beta (14 Hz), and gamma (30 Hz) BB, respectively, for 15 min. Their EEG was recorded in pre, during, and post BB states. Participants performed a digit span test before and after a BB session. A significant increase in the cognitive score was found only for Group A while a significant decrease in reaction time was noted for Groups A and C. Group A had a significant decrease of theta and increase of alpha power, and a significant increase of theta and decrease of gamma imaginary coherence (ICH) post BB. Group C had a significant increase in theta and gamma power accompanied by the increase of theta and gamma ICH post BB. The effectiveness of BB depends on the frequency of stimulation. A putative neural mechanism involves an increase in theta ICH in parieto-frontal and interhemispheric frontal networks.

However, relatively little is known about how to relate features of such aggregate neural recordings to the functional and anatomical configurations of the underlying neural circuits that produce them. An important neural circuit parameter which has profound effects on neural network dynamics and neural function is the ratio between excitation and inhibition (E:I), which has been found to be atypical in many neuropsychiatric conditions. Here we used simulations of recurrent networks of point-like leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons to study how to infer parameters such as the E:I ratio or the magnitude of the external input of the network from aggregate electrical measures. We used approximations (or proxies), validated in previous work, to generate realistic LFPs and EEGs from simulations of such networks. We computed different spectral features from simulated neural mass signals, such as the 1/f spectral power law or the Hurst exponent (H), and studied how these features changed when we changed the E:I ratio or the strength of the external input of the network model. We discuss how different spectral features of aggregate signals relate to the E:I ratio or the strength of the external input and outline our efforts to fit our model, in future work, to multiple measures extracted from empirical recordings of aggregate neural activity.

Here, we define the oscillatory mechanisms supporting selection of "where" and "when" features from visual WM storage and investigate the role of pFC in feature selection. Fourteen individuals with lateral pFC damage and 20 healthy controls performed a visuospatial WM task while EEG was recorded. On each trial, two shapes were presented sequentially in a top/bottom spatial orientation. A retro-cue presented mid-delay prompted which of the two shapes had been in either the top/bottom spatial position or first/second temporal position. We found that cross-frequency coupling between parieto-occipital alpha (alpha; 8-12 Hz) oscillations and topographically distributed gamma (gamma; 30-50 Hz) activity tracked selection of the distinct cued feature in controls. This signature of feature selection was disrupted in patients with pFC lesions, despite intact alpha-gamma coupling independent of feature selection. These findings reveal a pFC-dependent parieto-occipital alpha-gamma mechanism for the rapid selection of visual WM representations.

We recorded electroencephalogram during food choices while participants responded naturally or regulated their choices by attending to health attributes or decreasing attention to taste attributes. Using a drift diffusion model, we predicted the time course of neural signals associated with AVC and EA. Results suggested that event-related potentials (ERPs) correlated with the time course of model-predicted taste-attribute signals, with no modulation by regulation. By contrast, suppression of frontal and occipital alpha power correlated with the time course of EA, tracked tastiness according to its goal relevance, and predicted individual variation in successful down-regulation of tastiness. Additionally, an earlier rise in frontal and occipital theta power represented food tastiness more strongly during regulation and predicted a weaker influence of food tastiness on behaviour. Our findings illuminate how regulation modifies the representation of attributes during the process of EA.

However, working memory performance in patients with restless legs syndrome remains uncertain. The present study aimed to examine working memory performance in patients with restless legs syndrome by investigating electroencephalography theta-band oscillations within task-relevant brain regions and the synchronization among oscillations during a working memory task. Twelve female idiopathic patients with restless legs syndrome and 12 female healthy controls participated in this study. Nineteen-channel electroencephalography data were recorded while participants performed a Sternberg working memory task. We analysed event-related theta-band activity and interregional theta-band phase synchrony during the memory retrieval phase. The spatial pattern of theta-band phase synchrony was quantified using graph theory measures, including the clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, and small-world propensity. Considerable increases in theta-band activity and theta-band phase synchrony were observed at 600-700 ms in controls and at 650-750 ms in restless legs syndrome subjects after the probe item was presented. During this period, induced theta-band activity showed lower with borderline significance in the restless legs syndrome subjects than in the controls regardless of channel location (F-4,F-88 = 3.92, p = .06). Theta-band phase synchrony between the frontal and posterior regions was significantly reduced in the restless legs syndrome subjects. Inefficiency in both global and local networks in the restless legs syndrome subjects was revealed by the decreased small-world propensity (t(22) = 2.26, p = .03). Small-world propensity was negatively correlated with restless legs syndrome severity (r = -.65, p = .02). Our findings suggest that patients with restless legs syndrome have multiple deficits in cognitive processes, including attentional allocation, evaluation of incoming stimuli, and memory manipulation of encoded information during a working memory task. Abnormal local theta-band neural synchrony and global theta-band neural synchrony may underlie the neurophysiological mechanism of the working memory dysfunction associated with restless legs syndrome.

Increase in Beta Power Reflects Attentional Top-Down Modulation After Psychosocial Stress Induction	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						anxiety; heart rate (HR); attentional control; beta band frequency; psychosocial stress	EMOTION REGULATION; SOCIAL STRESS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; HIGH-FREQUENCY; EEG DYNAMICS; SYNCHRONIZATION	Selective attention depends on goal-directed and stimulus-driven modulatory factors, each relayed by different brain rhythms. Under certain circumstances, stress-related states can change the balance between goal-directed and stimulus-driven factors. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying these changes remain unclear. In this study, we explored how psychosocial stress can modulate brain rhythms during an attentional task and a task-free period. We recorded the EEG and ECG activity of 42 healthy participants subjected to either the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a controlled procedure to induce stress, or a comparable control protocol (same physical and cognitive effort but without the stress component), flanked by an attentional task, a 90 s of task-free period and a state of anxiety questionnaire. We observed that psychosocial stress induced an increase in heart rate (HR), self-reported anxiety, and alpha power synchronization. Also, psychosocial stress evoked a relative beta power increase during correct trials of the attentional task, which correlates positively with anxiety and heart rate increase, and inversely with attentional accuracy. These results suggest that psychosocial stress affects performance by redirecting attentional resources toward internal threat-related thoughts. An increment of endogenous top-down modulation reflected an increased beta-band activity that may serve as a compensatory mechanism to redirect attentional resources toward the ongoing task. The data obtained here may contribute to designing new ways of clinical management of the human stress response in the future and could help to minimize the damaging effects of persistent stressful experiences.

Thirty-six undergraduate female students who were identified as either high or low math performers, according to an arithmetic fluency test, were recruited. In the main experiment, EEG recordings were taken, while the participants performed a mental addition task. The mental addition problems were classified as either easy or difficult, and were presented to participants in several forms. The results indicated that problem difficulty increases the gap in accuracy attainment between high and low math performers. Additionally, high performers displayed larger alpha power during mental arithmetic in P7, corresponding to the left parietal lobe. This indicated that combining behavioral and neural data can improve our understanding of the differences between high and low math performers. Interpretations and implications are discussed.

Spontaneous cortical MEG activity undergoes unique age- and sex-related changes during the transition to adolescence	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography (MEG); Resting state; Frequency; Power; Development	DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; MENTAL ROTATION; FRONTAL-LOBE; CHILDHOOD; EEG; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS	Background: While numerous studies have examined the developmental trajectory of task-based neural oscillations during childhood and adolescence, far less is known about the evolution of spontaneous cortical activity during this time period. Likewise, many studies have shown robust sex differences in task-based oscillations during this developmental period, but whether such sex differences extend to spontaneous activity is not understood. Methods: Herein, we examined spontaneous cortical activity in 111 typically-developing youth (ages 9-15 years; 55 male). Participants completed a resting state magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recording and a structural MRI. MEG data were source imaged and the power within five canonical frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) was computed. The resulting power spectral density maps were analyzed via vertex-wise ANCOVAs to identify spatially-specific effects of age, sex, and their interaction. Results: We found robust increases in power with age in all frequencies except delta, which decreased over time, with findings largely confined to frontal cortices. Sex effects were distributed across frontal and temporal regions; females tended to have greater delta and beta power, whereas males had greater alpha. Importantly, there was a significant age-by-sex interaction in theta power, such that males exhibited decreasing power with age while females showed increasing power with age in the bilateral superior temporal cortices. Discussion: These data suggest that the strength of spontaneous activity undergoes robust change during the transition from childhood to adolescence (i.e., puberty onset), with intriguing sex differences in some cortical areas. Future developmental studies should probe task-related oscillations and spontaneous activity in parallel.

Spatio-spectral relationships between pathological neural dynamics and cognitive impairment along the Alzheimer's disease spectrum	ALZHEIMER'S & DEMENTIA: DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT & DISEASE MONITORING			English	Article						neural oscillations; neuropsychology; resting-state magnetoencephalography	OSCILLATIONS; STATE; EEG; MEG; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY	Introduction: Numerous studies have described aberrant patterns of rhythmic neural activity in patients along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum, yet the relationships between these pathological features and cognitive decline are uncertain. Methods: We acquired magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from 38 amyloid-PET biomarker-confirmed patients on the AD spectrum and a comparison group of biomarker-negative cognitively normal (CN) healthy adults, alongside an extensive neuropsychological battery. Results: By modeling whole-brain rhythmic neural activity with an extensive neuropsychological profile in patients on the AD spectrum, we show that the spectral and spatial features of deviations from healthy adults in neural population-level activity inform their relevance to domain-specific neurocognitive declines. Discussion: Regional oscillatory activity represents a sensitive metric of neuronal pathology in patients on the AD spectrum. By considering not only the spatial, but also the spectral, definitions of cortical neuronal activity, we show that domain-specific cognitive declines can be better modeled in these individuals.

Autoscopic hallucinations are changes in self-consciousness determined by a mismatch in integration of multiple sensory inputs. Our goal is to highlight the brain network involved in generation of autoscopic hallucination elicited by electrical stimulation of a PVNH in a drug resistant epilepsy patient. Our patient was explored using stereo-electroencephalography with electrodes covering the right posterior temporal PVNH and the adjacent cortex. Direct electrical high frequency stimulation of the PVNH elicited autoscopic hallucinations mainly involving the face and upper trunk. We then used multiple modalities to determine brain connectivity: single pulse electrical stimulation of the PVNH and stimulation-evoked potentials were used to highlight resting state effective connectivity. High-frequency stimulation using alternating polarity pulses enabled us to identify the network involved, time-locked to the clinical effect and to map symptom-related effective connectivity. Functional connectivity using a non-linear regression method was used to determine dependencies between different cortical regions following the stimulation. Finally, structural connectivity was highlighted using deterministic fiber tracking. Multi-modal connectivity analysis identified a network involving the PVNH, occipital and temporal neocortex, fusiform gyrus and parietal cortex. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The analysis of the regional field power (RFP) showed evidence that different cortical areas respond with different time delays to CO2 challenges. An opposite behavior was found for the end-tidal O-2. We suppose that the different cortical time delays likely expresse specific ascending pathways to the cortex, generated by chemoreceptor nuclei in the brain stem. Although the brain stem is in charge of the automatic control of ventilation, the cortex is involved in the voluntary control of breathing but also receives inputs from the brain stem, which influences the perception of breathing, the arousal state and sleep architecture in conditions of hypoxia/hypercapnia. We evaluated in 11 healthy subjects the effects of breath hold (BH; 30 s of apneas and 30 s of normal breathing) and BH-related CO2/O-2 changes on electroencephalogram (EEG) global field power (GFP) and RFP in nine different areas (3 rostrocaudal sections: anterior, central, and posterior; and 3 sagittal sections: left, middle, and right) in the delta- and alpha-bands by cross correlation analysis. No significant differences were observed in GFP or RFP when comparing free breathing (FB) with the BH task. Within the BH task, the shift from apnea to normal ventilation was accompanied by an increase in the delta-power and a decrease in the alpha-power. The end-tidal pressure of CO2(PETCO2) was positively correlated with the delta-band and negatively with the alpha-band with a positive time shift, whereas an opposite behavior was found for the end-tidal pressure of O-2(PETO2). Notably, the time shift between PETCO2/PETO2 signals and cortical activity at RFP was heterogenous and seemed to follow a hierarchical activation, with the delta-band responding earlier than the alpha-band. Overall, these findings suggest that the effect of BH on the cortex may follow specific ascending pathways from the brain stem and be related to chemoreflex stimulation. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We demonstrated that the end tidal CO2 oscillation causes oscillations of delta and alpha bands. The analysis of the regional field power showed that different cortical areas respond with different time delays to CO2 challenges. An opposite behavior was found for the end-tidal O-2. We can suppose that the different cortical time delay response likely expresses specific ascending pathways to the cortex generated by chemoreceptor nuclei in the brainstem.

However, whether the conditions most favourable for bottom-up attention change with the addition of top-down cues is unclear. To explore the characteristics of favourable oscillations during bottom-up processing, in experiment 1, 36 participants completed a selective atten-tion task (visual search) without cues. Then, in experiment 2, we examined whether favourable oscillatory char-acteristics were changed by top-down attentional cues; in this experiment, 62 subjects were asked to perform an attention network task. We found that without anticipation, oscillatory states that were associated with better performance were characterized by lower theta power in the frontal area, higher alpha power in the occipital area, higher beta power in the frontal area, and weaker gamma-theta amplitude-envelope coupling in the parietal area. However, some characteristics that were associated with better performance, including theta power and low beta power, were changed after the addition of different cues. In addition, there were some new characteristics related to improved performance under temporal and spatial anticipation. These results suggest that top-down attention implements a more energy-efficient strategy to process information, optimizing the process of bottom-up atten-tion.& nbsp; (c) 2021 IBRO.

An Electrophysiological Study of Brain Rhythms in the Rhesus Monkey Macaca mulatta	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						monkey; electrocorticogram; oscillations; photostimulation; resonance frequency	CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; RESONANCE PHENOMENA; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; STIMULI; FLICKER; SYNCHRONIZATION; POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; CHILDREN	Rhythmic light stimulation can alter the electrical activity of the human and animal brain. Moreover, the brain response to certain flicker frequencies significantly exceeds the responses to neighboring frequencies. This phenomenon is thought to be related with the effect of resonance, as evidenced by the coincidence of one of the maxima in the profile of the response to flashes with the frequency of the alpha rhythm. However, other frequencies that cause an increased response to flashes are not reflected in electroencephalogram (EEG) as dominant oscillations. The goal of this study was to reveal the relationship between local maxima in the profile of the responses to flashes of different frequencies and dominant brain oscillations recorded in electrocorticogram (ECoG) of rhesus monkeys without stimulation. The study was carried out on four male rhesus monkeys Macaca mulatta. In three animals, peak responses were elicited by flickers at 8 and 16 Hz, while one monkey showed the second peak in the 22-30 Hz range. The first maximum (8-10 Hz) in the profile of the response to rhythmic photostimulation coincided with the dominant rhythm recorded in the occipital and parietal regions at rest. The second maximum at 16 Hz coincided with the dominant ECoG rhythm in one of the primates when it was in the state of emotional arousal, which may account for the resonant origin of the increase in responses in this frequency range. The data obtained indicate that dominant brain rhythms, including latent rhythms revealed only by rhythmic photostimulation, can coincide in frequency in monkeys and humans. The mechanisms behind the selective sensitivity of neural networks to different frequencies of photostimulation are discussed.	[Harauzov, A. K.; Klimuk, M. A.; Ivanova, L. E.; Podvigina, D.

Cannabis use impacts pre-stimulus neural activity in the visual cortices of people with HIV	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						gamma; magnetoencephalography; MEG; neural oscillations; neurocognitive decline; visuospatial processing	STATE EEG RHYTHMS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION NETWORK; MEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; INTERFERENCE; MODULATION; MARIJUANA; MOTION; PHASE	People with HIV (PWH) use cannabis at a higher rate than the general population, but the influence on neural activity is not well characterized. Cannabis use among PWH may have a beneficial effect, as neuroinflammation is known to be a critical problem in PWH and cannabis use has been associated with a reduction in proinflammatory markers. Thus, it is important to understand the net impact of cannabis use on brain and cognitive function in PWH. In this study, we collected magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain imaging data on 81 participants split across four demographically matched groups (i.e., PWH using cannabis, controls using cannabis, non-using PWH, and non-using controls). Participants completed a visuospatial processing task during MEG. Time-frequency resolved voxel time series were extracted to identify the dynamics of oscillatory and pre-stimulus baseline neural activity. Our results indicated strong theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (10-16 Hz), and gamma (62-72 Hz) visual oscillations in parietal-occipital brain regions across all participants. PWH exhibited significant behavioral deficits in visuospatial processing, as well as reduced theta oscillations and elevated pre-stimulus gamma activity in visual cortices, all of which replicate prior work. Strikingly, chronic cannabis use was associated with a significant reduction in pre-stimulus gamma activity in the visual cortices, such that PWH no longer statistically differed from controls. These results provide initial evidence that cannabis use may normalize some neural aberrations in PWH. This study fills an important gap in understanding the impact of cannabis use on brain and cognitive function in PWH.

The use of brain imaging methods to investigate the underlying neurobiological brain activations that occur during conflict processing have demonstrated a strong involvement of the fronto-parietal attention network (FPAN). Surprisingly, the directional interconnections, their time courses and activations at different frequency bands remain to be elucidated, and thus, this constitutes the focus of this study. The shared information flow between brain areas of the FPAN is provided for frequency bands ranging from the theta to the lower gamma band (4-40 Hz). We employed an adaptation of the Simon task utilizing Magnetoencephalography (MEG). Granger causality was applied to investigate interconnections between the active brain regions, as well as their directionality. Following stimulus onset, the middle frontal precentral cortex and superior parietal cortex were significantly activated during conflict processing in a time window of between 300 to 600ms. Important differences in causality were found across frequency bands between processing of conflicting stimuli in the left as compared to the right visual hemifield. The exchange of information from and to the FPAN was most prominent in the beta band. Moreover, the anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior insula represented key areas for conflict monitoring, either by receiving input from other areas of the FPAN or by generating output themselves. This indicates that the salience network is at least partly involved in processing conflict information. The present study provides detailed insights into the underlying neural mechanisms of the FPAN, especially regarding its temporal characteristics and directional interconnections.

It has been proposed that there are truly epileptogenic and less pathological or even protective IEDs. Recent studies suggest that highly pathological IEDs are characterized by high-frequency oscillations (HFOs). Here, we aimed to dissect these 'HFO-IEDs' at the single-neuron level, hypothesizing that the underlying mechanisms are distinct from 'non-HFO-IEDs'. Analysing hybrid depth electrode recordings from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, we found that single-unit firing rates were higher in HFO- than in non-HFO-IEDs. HFO-IEDs were characterized by a pronounced pre-peak increase in firing, which coincided with the preferential occurrence of HFOs, whereas in non-HFOIEDs, there was only a mild pre-peak increase followed by a post-peak suppression. Comparing each unit's firing during HFO-IEDs to its baseline activity, we found many neurons with a significant increase during the HFO component or ascending part, but almost none with a decrease. No such imbalance was observed during non-HFO-IEDs. Finally, comparing each unit's firing directly between HFO- and non-HFO-IEDs, we found that most cells had higher rates during HFO-IEDs and, moreover, identified a distinct subset of neurons with a significant preference for this IED subtype. In summary, our study reveals that HFO- and non-HFO-IEDs have different single-unit correlates. In HFO-IEDs, many neurons are moderately activated, and some participate selectively, suggesting that both types of increased firing contribute to highly pathological IEDs.

Oscillatory Entrainment of the Frequency-following Response in Auditory Cortical and Subcortical Structures	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory cortex; brainstem; entrainment; frequency-following response; magnetoencephalography; oscillations	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN-STEM; SPEECH; DISCRIMINATION; STIMULATION; PRINCIPLES; DURATION; ALPHA; SOUND	There is much debate about the existence and function of neural oscillatory mechanisms in the auditory system. The frequency-following response (FFR) is an index of neural periodicity encoding that can provide a vehicle to study entrainment in frequency ranges relevant to speech and music processing. Criteria for entrainment include the presence of poststimulus oscillations and phase alignment between stimulus and endogenous activity. To test the hypothesis of entrainment, in experiment 1 we collected FFR data for a repeated syllable using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography in 20 male and female human adults. We observed significant oscillatory activity after stimulus offset in auditory cortex and subcortical auditory nuclei, consistent with entrainment. In these structures, the FFR fundamental frequency converged from a lower value over 100 ms to the stimulus frequency, consistent with phase alignment, and diverged to a lower value after offset, consistent with relaxation to a preferred frequency. In experiment 2, we tested how transitions between stimulus frequencies affected the MEG FFR to a train of tone pairs in 30 people. We found that the FFR was affected by the frequency of the preceding tone for up to 40 ms at subcortical levels, and even longer durations at cortical levels. Our results suggest that oscillatory entrainment may be an integral part of periodic sound representation throughout the auditory neuraxis. The functional role of this mechanism is unknown, but it could serve as a fine-scale temporal predictor for frequency information, enhancing stability and reducing susceptibility to degradation that could be useful in real-life noisy environments.

Considering that functional lateralization can be affected by handedness, spinal and cerebral pain-related responses may be different between right- and left-handed individuals. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the cortical and spinal mechanisms of nociceptive integration when nociceptive stimuli are applied to right -handed vs. left -handed individuals. The NFR, evoked potentials (ERP: P45, N100, P260), and event-related spectral perturbations (ERSP: theta, alpha, beta and gamma band oscillations) were compared between ten right-handed and ten left-handed participants. Pain was induced by transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the lower limbs and left upper limb. Stimulation intensity was adjusted individually in five counterbalanced conditions of 21 stimuli each: three unilateral (right lower limb, left lower limb, and left upper limb stimulation) and two bilateral conditions (right and left lower limbs, and the right lower limb and left upper limb stimulation). The amplitude of the NFR, ERP, ERSP, and pain ratings were compared between groups and conditions using a mixed ANOVA. A significant increase of responses was observed in bilateral compared with unilateral conditions for pain intensity, NFR amplitude, N100, theta oscillations, and gamma oscillations. However, these effects were not significantly different between right- and left-handed individuals. These results suggest that spinal and cerebral integration of bilateral nociceptive inputs is similar between right- and left-handed individuals. They also imply that pain-related responses measured in this study may be examined independently of handedness.

J	Bae, GY				Bae, Gi-Yeul			Neural evidence for categorical biases in location and orientation representations in a working memory task	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG decoding; Categorical bias; Visual working memory	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; COLOR; PSYCHOPHYSICS; PRECISION; CAPACITY; MODEL; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATIONS; PERCEPTION	Previous research demonstrated that visual representations in working memory exhibit biases with respect to the categorical structure of the stimulus space. However, a majority of those studies used behavioral measures of working memory, and it is not clear whether the working memory representations per se are influenced by the categorical structure or whether the biases arise in decision or response processes during the report. Here, I applied a multivariate decoding technique to EEG data collected during working memory tasks to determine whether neural activity associated with the representations in working memory is categorically biased prior to the report. I found that the decoding of spatial working memory was biased away from the nearest cardinal location, consistent with the biases observed in the behavioral responses. In a follow-up experiment which was designed to prevent the use of a response preparation strategy, I found that the decoding still exhibited categorical biases. Together, these results provide neural evidence that working memory representations themselves are categorically biased, imposing important constraints on the models of working memory representations.

Detection of these two sleep stages will help researchers in many applications to detect sleep related diseases and disorders and also in many fields of neuroscience studies such as cognitive impairment and memory consolidation. Since manual sleep staging is time-consuming, subjective, and expensive; designing an efficient automatic sleep scoring system will overcome some of these difficulties. Many studies have proposed automatic sleep staging systems with different methods. In recent years, deep learning methods show their potential in different applications. In this study, we propose SWS and REM detection system by using a deep neural network. In the proposed system we use a kernel-based layer to get the system closer to the manual scoring approach. Also, we use a new method for augmenting EEG signals to prevent overfitting the network. The results show the efficiency of the designed system in SWS and REM detection.

Amble Gait EEG Points at Complementary Cortical Networks Underlying Stereotypic Multi-Limb Co-ordination	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						amble gait; EEG; multi-limb coordination; anti-phase; arm swing; supplementary motor area; right hemisphere; event related spectral perturbations	SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BIMANUAL COORDINATION; ARM; PREMOTOR; CORTEX; WALKING; OSCILLATIONS; ACTIVATION; MOVEMENTS	Background: Walking is characterized by stable antiphase relations between upper and lower limb movements. Such bilateral rhythmic movement patterns are neuronally generated at levels of the spinal cord and brain stem, that are strongly interconnected with cortical circuitries, including the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA). Objective To explore cerebral activity associated with multi-limb phase relations in human gait by manipulating mutual attunement of the upper and lower limb antiphase patterns. Methods: Cortical activity and gait were assessed by ambulant EEG, accelerometers and videorecordings in 35 healthy participants walking normally and 19 healthy participants walking in amble gait, where upper limbs moved in-phase with the lower limbs. Power changes across the EEG frequency spectrum were assessed by Event Related Spectral Perturbation analysis and gait analysis was performed. Results: Amble gait was associated with enhanced Event Related Desynchronization (ERD) prior to and during especially the left swing phase and reduced Event Related Synchronization (ERS) at final swing phases. ERD enhancement was most pronounced over the putative right premotor, right primary motor and right parietal cortex, indicating involvement of higher-order organization and somatosensory guidance in the production of this more complex gait pattern, with an apparent right hemisphere dominance. The diminished within-step ERD/ERS pattern in amble gait, also over the SMA, suggests that this gait pattern is more stride driven instead of step driven. Conclusion: Increased four-limb phase complexity recruits distributed networks upstream of the primary motor cortex, primarily lateralized in the right hemisphere. Similar parietal-premotor involvement has been described to compensate impaired SMA function in Parkinson's disease bimanual antiphase movement, indicating a role as cortical support regions.

In these tasks, participants adapt their decision-making strategies following exposure to incongruent stimuli. According to conflict monitoring accounts, conflict -ing stimulus features are detected in medial frontal cortex, and the extent of experienced conflict scales with response time (RT) and frontal theta-band activity in the Electroencephalogram (EEG). However, the consequent adjustments to decision processes following response conflict are not well-specified. To characterise these ad-justments and their neural implementation we recorded EEG during a modified Flanker task. We traced the time-courses of performance monitoring processes (frontal theta) and multiple processes related to perceptual decision-making. In each trial participants judged which of two overlaid gratings forming a plaid stimulus (termed the S1 target) was of higher contrast. The stimulus was divided into two sections, which each contained higher contrast gratings in either congruent or incongruent directions. Shortly after responding to the S1 target, an addi-tional S2 target was presented, which was always congruent. Our EEG results suggest enhanced sensory evidence representations in visual cortex and reduced evidence accumulation rates for S2 targets following incongruent S1 stimuli. Results of a follow-up behavioural experiment indicated that the accumulation of sensory evidence from the incongruent (i.e. distracting) stimulus element was adjusted following response conflict. Frontal theta ampli-tudes positively correlated with RT following S1 targets (in line with conflict monitoring accounts). Following S2 targets there was no such correlation, and theta amplitude profiles instead resembled decision evidence accu-mulation trajectories. Our findings provide novel insights into how cognitive control is implemented following exposure to conflicting information, which is critical for extending conflict monitoring accounts.

However, little is known about possible age-related behavioral changes, and how the human substantia nigra (SN) signals positive and negative social information. Therefore, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) from the SN of Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients ( n = 12, intraoperative, OFF medication) in combination with a social incentive delay task including photos of neutral, positive or negative human gestures and mimics as feedback. We also tested a group of non-operated PD patients ( n = 24, ON and OFF medication), and a sample of healthy young ( n = 51) and older ( n = 52) adults with behavioral readouts only. Behaviorally, the anticipation of both positive and negative social feedback equally accelerated response times in contrast to neutral social feedback in healthy young and older adults. Although this effect was not significant in the group of operated PD patients - most likely due to the small sample size - iEEG recordings in their SN showed a significant increase in alpha -beta power (9-20 Hz) from 300 to 600 ms after cue onset again for both positive and negative cues. Finally, in non-operated PD patients, the behavioral effect was not modulated by medication status (ON vs OFF medication) suggesting that other processes than dopaminergic neuromodulation play a role in driving invigoration by social incentives. Together, our findings provide novel and direct evidence for a role of the SN in processing positive and negative social information via specific oscillatory mechanisms in the alpha-beta range, and they suggest that anticipating social value in simple cue-outcome associations is intact in healthy aging and PD.

Motor imagery (MI), based on the theory of mirror neurons and neuroplasticity, can promote motor cortical activation in neurorehabilitation. The strategy of MI based on brain-computer interface (BCI) has been used in rehabilitation training and daily assistance for patients with hemiplegia in recent years. However, it is difficult to maintain the consistency and timeliness of receiving external stimulation to neural activation in most subjects owing to the high variability of electroencephalogram (EEG) representation across trials/subjects. Moreover, in practical application, MI-BCI cannot highly activate the motor cortex and provide stable interaction owing to the weakness of the EEG feature and lack of an effective mode of activation. Approach. In this study, a novel hybrid BCI paradigm based on MI and vestibular stimulation motor imagery (VSMI) was proposed to enhance the capability of feature response for MI. Twelve subjects participated in a group of controlled experiments containing VSMI and MI. Three indicators, namely, activation degree, timeliness, and classification accuracy, were adopted to evaluate the performance of the task. Main results. Vestibular stimulation could significantly strengthen the suppression of alpha and beta bands of contralateral brain regions during MI, that is, enhance the activation degree of the motor cortex (p< 0.01). Compared with MI, the timeliness of EEG feature-response achieved obvious improvements in VSMI experiments. Moreover, the averaged classification accuracy of VSMI and MI was 80.56% and 69.38%, respectively. Significance. The experimental results indicate that specific vestibular activity contributes to the oscillations of the motor cortex and has a positive effect on spontaneous imagery, which provides a novel MI paradigm and enables the preliminary exploration of sensorimotor integration of MI.

SLEEP			English	Article						slow oscillations; aging; sex differences; slow waves; EEG; sleep; nonrapid eye movement sleep	CORTICAL SYNCHRONIZATION; MEMORY IMPROVEMENT; DEPENDENT MEMORY; MIDDLE YEARS; EEG; GENDER; HOMEOSTASIS; SKULL; YOUNG; MEN	Aging is associated with reduced slow wave (SW) density (number SW/min in nonrapid-eye movement sleep) and amplitude. It has been proposed that an age-related decrease in SW density may be due to a reduction in electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude instead of a decline in the capacity to generate SW. Here, we propose a data-driven approach to adapt SW amplitude criteria to age and sex. We predicted that the adapted criteria would reduce age and sex differences in SW density and SW characteristics but would not abolish them. A total of 284 healthy younger and older adults participated in one night of sleep EEG recording. We defined age- and sex-adapted SW criteria in a first cohort of younger (n = 97) and older (n = 110) individuals using a signal-to-noise ratio approach. We then used these age- and sex-specific criteria in an independent second cohort (n = 77, 38 younger and 39 older adults) to evaluate age and sex differences on SW density and SW characteristics. After adapting SW amplitude criteria, we showed maintenance of an age-related difference for SW density whereas the sex-related difference vanished. Indeed, older adults produced less SW compared with younger adults. Specifically, the adapted SW amplitude criteria increased the probability of occurrence of low amplitude SW (<80 mu V) for older men especially. Our results thereby confirm an age-related decline in SW generation rather than an artifact in the detection amplitude criteria. As for the SW characteristics, the age- and sex-adapted criteria display reproducible effects across the two independent cohorts suggesting a more reliable inventory of the SW.

We aimed to study its effects on cortical excitability, oscillatory patterns, and motor function, the main aim being to identify potentially beneficial neurophysiological effects.Materials and Methods: We applied randomized real or placebo stimulation over the unaffected primary motor cortex of 10 subacute (7 +/- 3 days) post-stroke patients. Neurophysiological measurements were performed using electroencephalography and electromyography. Motor function was assessed with the Wolf Motor Function Test. We performed a repeated measure study with the recordings taken pre-, post-cTBS, and at 3 months' follow-up.Results: We investigated changes in motor rhythms during arm elevation and thumb opposition tasks and found significant changes in beta power of the affected thumb's opposition, specifically after real cTBS. Our results are consistent with an excitatory response (increase in event-related desynchronization) in the sensorimotor cortical areas of the affected hemisphere, after stimulation. Neither peak-to-peak amplitude of motor-evoked potentials nor motor performance were significantly altered.Conclusions: Consistently with the theoretical prediction, this contralateral inhibitory stimulation paradigm changes neurophysiology, leading to a significant excitatory impact on the cortical oscillatory patterns of the contralateral hemisphere. These proof-of-concept results provide evidence for the potential role of continuous TBS in the neurorehabilitation of post-stroke patients. We suggest that these changes in ERS/ERD patterns should be further explored in future phase IIb/phase III clinical trials, in larger samples of poststroke patients.

However, in contrast with the large number of studies reporting neuroanatomical differences in activation relative to young adults, changes of temporal dynamics of neural activity during normal and pathological aging have been grossly understudied and are still poorly known. Here, we synthesize the current state of knowledge from MEG and EEG studies that aimed at specifying the effects of healthy and pathological aging on local and network dynamics, and discuss the clinical and theoretical implications of these findings. We argue that considering the temporal dynamics of brain activations and networks could provide a better understanding of changes associated with healthy aging, and the progression of neurodegenerative disease. Recent research has also begun to shed light on the association of these dynamics with other imaging modalities and with individual differences in cognitive performance. These insights hold great potential for driving new theoretical frameworks and development of biomarkers to aid in identifying and treating age-related cognitive changes.	[Courtney, S.

BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						gestures; EEG; intra-brain connectivity	SENSORIMOTOR ALPHA; SOCIAL-INTERACTION; EEG; OSCILLATIONS; THETA; PERCEPTION; ATTENTION; EMOTION; MOTOR; MU	Recently, the neurosciences have become interested in the investigation of neural responses associated with the use of gestures. This study focuses on the relationship between the intra-brain and inter-brain connectivity mechanisms underlying the execution of different categories of gestures (positive and negative affective, social, and informative) characterizing non-verbal interactions between thirteen couples of subjects, each composed of an encoder and a decoder. The study results underline a similar modulation of intra- and inter-brain connectivity for alpha, delta, and theta frequency bands in specific areas (frontal or posterior regions) depending on the type of gesture. Moreover, taking into account the gestures' valence (positive or negative), a similar modulation of intra- and inter-brain connectivity in the left and right sides was observed. This study showed congruence in the intra-brain and inter-brain connectivity trend during the execution of different gestures, underlining how non-verbal exchanges might be characterized by intra-brain phase alignment and implicit mechanisms of mirroring and synchronization between the two individuals involved in the social exchange.

The association of polygenic risk for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression with neural connectivity in adolescents and young adults: examining developmental and sex differences	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; EEG COHERENCE; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; IDENTIFIES 30; OSCILLATIONS; LINKAGE; LOCI; SYNCHRONIZATION; ABNORMALITIES	Neurodevelopmental abnormalities in neural connectivity have been long implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia (SCZ); however, it remains unclear whether these neural connectivity patterns are associated with genetic risk for SCZ in unaffected individuals (i.e., an absence of clinical features of SCZ or a family history of SCZ). We examine whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) for SCZ are associated with functional neural connectivity in adolescents and young adults without SCZ, whether this association is moderated by sex and age, and if similar associations are observed for genetically related neuropsychiatric PRS. One-thousand four-hundred twenty-six offspring from 913 families, unaffected with SCZ, were drawn from the Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) prospective cohort (median age at first interview = 15.6 (12-26), 51.6% female, 98.1% European American, 41% with a family history of alcohol dependence). Participants were followed longitudinally with resting-state EEG connectivity (i.e., coherence) assessed every two years. Higher SCZ PRS were associated with elevated theta (3-7 Hz) and alpha (7-12 Hz) EEG coherence. Associations differed by sex and age; the most robust associations were observed between PRS and parietal-occipital, central-parietal, and frontal-parietal alpha coherence among males between ages 15-19 (B: 0.15-0.21, p < 10(-4)). Significant associations among EEG coherence and Bipolar and Depression PRS were observed, but differed from SCZ PRS in terms of sex, age, and topography. Findings reveal that polygenic risk for SCZ is robustly associated with increased functional neural connectivity among young adults without a SCZ diagnosis. Striking differences were observed between men and women throughout development, mapping onto key periods of risk for the onset of psychotic illness and underlining the critical importance of examining sex differences in associations with neuropsychiatric PRS across development.

It is a very tedious task for clinicians to monitor the entire sleep durations of the subjects and analyse the sleep staging in traditional and manual laboratory environmental methods. For the purpose of accurate diagnosis of different sleep disorders, we have considered the automated analysis of sleep epochs, which were collected from the subjects during sleep time. The complete process of an automated approach of sleep stages' classification is majorly executed through four steps: pre-processing the raw signals, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. In this study, we have extracted 12 statistical properties from input signals. The proposed models are tested in three different combinations of features sets. In the first experiment, the feature set contained all the 12 features. The second and third experiments were conducted with the nine and five best features. The patient records come from the ISRUC-Sleep database. The highest classification accuracy was achieved for sleep staging through combinations with the five feature set. From the categories of the subjects, the reported accuracy results were found to exceed above 90%. As per the outcome from the proposed system the random forest classification techniques achieved best accuracy incomparable to that of the other two classifiers.

Electroencephalogram- (EEG-) based detection of SI could assist in understanding SI neuroscientific causes that, as a result, could explain the SI role in student's learning. In this study, 26 participants were selected based on questionnaires to participate in the mathematics classroom experiment. SI and personal interest (PI) questionnaires along with knowledge tests were undertaken to measure student's interest and knowledge levels. A hybrid method combining empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and wavelet transform was developed and employed for feature extraction. The proposed method showed significant difference using the multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) test and consistently outperformed other methods in the classification performance using weighted k-nearest neighbours (wkNN). The high classification accuracy of 85.7% with the sensitivity of 81.8% and specificity of 90% revealed that brain oscillation patterns of high SI students are somewhat different than students with low or no SI. In addition, the result suggests that the delta rhythm could have a significant effect on cognitive processing.

They have proven especially fruitful for understanding brain rhythms. However, although motivated by neurobiological considerations they are phenomenological in nature, and cannot hope to recreate some of the rich repertoire of responses seen in real neuronal tissue. Here we consider a simple spiking neuron network model that has recently been shown to admit an exact mean-field description for both synaptic and gap-junction interactions. The mean-field model takes a similar form to a standard neural mass model, with an additional dynamical equation to describe the evolution of within-population synchrony. As well as reviewing the origins of this next generation mass model we discuss its extension to describe an idealised spatially extended planar cortex. To emphasise the usefulness of this model for EEG/MEG modelling we show how it can be used to uncover the role of local gap-junction coupling in shaping large scale synaptic waves.

Being at an embryonic stage, it is difficult to find consensus regarding the applied methodology to achieve the best results. This study focused on understanding one of the major methodological issues-the training session frequency. The aim of the investigation was to understand if there are differences between performing two sessions or three sessions per week in enhancement of alpha activity and improvement of cognition; and in case there are differences, infer the best protocol. Forty-five athletes were randomly assigned to the three-session-training-per-week group, the two-session-training-per-week group and a control group. The results showed that neurofeedback training with three sessions per week was more effective in increase of alpha amplitude during neurofeedback training than two sessions per week. Furthermore, only the three-session-per-week group showed significant enhancement in N-back and oddball performance after training. The findings suggested more condensed training protocol lead to better outcomes, providing guidance on neurofeedback protocol design in order to optimize training efficacy.

In this work, we used the diffusion decision model and multi-electrode EEG signals to study the impact of neuronal activity during the preparatory period on the following decision process in an attention task. Two groups were defined by fast and slow responses during the performance of control trials. A third, control group performed the same experiment but with instructions defining signal for response execution. We observed that the fast-responding group had a shorter duration of nondecision processes (describing both stimulus encoding and response preparation) preceded by lower power of the frontal upper alpha (10-15 Hz) and central beta (21-26 Hz) activities during the preparatory period. To determine whether these differences were followed by a shortening of the early perceptual or late motor process, we analyzed lateralized readiness potential (LRP). The time from LRP onset until response execution (LRP-RT interval) was similar in all three groups, enabling us to interpret shortening of nondecision time as reflecting faster stimulus encoding.

Delirium, Caffeine, and Perioperative Cortical Dynamics	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						postoperative cognitive changes; electroencephalography; delirium; cognitive aging; cognitive dysfunction	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; POSTOPERATIVE DELIRIUM; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; SURGERY; MORTALITY; KETAMINE; OUTCOMES; RISK; EEG	Delirium is a major public health issue associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, particularly after surgery. While the neurobiology of delirium remains incompletely understood, emerging evidence suggests that cognition requires close proximity to a system state called criticality, which reflects a point of dynamic instability that allows for flexible access to a wide range of brain states. Deviations from criticality are associated with neurocognitive disorders, though the relationship between criticality and delirium has not been formally tested. This study tested the primary hypothesis that delirium in the postanesthesia care unit would be associated with deviations from criticality, based on surrogate electroencephalographic measures. As a secondary objective, the impact of caffeine was also tested on delirium incidence and criticality. To address these aims, we conducted a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial that tested the effects of intraoperative caffeine on postoperative recovery in adults undergoing major surgery. In this substudy, whole-scalp (16-channel) electroencephalographic data were analyzed from a subset of trial participants (n = 55) to determine whether surrogate measures of neural criticality - (1) autocorrelation function of global alpha oscillations and (2) topography of phase relationships via phase lag entropy - were associated with delirium. These measures were analyzed in participants experiencing delirium in the postanesthesia care unit (compared to those without delirium) and in participants randomized to caffeine compared to placebo. Results demonstrated that autocorrelation function in the alpha band was significantly reduced in delirious participants, which is important given that alpha rhythms are postulated to play a vital role in consciousness. Moreover, participants randomized to caffeine demonstrated increased alpha autocorrelation function concurrent with reduced delirium incidence. Lastly, the anterior-posterior topography of phase relationships appeared most preserved in non-delirious participants and in those receiving caffeine. These data suggest that early postoperative delirium may reflect deviations from neural criticality, and caffeine may reduce delirium risk by shifting cortical dynamics toward criticality.

However, little is known whether fragmented reading (FR) affects cognition and what are the underlying electroencephalogram (EEG) alterations it may lead to. Purpose: This study aimed to identify whether individuals have FR habits based on the single-trial EEG spectral features using machine learning (ML), as well as to find out the potential cognitive impairment induced by FR. Methods: Subjects were recruited through a questionnaire and divided into FR and noFR groups according to the time they spent on FR per day. Moreover, 64-channel EEG was acquired in Continuous Performance Task (CPT) and segmented into 0.5-1.5 s post-stimulus epochs under cue and background conditions. The sample sizes were as follows: FR in cue condition, 692 trials; noFR in cue condition, 688 trials; FR in background condition, 561 trials; noFR in background condition, 585 trials. For these single-trials, the relative power (RP) of six frequency bands [delta (1-3 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta1 (14-20 Hz), beta2 (21-29 Hz), lower gamma (30-40 Hz)] were extracted as features. After feature selection, the most important feature sets were fed into three ML models, namely Support-Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Naive Bayes to perform the identification of FR. RP of six frequency bands was also used as feature sets to conduct classification tasks. Results: The classification accuracy reached up to 96.52% in the SVM model under cue conditions. Specifically, among six frequency bands, the most important features were found in alpha and gamma bands. Gamma achieved the highest classification accuracy (86.69% for cue, 86.45% for background). In both conditions, alpha RP in central sites of FR was stronger than noFR (p < 0.001). Gamma RP in the frontal site of FR was weaker than noFR in the background condition (p < 0.001), while alpha RP in parieto-occipital sites of FR was stronger than noFR in the cue condition (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Fragmented reading can be identified based on single-trial EEG evoked by CPT using ML, and the RP of alpha and gamma may reflect the impairment on attention and working memory by FR. FR might lead to cognitive impairment and is worth further exploration.

Given that in predictive coding higher frequencies have been associated with prediction errors, while lower frequencies have been linked to expectations, we tested the hypothesis that alpha-to-beta ERD and gamma ERS induced by aversive pictures are associated with expectations and prediction errors, respectively. We recorded EEG while volunteers were involved in a probabilistically cued affective picture task using three different negative valences to produce expectations and prediction errors. Our data show that alpha-to-beta band activity after stimulus presentation was related to the expected valence of the stimulus as predicted by a cue. The absolute mismatch of the expected and actual valence, which denotes an absolute prediction error was related to increases in alpha, beta and gamma band activity. This demonstrates that top-down predictions and bottom-up prediction errors are represented in typical spectral patterns associated with affective picture processing. This study provides direct experimental evidence that negative affective picture processing can be described by neuronal predictive coding computations.

Neural basis of the visual working memory deficit in schizophrenia: Merging evidence from fMRI and EEG	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; fMRI; Visual working memory; Schizophrenia; Alpha oscillations; Event-related desynchronization; Posterior parietal cortex	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; ALPHA; CAPACITY; MAINTENANCE; PERFORMANCE; SYNCHRONY; PEOPLE	Although people with schizophrenia (PSZ) exhibit robust and reliable deficits in working memory (WM) capacity, the neural processes that give rise to this impairment remain poorly understood. One reason for this lack of clarity is that most studies employ a single neural recording modality-each with strengths and weaknesses-with few examples of integrating results across modalities. To address this gap, we conducted a secondary analysis that combined data from an overlapping set of subjects in previously published electroencephalographic and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that used nearly identical working memory tasks (visual change detection). The prior studies found similar patterns of results for both posterior parietal BOLD activation and suppression of the alpha frequency band within the EEG. Specifically, both signals exhibited abnormally shallow modulation as a function of the amount of information being stored in WM in PSZ. In the present study, both alpha suppression and posterior parietal BOLD activity increased as the number of items stored in WM increased. The magnitude of alpha suppression modulation was correlated with the magnitude of BOLD signal modulation in PSZ, but not in HCS. This finding suggests that the same illness-related biological processes constrain both alpha suppression and BOLD signal modulation as a function of WM storage in PSZ. The complementary strengths of these two techniques may thus combine to advance the identification of the processes underlying WM deficits in PSZ.

Although it is a promising tool, the variability of tACS results has raised questions regarding the robustness and reproducibility of its effects. Building on recent research using tACS to modulate visuospatial attention, we here attempted to replicate findings of lateralized parietal tACS at alpha frequency to induce a change in attention bias away from the contra- towards the ipsilateral visual hemifield. 40 healthy participants underwent tACS in two separate sessions where either 10 Hz tACS or sham was applied via a high-density montage over the left parietal cortex at 1.5 mA for 20 min, while performance was assessed in an endogenous attention task. Task and tACS parameters were chosen to match those of previous studies reporting positive effects. Unlike these studies, we did not observe lateralized parietal alpha tACS to affect attention deployment or visual processing across the hemifields as compared to sham. Likewise, additional resting electroencephalography immediately offline to tACS did not reveal any notable effects on individual alpha power or frequency. Our study emphasizes the need for more replication studies and systematic investigations of the factors that drive tACS effects.

This has generated considerable interest, both in clinical and research endeavors, in characterizing the relationship between disturbed sleep and schizophrenia. Sleep features can be objectively assessed with EEG recordings. Traditionally, EEG studies have focused on sleep architecture, which includes non-REM and REM sleep stages. More recently, numerous studies have investigated alterations in sleep-specific rhythms, including EEG oscillations, such as sleep spindles and slow waves, in individuals with schizophrenia compared with control subjects. In this article, the author reviews state-of-the-art evidence of disturbed sleep in schizophrenia, starting from the relationship between sleep disturbances and clinical symptoms. First, the author presents studies demonstrating abnormalities in sleep architecture and sleep-oscillatory rhythms in schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders, with an emphasis on recent work demonstrating sleep spindles and slow-wave deficits in early-course and first-episode schizophrenia. Next, the author shows how these sleep abnormalities relate to the cognitive impairments in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and point to dysfunctions in underlying thalamocortical circuits, Ca+ channel activity, and GABA-glutamate neurotransmission. Finally, the author discusses some of the next steps needed to further establish the role of altered sleep in schizophrenia, including the need to investigate sleep abnormalities across the psychotic spectrum and to establish their relationship with circadian disturbances, which in turn will contribute to the development of novel sleep-informed treatment interventions.

Using simultaneous EEG and fMRI, we previously identified the neural correlates of this relationship, including activation of the thalamus, bilateral putamen, medial frontal gyrus, middle cingulate cortex, and precuneus. However, research to date has focussed primarily on non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and spindles per se, thus overlooking the possibility that brain activity that occurs in other sleep-wake states might also be related to cognitive abilities. In our current study, we sought to investigate whether brain activity across sleep/wake states is also related to human intelligence in N = 29 participants. During NREM sleep, positive correlations were observed between fluid intelligence and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activations in the bilateral putamen and the paracentral lobule/precuneus, as well as between short-term memory (STM) abilities and activity in the medial frontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. During wake, activity in bilateral postcentral gyri and occipital lobe was positively correlated with short-term memory abilities. In participants who experienced REM sleep in the scanner, fluid intelligence was positively associated with midbrain activation, and verbal intelligence was associated with right postcentral gyrus activation. These findings provide evidence that the relationship between sleep and intellectual abilities exists beyond sleep spindles.

Neurophysiological biomarkers include ictal onsets and interictal spikes. Furthermore, the epileptic network shows oscillations with potential localization value and pathomechanistic implications. The cellular origin of such markers in invasive EEG in vivo remains to be clarified. Methods: In the presented pilot study, surgical brain samples and invasive EEG recordings of seven patients with surgically treated Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) type II were coregistered using a novel protocol. Dysmorphic neurons and balloon cells were immunohistochemically quantified. Evaluated markers included seizure onset, spikes, and oscillatory activity in delta, theta, gamma and ripple frequency bands, as well as sample entropy and phase-amplitude coupling between delta, theta, alpha and beta phase and gamma amplitude. Results: Correlations between histopathology and neurophysiology provided evidence for a contribution of dysmorphic neurons to interictal spikes, fast gamma activity and ripples. Furthermore, seizure onset and phase-amplitude coupling in areas with dysmorphic neurons suggests preserved connectivity is related to seizure initiation. Balloon cells showed no association. Conclusions: Phase-amplitude coupling, spikes, fast gamma and ripples are related to the density of dysmorphic neurons and localize the seizure onset zone. Significance: The results of our pilot study provide a new powerful tool to address the cellular source of abnormal neurophysiology signals to leverage current and novel biomarkers for the localization of epileptic activity in the human brain.

J	Michail, G; Jenner, LT; Keil, J				Michail, Georgios; Toran Jenner, Lino; Keil, Julian			Prestimulus alpha power but not phase influences visual discrimination of long-duration visual stimuli	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; EEG; individual alpha frequency; oscillation; perception; signal detection theory; visual		Occipital oscillations in the alpha band are closely related to visual perception and attention. In multiple studies, increased alpha power has been shown to reduce detection rates of hard-to-detect visual stimuli. Recent studies explain this finding by a shift in perceptual bias. Moreover, the phase of alpha oscillations prior to stimulus onset appears to be critical for the detection of visual stimuli. This is explained by a shift in cortical excitability over the course of each alpha cycle. However, prior studies often used short presentation times of visual stimuli at the perceptual threshold. Here, we use longer presentation times to elucidate whether the same mechanisms hold for the perception of salient but challenging visual stimuli presented for up to 1,500 ms. To this end, we presented participants with hard to distinguish but salient upright or tilted Gaussian gratings in a two-alternative forced choice task, while recording occipital electroencephalographic activity. Previous reports link alpha power to stimulus detection hit rates, and we found that low prestimulus power at the individual alpha frequency relates to higher perceptual accuracy. Contrary to recent findings, we neither found an influence of alpha power on criterion, nor an influence of alpha phase on perception or response speed. We argue that longer presentation times might attenuate a possible response bias, and increased excitability might sharpen the discrimination ability, thereby leading to increased perceptual accuracy and unaffected response criterion.

Effects of Acute Ethanol Intoxication on Local Field Potentials in the Rat Lateral Septum	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						ethanol; addiction; lateral septum (LS); local field potentials (LFPs); septogram; acute alcohol intoxication	ALCOHOL; OSCILLATIONS; NEURONS; ORIGIN; POWER; LFP; EEG	The lateral septum (LS) is an important part of the limbic and reward brain systems; its activity has been associated with the development of different aspects of addiction. Using a stereotaxically inserted semi-microelectrode, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the rat LS under background conditions and after i.p. injection of 2.0 g/kg body mass 15% ethanol (Ethl) solution. The recorded LFPs showed typical 1/f behavior. Acute Ethl intoxication resulted in increases in the spectral power of nearly all frequency LFP ranges, except the beta-1 sub-band. A prominent peak has been detected in the beta-1 sub-band centered at 14.77 Hz. Ethanol intoxication resulted in a shift of this peak toward 13.70 Hz with simultaneous decrease in the power of the above sub-band. Powers of most LFP ranges/subranges under conditions of the above intoxications demonstrated increments, most intense for delta, beta-2, gamma-high, and epsilon (ultrafast, >90 Hz) oscillations. Changes in the relatively highfrequency LFP components are assumed to reflect Ethl-induced modifications of the activity of local LS neuronal ensembles, while those of low-frequency (delta) oscillations are probably related to global modulation of the activity of the entire brain. It is supposed that the observed changes caused by acute Ethl intoxication may reflect mainly intensification of GABA-mediated signaling.	[Chaikovska, O., V; Rokunets, I.

Previous hypotheses suggested that slow and fast spindles or spindles with various spatial extent may be generated in different circuits with various cortical laminar innervation patterns. We used NREM sleep EEG data recorded from four human epileptic patients undergoing presurgical electrophysiological monitoring with subdural electrocorticographic grids (ECoG) and implanted laminar microelectrodes penetrating the cortex (IME). The position of IMEs within cortical layers was confirmed using postsurgical histological reconstructions. Many spindles detected on the IME occurred only in one layer and were absent from the ECoG, but with increasing amplitude simultaneous detection in other layers and on the ECoG became more likely. ECoG spindles were in contrast usually accompanied by IME spindles. Neither IME nor ECoG spindle cortical profiles were strongly associated with sleep spindle frequency or globality. Multiple-unit and single-unit activity during spindles, however, was heterogeneous across spindle types, but also across layers and patients. Our results indicate that extremely local spindles may occur in any cortical layer, but co-occurrence at other locations becomes likelier with increasing amplitude and the relatively large spindles detected on ECoG channels have a stereotypical laminar profile. We found no compelling evidence that different spindle types are associated with different laminar profiles, suggesting that they are generated in cortical and thalamic circuits with similar cortical innervation patterns. Local neuronal activity is a stronger candidate mechanism for driving functional differences between spindles subtypes.

Especially early during motor learning, cognitive functions such as attentional engagement, are essential, e.g., to discover relevant visual stimuli. Drawing participant's attention towards task-relevant stimuli-e.g., with task instructions using visual cues or explicit written information-is a common practice to support cognitive engagement during training and, hence, accelerate motor learning. However, there is little scientific evidence about how visually cued or written task instructions affect attentional brain networks during motor learning. In this experiment, we trained 36 healthy participants in a virtual motor task: surfing waves by steering a boat with a joystick. We measured the participants' motor performance and observed attentional brain networks using alpha-band electroencephalographic (EEG) activity before and after training. Participants received one of the following task instructions during training: (1) No explicit task instructions and letting participants surf freely (implicit training; IMP); (2) Task instructions provided through explicit visual cues (explicit-implicit training; E-IMP); or (3) through explicit written commands (explicit training; E). We found that providing task instructions during training (E and E-IMP) resulted in less post-training motor variability-linked to enhanced performance-compared to training without instructions (IMP). After training, participants trained with visual cues (E-IMP) enhanced the alpha-band strength over parieto-occipital and frontal brain areas at wave onset. In contrast, participants who trained with explicit commands (E) showed decreased fronto-temporal alpha activity. Thus, providing task instructions in written (E) or using visual cues (E-IMP) leads to similar motor performance improvements by enhancing activation on different attentional networks. While training with visual cues (E-IMP) may be associated with visuo-attentional processes, verbal-analytical processes may be more prominent when written explicit commands are provided (E). Together, we suggest that training parameters such as task instructions, modulate the attentional networks observed during motor practice and may support participant's cognitive engagement, compared to training without instructions.

While group analysis suggested a correlation between surgical removal of HFO generating tissue and seizure free outcome, HFO could not predict seizure outcome on an individual patient level. One possible explanation is the lack of differentiation between physiological and epileptic HFO. In the mesio-temporal lobe, a proportion of physiological ripples can be identified by their association with scalp sleep spindles. Spike associated ripples in contrast can be considered epileptic. This study investigated whether categorizing ripples by the co-occurrence with sleep spindles or spikes improves outcome prediction after surgery. Additionally, it aimed to investigate whether spindle-ripple association is limited to the mesio-temporal lobe structures or visible across the whole brain. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed EEG of 31 patients with chronic intracranial EEG. Sleep spindles in scalp EEG and ripples and epileptic spikes in iEEG were automatically detected. Three ripple subtypes were obtained: SpindleR, Non-SpindleR, and SpikeR. Rate ratios between removed and non-removed brain areas were calculated. We compared the distinct ripple subtypes and their rates in different brain regions, inside and outside seizure onset areas and between patients with good and poor seizure outcome. Results: SpindleR were found across all brain regions. SpikeR had significantly higher rates in the SOZ than in Non-SOZ channels. A significant positive correlation between removal of ripple-events and good outcome was found for the mixed ripple group (r(s) = 0.43, p = 0.017) and for ripples not associated with spindles (r(s)=0.40, p = 0.044). Also, a significantly high proportion of spikes associated with ripples were removed in seizure free patients (p = 0.036). Discussion: SpindleR are found in mesio-temporal and neocortical structures, indicating that ripple-spindle-coupling might have functional importance beyond mesio-temporal structures. Overall, the proportion of SpindleR was low and separating spindle and spike associated ripples did not improve outcome prediction in our patient group. SpindleR analysis therefore can be a tool to identify physiological events but needs to be used in combination with other methods to have clinical relevance.

It is largely unclear whether seizures with distinct onset patterns originate from varying network interactions and terminate through different termination pathways. Methods: We investigated the morphology and location of 103 intracranial EEG seizure onset and termination patterns from 20 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. We determined if seizure onset patterns were associated with specific termination patterns. Finally, we looked at network interactions prior to the generation of distinct seizure onset patterns by calculating directed functional connectivity matrices. Results: We identified nine seizure onset and six seizure termination patterns. The most common onset pattern was Low-Voltage Fast Activity (36 %), and the most frequent termination pattern was Burst Suppression (44 %). All seizures with fast (>13 Hz) termination patterns had a fast (>13 Hz) onset pattern type. Almost any onset pattern could terminate with the Burst Suppression and rhythmic Spike/PolySpike and Wave (rSW/rPSW) termination patterns. Seizures with a fast activity onset had higher inflow to the seizure onset zone from other regions in the gamma and high gamma frequency ranges prior to their generation compared to seizures with a slow onset. Significance: Our observations suggest that different mechanisms underlie the generation of different seizure onset patterns although seizure onset patterns can share a common termination pattern. Possible mechanisms underlying these patterns are discussed.

Microscale dynamics of electrophysiological markers of epilepsy	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Microelectrode; Interictal Discharges; High Frequency Oscillations	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; TEMPORAL-LOBE; FAST RIPPLES; PATTERNS; PROPAGATION; MECHANISMS; EEG; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHY; POTENTIALS	Objective: Interictal discharges (IIDs) and high frequency oscillations (HFOs) are established neurophysiologic biomarkers of epilepsy, while microseizures are less well studied. We used custom poly(3,4-ethy lenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) microelectrodes to better understand these markers' microscale spatial dynamics. Methods: Electrodes with spatial resolution down to 50 mm were used to record intraoperatively in 30 subjects. IIDs' degree of spread and spatiotemporal paths were generated by peak-tracking followed by clustering. Repeating HFO patterns were delineated by clustering similar time windows. Multi-unit activity (MUA) was analyzed in relation to IID and HFO timing. Results: We detected IIDs encompassing the entire array in 93% of subjects, while localized IIDs, observed across < 50% of channels, were seen in 53%. IIDs traveled along specific paths. HFOs appeared in small, repeated spatiotemporal patterns. Finally, we identified microseizure events that spanned 50-100 mm. HFOs covaried with MUA, but not with IIDs. Conclusions: Overall, these data suggest that irritable cortex micro-domains may form part of an underlying pathologic architecture which could contribute to the seizure network. Significance: These results, supporting the possibility that epileptogenic cortex comprises a mosaic of irritable domains, suggests that microscale approaches might be an important perspective in devising novel seizure control therapies.

This hierarchical structure-building is reflected in rhythmic neural activity across multiple timescales in E/MEG in healthy, awake participants. However, recent studies have shown evidence for this "cortical tracking" of higher-level linguistic structures also in a proportion of unresponsive patients. What does this tell us about these patients' residual levels of cognition and consciousness? Must the listener direct their attention toward higher level speech structures to exhibit cortical tracking, and would selective attention across levels of the hierarchy influence the expression of these rhythms? We investigated these questions in an EEG study of 72 healthy human volunteers listening to streams of monosyllabic isochronous English words that were either unrelated (scrambled condition) or composed of four-word-sequences building meaningful sentences (sentential condition). Importantly, there were no physical cues between four-word-sentences. Rather, boundaries were marked by syntactic structure and thematic role assignment. Participants were divided into three attention groups: from passive listening (passive group) to attending to individual words (word group) or sentences (sentence group). The passive and word groups were initially naive to the sentential stimulus structure, while the sentence group was not. We found significant tracking at word- and sentence rate across all three groups, with sentence tracking linked to left middle temporal gyrus and right superior temporal gyrus. Goal-directed attention to words did not enhance word-rate-tracking, suggesting that word tracking here reflects largely automatic mechanisms, as was shown for tracking at the syllable-rate before. Importantly, goal-directed attention to sentences relative to words significantly increased sentence-rate-tracking over left inferior frontal gyrus. This attentional modulation of rhythmic EEG activity at the sentential rate highlights the role of attention in integrating individual words into complex linguistic structures. Nevertheless, given the presence of high-level cortical tracking under conditions of lower attentional effort, our findings underline the suitability of the paradigm in its clinical application in patients after brain injury. The neural dissociation between passive tracking of sentences and directed attention to sentences provides a potential means to further characterise the cognitive state of each unresponsive patient.

However, we do not have a clear understanding of the degree working memory is impaired under prolonged TSD, nor do we know the underlying neurophysiological mechanism. In this study, we recorded EEG data from 64 subjects while they performed a working memory task during resting wakefulness, after 24 h TSD, and after 30 h TSD. ANOVA was used to verify performance differences between 24 h and 30 h TSD in working memory tasks: (1) reaction time and accuracy hit rates, (2) P200, N200, and P300 amplitude and latency in measurements of event-related potential, as well as (3) effective connectivity strength between brain areas associated with working memory. Compared to 24 h TSD, 30 h TSD significantly decreased accuracy hit rates and induced a larger N200 difference waveform. The effective connectivity analysis showed that 30 h TSD also decreased beta frequency in effective connection strength from the right insular lobe to the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Effective connection from the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex increased in the match condition of the 2-back task. In conclusion, 30 h TSD had a greater negative impact on working memory than 24 h TSD. This impairment of working memory is associated with decreased strength in the effective connection from the right insula to the left ACC.

Individual differences in pure tone averages and working memory are known to be critical indicators of speech in noise comprehension. Recent studies have suggested that tracking of the speech envelope in cortical oscillations <8 Hz may be an important mechanism related to speech comprehension by segmenting speech into words and phrases (delta, 1 to 4 Hz) or phonemes and syllables (theta, 4 to 8 Hz). The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which individual differences in pure tone averages, working memory, and cortical tracking of the speech envelope relate to speech in noise comprehension in older adults. Design: Cortical tracking of continuous speech was assessed using electroencephalography in older adults (60 to 80 years). Participants listened to speech in quiet and in the presence of noise (time-reversed speech) and answered comprehension questions. Participants completed Forward Digit Span and Backward Digit Span as measures of working memory, and pure tone averages were collected. An index of reduction in noise (RIN) was calculated by normalizing the difference between raw cortical tracking in quiet and in noise. Results: Comprehension question performance was greater for speech in quiet than for speech in noise. The relationship between RIN and speech in noise comprehension was assessed while controlling for the effects of individual differences in pure tone averages and working memory. Delta band RIN correlated with speech in noise comprehension, while theta band RIN did not. Conclusions: Cortical tracking by delta oscillations is robust to the effects of noise. These findings demonstrate that the magnitude of delta band RIN relates to individual differences in speech in noise comprehension in older adults. Delta band RIN may serve as a neural metric of speech in noise comprehension beyond the effects of pure tone averages and working memory.	[McHaney, Jacie R.; Gnanateja, G.

We studied whether prediction error response is associated with neural oscillations or asynchronous broadband activity. Electrocorticography was conducted in three male monkeys, who passively listened to the auditory roving oddball stimuli. Local field potentials (LFPs) recorded over the auditory cortex underwent spectral principal component analysis, which decoupled broadband and rhythmic components of the LFP signal. We found that the broadband component captured the prediction error response, whereas none of the rhythmic components were associated with statistical irregularities of sounds. The broadband component displayed more stochastic, asymmetrical multifractal properties than the rhythmic components, which revealed more self-similar dynamics. We thus conclude that the prediction error response is captured by neuronal populations generating asynchronous broadband activity, defined by irregular dynamic states, which, unlike oscillatory rhythms, appear to enable the neural representation of auditory prediction error response.

Subthalamic deep brain stimulation induces finely-tuned gamma oscillations in the absence of levodopa	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Local field potentials; Finely-tuned gamma; Adaptive deep brain stimulation; Feedback markers		Finely-tuned gamma (FTG) oscillations can be recorded from cortex or the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) on dopaminergic medication, and have been associated with dyskinesias. When recorded during deep brain stimulation (DBS) on medication the FTG is entrained to half the stimulation frequency. We investigated whether these characteristics are shared off medication by recording local field potentials (LFP) from the STN from externalised DBS leads in 14 PD patients after overnight withdrawal of medication. FTG was induced de-novo by DBS in the absence of dyskinesias in a third of our cohort. The FTG could outlast stimulation or arise only after DBS ceased. FTG frequencies decreased during and across consecutive DBS blocks, but did not shift with changing stimulation frequency off medication. Together with the sustained after-effects this argues against simple entrainment by DBS in the off medication state. We also found significant coherence between STN-LFP and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals at FTG frequencies.

Evaluating users' preference for the appearance of humanoid robots via event-related potentials and spectral perturbations	BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Users' preference; humanoid robot appearance; neural dynamics; ERP; ERSP		Even though humanoid robots are being applied to diverse areas, the formation of users' preference for the appearance of humanoid robots remains unknown. The present study investigated users' neural dynamics underlying preference formation to evaluate users' preference for the appearance of humanoid robots. EEG signals were recorded in a preference categorisation task, and neural dynamics were analysed via event-related potentials and time-frequency analysis. The results showed that in the early stage, the preferred humanoid robot appearances elicited enhanced parieto-occipital N1, frontal P2, and early central and parieto-occipital theta rhythm power than the non-preferred appearances. In the later stage, the preferred humanoid robot appearances elicited enhanced scalp-distributed LPP and later central and parieto-occipital theta power than the non-preferred appearances. The results suggested that the formation of users' preference for the appearance of humanoid robots has a distinctive dual-stage of neural dynamics. The study provides designers with an objective method in evaluating users' preference for the appearance of humanoid robots.

Whether alpha activity similarly predicts target visibility in perceptual suppression paradigms, another type of illusion commonly used to investigate visual awareness, is presently unclear. Here, we examined prestimulus alpha activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of healthy participants in the context of a generalized flash suppression (GFS) task during which salient target stimuli are rendered subjectively invisible in a subset of trials following the onset of a full-field motion stimulus. Unlike for masking or threshold paradigms, alpha (8-12 Hz) amplitude prior to motion onset was significantly higher when targets remained subjectively visible compared to trials during which the targets became perceptually suppressed. Furthermore, individual prestimulus alpha amplitudes strongly correlated with the individual trial-to-trial variability quenching following motion stimulus onset, indicating that variability quenching in visual cortex is closely linked to prestimulus alpha activity. We conclude that predictive correlates of conscious perception derived from perceptual suppression paradigms differ substantially from those obtained with "near threshold paradigms", possibly reflecting the effectiveness of the suppressor stimulus.

J	De Koninck, BP; Guay, S; Blais, H; De Beaumont, L				De Koninck, Beatrice P.; Guay, Samuel; Blais, Helene; De Beaumont, Louis			Parametric study of transcranial alternating current stimulation for brain alpha power modulation	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						alpha power modulation; tACS; EEG; brain oscillations; non-invasive brain stimulation	VISUAL ANALOG SCALE; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; THETA OSCILLATIONS; EEG ALPHA; PARIETAL ALPHA; FREQUENCY; TACS; CORTEX; EXCITABILITY; MECHANISMS	Transcranial alternating current stimulation, a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, has been used to increase alpha (8-12 Hz) power, the latter being associated with various brain functions and states. Heterogeneity among stimulation parameters across studies makes it difficult to implement reliable transcranial alternating current stimulation protocols, explaining the absence of consensus on optimal stimulation parameters to modulate the alpha rhythm. This project documents the differential impact of controlling for key transcranial alternating current stimulation parameters, namely the intensity, the frequency and the stimulation site (anterior versus posterior). Phase 1:20 healthy participants underwent 4 different stimulation conditions. In each experimental condition, stimulation via 2 electrodes was delivered for 20 min. Stimulation conditions were administered at PO7-PO8 or F3-F4 at individual's alpha frequency, or at individual's theta frequency or sham. Stimulation intensity was set according to each participant's comfort following a standardized unpleasantness scale (<= 40 out of 100) and could not exceed 6 mA. All conditions were counterbalanced. Phase 2: participants who tolerated higher intensity of stimulation (4-6 mA) underwent alpha-frequency stimulation applied over PO7-PO8 at 1mA to investigate wirhin-subject modulation of stimulation response according to stimulation intensity. Whether set over posterior or anterior cortical sites, alpha-frequency stimulation showed greater increase in alpha power relative to stimulation at theta frequency and sham stimulation. Posterior alpha-frequency stimulation showed a greater increase in alpha power relative to the adjacent frequency bands over frontal and occipito-parietal brain areas. Low intensity (1 mA) posterior alpha stimulation showed a similar increase in alpha power than at high (4-6 mA) intensity when measured immediately after stimulation. However, when tested at 60 min or 120 min, low intensity stimulation was associated with significantly superior alpha power increase relative to high intensity stimulation. This study shows that posterior individual's alpha frequency stimulation at higher intensities is well tolerated but fails to increase stimulation aftereffects recorded within 2 h of stimulation on brain oscillations of the corresponding frequency band. In sharp contrast, stimulating at 1 mA (regardless of phosphene generation or sensory perception) effectively and selectively modulates alpha power within that 2-h time window, thus validating that it as a reliable stimulus intensity for future studies. This study also shows that posterior alpha-frequency stimulation preferentially modulates endogenous brain oscillations of the corresponding frequency band. Moreover, our data suggest that posterior alpha-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation is a reliable and precise non-invasive brain stimulation technique for persistent modulation of both frontal and occipito-parietal alpha power.

In this work, we propose a new sparse representation classification scheme that extends current schemes by exploiting the graph properties of relevant features. Based on this scheme each test signal is represented as a linear combination of train signals. Our expectation is that this constrained linear combination, exploiting the graph's structure of the training data, will lead to representations that are more robust. Moreover, in order to avoid overfitting and provide a model with good generalization abilities we adopt the bayesian framework and, in particular, the Variational Bayesian Framework since we use a specific prior distribution to exploit the graph structure of the data. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on two SSVEP datasets achieving state-of-the-art performance against well known classification methods in SSVEP literature.

Predictive Feedback, Early Sensory Representations, and Fast Responses to Predicted Stimuli Depend on NMDA Receptors	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						NMDARs; predictive coding	FUSIFORM FACE AREA; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; GRANGER CAUSALITY; BAND OSCILLATIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; VISUAL-CORTEX; KETAMINE; MODEL; FEEDFORWARD; POWER	Learned associations between stimuli allow us to model the world and make predictions, crucial for efficient behavior (e.g., hearing a siren, we expect to see an ambulance and quickly make way). While there are theoretical and computational frameworks for prediction, the circuit and receptor-level mechanisms are unclear. Using high-density EEG, Bayesian modeling, and machine learning, we show that inferred "causal" relationships between stimuli and frontal alpha activity account for reaction times (a proxy for predictions) on a trial-by-trial basis in an audiovisual delayed match-to-sample task which elicited predictions. Predictive beta feedback activated sensory representations in advance of predicted stimuli. Low-dose ketamine, an NMDAR blocker, but not the control drug dexmedetomidine, perturbed behavioral indices of predictions, their representation in higher-order cortex, feedback to posterior cortex, and pre-activation of sensory templates in higher-order sensory cortex. This study suggests that predictions depend on alpha activity in higher-order cortex, beta feedback, and NMDARs, and ketamine blocks access to learned predictive information.

However, predictive models identifying who is prone to develop AUD and the biomarkers indicating a predisposition to AUD are still unclear. Our sample (n = 656) included offspring and non-offspring of European American (EA) and African American (AA) ancestry from the Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) who were recruited as early as age 12 and were unaffected at first assessment and reassessed years later as AUD (DSM-5) (n = 328) or unaffected (n = 328). Machine learning analysis was performed for 220 EEG measures, 149 alcohol-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a recent large Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) of alcohol use/misuse and two family history (mother DSM-5 AUD and father DSM-5 AUD) features using supervised, Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to test which features assessed before developing AUD predict those who go on to develop AUD. Age, gender, and ancestry stratified analyses were performed. Results indicate significant and higher accuracy rates for the AA compared with the EA prediction models and a higher model accuracy trend among females compared with males for both ancestries. Combined EEG and SNP features model outperformed models based on only EEG features or only SNP features for both EA and AA samples. This multidimensional superiority was confirmed in a follow-up analysis in the AA age groups (12-15, 16-19, 20-30) and EA age group (16-19). In both ancestry samples, the youngest age group achieved higher accuracy score than the two other older age groups. Maternal AUD increased the model's accuracy in both ancestries' samples. Several discriminative EEG measures and SNPs features were identified, including lower posterior gamma, higher slow wave connectivity (delta, theta, alpha), higher frontal gamma ratio, higher beta correlation in the parietal area, and 5 SNPs: rs4780836, rs2605140, rs11690265, rs692854, and rs13380649. Results highlight the significance of sampling uniformity followed by stratified (e.g., ancestry, gender, developmental period) analysis, and wider selection of features, to generate better prediction scores allowing a more accurate estimation of AUD development.

Distinct neural sources underlying visual word form processing as revealed by steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP)	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							VENTRAL OCCIPITOTEMPORAL CORTEX; INDIVIDUAL FACE DISCRIMINATION; IMPLICIT MEASURE; CHILDREN LEARN; LETTER STRINGS; TIME-COURSE; RESPONSES; PRINT; SENSITIVITY; MECHANISMS	EEG has been central to investigations of the time course of various neural functions underpinning visual word recognition. Recently the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) paradigm has been increasingly adopted for word recognition studies due to its high signal-to-noise ratio. Such studies, however, have been typically framed around a single source in the left ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOT). Here, we combine SSVEP recorded from 16 adult native English speakers with a data-driven spatial filtering approach-Reliable Components Analysis (RCA)-to elucidate distinct functional sources with overlapping yet separable time courses and topographies that emerge when contrasting words with pseudofont visual controls. The first component topography was maximal over left vOT regions with a shorter latency (approximately 180 ms). A second component was maximal over more dorsal parietal regions with a longer latency (approximately 260 ms). Both components consistently emerged across a range of parameter manipulations including changes in the spatial overlap between successive stimuli, and changes in both base and deviation frequency. We then contrasted word-in-nonword and word-in-pseudoword to test the hierarchical processing mechanisms underlying visual word recognition. Results suggest that these hierarchical contrasts fail to evoke a unitary component that might be reasonably associated with lexical access.	[Wang, Fang; Kaneshiro, Blair; Strauber, C.

However, empirical cross-scale investigations are relatively infrequent, because of limited data availability and to the difficulty of analyzing rich multivariate datasets. Here, we applied frequency-resolved multivariate source-separation analyses to characterize a large-scale dataset comprising spiking and local field potential (LFP) activity recorded simultaneously in three brain regions (prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, hippocampus) in freely-moving mice. We identified a constellation of multidimensional, inter-regional networks across a range of frequencies (2-200 Hz). These networks were reproducible within animals across different recording sessions, but varied across different animals, suggesting individual variability in network architecture. The theta band (similar to 4-10 Hz) networks had several prominent features, including roughly equal contribution from all regions and strong inter-network synchronization. Overall, these findings demonstrate a multidimensional landscape of large-scale functional activations of cortical networks operating across multiple spatial, spectral, and temporal scales during open-field exploration.

Brain state-dependent high-frequency activity as a biomarker for abnormal neocortical networks in an epileptic spasms animal model	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						epileptic spasms; high-frequency activity; multiunit activity; slow wave oscillations; up and down states	LESS-THAN-1 HZ OSCILLATION; INFANTILE SPASMS; FAST RIPPLES; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; SLEEP; EEG; HIPPOCAMPAL; MECHANISMS; CORTEX; HYPSARRHYTHMIA	Objective Epileptic spasms are a hallmark of a severe epileptic state. A previous study showed neocortical up and down states defined by unit activity play a role in the generation of spasms. However, recording unit activity is challenging in clinical settings, and more accessible neurophysiological signals are needed for the analysis of these brain states. Methods In the tetrodotoxin model, we used 16-channel microarrays to record electrophysiological activity in the neocortex during interictal periods and spasms. High-frequency activity (HFA) in the frequency range of fast ripples (200-500 Hz) was analyzed, as were slow wave oscillations (1-8 Hz), and correlated with the neocortical up and down states defined by multiunit activity (MUA). Results HFA and MUA had high temporal correlation during interictal and ictal periods. Both increased strikingly during interictal up states and ictal events but were silenced during interictal down states and preictal pauses, and their distributions were clustered at the peak of slow oscillations in local field potential recordings. In addition, both HFA power and MUA firing rates were increased to a greater extent during spasms than interictal up states. During non-rapid eye movement sleep, the HFA rhythmicity faithfully followed the MUA up and down states, but during rapid eye movement sleep when MUA up and down states disappeared the HFA rhythmicity was largely absent. We also observed an increase in the number of HFA down state minutes prior to ictal onset, consistent with the results from analyses of MUA down states. Significance This study provides evidence that HFA may serve as a biomarker for the pathological up states of epileptic spasms. The availability of HFA recordings makes this a clinically practical technique. These findings will likely provide a novel approach for localizing and studying epileptogenic neocortical networks not only in spasms patients but also in other types of epilepsy.

This paper proposes a joint quaternion valued singular spectrum analysis (QSSA) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) based method for performing the sleeping stage classification. First, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is employed for decomposing the electroencephalograms (EEGs) into various waves. Then, both the QSSA and the EEMD are applied for denoising these waves. Finally, the features are extracted from the selected components and the bootstrap aggregating (bagging) classifier is employed for performing the sleeping stage classification. Sixteen sleeping records obtained from both the Sleep-EDF database and the SleepEDF expanded database in the Physio bank are employed for performing the evaluation. A statistical analysis is conducted. The computer numerical simulation results show that the accuracies achieved by our proposed algorithm for the 6 state stage classification to the 2 state stage classification based on the EEGs in the Sleep-EDF database are 89.39%, 90.66%, 94.09%, 94.17%, and 97.50%, respectively. Moreover, the classification accuracies in the Sleep-EDF expanded database are also very high. Also, the classification accuracies achieved by our proposed method are higher than those achieved by the existing methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.

These mild injuries are not visible on routine clinical imaging. The potential clinical role of a specific imaging biomarker be it diagnostic, prognostic or directing and monitoring progress of personalised treatment and rehabilitation has driven the exploration of several new neuroimaging modalities. This systematic review examined the evidence for magnetoencephalography (MEG) to provide an imaging biomarker in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Methods: Our review was prospectively registered on PROSPERO: CRD42019151387. We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, trial registers, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and conference abstracts and identified 37 papers describing MEG changes in mTBI eligible for inclusion. Since meta-analysis was not possible, based on the heterogeneity of reported outcomes, we provide a narrative synthesis of results. Results: The two most promising MEG biomarkers are excess resting state low frequency power, and widespread connectivity changes in all frequency bands. These may represent biomarkers with potential for diagnostic application, which reflect time sensitive changes, or may be capable of offering clinically relevant prognostic information. In addition, the rich data that MEG produces are well-suited to new methods of machine learning analysis, which is now being actively explored. Interpretation: MEG reveals several promising biomarkers, in the absence of structural abnormalities demonstrable with either computerised tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. This review has not identified sufficient evidence to support routine clinical use of MEG in mTBI currently. However, verifying MEG's potential would help meet an urgent clinical need within civilian, sports and military medicine.

In human brain cerebrum or cerebral hemispheres are the most commonly involved brain regions in epilepsy. In case of antiepileptic drugs failure, surgical treatment is the best cure possible for which correct localization of epileptogenic region is a challenging task for neurologists as well as for computer scientist for automatic localization. This research work's aim is to explore the functional activities of all brain regions in drug-resistant focal epileptic patients and achieve high accuracy for the classification of epileptogenic region (ER) with the high-density electroencephalographic (hdEEG) data. The proposed system includes frequency analysis for feature extractions followed by individual subject's registration of hdEEG signals with anatomical brain images for most precise localization of ER possible. The datasets attained from feature extraction process are then preprocessed for class imbalanced and then evaluated using different machine learning domains including the techniques under Bayesian networks, Lazy networks, Meta techniques, Rule based systems and Tree structured algorithms. Considering human brain both as stationary object as well as dynamic object, frequency-based and time frequency-based features are considered in 12 subjects respectively. Through this novel approach 99.70% accuracy is achieved to classify ER from healthy regions using KSTAR and IBK algorithm and 91.60% accuracy has been achieved to classify generator from propagator regions by applying IBK algorithm.

However, most systems exist only for use with EEG, which is cumbersome to apply to patients and has lower spatial resolution than MEG. Furthermore, the best practices for neural data feature extraction and feature selection are not well established. The inclusion of the best performing feature extraction algorithms is critical to the development of clinical neurofeedback systems. Using simultaneously collected MEG and accelerometer data before and during 10 spontaneous finger movements, we performed an in-depth comparison of independent components analysis (ICA) and spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD) algorithms for their individual abilities to isolate movement-relevant features in brain activity. Having restricted raw data to that from sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) frequencies in select MEG sensors over sensorimotor cortex, we compared ICA and SSD components using: (1) 2D topographies, (2) activations over time, (3) and correlations with accelerometer data at both 0ms and 60ms time delays. SSD performed more quickly and produced components that were more highly correlated with the behavioral data than ICA. We will discuss these results and suggestions for application to neurofeedback systems. In particular, we will present detailed visualizations of SSD results and discuss potential strategies and pitfalls for feature selection.

Targeted overexpression of glutamate transporter-1 reduces seizures and attenuates pathological changes in a mouse model of epilepsy	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Epilepsy; Glutamate transporter-1; GLT-1; AAV; Kainic acid; Seizure; Astrocyte	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS; ADENOSINE KINASE; GLT-1; EXPRESSION; ASTROCYTES; CEFTRIAXONE; IMMUNOREACTIVITY; AQUAPORIN-4; SYNTHETASE	Astrocytic glutamate transporters are crucial for glutamate homeostasis in the brain, and dysregulation of these transporters can contribute to the development of epilepsy. Glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) is responsible for the majority of glutamate uptake in the dorsal forebrain and has been shown to be reduced at epileptic foci in patients and preclinical models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Current antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) work primarily by targeting neurons directly through suppression of excitatory neurotransmission or enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmission, which can lead to both behavioral and psychiatric side effects. This study investigates the therapeutic capacity of astrocyte-specific AAV-mediated GLT-1 expression in the intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) model of TLE. In this study, we used Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and longterm-video EEG monitoring to demonstrate that cell-type-specific upregulation of GLT-1 in astrocytes is neuroprotective at early time points during epileptogenesis, reduces seizure frequency and total time spent in seizures, and eliminates large behavioral seizures in the IHKA model of epilepsy. Our findings suggest that targeting glutamate uptake is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of epilepsy.

Growing evidence suggests that the autistic peculiarities are not confined to the clinical population but extend along a continuum between healthy and maladaptive conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a differentiated connectivity pattern could also be tracked along the continuum of autistic traits in a non-clinical population. A Granger causality analysis conducted on a resting-state EEG recording showed that connectivity along the posterior-frontal gradient is sensitive to the magnitude of individual autistic traits and mostly conveyed through fast oscillatory activity. Specifically, participants with higher autistic traits were characterized by a prevalence of ascending connections starting from posterior regions ramping the cortical hierarchy. These findings point to the presence of a tendency within the neural mapping of individuals with higher autistic features in conveying proportionally more bottom-up information.

Autonomous vehicle technologies can help to increase the accessibility for persons having limited mobility. The design of such vehicle requires a network of sensors along with sensor fusion system to accurately map the surrounding environment necessary for its safe driving. This study proposes a brain-actuated intelligent vehicle with network of sonars and vision-based sensors which can be controlled by either using Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential brain signals or joystick. For electroencephalogram signal detection, four frequencies were flickered and displayed using a GUI on LCD screen and signals were recorded having 1000 Hz sampling frequency. These signals were segmented into 2-second window size with 50% overlap and features were extracted by using canonical correlation analysis. In addition, a low-level navigation control system consisting of smart sensor network was also implemented to maximize safety of the user. Data from various sensors was sent to the intelligent control unit for sensor fusion in order to improve the performance and robustness of the designed vehicle. The results were evaluated for both offline and online classification. For offline control, the accuracy of 96% was achieved with 104.48 bits/min while 95% accuracy was achieved for run-time control. The results show that the proposed system has improved accuracy as well as information transfer rate is concerned as compared to the existing systems.

Thalamocortical excitability modulation guides human perception under uncertainty	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; INHIBITION; STATE; PERFORMANCE; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES; NUCLEUS; EEG	Knowledge about the relevance of environmental features can guide stimulus processing. However, it remains unclear how processing is adjusted when feature relevance is uncertain. We hypothesized that (a) heightened uncertainty would shift cortical networks from a rhythmic, selective processing-oriented state toward an asynchronous ("excited") state that boosts sensitivity to all stimulus features, and that (b) the thalamus provides a subcortical nexus for such uncertainty-related shifts. Here, we had young adults attend to varying numbers of task-relevant features during EEG and fMRI acquisition to test these hypotheses. Behavioral modeling and electrophysiological signatures revealed that greater uncertainty lowered the rate of evidence accumulation for individual stimulus features, shifted the cortex from a rhythmic to an asynchronous/excited regime, and heightened neuromodulatory arousal. Crucially, this unified constellation of within-person effects was dominantly reflected in the uncertainty-driven upregulation of thalamic activity. We argue that neuromodulatory processes involving the thalamus play a central role in how the brain modulates neural excitability in the face of momentary uncertainty. How is neural processing adjusted when people experience uncertainty about the relevance of a stimulus feature? Here, the authors provide evidence suggesting that heightened uncertainty shifts cortical networks from a rhythmic to an asynchronous ("excited") state and that the thalamus is central for such uncertainty-related shifts.

We modified the EMU admission protocol via anti-seizure medications (ASM) withdrawal implemented one day before admission; thus, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this modified protocol. Methods: In January 2021, we initiated ASM tapering 24 h before-rather than on the first day after-EMU admission, contrasting with the previous protocol. We retrospectively reviewed EMU admissions between January and April of 2018, 2019, and 2021, and identified the time required to record the first seizure, and EMU yield to confirm or change the epilepsy classification. We also evaluated the safety of the modified protocol, by monitoring the seizure frequency for up to 5 months after the discharge from the hospital. Results: One hundred four patients were included (mean age: 30 years, men: 43%); excluding a longer disease duration and abundance of normal routine electro-encephalogram (EEG) in patients admitted before the pandemic, no differences were observed in patients' characteristics. On average, it took 41 h and 21 h to record the first seizure using the standard and modified protocols, respectively (p <0.001, 95% CI: 10-30). Other characteristics were investigated both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and epilepsy classifications were confirmed twice using the modified protocol (OR = 2.4, p = 0.04, 95% CI: 1.1-5.5). Multivariate regression analysis confirmed the shorter time to record the first seizure using the modified admission protocol (23 h less, p < 0.001; 95% CI: 12-34). Finally, 36 (86%) patients admitted during the pandemic exhibited no increase in seizure frequency after the discharge from the hospital. Conclusions: Initiating ASM withdrawal one day before EMU admission was deemed to be an efficient and safe way to confirm epilepsy classification and significantly decrease the length of hospital stay. Ultimately, this will shorten the long waiting list for EMU admission created by the COVID-19 pandemic. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Pavlov, YG; Kotchoubey, B				Pavlov, Yuri G.; Kotchoubey, Boris			Temporally distinct oscillatory codes of retention and manipulation of verbal working memory	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; frontal midline theta; oscillatory brain activity; short-term memory	LONG-TERM-MEMORY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; MAINTENANCE; EEG; THETA; DYNAMICS; INFORMATION; CAPACITY; INCREASE	Most psychophysiological studies of working memory (WM) target only the short-term memory construct, whereas short-term memory is only a part of the WM responsible for the storage of sensory information. Here, we aimed to further investigate oscillatory brain mechanisms supporting the executive components of WM-the part responsible for the manipulation of information. We conducted an exploratory reanalysis of a previously published EEG dataset where 156 participants (82 females) performed tasks requiring either simple retention or retention and manipulation of verbal information in WM. A relatively long delay period (>6 s) was employed to investigate the temporal trajectory of the oscillatory brain activity. Compared with baseline, theta activity was significantly enhanced during encoding and the delay period. Alpha-band power decreased during encoding and switched to an increase in the first part of the delay before returning to the baseline in the second part; beta-band power remained below baseline during encoding and the delay. The difference between the manipulation and retention tasks in spectral power had diverse temporal trajectories in different frequency bands. The difference maintained over encoding and the first part of the delay in theta, during the first part of the delay in beta, and during the whole delay period in alpha. Our results suggest that task-related modulations in theta power co-vary with the demands on the executive control network; beta suppression during mental manipulation can be related to the activation of motor networks; and alpha is likely to reflect the activation of language areas simultaneously with sensory input blockade.

Theta-burst stimulation entrains frequency-specific oscillatory responses	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Theta burst stimulation; Oscillations; LFP; Intracranial EEG; Functional connectivity	DEEP-BRAIN-STIMULATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN-MEMORY; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; INDUCTION; POWER; DEPRESSION; AMPLITUDE	Background: Brain stimulation has emerged as a powerful tool in human neuroscience, becoming integral to next-generation psychiatric and neurologic therapeutics. Theta-burst stimulation (TBS), in which electrical pulses are delivered in rhythmic bouts of 3-8 Hz, seeks to recapitulate neural activity seen endogenously during cognitive tasks. A growing literature suggests that TBS can be used to alter or enhance cognitive processes, but little is known about how these stimulation events influence underlying neural activity. Objective: Our study sought to investigate the effect of direct electrical TBS on mesoscale neural activity in humans by asking (1) whether TBS evokes persistent theta oscillations in cortical areas, (2) whether these oscillations occur at the stimulated frequency, and (3) whether stimulation events propagate in a manner consistent with underlying functional and structural brain architecture. Methods: We recruited 20 neurosurgical epilepsy patients with indwelling electrodes and delivered direct cortical TBS at varying locations and frequencies. Simultaneous iEEG was recorded from non stimulated electrodes and analyzed to understand how TBS influences mesoscale neural activity. Results: We found that TBS rapidly evoked theta rhythms in widespread brain regions, preferentially at the stimulation frequency, and that these oscillations persisted for hundreds of milliseconds post stimulation offset. Furthermore, the functional connectivity between recording and stimulation sites predicted the strength of theta response, suggesting that underlying brain architecture guides the flow of stimulation through the brain. Conclusions: By demonstrating that cortical TBS induces frequency-specific oscillatory responses, our results suggest this technology can be used to directly and predictably influence the activity of cognitively-relevant brain networks.

Since such evoked oscillations depend on cortical N-methyl D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-mediated network activity, they can serve as pharmacodynamic biomarkers in the preclinical and clinical development of drug candidates engaging these circuits. However, there are few test-retest reliability data in preclinical species, a prerequisite for within-subject testing paradigms. Objective We investigated the long-term psychometric stability of these measures in a rodent model. Methods Female rats with chronic epidural implants were used to record tone- and 40 Hz click-evoked responses at multiple time points and across six sessions, spread over 3 weeks. We assessed reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Separately, we used mixed-effects ANOVA to examine time and session effects. Individual subject variability was determined using the coefficient of variation (CV). Lastly, to illustrate the importance of long-term measure stability for within-subject testing design, we used low to moderate doses of an NMDA antagonist MK801 (0.025-0.15 mg/kg) to disrupt the evoked response. Results We found that 40-Hz ASSR showed good reliability (ICC=0.60-0.75), while the reliability of tone-evoked gamma ranged from poor to good (0.33-0.67). We noted time but no session effects. Subjects showed a lower variance for ASSR over tone-evoked gamma. Both measures were dose-dependently attenuated by NMDA antagonism. Conclusion Overall, while both evoked gamma measures use NMDA transmission, 40-Hz ASSR showed superior psychometric properties of higher ICC and lower CV, relative to tone-evoked gamma.

A Case-Study in Neuromarketing Field	SENSORS			English	Article						applied neurosciences; EEG; HR; GSR; sample size; signal processing	EEG ALPHA; RECOMMENDATIONS; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; WORKLOAD; DYNAMICS; POWER; ERP	The sample size is a crucial concern in scientific research and even more in behavioural neurosciences, where besides the best practice it is not always possible to reach large experimental samples. In this study we investigated how the outcomes of research change in response to sample size reduction. Three indices computed during a task involving the observations of four videos were considered in the analysis, two related to the brain electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and one to autonomic physiological measures, i.e., heart rate and skin conductance. The modifications of these indices were investigated considering five subgroups of sample size (32, 28, 24, 20, 16), each subgroup consisting of 630 different combinations made by bootstrapping n (n = sample size) out of 36 subjects, with respect to the total population (i.e., 36 subjects). The correlation analysis, the mean squared error (MSE), and the standard deviation (STD) of the indexes were studied at the participant reduction and three factors of influence were considered in the analysis: the type of index, the task, and its duration (time length). The findings showed a significant decrease of the correlation associated to the participant reduction as well as a significant increase of MSE and STD (p < 0.05). A threshold of subjects for which the outcomes remained significant and comparable was pointed out. The effects were to some extents sensitive to all the investigated variables, but the main effect was due to the task length. Therefore, the minimum threshold of subjects for which the outcomes were comparable increased at the reduction of the spot duration.

Electroacupuncture treatment is one of the most widely used TCM therapeutic interventions for poststroke flaccid paralysis. However, the response to electroacupuncture in different durations of flaccid stage poststroke as well as in the topological configuration of the cortical network remains unclear. The objectives of this study are to explore the disruption of the cortical network in patients in different durations of flaccid stage and observe dynamic network reorganization during and after electroacupuncture. Resting-state networks were constructed from 18 subjects with flaccid upper extremity by partial directed coherence (PDC) analysis of multichannel EEG. They were allocated to three groups according to time after flaccid paralysis: the short-duration group (those with flaccidity for less than two months), the medium-duration group (those with flaccidity between two months and six months), and the long-duration group (those with flaccidity over six months). Compared with short-duration flaccid subjects, weakened effective connectivity was presented in medium-duration and long-duration groups before electroacupuncture. The long-duration group has no response in the cortical network during electroacupuncture. The global network measures of EEG data (sPDC, mPDC, and N) indicated that there was no significant difference among the three groups. These results suggested that the network connectivity reduced and weakly responded to electroacupuncture in patients with flaccid paralysis for over six months. These findings may help us to modulate the formulation of electroacupuncture treatment according to different durations of the flaccid upper extremity.

Tight relationships between sleep quality, cognition, and amyloid-beta (A beta) accumulation, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, have been shown. Sleep arousals become more prevalent with aging and are considered to reflect poorer sleep quality. However, heterogeneity in arousals has been suggested while their associations with A beta and cognition are not established. METHODS. We recorded undisturbed night-time sleep with EEG in 101 healthy individuals aged 50-70 years, devoid of cognitive and sleep disorders. We classified spontaneous arousals according to their association with muscular tone increase (M+/M-) and sleep stage transition (T+/T-). We assessed cortical A beta burden over earliest affected regions via PET imaging and assessed cognition via neuropsychological testing. RESULTS. Arousal types differed in their oscillatory composition in theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (16-30 Hz) EEG bands. Furthermore, T+M- arousals, interrupting sleep continuity, were positively linked to A beta burden (P = 0.0053, R-beta*(2) = 0.08). By contrast, more prevalent T-M+ arousals, upholding sleep continuity, were associated with lower A beta burden (P = 0.0003, R-beta*(2) = 0.13), and better cognition, particularly over the attentional domain (P < 0.05, R-beta*(2) >= 0.04). CONCLUSION. Contrasting with what is commonly accepted, we provide empirical evidence that arousals are diverse and differently associated with early AD-related neuropathology and cognition. This suggests that sleep arousals, and their coalescence with other brain oscillations during sleep, may actively contribute to the beneficial functions of sleep and constitute markers of favorable brain and cognitive health trajectories.

Recent studies showed similarity in eye movement patterns between wakefulness and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, indicating that the brain status of REM sleep likely resembles that of awake status. REM sleep in humans could be divided into phasic REM and tonic REM sleep according to the difference in eye movement frequencies. Mice are the most commonly used animal model for studying neuronal and molecular mechanisms underlying sleep. However, there was a lack of details for eye movement patterns during REM sleep, hence it remains unknown whether REM sleep can be further divided into different stages in mice. Here we developed a device combining electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG) as well as eye movements recording in mice to study the eye movement patterns during sleep. We implanted a magnet beneath the conjunctiva of eye and tracked eye movements using a magnetic sensor. The magnetic signals showed strong correlation with video-oculography in head-fixed mice, indicating that the magnetic signals reflect the direction and magnitude of eye movement. We also found that the magnet implanted beneath the conjunctiva exhibited good biocompatibility. Finally, we examined eye movement in sleep-wake cycle, and discriminated tonic REM and phasic REM according to the frequency of eye movements, finding that compared to tonic REM, phasic REM exhibited higher oscillation power at 0.50 Hz, and lower oscillation power at 1.50-7.25 Hz and 9.50-12.00 Hz. Our device allowed to simultaneously record EEG, EMG, and eye movements during sleep and wakefulness, providing a convenient and high temporal-spatial resolution tool for studying eye movements in sleep and other researches in mice.

The variational mode decomposition method was applied for its reliability and nonlinear adaptation. Nonlinear challenge was designed to verify the robustness of the proposed method. Modulation index was used to calculate the intensity of the coupling. Our results showed that the modulation indexes tend to be driven by the delta/theta. phase than the alpha and beta phase in general, which implies the importance of theta phase in the emotion processing. Besides, the. activity in the AF brain area seems to serve as a potential feature for the neutral emotion, whereas the beta rhythm is associated with the negative emotion. Meanwhile, we also found the bipolar synchronizations move toward the central lobe with the increasing amplitude frequencies.

Afterward, the anti-vertigo ability of the subject was tested for the best performance after 1 month of training and verified whether it is related to the EEG signals we collected before.& nbsp;Results: (1) The absolute power of alpha waves in the C3 and C4 regions is the same as the difference between 1 min before and 2 min after stimulation, and their activity is enhanced by stimulation. Otherwise, the activation of the C3 region after 5 min of stimulation is still significantly changed. (2) Through Spearman's correlation analysis, we found that the alpha waves in the C3 and C4 the greater the power change, the better the performance of the subject in the proficient stage.& nbsp;Conclusion: C3 and C4 areas are specific brain regions of the stress response of anti-vertigo endurance training, and the absolute power of the alpha wave can be used as a parameter for identifying the degree of motion sickness (MS). The absolute power changes of alpha waves in the C3 and C4 areas are positively correlated with their anti-vertigo potential.& nbsp;Significance: Increasing the absolute power of alpha wave in the C3 and C4 is a manifestation of MS stress adaptability.

Slow Wave Sleep and EEG Delta Spectral Power are Associated with Cognitive Function in Parkinson's Disease	JOURNAL OF PARKINSONS DISEASE			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; slow wave sleep; sleep; cognition	EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; QUALITY; PERFORMANCE; IMPROVEMENT; IMPAIRMENT; DEMENTIA	Background: Cognitive and sleep dysfunction are common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Objective: Determine the relationship between slow wave sleep (SWS) and cognitive performance in PD. Methods: Thirty-two PD participants were evaluated with polysomnography and a comprehensive level II neurocognitive battery, as defined by the Movement Disorders Society Task Force for diagnosis of PD-mild cognitive impairment. Raw scores for each test were transformed into z-scores using normative data. Z-scores were averaged to obtain domain scores, and domain scores were averaged to determine the Composite Cognitive Score (CCS), the primary outcome. Participants were grouped by percent of SWS into High SWS and Low SWS groups and compared on CCS and other outcomes using 2-sided t-tests or Mann-Whitney U. Correlations of cognitive outcomes with sleep architecture and EEG spectral power were performed. Results: Participants in the High SWS group demonstrated better global cognitive function (CCS) (p = 0.01, effect size: r = 0.45). In exploratory analyses, the High SWS group showed better performance in domains of executive function (effect size: Cohen's d = 1.05), language (d = 0.95), and processing speed (d = 1.12). Percentage of SWS was correlated with global cognition and executive function, language, and processing speed. Frontal EEG delta power during N3 was correlated with the CCS and executive function. Cognition was not correlated with subjective sleep quality. Conclusion: Increased SWS and higher delta spectral power are associated with better cognitive performance in PD. This demonstrates the significant relationship between sleep and cognitive function and suggests that interventions to improve sleep might improve cognition in individuals with PD.

The role of delta and theta oscillations during ego-motion in healthy adult volunteers	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Vestibular system; Vestibular stimulation; Reference frames; Hemispheric asymmetry; Alpha activity; Passive motion; Multisensory		The successful cortical processing of multisensory input typically requires the integration of data represented in different reference systems to perform many fundamental tasks, such as bipedal locomotion. Animal studies have provided insights into the integration processes performed by the neocortex and have identified region specific tuning curves for different reference frames during ego-motion. Yet, there remains almost no data on this topic in humans. In this study, an experiment originally performed in animal research with the aim to identify brain regions modulated by the position of the head and eyes relative to a translational ego-motion was adapted for humans. Subjects sitting on a motion platform were accelerated along a translational pathway with either eyes and head aligned or a 20 degrees yaw-plane offset relative to the motion direction while EEG was recorded. Using a distributed source localization approach, it was found that activity in area PFm, a part of Brodmann area 40, was modulated by the congruency of translational motion direction, eye, and head position. In addition, an asymmetry between the hemispheres in the opercular-insular region was observed during the cortical processing of the vestibular input. A frequency specific analysis revealed that low-frequency oscillations in the delta- and theta-band are modulated by vestibular stimulation. Source-localization estimated that the observed low-frequency oscillations are generated by vestibular core-regions, such as the parieto-opercular region and frontal areas like the mid-orbital gyrus and the medial frontal gyrus.

However, the effects of motor imagery perspectives on these differences have not been investigated yet. Our study aimed to check how handedness impacts the activity of alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) oscillations during creating a kinesthetic (KMI) or visual-motor (VMI) representation of movement. Forty subjects (20 right-handed and 20 left-handed) who participated in the experiment were tasked with imagining sequential finger movement from a visual or kinesthetic perspective. Both the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and behavioral correctness of the imagery task performance were measured. After the registration, we used independent component analysis (ICA) on EEG data to localize visual- and motor-related EEG sources of activity shared by both motor imagery conditions. Significant differences were obtained in the visual cortex (the occipital ICs cluster) and the right motor-related area (right parietal ICs cluster). In comparison to right-handers who, regardless of the task, demonstrated the same pattern in the visual area, left-handers obtained higher power in the alpha waves in the VMI task and better performance in this condition. On the other hand, only the right-handed showed different patterns in the alpha waves in the right motor cortex during the KMI condition. The results indicate that left-handers imagine movement differently than right-handers, focusing on visual experience. This provides new empirical evidence on the influence of movement preferences on imagery processes and has possible future implications for research in the area of neurorehabilitation and motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs).

Developmental changes in auditory-evoked neural activity underlie infants' links between language and cognition	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article						conceptual development; developmental tuning; infant cognition; infant EEG; infant ERP; language acquisition	ALPHA DESYNCHRONIZATION; 4-MONTH-OLD INFANTS; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; EEG ALPHA; ATTENTION; WORDS; CATEGORIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; RHYTHMS; POWER	The power and precision with which humans link language to cognition is unique to our species. By 3-4 months of age, infants have already established this link: simply listening to human language facilitates infants' success in fundamental cognitive processes. Initially, this link to cognition is also engaged by a broader set of acoustic stimuli, including non-human primate vocalizations (but not other sounds, like backwards speech). But by 6 months, non-human primate vocalizations no longer confer this cognitive advantage that persists for speech. What remains unknown is the mechanism by which these sounds influence infant cognition, and how this initially broader set of privileged sounds narrows to only human speech between 4 and 6 months. Here, we recorded 4- and 6-month-olds' EEG responses to acoustic stimuli whose behavioral effects on infant object categorization have been previously established: infant-directed speech, backwards speech, and non-human primate vocalizations. We document that by 6 months, infants' 4-9 Hz neural activity is modulated in response to infant-directed speech and non-human primate vocalizations (the two stimuli that initially support categorization), but that 4-9 Hz neural activity is not modulated at either age by backward speech (an acoustic stimulus that doesn't support categorization at either age). These results advance the prior behavioral evidence to suggest that by 6 months, speech and non-human primate vocalizations elicit distinct changes in infants' cognitive state, influencing performance on foundational cognitive tasks such as object categorization.

Biomarkers of memory variability in traumatic brain injury	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						traumatic brain injury; episodic memory; recall; theta; intracranial EEG	HIGH-FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL ACTIVITY; STIMULATION; CORTEX; EEG	Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of cognitive disability and is often associated with significant impairment in episodic memory. In traumatic brain injury survivors, as in healthy controls, there is marked variability between individuals in memory ability. Using recordings from indwelling electrodes, we characterized and compared the oscillatory biomarkers of mnemonic variability in two cohorts of epilepsy patients: a group with a history of moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (n = 37) and a group of controls without traumatic brain injury (n = 111) closely matched for demographics and electrode coverage. Analysis of these recordings demonstrated that increased high-frequency power and decreased theta power across a broad set of brain regions mark periods of successful memory formation in both groups. As features in a logistic-regression classifier, spectral power biomarkers effectively predicted recall probability, with little difference between traumatic brain injury patients and controls. The two groups also displayed similar patterns of theta-frequency connectivity during successful encoding periods. These biomarkers of successful memory, highly conserved between traumatic brain injury patients and controls, could serve as the basis for novel therapies that target disordered memory across diverse forms of neurological disease.

Exploring developmental changes in infant anticipation and perceptual processing: EEG responses to tactile stimulation	INFANCY			English	Article							MU RHYTHM; NEURAL MECHANISMS; MOTOR ACTIVATION; BODY MAPS; ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; IMITATION; DYNAMICS	There is an increasing interest in alpha-range rhythms in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in relation to perceptual and attentional processes. The infant mu rhythm has been extensively studied in the context of linkages between action observation and action production in infancy, but less is known about the mu rhythm in relation to cross-modal processes involving somatosensation. We investigated differences in mu responses to cued vibrotactile stimulation of the hand in two age groups of infants: From 6 to 7 months and 13 to 14 months. We were also interested in anticipatory neural responses in the alpha frequency range prior to tactile stimulation. Tactile stimulation of infants' left or right hand was preceded by an audiovisual cue signaling which hand would be stimulated. In response to the tactile stimulus, infants demonstrated significant mu desynchronization over the central areas contralateral to the hand stimulated, with higher mu peak frequency and greater contralateral mu desynchronization for older infants. Prior to the tactile stimulus, both age groups showed significant bilateral alpha desynchronization over frontocentral sites, which may be indicative of generalized anticipation of an upcoming stimulus. The findings highlight the potential of examining the sensorimotor mu rhythm in the context of infant attentional development.

This hypothesis suggested that individuals with higher Gf tend to flexibly and adaptively allocate their limited resources according to the task type and task difficulty rather than simply exert more or fewer resources in any condition. To examine this hypothesis, the present study used electroencephalogram (EEG) indicators (i.e., frontal theta-ERS and parietal-occipital alpha-ERD) as the measurements of participants' resource allocation during the exploration task and exploitation task with different difficulties. The results found that higher Gf individuals tend to allocate fewer resources in all difficulty levels in the exploitation task compared to average Gf participants. In contrast, in the exploration task, higher Gf participants would allocate more resources in the medium- and high-difficulty levels than average Gf participants, but this phenomenon was only found in males. These findings provided supportive evidence for the integrated control hypothesis that flexible and adaptive attentional control ability are important characteristics of human intelligence.

Electroencephalographic Study of the Resting-state Neuronal Oscillations Underlying Third-party Punishment	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						third-party punishment; EEG; LRTCs; social norms; AEC; resting-state	RANGE TEMPORAL CORRELATIONS; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION; HUMAN BRAIN; ALPHA; EEG; TEMPOROPARIETAL; SYNCHRONIZATION; MECHANISMS	For over a decade, neuroimaging and brain stimulation studies have investigated neural mechanisms of third-party punishment, a key instrument for social norms enforcement. However, the neural dynamics underlying these mechanisms are still unclear. Previous electroencephalographic studies on third-party punishment have shown that inter-brain connectivity is linked to punishment behavior. However, no clear evidence was provided regarding whether the effect of inter-brain connectivity on third-party punishment is mediated by local neuronal states. In this study, we further investigate whether resting-state neuronal activity in the alpha frequency range can predict individual differences in third-party punishment. More specifically, we show that the global resting-state connectivity between the right dorsolateral prefrontal and right temporo-parietal regions is negatively correlated with the level of third-party punishment. Additionally, individuals with stronger local restingstate long-range temporal correlations in the right temporo-parietal cortices demonstrated a lower level of third-party punishment. Thus, our results further support the idea that global and local neuronal dynamics can contribute to individual differences in third-party punishment. (c) 2021 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Decreased electroencephalogram alpha (8-13 Hz) and low-beta (13-20 Hz) oscillation power have been associated with ketamine-induced dissociation. We aimed to characterize surface electroencephalogram signatures that may serve as biomarkers for dissociation. Methods: We analyzed data from a single-site, open-label, high-density surface electroencephalogram study of ketamine anesthesia (2 mg/kg, n = 15). We assessed dissociation longitudinally using the Clinician Administered Dissociation States Scale (CADSS) and administered midazolam to attenuate dissociation and enable causal inference. We analyzed electroencephalogram power and global coherence with multitaper spectral methods. Mixed effects models were used to assess whether power and global coherence signatures of ketamine could be developed into dissociation-specific biomarkers. Results: Compared to baseline, ketamine unresponsiveness was associated with increased frontal power between 0.5 to 9.3 Hz, 12.2 to 16.6 Hz, and 24.4 to 50 Hz. As subjects transitioned into a responsive but dissociated state (mean CADSS +/- SD, 22.1 +/- 17), there was a decrease in power between 0.5 to 10.3 Hz and 11.7 to 50 Hz. Midazolam reduced dissociation scores (14.3 +/- 11.6), decreased power between 4.4 to 11.7 Hz and increased power between 14.2 to 50 Hz. Our mixed-effects model demonstrated a quadratic relationship between time and CADSS scores. When models (frontal power, occipital power, global coherence) were reanalyzed with midazolam and electroencephalogram features as covariates, only midazolam was retained. Conclusions: Ketamine is associated with structured electroencephalogram power and global coherence signatures that may enable principled anesthetic state but not dissociation monitoring. Significance: A neurophysiological biomarker for dissociation may lead to a better understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders. (C) 2021 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						cognitive control; executive functions; frontal-midline theta; neurofeedback; training; working memory	VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; EARLY CONSOLIDATION; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; EEG-NEUROFEEDBACK; EPISODIC MEMORY; FRONTAL THETA; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; DYNAMICS; CONNECTIVITY	Frontal-midline (FM) theta activity (4-8 Hz) is proposed to reflect a mechanism for cognitive control that is needed for working memory retention, manipulation, and interference resolution. Modulation of FM theta activity via neurofeedback training (NFT) demonstrated transfer to some but not all types of cognitive control. Therefore, the present study investigated whether FM theta NFT enhances performance and modulates underlying EEG characteristics in a delayed match to sample (DMTS) task requiring mainly proactive control and a color Stroop task requiring mainly reactive control. Moreover, temporal characteristics of transfer were explored over two posttests. Across seven 30-min NFT sessions, an FM theta training group exhibited a larger FM theta increase compared to an active control group who upregulated randomly chosen frequency bands. In a posttest performed 13 days after the last training session, the training group showed better retention performance in the DMTS task. Furthermore, manipulation performance was associated with NFT theta increase for the training but not the control group. Contrarily, behavioral group differences and their relation to FM theta change were not significant in the Stroop task, suggesting that NFT is associated with proactive but not reactive control enhancement. Transfer to both tasks at a posttest one day after training was not significant. Behavioral improvements were not accompanied by changes in FM theta activity, indicating no training-induced modulation of EEG characteristics. Together, these findings suggest that NFT supports transfer to cognitive control that manifests late after training but that other training-unspecific factors may also contribute to performance enhancement.

However, how schematic/semantic mnemonic structures aid the integration of novel elements remains poorly understood. Here, we showed that the ability to integrate novel picture information into learned structures of picture associations that overlapped by the same picture scene (i.e., simple network) or by a conceptually related picture scene (i.e., schematic/semantic network) is hippocampus-dependent, as patients with lesions at the medial temporal lobe (including the hippocampus) were impaired in inferring novel relations between pictures within these memory networks. We also found more persistent and widespread scalp EEG theta oscillations (3-5 Hz) while participants integrated novel pictures into schematic/semantic memory networks than into simple networks. On the other hand, greater neural similarity was observed between EEG patterns elicited by novel and related events within simple networks than between novel and related events within schematic/semantic memory networks. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms that support the development and organization of structures of knowledge.

Participants performed visual and auditory versions of the temporal order judgment task. Prestimulus functional links were assessed via alpha band coherence computed in the source space for preselected regions of interest. As compared with the baseline condition, an increase of local functional links between the primary visual cortex and the intraparietal cortex was observed in both hemispheres during the anticipation of visual and auditory stimuli. An increase of functional interaction between the intraparietal cortex and the ventral premotor cortex was observed only in the left hemisphere during auditory anticipatory attention. Unlike our previous research on anticipatory attention in adults, the analysis of functional connectivity in children showed no frontoparietal functional links in the right hemisphere and no modality-specific cortical links. The results of the study suggest that the brain's top-down modulatory systems of the right hemisphere are still immature in children aged 9-10 years.

While memory retention strengthens memory traces, it is unclear what happens to memory traces of events that are actively forgotten. Using intracranial EEG recordings from lateral temporal cortex, we find that memory traces for actively forgotten information are partially preserved and exhibit unique neural signatures. Memory traces of successfully remembered items show stronger encoding-retrieval similarity in gamma frequency patterns. By contrast, encoding-retrieval similarity of item-specific memory traces of actively forgotten items depend on activity at alpha/beta frequencies commonly associated with functional inhibition. Additional analyses revealed selective modification of item-specific patterns of connectivity and top-down information flow from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to lateral temporal cortex in memory traces of intentionally forgotten items. These results suggest that intentional forgetting relies more on inhibitory top-down connections than intentional remembering, resulting in inhibitory memory traces with unique neural signatures and representational formats. The authors used intracranial EEG recordings from patients with epilepsy to show that successful intentional forgetting is due to a selective modification of item-specific top-down connections and not simply a degradation of the memory traces.

Reading direct speech quotes increases theta phase-locking: Evidence for cortical tracking of inner speech?

Does theta activity also encode the rhythmic dynamics of inner speech? Previous research established that silent reading of direct speech quotes (e.g., Mary said: "This dress is lovely! ") elicits more vivid inner speech than indirect speech quotes (e.g., Mary said that the dress was lovely ). As we cannot directly track the phase alignment between theta activity and inner speech over time, we used EEG to measure the brain's phase-locked responses to the onset of speech quote reading. We found that direct (vs. indirect) quote reading was associated with increased theta phase synchrony over trials at 250-500 ms post-reading onset, with sources of the evoked activity estimated in the speech processing network. An eye-tracking control experiment confirmed that increased theta phase synchrony in direct quote reading was not driven by eye movement patterns, and more likely reflects synchronous phase resetting at the onset of inner speech. These findings suggest a functional role of theta phase modulation in reading-induced inner speech.

Spectral changes following resective epilepsy surgery and neurocognitive function in children with epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						biomarkers; cognitive function; epilepsy surgery; intracranial EEG; thalamocortical dysrhythmia	THALAMOCORTICAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; FOCAL EPILEPSY; LOBE; OSCILLATIONS; RELEVANCE; FREQUENCY; NETWORKS	Decelerated resting cortical oscillations, high-frequency activity, and enhanced cross-frequency interactions are features of focal epilepsy. The association between electrophysiological signal properties and neurocognitive function, particularly following resective surgery, is, however, unclear. In the current report, we studied intraoperative recordings from intracranial electrodes implanted in seven children with focal epilepsy and analyzed the spectral dynamics both before and after surgical resection of the hypothesized seizure focus. The associations between electrophysiological spectral signatures and each child's neurocognitive profiles were characterized using a partial least squares analysis. We find that extent of spectral alteration at the periphery of surgical resection, as indexed by slowed resting frequency and its acceleration following surgery, is associated with baseline cognitive deficits in children. The current report provides evidence supporting the relationship between altered spectral properties in focal epilepsy and neuropsychological deficits in children. In particular, these findings suggest a critical role of disrupted thalamocortical rhythms, which are believed to underlie the spectral alterations we describe, in both epileptogenicity and neurocognitive function. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Spectral alterations marked by decelerated resting oscillations and ectopic high-frequency activity have been noted in focal epilepsy. We leveraged intraoperative recordings from chronically implanted electrodes pre- and postresection to understand the association between these electrophysiological phenomena and neuropsychological function. We find that the extent of spectral alteration, indexed by slowed resting frequency and its acceleration following resection, is associated with baseline cognitive deficits. These findings provide novel insights into neurocognitive impairments in focal epilepsy.

Deep brain stimulation of the infralimbic cortex in rodents or the human equivalent-the subgenual cingulate cortex-constitutes a fast antidepressant treatment. The aim of this work was: (1) to describe the oscillatory profile in a rodent model of anxiety, and (2) to deepen the therapeutic basis of infralimbic deep brain stimulation in mood disorders. First, the anxiogenic drug FG-7142 was administered to anaesthetized rats to characterize neural oscillations within the amygdala and the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus. Next, deep brain stimulation was applied. FG-7142 administration drastically reduced the slow waves, increasing delta, low theta, and beta oscillations in the network. Moreover, FG-7142 altered communication in these bands in selective subnetworks. Deep brain stimulation of the infralimbic cortex reversed most of these FG-7142 effects. Cross-frequency coupling was also inversely modified by FG-7142 and by deep brain stimulation.

Different roles of T-type calcium channel isoforms in hypnosis induced by an endogenous neurosteroid epipregnanolone	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Low-voltage-activated; Calcium; Thalamus; Righting reflex; Withdrawal reflex; Isoflurane	MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; ABSENCE SEIZURES; INHIBITION; STEROIDS; CONSCIOUSNESS; MODULATION; ANESTHESIA; DELETION; CURRENTS; NEURONS	Background: Many neuroactive steroids induce sedation/hypnosis by potentiating gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) currents. However, we previously demonstrated that an endogenous neuroactive steroid epipregnanolone [(3 beta,5 beta)-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one] (EpiP) exerts potent peripheral analgesia and blocks T-type calcium currents while sparing GABA(A) currents in rat sensory neurons. This study seeks to investigate the behavioral effects elicited by systemic administration of EpiP and to characterize its use as an adjuvant agent to commonly used general anesthetics (GAs). Methods: Here, we utilized electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to characterize thalamocortical oscillations, as well as behavioral assessment and mouse genetics with wild-type (WT) and different knockout (KO) models of T-channel isoforms to investigate potential sedative/hypnotic and immobilizing properties of EpiP. Results: Consistent with increased oscillations in slower EEG frequencies, EpiP induced an hypnotic state in WT mice when injected alone intra-peritoneally (i.p.) and effectively facilitated anesthetic effects of isoflurane (ISO) and sevoflurane (SEVO). The Ca(V)3.1 (Cacna1g) KO mice demonstrated decreased sensitivity to EpiP-induced hypnosis when compared to WT mice, whereas no significant difference was noted between Ca(V)3.2 (Cacna1h), Ca(V)3.3 (Cacna1i) and WT mice. Finally, when compared to WT mice, onset of EpiP-induced hypnosis was delayed in Ca(V)3.2 KO mice but not in Ca(V)3.1 and Ca(V)3.3 KO mice. Conclusion: We posit that EpiP may have an important role as novel hypnotic and/or adjuvant to volatile anesthetic agents. We speculate that distinct hypnotic effects of EpiP across all three T-channel isoforms is due to their differential expression in thalamocortical circuitry.

Spindles are highly heritable as identified by different spindle detectors	SLEEP			English	Article						spindle; heritability; spindle detection; genetics	SLEEP SPINDLES; CAGE QUESTIONNAIRE; PERFORMANCE; EEG; VALIDATION; TOPOGRAPHY; SLOW; AGE	Study Objectives: Sleep spindles, a defining feature of stage N2 sleep, are maximal at central electrodes and are found in the frequency range of the electroencephalogram (EEG) (sigma 11-16 Hz) that is known to be heritable. However, relatively little is known about the heritability of spindles. Two recent studies investigating the heritability of spindles reported moderate heritability, but with conflicting results depending on scalp location and spindle type. The present study aimed to definitively assess the heritability of sleep spindle characteristics. Methods: We utilized the polysomnography data of 58 monozygotic and 40 dizygotic same-sex twin pairs to identify heritable characteristics of spindles at C3/C4 in stage N2 sleep including density, duration, peak-to-peak amplitude, and oscillation frequency. We implemented and tested a variety of spindle detection algorithms and used two complementary methods of estimating trait heritability. Results: We found robust evidence to support strong heritability of spindles regardless of detector method (h(2) > 0.8). However not all spindle characteristics were equally heritable, and each spindle detection method produced a different pattern of results. Conclusions: The sleep spindle in stage N2 sleep is highly heritable, but the heritability differs for individual spindle characteristics and depends on the spindle detector used for analysis.

Resting-state functional connectivity in the idiopathic generalized epilepsies: A systematic review and meta-analysis of EEG and MEG studies	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Review						Network analysis; Functional connectivity; Idiopathic generalized epilepsy; Meta-analysis	CHILDHOOD ABSENCE EPILEPSY; BRAIN NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS	For idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE), brain network analysis is emerging as a biomarker for poten-tial use in clinical care. To determine whether people with IGE show alterations in resting-state brain connectivity compared to healthy controls, and to quantify these differences, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) functional connectivity and net -work studies. The review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Twenty-two studies were eli-gible for inclusion. Outcomes from individual studies supported hypotheses for interictal, resting-state brain connectivity alterations in IGE patients compared to healthy controls. In contrast, meta-analysis from six studies of common network metrics clustering coefficient, path length, mean degree and nodal strength showed no significant differences between IGE and control groups (effect sizes ranged from-0.151 -1.78). The null findings of the meta-analysis and the heterogeneity of the included studies high-lights the importance of developing standardized, validated methodologies for future research. Network neuroscience has significant potential as both a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in epilepsy, though individual variability in network dynamics needs to be better understood and accounted for.

Elderly individuals usually experience defects in the processing of VWM. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is a key structure for the top-down control of working memory processes. Many studies have shown that repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves VWM by modulating the excitability of neurons in the target cortical region, though the underlying neural mechanism has not been clarified. Therefore, this study sought to assess the characteristics of brain memory function post-rTMS targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The study stimulated the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in elderly individuals by performing a high-frequency rTMS protocol and evaluated behavioral performance using cognitive tasks and a VWM task. Based on the simultaneously recorded electroencephalogram signals, event-related potential and event-related spectral perturbation analysis techniques were used to investigate the variation characteristics of event-related potential components' (N2PC and CDA) amplitudes and neural oscillations in elderly individuals to elucidate the effect of high-frequency rTMS. The results found that rTMS enhanced VWM performance and significantly improved attention and executive function in elderly individuals with subjective cognitive decline. We therefore speculate that rTMS enhances VWM by increasing the N2PC and CDA amplitude, alongside increasing beta oscillation activity. This would improve the attention and allocation of resources in elderly individuals such as to improve an individual's VWM.

Traditionally, research to elucidate associated neural correlates has intensively, but also quite selectively examined mechanisms during response inhibition in various tasks. Doing so, in-between trial periods or periods prior to the response inhibition process, where no information relevant to inhibitory control is presented, have been neglected. Yet, these periods may nevertheless reveal relevant information. In the present study, using a case-control cross-sectional design, we take a more holistic approach, examining the inter-relation of pre-trial and within-trial periods in a Go/Nogo task with a focus on EEG theta band activity. Applying EEG beamforming methods, we show that the dynamics between pre-trial (pro-active) and within-trial (inhibition-related) control processes significantly differ between AD(H)D subtypes. We show that response inhibition, and differences between AD(H)D subtypes, exhibit distinct patterns of (at least) three factors: (i) strength of pre-trial (pro-active control) theta-band activity, (ii) the interrelation of pro-active control and inhibition-relation theta band activity and (iii) the functional neuroanatomical region active during theta-related pro-active control processes. This multi-factorial pattern is captured by AD(H) D subtype clinical symptom clusters. The study provides a first hint that novel cognitive-neurophysiological facets of AD(H)D may be relevant to distinguish AD(H)D subtypes.

However, it is unknown whether these signals play a role in reward-based decision-making and whether such dynamic network configuration is altered in a major depressive episode. We recruited men and women with and without depression to perform a streamlined version of the Expenditure of Effort for Reward Task during recording of electroencephalography. Goal-directed behavior was quantified as willingness to exert physical effort to obtain reward, and reward-evaluation was the degree to which the decision to exert effort was modulated by incentive level. We found that the amplitude of frontal-midline theta oscillations was greatest in participants with the greatest reward-evaluation. Furthermore, coupling between frontal theta phase and parieto-occipital gamma amplitude was positively correlated with reward-evaluation. In addition, goal-directed behavior was positively correlated with coupling between frontal delta phase to motor beta amplitude. Finally, we performed a factor analysis to derive 2 symptom dimensions and found that mood symptoms positively tracked with reward-evaluation and motivation symptoms negatively tracked with goal-directed behavior. Altogether, these results provide evidence that 2 aspects of reward-based decision-making are instantiated by different modes of prefrontal top-down control and are modulated in different symptom dimensions of depression.

Proprioceptive stimuli, comprising brief stretches of the wrist flexors, were delivered via a robotic wrist interface to 30 young people with dystonia (20 isolated genetic/idiopathic and 10 dystonic CP) and 22 controls (mean age 12.7 years). Scalp EEG was recorded using the 10-20 international system and the relative change in post-stimulus power with respect to baseline was calculated for the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (14-30 Hz) fre-quency bands. A clear developmental profile in event-related spectral changes was seen in controls. Controls showed a prominent early alpha/mu band event-related desynchronisation (ERD) followed by an event-related synchro-nisation (ERS) over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex following movement of either hand. The alpha ERD was significantly smaller in the dystonia groups for both dominant and non-dominant hand movement (ANCOVA across the 3 groups with age as covariate: dominant hand F(2,47) = 4.45 p = 0.017; non-dominant hand F(2,42) = 9.397 p < 0.001. Alpha ERS was significantly smaller in dystonia for the dominant hand (ANCOVA F(2,47) = 7.786 p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in ERD or ERS between genetic/idiopathic dystonia and dystonic CP. Conclusion: Modulation of alpha/mu activity by a proprioceptive stimulus is reduced in dystonia, demonstrating a developmental abnormality of sensorimotor processing which is common to isolated genetic/idiopathic and acquired dystonia/dystonic CP.

Cortical decreases in theta coherence are believed to reflect response accuracy efficiency. However, the role of theta coherence during conflict resolution is poorly understood in noncortical areas. In this study, coherence between the hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) was measured during a conflict resolution task. Although both brain areas have been previously implicated in the Stroop task, their interactions are not well understood. METHODS: Nine patients were implanted with stereotactic electroencephalography contacts in the hippocampus and OFC. Local field potential data were sampled throughout discrete phases of a Stroop task. Coherence was calculated for hippocampal and OFC contact pairs, and coherence spectrograms were constructed for congruent and incongruent conditions. Coherence changes during cue processing were identified using a nonparametric cluster-permutation t test. Group analysis was conducted to compare overall theta coherence changes among conditions. RESULTS: In 6 of 9 patients, decreased theta coherence was observed only during the incongruent condition (P < 0.05). Congruent theta coherence did not change from baseline. Group analysis showed lower theta coherence for the incongruent condition compared with the congruent condition (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Theta coherence between the hippocampus and OFC decreased during conflict. This finding supports existing theories that theta coherence desynchronization contributes to improved response accuracy and processing efficiency during conflict resolution. The underlying theta coherence observed between the hippocampus and OFC during conflict may be distinct from its previously observed role in memory.

This also allows the investigation of listening effort on larger time scales (i.e., sustained listening effort). Here, we investigated the modulation of sustained listening effort by a noise reduction algorithm as applied in hearing aids in a listening scenario with noisy continuous speech. The investigated directional noise reduction algorithm mainly suppresses noise from the background. Design: We recorded the pupil size and the EEG in 22 participants with hearing loss who listened to audio news clips in the presence of background multi-talker babble noise. We estimated how noise reduction (off, on) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR; +3 dB, +8 dB) affect pupil size and the power in the parietal EEG alpha band (i.e., parietal alpha power) as well as the behavioral performance. Results: Our results show that noise reduction reduces pupil size, while there was no significant effect of the SNR. It is important to note that we found interactions of SNR and noise reduction, which suggested that noise reduction reduces pupil size predominantly under the lower SNR. Parietal alpha power showed a similar yet nonsignificant pattern, with increased power under easier conditions. In line with the participants' reports that one of the two presented talkers was more intelligible, we found a reduced pupil size, increased parietal alpha power, and better performance when people listened to the more intelligible talker. Conclusions: We show that the modulation of sustained listening effort (e.g., by hearing aid noise reduction) as indicated by pupil size and parietal alpha power can be studied under more ecologically valid conditions. Mainly concluded from pupil size, we demonstrate that hearing aid noise reduction lowers sustained listening effort. Our study approximates to real-world listening scenarios and evaluates the benefit of the signal processing as can be found in a modern hearing aid.

J	Chaikovska, OV				Chaikovska, O., V			Effect of acute alcohol intoxication on scale-free neural activity in the lateral septum in rats	REGULATORY MECHANISMS IN BIOSYSTEMS			English	Article						neural noise; local field potential; LFP; ethanol; arrhythmic activity; neural activity; rats	NOISE; COMPONENTS; BALANCE; ORIGIN; EEG	Electrophysiological recordings of brain activity show both oscillatory dynamics that typically are analyzed in the time-frequency domain to describe brain oscillatory phenomena and scale-free arrhythmic activity defined as neural noise. Recent studies consider this arrhythmic fractal dynamics of neural noise as a sensitive biomarker of a number of cognitive processes, activity of neurotransmitter systems, changes that accompany neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders including alcohol use disorder. We tested the changes in neural noise induced by acute alcohol intoxication in the lateral septum for the entire spectrum (1-200 Hz) of local field potential signal and for frequency specific ranges (delta, theta, beta, gamma and epsilon bands). Five male Wistar rats were implanted with intracranial electrodes and local field potential signal was measured for baseline activity and activity induced by acute ethanol intoxication (2 g/kg). Change in neural noise dynamics was assessed as a change in the slope of linear regression fit of power spectral density curves in double logarithmic scale. In our study alcohol resulted in lower incline of scale-free activity in the lateral septum for high frequency range and for the whole spectrum, which is interpreted generally as increase in neural noise and change in neuronal processing in a more stochastic way initiated by the acute alcohol intoxication. At the same time, we observed decrease in neural noise for low frequency range. The observed changes may be related to the shift of the excitatory-inhibitory balance towards inhibition and changes in neurotransmission mostly in the GABAergic system. Scale-free activity was sensitive in the conditions of acute alcohol intoxication, therefore to understand its role in alcohol use disorder we need more data and studies on the underlying processes. Future studies should include simultaneous recordings and analysis of arrhythmic dynamics with the oscillatory and multiunit spiking activity in the lateral septum. It can reveal the contribution of different-scale processes in changes driven by acute alcohol intoxication and clarify the specific electrophysiological mechanisms.

Epilepsy Due to Mild TBI in Children: An Experience at a Tertiary Referral Center	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						mild TBI; posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE); intractable epilepsy; pediatric epilepsy; TBI in children; seizures; accidental trauma; non-accidental trauma; mechanism of mild TBI; Post-impact seizures; seizure semiology	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; EARLY POSTTRAUMATIC SEIZURES; CONCUSSIVE CONVULSIONS; UNPROVOKED SEIZURES; HEAD-INJURY; RISK; PREDICTION; SPORT	Rationale: Posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE) is a common cause of morbidity in children after a traumatic brain injury (TBI), occurring in 10-20% of children following severe TBI. PTE is diagnosed after two or more unprovoked seizures occurring 1-week post TBI. More often, studies have focused on children with epilepsy due to severe TBI. We aim to understand the utility of head computed tomography (HCT), EEG, and the risk of developing drug-resistant epilepsy in children after mild TBI. Method: We retrospectively studied 321 children with TBI at a tertiary pediatric referral center during a 10-year period. Mild TBI was defined as loss of consciousness (LOC) or amnesia < 30 min, moderate TBI as LOC or amnesia between 30 min and 1 day, and severe TBI as LOC or amnesia > 1 day, subdural hemorrhage, or contusion. Multiple clinical variables were reviewed, including past and present antiepileptic drug(s), seizure control, and mode of injury. First and subsequent post-TBI EEGs/prolonged video-EEGs were obtained acutely, subacutely, and/or chronically (range, day 1-3 years, median 1 month). Descriptive analyses were conducted using medians and ranges for continuous data. Categorical data were reported using frequencies and percentages, while comparisons between groups were made using Fisher's exact test for small sample sizes. Results: Forty-seven children were diagnosed with posttraumatic epilepsy: eight children (17%) due to mild TBI, 39 children (83%) due to severe TBI. For the eight children with mild TBI whom all had an accidental trauma (non-inflicted), the median follow-up time was 25 months (range 1.5 months-84 months). The median age was 10 years (range 4-18 years), and the median age at the time of injury was seven years (range: 23 months-13 years). No relevant previous medical history was present for six patients (80%), and two patients' (20%) relevant previous medical histories were unknown. Seven patients (88%) had no history of seizures, and patient #6 (12%) had unknown seizure history. Six patients (75%) had normal routine EEG(s). Patient #6 (13%) had an abnormal VEEG 3 months after the initial normal routine EEG, while patient #1 (13%) had an initial prolonged EEG 8 months after TBI. Compared to the 39 patients with severe TBI, 31 (79%) of whom had abnormal EEGs (routine and/or prolonged with video), mild TBI patients were more likely to have normal EEGs, p = 0.005. Head CT scans were obtained acutely for seven patients (90%), all of which were normal. One patient only had brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 8 months after the injury. Compared to the 39 patients with severe TBI, all of whom had abnormal HCTs, mild TBI patients were less likely to have abnormal HCTs, p < 0.0001. In patients with mild TBI, no patient had both abnormal EEG/VEEG and HCT, and no one was on more than one Antiepileptic drug (AED), p < 0.005. Six patients (75%) had MRIs, of which five (63%) were normal. Two patients (#1, 7) did not have MRIs, while one patient's (#4) MRI was unavailable. Five patients (63%) had a seizure <24 h post TBI, while the rest had seizures after the first week of injury. Conclusion: Children with epilepsy due to mild TBI, loss of consciousness, or amnesia < 30 min are more likely to have normal HCT and EEG and to be on 0-1 AED. Limitations of our study include the small sample size and retrospective design. The current findings add to the paucity of data in children who suffer from epilepsy due to mild TBI.

Thus, an investigation aiming at identifying ictal periods in autonomous nervous system-controlled signals that can be, also, continuously recorded through a wearable device is proposed. Two signals are considered, electrodermal activity, obtained from the measurement of the galvanic skin response, and heart rate variability, derived from the analysis of the inter beat interval computed from the photoplethysmographic signal. A database of 11 subjects, composed by these two signals recorded simultaneously with electroencephalography is employed. Time and frequency-domain features were extracted from the electrodermal and heart rate variability signals by taking 4-minute segments previous to the beginning of a seizure as interictal, and 4-minute segments after as ictal, for training, and through a 4-minute windows with a 30-second slide segmentation for testing, while the electroencephalographic signal was taken as reference to obtain the tags for the ictal and interictal periods. The features were classified using a perceptron multilayer neural network trained with scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation algorithm, obtaining the following results, accuracy: 25.15%, recall: 97.49%, specificity: 0.44% precision: 24.86%, and F2 score: 60.12%.

Based on experimental findings from animal models and brain tissue from patients with DRE, different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the cause(s) of drug resistance. One is the intrinsic severity hypothesis that posits that drug resistance is an inherent property of epilepsy related to disease severity. Seizure frequency is one measure of epilepsy severity, but frequency alone is an incomplete measure of severity and does not fully explain basic research and clinical studies on drug resistance; thus, other measures of epilepsy severity are needed. One such measure could be pathological high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), which are believed to reflect the neuronal disturbances responsible for the development of epilepsy and the generation of spontaneous seizures. In this manuscript, we will briefly review the intrinsic severity hypothesis, describe basic and clinical research on HFOs in the epileptic brain, and based on this evidence discuss whether HFOs could be a clinical measure of epilepsy severity. Understanding the mechanisms of DRE is critical for producing breakthroughs in the development and testing of novel strategies for treatment.

Its subjective effect has been described as intense, vivid dream-like experiences occurring while awake; hence, ibogaine is often referred to as an oneirogenic psychedelic. While this unique dream-like profile has been hypothesized to aid the antiaddictive effects, the electrophysiological signatures of this psychedelic state remain unknown. We previously showed in rats that ibogaine promotes a waking state with abnormal motor behavior along with a decrease in NREM and REM sleep. Here, we performed an in-depth analysis of the intracranial electroencephalogram during "ibogaine wakefulness". We found that ibogaine induces gamma oscillations that, despite having larger power than control levels, are less coherent and less complex. Further analysis revealed that this profile of gamma activity compares to that of natural REM sleep. Thus, our results provide novel biological evidence for the association between the psychedelic state and REM sleep, contributing to the understanding of the brain mechanisms associated with the oneirogenic psychedelic effect of ibogaine.

WORKING MEMORY, IMPULSIVITY AND EMOTIONAL REGULATION CORRELATES WITH FRONTAL ASYMMETRY OF HEALTHY YOUNG SUBJECTS DURING AUDITORY SESSION	NEURAL NETWORK WORLD			English	Article						EEG; working memory deficit; emotional regulation	QUESTIONNAIRE; ACTIVATION; DIAGNOSIS; SCALE; BETA	Background: Specific frequency oscillations provide idea about functioning of underlying brain regions. Brain oscillations and event based assessment of cognitive functions like working memory (WM), impulsivity (Imp) and emotional regulation (ER) were reported to influence each other in different ethnic groups. But how these traits are regulated in healthy Indian adults was not explored widely. Aims: We analyzed link between scalp electrical activity and different neuropsychological traits in higher education aspirants. Method: All the traits were self-assessed using standard questionnaires. QEEG was performed during an audio-sensory session. Tracings collected through BESS software were analyzed using SPSS. Results: Less impulsive individuals exhibited higher frontal theta and beta activity. Higher frontal theta activity was associated with higher ER, whereas higher theta and alpha activity showed association with WM deficit. Individuals with higher Imp and happiness exhibited higher frontal hemispheric asymmetry for theta and alpha, while those with lower asymmetry for alpha and beta activity showed higher ER. Beta asymmetry was positively related with happiness. Conclusions: We infer that variability in behaviour of healthy adults is influenced by differential frontal brain impulses and could be considered for providing individualized assistance to emotionally vulnerable individuals.

Methods: As part of a longitudinal study of early child development, we used the auditory oddball stimulus paradigm with a portable electroencephalography system to obtain ERP data from two-month-old infants (32 term, six preterm) in Sri Lanka. The mismatch negativity was calculated between 200 and 350 milliseconds after stimulus presentation. Results: We found a significant correlation between birth weight and mismatch negativity (P = 0.046), and our time-frequency analysis indicated power differences between standard and oddball tones at approximately 5 and 18 Hz. There was no significant difference between mismatch negativity in children undergoing ERP studies in a hospital setting (30) versus in the child's home (eight). Conclusions: Although our modest sample size precludes drawing definitive conclusions, these preliminary results show that it is possible to acquire ERP datasets using currently available portable technology in a hospital or home setting, even in a developing nation such as Sri Lanka. Follow-up of this cohort will include developmental assessments, which will add to the growing literature relating early electrophysiology to developmental outcome. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies in humans have measured putative memory representations indirectly, by decoding memory contents from neural activity evoked by a neutral impulse stimulus. However, it is unclear whether memory contents can also be decoded in different species and attentional conditions. Here, we employ a cross-species approach to test whether auditory memory contents can be decoded from electrophysiological signals recorded in different species. Awake human volunteers (N = 21) were exposed to auditory pure tone and noise burst stimuli during an auditory sensory memory task using electroencephalography. In a closely matching paradigm, anesthetized female rats (N = 5) were exposed to comparable stimuli while neural activity was recorded using electrocorticography from the auditory cortex. In both species, the acoustic frequency could be decoded from neural activity evoked by pure tones as well as neutral frozen noise burst stimuli. This finding demonstrates that memory contents can be decoded in different species and different states using homologous methods, suggesting that the mechanisms of sensory memory encoding are evolutionarily conserved across species.

Altered neural oscillations during complex sequential movements in patients with Parkinson's disease	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Motor complexity; Alpha oscillations; Magnetoencephalography; Parietal cortex	REACTION-TIME; BETA-DESYNCHRONIZATION; MOTOR; EEG; MEG; SEPARATION; ATTENTION; CORTEX; MODULATION; ACTIVATION	The sequelae of Parkinson's disease (PD) includes both motor-and cognitive-related symptoms. Although traditionally considered a subcortical disease, there is increasing evidence that PD has a major impact on cortical function as well. Prior studies have reported alterations in cortical neural function in patients with PD during movement, but to date such studies have not examined whether the complexity of multicomponent movements modulate these alterations. In this study, 23 patients with PD (medication "off" state) and 27 matched healthy controls performed simple and complex finger tapping sequences during magnetoencephalography (MEG), and the resulting MEG data were imaged to identify the cortical oscillatory dynamics serving motor performance. The patients with PD were significantly slower than controls at executing the sequences overall, and both groups took longer to complete the complex sequences than the simple. In terms of neural differences, patients also exhibited weaker beta complexity-related effects in the right medial frontal gyrus and weaker complexity-related alpha activity in the right posterior and inferior parietal lobules, suggesting impaired motor sequence execution. Characterizing the cortical pathophysiology of PD could inform current and future therapeutic interventions that address both motor and cognitive symptoms.

Several studies have suggested beneficial effects of GVS on motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Areas covered: A comprehensive overview of the stimulation techniques, potential mechanisms of action, challenges, and future research directions. Expert opinion: This emerging technology is not currently a viable therapy. However, a complementary therapy that is inexpensive, easily disseminated, customizable, and portable is sufficiently enticing that continued research and development is warranted. Future work utilizing biomedical engineering approaches, including concomitant functional neuroimaging, have the potential to significantly increase efficacy. GVS could be explored for other PD symptoms including orthostatic hypotension, dyskinesia, and sleep disorders.

This paper reviews terminology used to refer to cognitive load, mental workload and its variations, as well as their operationalizations and measurements. All 27 papers employed physiological NeuroIS measures, while six of them additionally used subjective self-ratings. The wide range of measurements prompts us to question if we are measuring the same construct. We provide an overview and a summary of cognitive load terminology and measurement used in these 27 papers and conclude with recommendations for future research.

High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have emerged as a promising clinical biomarker for presurgical evaluation in childhood epilepsy. HFOs are commonly classified in stereo-encephalography as ripples (80-200 Hz) and fast ripples (200-500 Hz). Ripples are less specific and not so directly associated with epileptogenic activity because of their physiological and pathological origin. The aim of this paper is to distinguish HFOs in the ripple band and to improve the evaluation of the epileptogenic zone (EZ). Approach. This study constitutes a novel modeling approach evaluated in ten patients from Sant Joan de Deu Pediatric Hospital (Barcelona, Spain), with clearly-defined seizure onset zones (SOZ) during presurgical evaluation. A subject-by-subject basis analysis is proposed: a probabilistic Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based on the combination of specific ripple features is applied for estimating physiological and pathological ripple subpopulations. Main Results. Clear pathological and physiological ripples are identified. Features differ considerably among patients showing within-subject variability, suggesting that individual models are more appropriate than a traditional whole-population approach. The difference in rates inside and outside the SOZ for pathological ripples is significantly higher than when considering all the ripples. These significant differences also appear in signal segments without epileptiform activity. Pathological ripple rates show a sharp decline from SOZ to non-SOZ contacts and a gradual decrease with distance. Significance. This novel individual GMM approach improves ripple classification and helps to refine the delineation of the EZ, as well as being appropriate to investigate the interaction of epileptogenic and propagation networks.

A study of slow oscillation-spindle coupling	SLEEP			English	Article						sleep; memory; consolidation; spindles; slow oscillations; children; autism	DECLARATIVE MEMORY; FALSE MEMORY; CONSOLIDATION; EEG	Sleep is assumed to support memory through an active systems consolidation process that does not only strengthen newly encoded representations but also facilitates the formation of more abstract gist memories. Studies in humans and rodents indicate a key role of the precise temporal coupling of sleep slow oscillations (SO) and spindles in this process. The present study aimed at bolstering these findings in typically developing (TD) children, and at dissecting particularities in SO-spindle coupling underlying signs of enhanced gist memory formation during sleep found in a foregoing study in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) without intellectual impairment. Sleep data from 19 boys with ASD and 20 TD boys (9-12 years) were analyzed. Children performed a picture-recognition task and the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) task before nocturnal sleep (encoding) and in the next morning (retrieval). Sleep-dependent benefits for visual-recognition memory were comparable between groups but were greater for gist abstraction (recall of DRM critical lure words) in ASD than TD children. Both groups showed a closely comparable SO-spindle coupling, with fast spindle activity nesting in SO-upstates, suggesting that a key mechanism of memory processing during sleep is fully functioning already at childhood. Picture-recognition at retrieval after sleep was positively correlated to frontocortical SO-fast-spindle coupling in TD children, and less in ASD children. Critical lure recall did not correlate with SO-spindle coupling in TD children but showed a negative correlation (r = -.64, p = .003) with parietal SO-fast-spindle coupling in ASD children, suggesting other mechanisms specifically conveying gist abstraction, that may even compete with SO-spindle coupling.

Global and intertuberal epileptic networks in tuberous sclerosis based on stereoelectroencephalographic (sEEG) findings: a quantitative EEG analysis in pediatric subjects and surgical implications	CHILDS NERVOUS SYSTEM			English	Article						Epileptic networks; Stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG); Global coherence; Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC); Quantitative analysis; Pediatric	LONG-TERM OUTCOMES; EKER RAT MODEL; CORTICAL TUBERS; EPILEPTOGENIC NETWORKS; PRESURGICAL EVALUATION; SURGERY; CHILDREN; COMPLEX; FOCI; LOCALIZATION	Objective Recent evidence favors a network concept in tuberous sclerosis (TSC) with seizure generation and propagation related to changes in global and regional connectivity between multiple, anatomically distant tubers. Direct exploration of network dynamics in TSC has been made possible through intracranial sampling with stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG). The objective of this study is to define epileptic networks in TSC using quantitative analysis of sEEG recordings. We also discuss the impact of the definition of these epileptic networks on surgical decision-making. Methods Intracranial sEEG recordings were obtained from four pediatric patients who presented with medically refractory epilepsy secondary to TSC and subjected to quantitative signal analysis methods. Cortical connectivity was quantified by calculating pairwise coherence between all contacts and constructing an association matrix. The global coherence, defined as the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to the sum of all the eigenvalues, was calculated for each frequency band (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma). Spatial distribution of the connectivity was identified by plotting the leading principal component (product of the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector). Results Four pediatric subjects with TSC underwent invasive intracranial monitoring with sEEG, comprising 31 depth electrodes and 250 contacts, for localization of the epileptogenic focus and guidance of subsequent surgical intervention. Quantitative connectivity analysis revealed a change in global coherence during the ictal period in the beta/low gamma (14-30 Hz) and high gamma (31-80 Hz) bands. Our results corroborate findings from existing literature, which implicate higher frequencies as a driver of synchrony and desynchrony. Conclusions Coordinated high-frequency activity in the beta/low gamma and high gamma bands among spatially distant sEEG define the ictal period in TSC. This time-dependent change in global coherence demonstrates evidence for intra-tuberal and inter-tuberal connectivity in TSC. This observation has surgical implications. It suggests that targeting multiple tubers has a higher chance of seizure control as there is a higher chance of disrupting the epileptic network. The use of laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) allowed us to target multiple disparately located tubers in a minimally invasive manner with good seizure control outcomes.

Although some cross-regional temporal correlation patterns (functional connectivity; FC) exhibit a high degree of stability across individuals and species, there is growing acknowledgment that measures of FC can exhibit marked changes over a range of temporal scales. Further, FC can covary with experimental task demands and ongoing neural processes linked to arousal, consciousness and perception, cognitive and affective state, and brain-body interactions. The increased recognition that such interrelated neural processes modulate FC measurements has raised both challenges and new opportunities in using FC to investigate brain function. Here, we review recent advances in the quantification of neural effects that shape fMRI FC and discuss the broad implications of these findings in the design and analysis of fMRI studies. We also discuss how a more complete understanding of the neural factors that shape FC measurements can resolve apparent inconsistencies in the literature and lead to more interpretable conclusions from fMRI studies.

Effects of Slow Oscillatory Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation on Motor Cortical Excitability Assessed by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						transcranial alternating current stimulation; transcranial magnetic stimulation; entrainment; plasticity; neural oscillations	ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; CORTICOSPINAL EXCITABILITY; BRAIN-STIMULATION; TACS; ENTRAINMENT; CORTEX; SHIFTS	Converging evidence suggests that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) may entrain endogenous neural oscillations to match the frequency and phase of the exogenously applied current and this entrainment may outlast the stimulation (although only for a few oscillatory cycles following the cessation of stimulation). However, observing entrainment in the electroencephalograph (EEG) during stimulation is extremely difficult due to the presence of complex tACS artifacts. The present study assessed entrainment to slow oscillatory (SO) tACS by measuring motor cortical excitability across different oscillatory phases during (i.e., online) and outlasting (i.e., offline) stimulation. 30 healthy participants received 60 trials of intermittent SO tACS (0.75 Hz; 16 s on/off interleaved) at an intensity of 2 mA peak-to-peak. Motor cortical excitability was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the hand region of the primary motor cortex (M1(HAND)) to induce motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the contralateral thumb. MEPs were acquired at four time-points within each trial - early online, late online, early offline, and late offline - as well as at the start and end of the overall stimulation period (to probe longer-lasting aftereffects of tACS). A significant increase in MEP amplitude was observed from pre- to post-tACS (paired-sample t-test; t(29) = 2.64, P = 0.013, d = 0.48) and from the first to the last tACS block (t(29) = -2.93, P = 0.02, d = 0.54). However, no phase-dependent modulation of excitability was observed. Therefore, although SO tACS had a facilitatory effect on motor cortical excitability that outlasted stimulation, there was no evidence supporting entrainment of endogenous oscillations as the underlying mechanism.

Ripples are regarded as playing an essential role in several aspects of memory function, mainly in the hippocampus. This type of ripple generally occurs with sharp waves and is called a sharp-wave ripple (SPW-R). Extensive research of SPW-Rs in the rodent brain while actively awake has also linked the function of these SPW-Rs to navigation and decision making. Although many studies with rodents unveiled SPW-R function, research in humans on this subject is still sparse. Therefore, unveiling SPW-R function in the human hippocampus is warranted. A certain type of ripples may also be a biomarker of epilepsy. This type of ripple is called a pathological ripple (p-ripple). p-ripples have a wider range of frequency (80-500 Hz) than SPW-Rs, and the range of frequency is especially higher in brain regions that are intrinsically linked to epilepsy onset. Brain regions producing ripples are too small for scalp electrode recording, and intracranial recording is typically needed to detect ripples. In addition, SPW-Rs in the human hippocampus have been recorded from patients with epilepsy who may have p-ripples. Differentiating SPW-Rs and p-ripples is often not easy. We need to develop more sophisticated methods to record SPW-Rs to differentiate them from p-ripples. This paper reviews the general features and roles of ripple waves.

Voltage-gated chloride channels (ClC) play diverse physiological roles in neurons. However, less is known regarding their functions in the epilepogenesis of TLE. Methods: ClC-mediated current and the spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents (sIPSC) in hippocampal neurons of epileptic lesions were investigated by electrophysiological recording. The EEG data were analyzed by Z-scored wavelet and Fourier transformations. The expression of ClC-3, a member of ClC gene family, was detected by immunostaining and western blot. Findings: ClC-mediated current was increased in the hippocampal neurons of chronic TLE mice. Application of chloride channel blockers, NPPB (5-Nitro-2- [3-phenylpropylamino] benzoic acid) and DIDS (4,4'-Diisothiocyanato-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid disodium salt) reduced ClC-mediated current and increased inhibitory synaptic transmission in TLE mice. NPPB and DIDS reduced the seizure frequency and the average absolute power of ictal high-frequency oscillations (HFOs, 80-500 Hz) in TLE mice. In addition, both drugs induced outwardly rectified currents, which might be tonic inhibitory currents in the hippocampal neurons of TLE patients. Furthermore, the expression of ClC-3 was increased in the hippocampus of TLE mice and patients and positively correlated with both the absolute power and number of ictal HFOs per seizure in the sclerotic hippocampus. Interpretation: These data suggest that ClC participate in the epilepogenetic process of TLE and the inhibition of ClC may have anti-epileptic effect. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Sensitivity of amplitude and phase based MEG measures of interhemispheric connectivity during unilateral finger movements	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Interhemispheric connectivity; Finger movements; Phase-based connectivity; Amplitude-based connectivity; Granger Causality; MEG	CONTRALESIONAL HEMISPHERE; BETA OSCILLATIONS; VOLUME-CONDUCTION; MOTOR CORTEX; EEG; INHIBITION; RHYTHMS; STROKE; SYNCHRONIZATION; DYNAMICS	Interactions between different brain regions can be revealed by dependencies between their neuronal oscillations. We examined the sensitivity of different oscillatory connectivity measures in revealing interhemispheric interactions between primary motor cortices (M1s) during unilateral finger movements. Based on frequency, amplitude, and phase of the oscillations, a number of metrics have been developed to measure connectivity between brain regions, and each metric has its own strengths, weaknesses, and pitfalls. Taking advantage of the well-known movement-related modulations of oscillatory amplitude in M1s, this study compared and contrasted a number of leading connectivity metrics during distinct phases of oscillatory power changes. Between M1s during unilateral movements, we found that phase-based metrics were effective at revealing connectivity during the beta (15-35 Hz) rebound period linked to movement termination, but not during the early period of beta desynchronization occurring during the movement itself. Amplitude correlation metrics revealed robust connectivity during both periods. Techniques for estimating the direction of connectivity had limited success. Granger Causality was not well suited to studying these connections because it was strongly confounded by differences in signal-to-noise ratio linked to modulation of beta amplitude occurring during the task. Phase slope index was suggestive but not conclusive of a unidirectional influence between motor cortices during the beta rebound. Our findings suggest that a combination of amplitude and phase-based metrics is likely required to fully characterize connectivity during task protocols that involve modulation of oscillatory power, and that amplitude-based metrics appear to be more sensitive despite the lack of directional information.

In sports, flow can be enhanced by mindfulness training, which has been associated with frontal theta activity (4-8 Hz). Moreover, frontal-midline theta oscillations were shown to subserve control processes in a large variety of cognitive tasks. Based on previous theta neurofeedback training studies, which revealed that one training session is sufficient to enhance motor performance, the present study investigated whether one 30-minute session of frontal-midline theta neurofeedback training (1) enhances flow experience additionally to motor performance in a finger tapping task, and (2) transfers to cognitive control processes in an n-back task. Participants, who were able to successfully upregulate their theta activity during neurofeedback training (responders), showed better motor performance and flow experience after training than participants, who did not enhance their theta activity (non-responders). Across all participants, increase of theta activity during training was associated with motor performance enhancement from pretest to posttest irrespective of pre-training performance. Interestingly, theta training gains were also linked to the increase of flow experience, even when corresponding increases in motor performance were controlled for. Results for the n-back task were not significant. Even though these findings are mainly correlational in nature and additional flow-promoting influences need to be investigated, the present findings suggest that frontal-midline theta neurofeedback training is a promising tool to support flow experience with additional relevance for performance enhancement.

However, to our knowledge, methods for measuring and analyzing brain organoid function have not been developed yet. This study focused on the frequency components of an obtained waveform below 500 Hz using planner microelectrode array (MEA) and evaluated the response to the convulsants pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and strychnine as well as the antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) perampanel and phenytoin. Sudden and persistent seizure-like firing was observed with PTZ administration, displaying a concentration-dependent periodic activity with the frequency component enhanced even in one oscillation characteristic. On the other hand, in the administration of AEDs, the frequency of oscillation decreased in a concentrationdependent manner and the intensity of the frequency component in one oscillation also decreased. Interestingly, at low doses of phenytoin, a group of synchronized bursts was formed, which was different from the response to the perampanel. Frequency components contained information on cerebral organoid function, and MEA was proven useful in predicting the seizure liability of drugs and evaluating the effect of AEDs with a different mechanism of action. In addition, frequency component analysis of brain organoids using MEA is an important analysis method to perform in vitro to in vivo extrapolation in the future, which will help explore the function of the organoid itself, study human brain developments, and treat various brain diseases.

We explored whether and how physical activity and aerobic fitness are associated with the oscillatory dynamics underlying anticipatory spatial attention. We studied whether the link between physical exercise level and cognitive control in adolescents is mediated by task-related oscillatory activity. Magnetoencephalographic alpha oscillations during a modified Posner's cueing paradigm were measured in 59 adolescents (37 females and 22 males, 12-17 years). Accelerometer-measured physical activity and aerobic fitness (20-m shuttle run test) were used to divide the sample into higher- and lower-performing groups. The interhemispheric alpha asymmetry during selective attention was larger in the high than in the low physical activity group, but there was no difference between the high and low aerobic fitness groups. Exploratory mediation analysis suggested that anticipatory interhemispheric asymmetry mediates the association between physical activity status and drift rate in the selective attention task. Higher physical activity was related to increased cue-induced asymmetry, which in turn was associated with less efficient processing of information. Behaviorally, more physically active males showed stronger dependence on the cue, while more fit females showed more efficient processing of information. Our findings suggest that physical activity may be associated with a neural marker of anticipatory attention in adolescents. These findings might help to explain the varying results regarding the association of physical activity and aerobic fitness with attention and inhibition in adolescents.

K-complexes have two major functions: first, they suppress cortical arousal in response to stimuli that the sleeping brain evaluates to avoid signaling danger; and second, they help strengthen memory. K-complexes also play an important role in the analysis of sleep quality, in the detection of diseases associated with sleep disorders, and as biomarkers for the detection of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Detecting K-complexes is relatively difficult, as reliable methods of identifying this complex cannot be found in the literature. In this paper, we propose a new method for the automatic detection of K-complexes combining the method of recursion and reallocation of the Cohen class and the deep neural networks, obtaining a recursive strategy aimed at increasing the percentage of classification and reducing the computation time required to detect K-complexes by applying the proposed methods.

There are no useful diagnostic biomarkers differentiating BAFME from other CM diseases. Objective To establish reliable biomarkers including high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) with giant SEPs for the diagnosis of BAFME. Methods This retrospective case study included 49 consecutive CM patients (16 BAFME and 33 other CM patients) who exhibited giant P25 or N35 SEPs. SEPs were processed by a band-pass filter of 400-1000 Hz to analyze HFOs. Clinical and SEP findings were compared between (1) BAFME and other CM groups and (2) patients with presence and absence of P25-HFOs (HFOs superimposed on giant P25). The diagnostic power of each factor for BAFME was calculated. Results All 16 BAFME patients showed SEP P25-HFOs with significantly higher occurrence (P < 0.0001) compared with that of other CM groups. The presence of P25-HFOs significantly correlated with a BAFME diagnosis (P < 0.0001) and high SEP P25 and N35 amplitudes (P = 0.01 and P < 0.0001, respectively). BAFME was reliably diagnosed using P25-HFOs with high sensitivity (100%), specificity (87.9%), positive predictive value (80%), and negative predictive value (100%), demonstrating its superiority as a diagnostic factor compared to other factors. Conclusions P25-HFOs with giant SEPs is a potential biomarker for BAFME diagnosis. P25-HFOs may reflect cortical hyperexcitability partly due to paroxysmal depolarizing shifts in epileptic neuronal activities and higher degrees of rhythmic tremulousness than those in ordinary CM.

Specifically, both the power and the phase of oscillations in the alpha-frequency band (9-13 Hz) have been reported to predict the detection of visual stimuli. Up to now, the functional mechanisms underlying pre-stimulus power and phase effects on upcoming visual percepts are debated. Here, we used magnetoencephalography recordings together with a near-threshold visual detection task to investigate the neural generators of pre-stimulus power and phase and their impact on subsequent visual-evoked responses. Pre-stimulus alpha-band power and phase opposition effects were found consistent with previous reports. Source localization suggested clearly distinct neural generators for these pre-stimulus effects: Power effects were mainly found in occipital-temporal regions, whereas phase effects also involved prefrontal areas. In order to be functionally relevant, the pre-stimulus correlates should influence post-stimulus processing. Using a trial-sorting approach, we observed that only pre-stimulus power modulated the Hits versus Misses difference in the evoked response, a well-established post-stimulus neural correlate of near-threshold perception, such that trials with stronger pre-stimulus power effect showed greater post-stimulus difference. By contrast, no influence of pre-stimulus phase effects were found. In sum, our study shows distinct generators for two pre-stimulus neural patterns predicting visual perception, and that only alpha power impacts the post-stimulus correlate of conscious access. This underlines the functional relevance of prestimulus alpha power on perceptual awareness, while questioning the role of alpha phase.

All patients were subjected to the detailed EEG examination. As was found, characteristics of pain in subjects of the examined group noticeably depended on the type of their temperament. Simultaneously, spectral powers (SPs) of EEG oscillations of the beta range also demonstrated specific dependences on the temperament type. Spectral powers of beta activity showed negative correlations (in many cases significant) with the extra/introversion estimates of the patients, while correlations with the neuroticism level were positive. The mean pain intensity in patients with choleric and melancholic temperaments showed positive correlations with the intensity of beta activity, while correlations of the periodicity of spinal pain with the above activity were positive and stronger. The above differences are assumed to depend on the functional state of the brain and, primarily, on the degree of activation of the ascending reticular formation reflected on the type of temperament of the individual. The importance of the human neuroconstitution for peculiarities of the pathogenesis of reflex neurological disorders of the spine with neck and back pain is discussed.	[Nazarchuk, I.

A state space modeling approach to real-time phase estimation	ELIFE			English	Article						phase; real-time; rhythms; EEG; LFP; Human; Rat	BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; FREQUENCY; EEG; RHYTHMS; AWAKE; MECHANISMS; GENERATION; COMPONENTS; AMPLITUDE	Brain rhythms have been proposed to facilitate brain function, with an especially important role attributed to the phase of low-frequency rhythms. Understanding the role of phase in neural function requires interventions that perturb neural activity at a target phase, necessitating estimation of phase in real-time. Current methods for real-time phase estimation rely on bandpass filtering, which assumes narrowband signals and couples the signal and noise in the phase estimate, adding noise to the phase and impairing detections of relationships between phase and behavior. To address this, we propose a state space phase estimator for real-time tracking of phase. By tracking the analytic signal as a latent state, this framework avoids the requirement of bandpass filtering, separately models the signal and the noise, accounts for rhythmic confounds, and provides credible intervals for the phase estimate. We demonstrate in simulations that the state space phase estimator outperforms current state-of-the-art real-time methods in the contexts of common confounds such as broadband rhythms, phase resets, and co-occurring rhythms. Finally, we show applications of this approach to in vivo data. The method is available as a ready-to-use plug-in for the Open Ephys acquisition system, making it widely available for use in experiments.

This paper covers the mentioned and currently missing parts of knowledge that are essential for the appropriate development of the method itself and future applications. Artificially streamed real sleep EEG data were used to quantitatively compare the two currently used real-time methods: the phase-locking loop (PLL) and the fixed-step stimulus in our own implementation. The fixed-step stimulation method was concluded to be more reliable and practically applicable compared to the PLL method. The sleep experiment with chronic insomnia patients in our sleep laboratory was analyzed in order to precisely characterize the effect of sound stimulation during deep sleep. We found that there is a significant phase synchronization of delta waves, which were shown to be the most sensitive metric of the effect of acoustic stimulation compared to commonly used averaged signal and power analyses. This finding may change the understanding of the effect and function of the SWA stimulation described in the literature.

Hidden wounds of violence: Abnormal motor oscillatory brain activity is related to posttraumatic stress symptoms	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						PTSD; LRP; Posttraumatic stress symptoms; Mu/alpha rhythms; Event-related potential; Brain oscillations	PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; PTSD CHECKLIST; ONSET LATENCY; VOLUNTARY; DISORDER; PICTURES; EEG; ACTIVATION; EXPOSURE; RHYTHMS	Victims of urban violence are at risk of developing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), one of the most debilitating consequences of violence. Considering that PTSD may be associated with inefficient selection of defensive responses, it is important to understand the relation between motor processing and PTSD. The present study aims to investigate the extent to which the severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) is related to motor preparation against visual threat cues in victims of urban violence. Participants performed a choice reaction time task while ignoring a picture that could be threating or neutral. The EEG indices extracted were the motor-related amplitude asymmetry (MRAA) in the alpha frequency range, and the lateralized readiness potential (LRP). We observed a linear relation between longer LRP latency and a slower reaction time, selectively during threat processing (compared to neutral) in low PTSS, but not in high PTSS participants. Alpha MRAA suppression and the PTSS were also linearly related: the smaller the alpha MRAA suppression in the threat condition relative to neutral, the greater the PTSS. These results provide evidence that threatening cues affect motor processing that is modulated by the severity of PTSS in victims of urban violence.

J	Stein, J				Stein, John			Reduced Visual Magnocellular Event-Related Potentials in Developmental Dyslexia	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						dyslexia; visual; magnocellular; parvocellular; timing; VERPs; spectral analysis; biomarker; hemifield; handedness		(1) Background-the magnocellular hypothesis proposes that impaired development of the visual timing systems in the brain that are mediated by magnocellular (M-) neurons is a major cause of dyslexia. Their function can now be assessed quite easily by analysing averaged visually evoked event-related potentials (VERPs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Such analysis might provide a useful, objective biomarker for diagnosing developmental dyslexia. (2) Methods-in adult dyslexics and normally reading controls, we recorded steady state VERPs, and their frequency content was computed using the fast Fourier transform. The visual stimulus was a black and white checker board whose checks reversed contrast every 100 ms. M- cells respond to this stimulus mainly at 10 Hz, whereas parvocells (P-) do so at 5 Hz. Left and right visual hemifields were stimulated separately in some subjects to see if there were latency differences between the M- inputs to the right vs. left hemispheres, and these were compared with the subjects' handedness. (3) Results-Controls demonstrated a larger 10 Hz than 5 Hz fundamental peak in the spectra, whereas the dyslexics showed the reverse pattern. The ratio of subjects' 10/5 Hz amplitudes predicted their reading ability. The latency of the 10 Hz peak was shorter during left than during right hemifield stimulation, and shorter in controls than in dyslexics. The latter correlated weakly with their handedness. (4) Conclusion-Steady state visual ERPs may conveniently be used to identify developmental dyslexia. However, due to the limited numbers of subjects in each sub-study, these results need confirmation.

The aim of this study was to study the neuropsychological profile of patients with PNES and an age-matched group of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) during admission to a video electroencephalography monitoring unit (VEMU) and 1 year after discharge. Methods: Patients diagnosed with PNES or TLE at a VEMU were prospectively recruited. Neuropsychological, demographic, clinical, and treatment variables were collected at baseline and 1 year. To minimize multiple comparisons, scores from different cognitive tests were computed for attention and psychomotor speed, verbal memory, visual memory, language, and executive function. A global cognitive impairment index (GCII) was also created. Post hoc analyses were conducted to identify clinical variables that might mediate the differences observed in cognition over time between the groups. These included seizure frequency, number of antiseizure medication (ASM), number of psychotropic drugs, depression, and quality of life. Results: We studied 24 patients with PNES and 24 patients with TLE. The groups performed similarly in the baseline neuropsychological tests. There was a significant time (baseline to 1-year follow-up) by group (PNES vs TLE) interaction for the GCII (p = 0.006), language (p = 0.04), and executive function (p = 0.013), with PNES patients showing improvement and TLE patients remaining stable. The time by group interaction for attention and psychomotor speed showed a trend toward significance (p = 0.056), Reduction in number of ASM was associated with improved cognition in PNES patients at 1 year. Conclusion: PNES patients showed improved cognition at 1 year of follow-up, particularly in language and executive functions. This finding shows the potential benefits of an early, accurate diagnosis, which range from improved cognition to better management. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Functional Connectivity and Frequency Power Alterations during P300 Task as a Result of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis	SENSORS			English	Article						ALS; EEG; classifier; neural; connectivity; frequency-specific; BCI	OSCILLATIONS	Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most aggressive neurodegenerative diseases and is now recognized as a multisystem network disorder with impaired connectivity. Further research for the understanding of the nature of its cognitive affections is necessary to monitor and detect the disease, so this work provides insight into the neural alterations occurring in ALS patients during a cognitive task (P300 oddball paradigm) by measuring connectivity and the power and latency of the frequency-specific EEG activity of 12 ALS patients and 16 healthy subjects recorded during the use of a P300-based BCI to command a robotic arm. For ALS patients, in comparison to Controls, the results (p < 0.05) were: an increment in latency of the peak ERP in the Delta range (OZ) and Alpha range (PO7), and a decreased power in the Beta band among most electrodes; connectivity alterations among all bands, especially in the Alpha band between PO7 and the channels above the motor cortex. The evolution observed over months of an advanced-state patient backs up these findings. These results were used to compute connectivity- and power-based features to discriminate between ALS and Control groups using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Cross-validation achieved a 100% in specificity and 75% in sensitivity, with an overall 89% success.</p>	[Perez-Ortiz, Claudia X.; Gordillo, Jose L.; Mendoza-Montoya, Omar; Antelis, Javier M.] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Monterrey 64849, Mexico; [Caraza, Ricardo; Martinez, Hector R.] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Med & Ciencias Salud, Monterrey 64849, Mexico		Mendoza-Montoya, O (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Monterrey 64849, Mexico.	c.xochitl96@gmail.com; JLGordillo@Tec.mx; omendoza83@tec.mx; mauricio.antelis@tec.mx; rcaraza@tec.mx; hector.ramon@tec.mx		Mendoza Montoya, Omar/0000-0002-4355-886X; Antelis, Javier M./0000-0003-3377-0813	National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACyT) [PN2015-873]; UIC-TEC Seed Funding Program 2021-2022	National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACyT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); UIC-TEC Seed Funding Program 2021-2022	This research has been funded by the National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico (CONACyT) through grant PN2015-873, and the UIC-TEC Seed Funding Program 2021-2022.		31	2	2	0	0	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		1424-8220		SENSORS-BASEL	Sensors	OCT	2021	21	20							6801	10.3390/s21206801	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21206801			20	Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation	WS6NU	34696014	gold, Green Published			2022-08-02	WOS:000715296400001

However, the nature of the underlying mechanisms remains unclear. Here, we therefore used multivariate pattern analyses to directly test the similarities in brain activity among different sleep stages (non-rapid eye movement stages N1-N3, as well as rapid-eye movement sleep REM, and wake). We varied stimulus salience by manipulating subjective (own vs. unfamiliar name) and paralinguistic (familiar vs. unfamiliar voice) salience in 16 healthy sleepers during an 8-h sleep opportunity. Paralinguistic salience (i.e., familiar vs. unfamiliar voice) was reliably decoded from EEG response patterns during both N2 and N3 sleep. Importantly, the classifiers trained on N2 and N3 data generalized to N3 and N2, respectively, suggesting similar processing mode in these states. Moreover, projecting the classifiers' weights using a forward model revealed similar fronto-central topographical patterns in NREM stages N2 and N3. Finally, we found no generalization from wake to any sleep stage (and vice versa) suggesting that "processing modes" or the overall processing architecture with respect to relevant oscillations and/or networks substantially change from wake to sleep. However, the results point to a single and rather uniform NREM-specific mechanism that is involved in (auditory) salience detection during sleep.

Clinical electroencephalography research shows that patients with dementia due to AD exhibit a slowing of neural electrical activity in the parietal cortex. Memory research has further suggested that successful memory performance is associated with changes in a posterior cingulate-parahippocampal cortical network together with increased theta-gamma oscillatory coupling, where theta oscillations act as carrier waves for gamma oscillations, which contain the actual information. However, the neurophysiological link between the memory research and clinical studies investigating aMCI and AD is lacking. In this study, we look at brain activity in aMCI and how it relates to memory performance. We demonstrate decreased gamma power in the posterior cingulate cortex and the left and right parahippocampus in aMCI patients in comparison to control participants. This goes together with reduced theta coherence between the posterior cingulate cortex and parahippocampus associated with altered memory performance aMCI patients in comparison to control participants. In addition, comparing patients with aMCI to control participants reveals an effect for theta-gamma coupling for the posterior cingulate cortex, and the left and right parahippocampus. Taken together, our results show that parahippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex interact via theta-gamma coupling, which is associated with memory recollection and is altered in aMCI patients, offering a potential candidate mechanism for memory decline in aMCI.

While somatosensory information is crucial for motor control and learning, the effects of somatosensory TMR on motor memory consolidation remain elusive. Here, healthy young adults (n = 28) were trained on a sequential serial reaction time task and received, during the offline consolidation period that followed, sequential electrical stimulation of the fingers involved in the task. This somatosensory TMR procedure was applied during either a 90-minute diurnal sleep (NAP) or wake (NONAP) interval that was monitored with electroencephalography. Consolidation was assessed with a retest following the NAP/NONAP episode. Behavioral results revealed no effect of TMR on motor performance in either of the groups. At the brain level, somatosensory stimulation elicited changes in oscillatory activity in both groups. Specifically, TMR induced an increase in power in the mu band in the NONAP group and in the beta band in both the NAP and NONAP groups. Additionally, TMR elicited an increase in sigma power and a decrease in delta oscillations in the NAP group. None of these TMR-induced modulations of oscillatory activity, however, were correlated with measures of motor memory consolidation. The present results collectively suggest that while somatosensory TMR modulates oscillatory brain activity during post-learning sleep and wakefulness, it does not influence motor performance in an immediate retest.

For this to transpire, prior knowledge must first be reinstated and then instantiated by being applied to incoming stimuli. Previous neuropsychological models implicate the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in mediating these functions for schemas and the anterior/lateral temporal lobes and related structures for categories. vmPFC, however, may also affect processing of semantic category information. Here, the putative differential role of the vmPFC in the reinstatement and instantiation of schemas and semantic categories was examined by probing network-level oscillatory dynamics. Patients with vmPFC damage (n = 11) and healthy controls (n = 13) were instructed to classify words according to a given schema or category, while electroencephalography was recorded. As reinstatement is a preparatory process, we focused on oscillations occurring 500 msec prior to stimulus presentation. As instantiation occurs at stimulus presentation, we focused on oscillations occurring between stimulus presentation and 1000 msec poststimulus. We found that reinstatement was associated with prestimulus, theta and alpha desynchrony between vmPFC and the posterior parietal cortex for schemas, and between lateral temporal lobe and inferotemporal cortex for categories. Damage to the vmPFC influenced both schemas and categories, but patients with damage to the subcallosal vmPFC showed schema-specific deficits. Instantiation showed similar oscillatory patterns in the poststimulus time frame, but in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Taken together, these findings highlight distinct but partially overlapping neural mechanisms implicated in schema- and category-mediated processing.

Early alpha/beta oscillations reflect the formation of face-related expectations in the brain	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; SEX-DIFFERENCES; TOP-DOWN; IDENTITY; MODULATION; DYNAMICS; BETA	Although statistical regularities in the environment often go explicitly unnoticed, traces of implicit learning are evident in our neural activity. Recent perspectives have offered evidence that both pre-stimulus oscillations and peri-stimulus event-related potentials are reliable biomarkers of implicit expectations arising from statistical learning. What remains ambiguous, however, is the origination and development of these implicit expectations. To address this lack of knowledge and determine the temporal constraints of expectation formation, pre-stimulus increases in alpha/beta power were investigated alongside a reduction in the N170 and a suppression in peri-/post-stimulus gamma power. Electroencephalography was acquired from naive participants who engaged in a gender classification task. Participants were uninformed, that eight face images were sorted into four reoccurring pairs which were pseudorandomly hidden amongst randomly occurring face images. We found a reduced N170 for statistically expected images at left parietal and temporo-parietal electrodes. Furthermore, enhanced gamma power following the presentation of random images emphasized the bottom-up processing of these arbitrary occurrences. In contrast, enhanced alpha/beta power was evident pre-stimulus for expected relative to random faces. A particularly interesting finding was the early onset of alpha/beta power enhancement which peaked immediately after the depiction of the predictive face. Hence, our findings propose an approximate timeframe throughout which consistent traces of enhanced alpha/beta power illustrate the early prioritisation of top-down processes to facilitate the development of implicitly cued face-related expectations.

Atypical electrophysiological and behavioral responses to diazepam in a leading mouse model of Down syndrome	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; TS65DN MOUSE; PLUS-MAZE; INHIBITION; MEMORY; RAT; EPILEPSY; OSCILLATIONS; DEFICITS	Mounting evidence implicates dysfunctional GABA(A)R-mediated neurotransmission as one of the underlying causes of learning and memory deficits observed in the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome (DS). The specific origin and nature of such dysfunction is still under investigation, which is an issue with practical consequences to preclinical and clinical research, as well as to the care of individuals with DS and anxiety disorder or those experiencing seizures in emergency room settings. Here, we investigated the effects of GABA(A)R positive allosteric modulation (PAM) by diazepam on brain activity, synaptic plasticity, and behavior in Ts65Dn mice. We found Ts65Dn mice to be less sensitive to diazepam, as assessed by electroencephalography, long-term potentiation, and elevated plus-maze. Still, diazepam pre-treatment displayed typical effectiveness in reducing susceptibility and severity to picrotoxin-induced seizures in Ts65Dn mice. These findings fill an important gap in the understanding of GABAergic function in a key model of DS.	[Victorino, Daniella B.; Pinheiro, Daniel J. L.

Confirmation of laterality is required when the preoperative evaluation limits the EZ to bilateral anterior temporal lobes or bilateral frontal lobes. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are considered to be promising biological markers for the EZ. However, a large number of studies on HFOs stem from intracranial research. There were few quantitative measures for scalp HFOs, so we proposed a new method to quantify and analyze scalp HFOs. This method was called the "scalp-HFO index" (HI) and calculated in both the EZ and non-EZ. The calculation was based on the numbers and spectral power of scalp HFOs automatically detected. We labeled the brain lobes involved in the EZ as regions of interest (ROIs). The HIs based on the ripple numbers (n-HI) and spectral power (s-HI) were significantly higher in the ROI than in the contra-ROI (P = 0.012, P = 0.003), indicating that HIs contributed to the lateralization of EZ. The sensitivity and specificity of n-HI for the localization of the EZ were 90% and 79.58%, respectively, suggesting that n-HI was valuable in localizing the EZ. HI may contribute to the implantation strategy of invasive electrodes. However, few scalp HFOs were recorded when the EZ was located in the medial cortex region. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We proposed the scalp-high-frequency oscillation (HFO) index (HI) as a quantitative assessment method for scalp HFOs to locate the epileptogenic zone (EZ). Our results showed that the HI in regions of interest (ROIs) was significantly higher than in contra-ROIs. Sensitivity and specificity of HI based on ripple rates (n-HI) for EZ localization were 90% and 79.58%, respectively. If the n-HI of the brain region was >1.35, it was more likely to be an epileptogenic region. Clinical application of HIs as an indicator may facilitate localization of the EZ.

J	Ghiani, A; Maniglia, M; Battaglini, L; Melcher, D; Ronconi, L				Ghiani, Andrea; Maniglia, Marcello; Battaglini, Luca; Melcher, David; Ronconi, Luca			Binding Mechanisms in Visual Perception and Their Link With Neural Oscillations: A Review of Evidence From tACS	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						tACS; brain oscillations; temporal binding; spatial binding; feature binding		Neurophysiological studies in humans employing magneto- (MEG) and electro- (EEG) encephalography increasingly suggest that oscillatory rhythmic activity of the brain may be a core mechanism for binding sensory information across space, time, and object features to generate a unified perceptual representation. To distinguish whether oscillatory activity is causally related to binding processes or whether, on the contrary, it is a mere epiphenomenon, one possibility is to employ neuromodulatory techniques such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). tACS has seen a rising interest due to its ability to modulate brain oscillations in a frequency-dependent manner. In the present review, we critically summarize current tACS evidence for a causal role of oscillatory activity in spatial, temporal, and feature binding in the context of visual perception. For temporal binding, the emerging picture supports a causal link with the power and the frequency of occipital alpha rhythms (8-12 Hz); however, there is no consistent evidence on the causal role of the phase of occipital tACS. For feature binding, the only study available showed a modulation by occipital alpha tACS. The majority of studies that successfully modulated oscillatory activity and behavioral performance in spatial binding targeted parietal areas, with the main rhythms causally linked being the theta (similar to 7 Hz) and beta (similar to 18 Hz) frequency bands. On the other hand, spatio-temporal binding has been directly modulated by parieto-occipital gamma (similar to 40-60 Hz) and alpha (10 Hz) tACS, suggesting a potential role of cross-frequency coupling when binding across space and time. Nonetheless, negative or partial results have also been observed, suggesting methodological limitations that should be addressed in future research. Overall, the emerging picture seems to support a causal role of brain oscillations in binding processes and, consequently, a certain degree of plasticity for shaping binding mechanisms in visual perception, which, if proved to have long lasting effects, can find applications in different clinical populations.

The reduced WM capacity is a common feature in many diseases, such as schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The theta-gamma neural code is an essential component of memory representations in the multi-item WM. A large body of studies have examined the association between cross-frequency coupling (CFC) across the cerebral cortices and WM performance; electrophysiological data together with the behavioral results showed the associations between CFC and WM performance. The oscillatory entrainment (sensory, non-invasive electrical/magnetic, and invasive electrical) remains the key method to investigate the causal relationship between CFC and WM. The frequency-tuned non-invasive brain stimulation is a promising way to improve WM performance in healthy and non-healthy patients with cognitive impairment. The WM performance is sensitive to the phase and rhythm of externally applied stimulations. CFC-transcranial-alternating current stimulation (CFC-tACS) is a recent approach in neuroscience that could alter cognitive outcomes. The studies that investigated (1) the association between CFC and WM and (2) the brain stimulation protocols that enhanced WM through modulating CFC by the means of the non-invasive brain stimulation techniques have been included in this review. In principle, this review can guide the researchers to identify the most prominent form of CFC associated with WM processing (e.g., theta/gamma phase-amplitude coupling), and to define the previously published studies that manipulate endogenous CFC externally to improve WM. This in turn will pave the path for future studies aimed at investigating the CFC-tACS effect on WM. The CFC-tACS protocols need to be thoroughly studied before they can be considered as therapeutic tools in patients with WM deficits.</p>	[Abubaker, Mohammed; Al Qasem, Wiam; Kvasnak, Eugen] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Med Biophys & Med Informat, Fac Med 3, Prague, Czech Republic		Abubaker, M (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Dept Med Biophys & Med Informat, Fac Med 3, Prague, Czech Republic.	mohammad.abubaker@lf3.cuni.cz							167	2	2	18	24	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND	1664-1078			FRONT PSYCHOL	Front.

J	He, Q; Pursiainen, S				He, Qin; Pursiainen, Sampsa			An extended application 'Brain Q' processing EEG and MEG data of finger stimulation extended from 'Zeffiro' based on machine learning and signal processing	COGNITIVE SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						Machine learning; Data analysis and signal processing; Functional analysis; Dipole reconstruction; EEG and MEG data; Bayes Optimization; Cognitive computation	MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; MODELS; OSCILLATIONS	Goal: To apply signal processing and machine learning skills and knowledge in processing the EEG and MEG signal and further localize and evaluate the source of the finger stimulation. Methods: Cognitive control is usually applied in information processing and behavioral response. In the preprocessing, baseline correction is implemented to analyze the pre-stimuli, combining ERP to mark the event related potential, studying the time-locked only behavior. Z-score transform, coherence and spec trum are calculated and analyzed in the functional connectivity analysis. In addition to the functional analysis, Bayes Optimizer evaluates the neuro imaging according to the hierarchical Bayes. The introduction of the application is described from both user and developer's prospects. Results: Introduction of both user and developers aspects, on its modules from pre-processing, functional analysis and results visualization and evaluation is conducted with one specific clinical data case, including the correlation is higher especially on gamma band and the MVAR coherence on the whole source space depicting the relation between different regions, especially on somatosensory (compared by thalamus) when stimulated by finger activity, phase-lock property of the E/MEG signal and etc. Compared to a manual selection, the scaling parameter prediction can be improved with support vector machine (SVM). The evaluation results with Bayes Optimization, location prediction is superior in the somatosensory area and in the thalamus, the total reconstructed source space is larger, one of the realization of cognitive system comparing different kernels and classifiers. The SVM and discriminant classifier gives similar results evaluating the dipole localization and the parameter choice related as well to the shape parameter, noise level, hyperprior and etc. Conclusion: Approaches of Brain Q are found to be suitable for pre-processing for the EEG and MEG data. The system is capable of functional analysis including coherence and spectral related computation. Machine learning techniques are conducted as well to analyze and evaluate the result of the dipole reconstruction and help to predict the better model parameters and the localization of the origin dipoles. A case on finger stimulation clinical data is conducted and the results of the analysis temporarily and spatially manifests its functionality for users and potential extensions for developers.

Heart rate variability is reduced during the menstrual phase in women with catamenial C1-type temporal lobe epilepsy	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Autonomic system; Epilepsy; Menstrual Cycle; Heart Rate Variability; SUDEP	PROGESTERONE; ESTROGEN; AGE	Introduction: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most frequent focal epilepsy in adulthood. Catamenial C1-type TLE, is characterized by a cyclic seizure exacerbation during the menstrual phase. The heart rate variability (HRV) analysis assesses cardiac autonomic control and may represent a biomarker for Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). It is plausible that female sex hormones can influence HRV. These changes might be more pronounced in patients suffering from catamenial C1-type TLE where hormonal changes also increase seizure susceptibility. To that aim, we evaluated HRV changes during the menstrual phase of women suffering from catamenial C1-type TLE. Methods: We enrolled 12 adults with a diagnosis of catamenial C1-type TLE (Catamenial Group) and 12 age-, and seizure-frequency-matched controls with TLE (Non-Catamenial Group). Each patient underwent a 20-minute EEG + EKG recording in resting state during the menstrual phase. HRV parameters were calculated with a short-lasting analysis of EKG records. Time domain-related, frequency domainrelated, as well as non-linear analysis parameters, were compared between the two groups. Result: Compared to the Non-Catamenial Group, the Catamenial Group showed significant reductions in SDNN (p-value = 0.01), RMSSD (p-value = 0.04), pNN50 (p-value = 0.001), LnLF ms(2) (p-value = 0.05), LnHF ms(2) (p-value = 0.007), SD1 (p-value = 0.02), and SD2 (p-value = 0.01). These results were independent from age, disease duration, numbers of ASM, and seizure etiology. Conclusion: Our data provide experimental evidence that vagal output is reduced during the menstrual phase in patients with catamenial C1-type TLE. These results indicate that, during the menstrual phase, patients with catamenial C1-type TLE may be at a higher risk of developing cardiac dysfunctions and SUDEP. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

This EP data set includes three stimulation paradigms: auditory (AEP, 40 and 2000 Hz), sensory (SEP, left and right maxillary nerve) and high-frequency oscillations (HFO) SEP. This permits derivation of electroencephalogram (EEG) biomarkers of corticothalamic communication under these conditions. The data set is presented in full band sampled at 2000 Hz. We provide technical validation of the evoked responses for the states of sedation, ischemia and recovery. This extended data set now permits mutual inferences between spontaneous and evoked activities across the recorded modalities. Future studies on the dataset may contribute to the development of new brain monitoring technologies, which will facilitate the prevention of neurological injuries.

GABAergic neurons in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) send inhibitory projections to multiple arousal-promoting nuclei, but the role of these neurons in modulating consciousness is unknown. In this study, designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) were targeted to RMTg GABAergic neurons of Vgat-ires-Cre mice. DREADDs expression was found in the RMTg and other brainstem regions. Activation of these neurons decreased movement and exploratory behavior, impaired motor coordination, induced electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations resembling nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep without loss of righting and reduced the dose requirement for sevoflurane-induced unconsciousness. These results suggest that GABAergic neurons in the RMTg and other brainstem regions promote sedation and facilitate sevoflurane-induced unconsciousness.

The timed release of neuromodulators from subcortical structures dynamically sculpts neural synchronization in thalamocortical networks to meet current attentional demands. In particular, noradrenaline modulates the balance of cortical excitation and inhibition, as reflected by thalamocortical alpha synchronization (similar to 8-12 Hz). These neuromodulatory adjustments facilitate the selective processing of prioritized information. Thus, by disrupting effective rhythmic coordination in attention networks, age-related locus coeruleus (LC) degeneration can impair higher levels of neural processing. In sum, findings across different levels of analysis and modalities shed light on how the noradrenergic modulation of neural synchronization helps to shape selective attention.

In this study, we found that, as assessed by magnetoencephalography, electromagnetic cortical neuronal activity while performing cognitive tasks was associated with a decrease in motivation caused by the tasks in healthy participants, suggesting the possibility that the brain utilizes information that reflects the invested amount of neural activity to suppress performance. To our knowledge, this is the first report to provide clues for the missing link between neural investments and the resulting activation of the biological alarms that suppress performance.

Studies on cortical effective connectivity (EC) during sleep may provide more direct and pathological information and shed new light on brain dysfunction due to SAHS. However, the EC is rarely explored in SAHS patients, especially during different sleep stages. Methods: To this end, six-channel EEG signals of 43 SAHS patients and 41 healthy participants were recorded by whole-night polysomnography (PSG). The symbolic transfer entropy (STE) was applied to measure the EC between cortical regions in different frequency bands. Posterior-anterior ratio (PA) was employed to evaluate the posterior-to-anterior pattern of information flow based on overall cortical EC. The statistical characteristics of the STE and PA and of the intra-individual normalized parameters (STE* and PA*) were served as different feature sets for classifying the severity of SAHS. Results: Although the patterns of STE across electrodes were similar, significant differences were found between the patient and the control groups. The variation trends across stages in the PA were also different in multiple frequency bands between groups. Important features extracted from the STE* and PA* were distributed in multiple rhythms, mainly in delta, alpha, and gamma. The PA* feature set gave the best results, with accuracies of 98.8% and 83.3% for SAHS diagnosis (binary) and severity classification (four-way). Conclusions: These results suggest that modifications in cortical EC were existed in SAHS patients during sleep, which may help characterize cortical abnormality in patients. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

This is one of the excellent models to explore the action of peripheral cytokine on central nervous system (CNS) and to study the development of depression. The auditory steady-state response (ASSR), electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations induced by periodic acoustic stimulation, is an effective approach to evaluate the neural function in mental illness including depression. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of IFN-alpha on the cortical ASSR and its correlation with depressive-like behavior. Methods: Chronic electrodes were implanted on the skull over the auditory cortex (AC) of male C57BL/6 mice. The animals were treated with daily injection of IFN-alpha or saline (vehicle) for three weeks. EEGs were recorded in AC of the same mouse before and after the injection treatment to monitor the changes of ASSR induced by IFN-alpha. Depressive-like behavior was analyzed in the forced swim test (FST). Immunohistochemical staining was used to examine the status of neuron and glia in the hippocampus and AC. Results: Compared to pretreatment condition, injection of IFN-alpha significantly reduced the power of 40 Hz ASSR in the mouse AC from the second week. Such a decrease continued to the third week. The immobility times of FST were significantly increased by a 3-week treatment of IFN-alpha and the immobility time was negatively correlated with the power of 40 Hz ASSR. Astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampus and AC were activated by IFN-alpha, but the density of neuron was not significantly affected. Conclusion: Our results suggest that EEG measurement of ASSR may be used as a biomarker to monitor the CNS side effects of IFN-alpha treatment and to search a novel intervention with potential therapeutic implications.

In this review the diversity of approach available is showcased. We first describe the most commonly used features that can be extracted from oscillatory activity of the central nervous system, and how these can be combined with an expanding range of non-invasive and invasive brain stimulation techniques. We then shift our focus to the periphery using tremor and Tourette's syndrome to illustrate the utility of peripheral biomarkers and interventions. Finally, we discuss current innovations which are changing the landscape of stimulation strategy by integrating technological advances and the use of machine learning to drive optimization.

J	Yuan, GJ; Liu, GY				Yuan, Guangjie; Liu, Guangyuan			Mate preference and brain oscillations: Initial romantic attraction is associated with decreases in alpha- and lower beta-band power	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						event-related desynchronization; event-related potential; individual preference; mate selection; romantic attraction	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; LOVE; DECISIONS; ATTENTION; ERD/ERS; LUST	Initial romantic attraction (IRA) refers to a series of positive reactions (such as feelings of exhilaration and compulsive thinking) toward desirable potential partners, usually at initial or early-stage encounters when no close relationship has yet been established. After decades of effort, the evolutionary value and key characteristics of IRA are well understood. However, the brain mechanisms associated with IRA are unclear. To address this question, we simulated a mate selection platform similar to that of Tinder. When participants assessed their romantic interest in potential partners on the platform, their electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded in real time. The behavioral data demonstrated that IRA to ideal potential partners mainly reflects the dimensions of arousal and domination. The main study finding was that processing of the individual preference faces that resulted in IRA was associated with a decrease in power in the alpha and lower beta bands over the posterior and anterior sensor clusters; this occurred between 870 and 2,000 ms post-stimulus. Key findings regarding event-related potentials (ERPs) sensitive to individual stimuli preferences were replicated. The results support the hypothesis that brain oscillations in the alpha and lower beta range may reflect modulation in cortical activity associated with individual mate preferences.

Applied research usually describes a delay in primary task resumption as an essential component of this performance deficit. Here, we investigate this approach using electrophysiological correlates of the focusing of attention within working memory, a process that is fundamental to switching between different tasks. A lateralized working memory task was frequently interrupted by either a high- or low-demanding arithmetic task and a subsequent retrospective cue indicated the working memory item required for later report. The detrimental effect of interruptions on primary task performance was most pronounced for high-demanding interruptions. After retro-cue presentation, fronto-central theta power (4-7 Hz) was lowest following high-demanding interruptions and posterior alpha power (8-14 Hz) was less suppressed in the two interruption conditions. These effects might be related to a deficit in attentional control processes following the retrospective cue. Furthermore, we introduce the suppression of posterior alpha power contralateral to the remembered primary task stimuli during the interruption phase as a temporal marker for primary task resumption. Especially for cognitively demanding interruption tasks, this effect seems to overlap in time with the processing of the interruption, which should contribute to the primary task performance deficit.

Measuring synchrony in bio-medical timeseries	CHAOS			English	Article								Paroxysms are sudden, unpredictable, short-lived events that abound in physiological processes and pathological disorders, from cellular functions (e.g., hormone secretion and neuronal firing) to life-threatening attacks (e.g., cardiac arrhythmia, epileptic seizures, and diabetic ketoacidosis). With the increasing use of personal chronic monitoring (e.g., electrocardiography, electroencephalography, and glucose monitors), the discovery of cycles in health and disease, and the emerging possibility of forecasting paroxysms, the need for suitable methods to evaluate synchrony-or phase-clustering-between events and related underlying physiological fluctuations is pressing. Here, based on examples in epilepsy, where seizures occur preferentially in certain brain states, we characterize different methods that evaluate synchrony in a controlled timeseries simulation framework. First, we compare two methods for extracting the phase of event occurrence and deriving the phase-locking value, a measure of synchrony: (M1) fitting cycles of fixed period-length vs (M2) deriving continuous cycles from a biomarker. In our simulations, M2 provides stronger evidence for cycles. Second, by systematically testing the sensitivity of both methods to non-stationarity in the underlying cycle, we show that M2 is more robust. Third, we characterize errors in circular statistics applied to timeseries with different degrees of temporal clustering and tested with different strategies: Rayleigh test, Poisson simulations, and surrogate timeseries. Using epilepsy data from 21 human subjects, we show the superiority of testing against surrogate time-series to minimize false positives and false negatives, especially when used in combination with M1. In conclusion, we show that only time frequency analysis of continuous recordings of a related bio-marker reveals the full extent of cyclical behavior in events. Identifying and forecasting cycles in biomedical timeseries will benefit from recordings using emerging wearable and implantable devices, so long as conclusions are based on conservative statistical testing.

We used implantable video-EEG radiotelemetry and qPCR to unravel the role of Ca(v)3.2 Ca2+ channels in hippocampal theta genesis. Frequency analysis of spontaneous long-term recordings in controls and Ca(v)3.2(-/-) mice revealed robust increase in relative power in the theta (4-8 Hz) and theta-alpha (4-12 Hz) ranges, which was most prominent during the inactive stages of the dark cycles. Urethane injection experiments also showed enhanced type II theta activity and altered theta architecture following Ca(v)3.2 ablation. Next, gene candidates from hippocampal transcriptome analysis of control and Ca(v)3.2(-/-) mice were evaluated using qPCR. Dynein light chain Tctex-Type 1 (Dynlt1b) was significantly reduced in Ca(v)3.2(-/-) mice. Furthermore, a significant reduction of GABA A receptor delta subunits and GABA B1 receptor subunits was observed in the septohippocampal GABAergic system. Our results demonstrate that ablation of Ca(v)3.2 significantly alters type II theta activity and theta architecture. Transcriptional changes in synaptic transporter proteins and GABA receptors might be functionally linked to the electrophysiological phenotype.

It plays a protective role in survival and exerts a vital impact on successful social interaction. Sleep loss, however, is commonplace in current society, and people are increasingly plagued by it. Previous studies have investigated whether sleep loss affects empathy for pain, yet the results were undecided. We aimed to determine whether this effect is existed and further explore the temporal and frequency dynamics of neural activities involved in this effect by recording the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We recruited 25 healthy adults (11 females) who were required to perform a pain judgement and unpleasantness rating about the presented nociceptive and neutral pictures after nocturnal sleep (NS) and sleep deprivation (SD), and their neuronal activities were recorded by event-related potentials (ERPs). Results showed a significantly decreased amplitude in the early components (N2, N340) of vicarious pain processing after SD. In further timefrequency (TF) analysis, a reduced energy occurred in theta2 (5-7 Hz) band under SD condition. Moreover, the decreased theta2 was positively correlated with the subjective ratings of both other's pain and selfunpleasantness only under SD condition. Our results indicated that SD impairs affective sharing of empathy for pain.

Mediated by the Ascending Reticular Arousal System (ARAS), arousal-dependent inputs interact with neural circuitry to shape their dynamics. In the occipital cortex, such inputs may trigger shifts between dominant oscillations, where alpha activity is replaced by gamma activity, or vice versa. A salient example of this are spectral power alternations observed while eyes are opened and/or closed. These transitions closely follow fluctuations in arousal, suggesting a common origin. To better understand the mechanisms at play, we developed and analyzed a computational model composed of two modules: a thalamocortical feedback circuit coupled with a superficial cortical network. Upon activation by noise-like inputs originating from the ARAS, our model is able to demonstrate that noise-driven non-linear interactions mediate transitions in dominant peak frequency, resulting in the simultaneous suppression of alpha limit cycle activity and the emergence of gamma oscillations through coherence resonance. Reduction in input provoked the reverse effect - leading to anticorrelated transitions between alpha and gamma power. Taken together, these results shed a new light on how arousal shapes oscillatory brain activity.

Sexually dimorphic development in the cortical oscillatory dynamics serving early visual processing	DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Gamma; Alpha; Magnetoencephalography; Development; Vision	SEX-DIFFERENCES; BAND OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; LATE MATURATION; BRAIN; CHILDHOOD; FREQUENCY; EEG; MEG	Successful interaction with one's visual environment is paramount to developing and performing many basic and complex mental functions. Although major aspects of visual development are completed at an early age, other structural and functional components of visual processing appear to be dynamically changing across a much more protracted period extending into late childhood and adolescence. However, the underlying neurophysiological changes and cortical oscillatory dynamics that support maturation of the visual system during this developmental period remain poorly understood. The present study utilized magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate maturational changes in the neural dynamics serving basic visual processing during childhood and adolescence (ages 9-15, n = 69). Our key results included robust sex differences in alpha oscillatory activity within the left posterior parietal cortex, and sex-by-age interactions in gamma activity in the right lingual gyrus and superior parietal lobule. Hierarchical regression revealed that the peak frequency of both the alpha and gamma responses predicted response power in parietal regions above and beyond the noted effects of age and sex. These findings affirm the view that neural oscillations supporting visual processing develop over a much more protracted period, and illustrate that these maturational trajectories are influenced by numerous elements, including age, sex, and individual variation.

Spacetime in the brain: rapid brain network reorganization in visual processing and recovery	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; WORKING-MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; RESTORATION; STIMULATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; MODULATION; ACTIVATION; TOPOLOGY	Functional connectivity networks (FCN) are the physiological basis of brain synchronization to integrating neural activity. They are not rigid but can reorganize under pathological conditions or during mental or behavioral states. However, because mental acts can be very fast, like the blink of an eye, we now used the visual system as a model to explore rapid FCN reorganization and its functional impact in normal, abnormal and post treatment vision. EEG-recordings were time-locked to visual stimulus presentation; graph analysis of neurophysiological oscillations were used to characterize millisecond FCN dynamics in healthy subjects and in patients with optic nerve damage before and after neuromodulation with alternating currents stimulation and were correlated with visual performance. We showed that rapid and transient FCN synchronization patterns in humans can evolve and dissolve in millisecond speed during visual processing. This rapid FCN reorganization is functionally relevant because disruption and recovery after treatment in optic nerve patients correlated with impaired and recovered visual performance, respectively. Because FCN hub and node interactions can evolve and dissolve in millisecond speed to manage spatial and temporal neural synchronization during visual processing and recovery, we propose "Brain Spacetime" as a fundamental principle of the human mind not only in visual cognition but also in vision restoration.

However, previous studies in animal models lacking the corpus callosum due to agenesis or total callosotomy and in humans with agenesis of the corpus callosum suggested that cortico-cortical connections may also have a relevant role in cortical (inter-hemispheric) spindle synchronization. Yet, most of these works did not provide direct quantitative analyses to support their observations. By studying a rare sample of callosotomized, split-brain patients, we recently demonstrated that the total resection of the corpus callosum is associated with a significant reduction in the inter-hemispheric propagation of non-REM slow waves. Interestingly, sleep spindles are often temporally and spatially grouped around slow waves (0.5-4 Hz), and this coordination is thought to have an important role in sleep-dependent learning and memory consolidation. Given these premises, here we set out to investigate whether total callosotomy may affect the generation and spreading of sleep spindles, as well as their coupling with sleep slow waves. To this aim, we analysed overnight high-density EEG recordings (256 electrodes) collected in five patients who underwent total callosotomy due to drug-resistant epilepsy (age 40-53, two females), three non-callosotomized neurological patients (age 44-66, two females), and in a sample of 24 healthy adult control subjects (age 20-47, 13 females). Individual sleep spindles were automatically detected using a validated algorithm and their properties and topographic distributions were computed. All analyses were performed with and without a regression-based adjustment accounting for inter-subject age differences. The comparison between callosotomized patients and healthy subjects did not reveal systematic variations in spindle density, amplitude or frequency. However, callosotomized patients were characterized by a reduced spindle duration, which could represent the result of a faster desyncbronization of spindle activity across cortical areas of the two hemispheres. In contrast with our previous findings regarding sleep slow waves, we failed to detect in callosotomized patients any clear, systematic change in the inter-hemispheric synchronization of sleep spindles. In line with this, callosotomized patients were characterized by a reduced extension of the spatial association between temporally coupled spindles and slow waves. Our findings arc consistent with a dependence of spindles on thalamo-cortical rather than cortico-cortical connections in humans, but also revealed that, despite their temporal association, slow waves and spindles arc independently regulated in terms of topographic expression.

It is lower in patients with epilepsy than in the healthy controls. However, HRV has been inadequately studied in different patient subgroups with medically controlled epilepsy. Hence, this study aimed to investigate factors associated with interictal HRV in patients with medically controlled epilepsy. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 54 patients (24 males and 30 females) with medically controlled focal epilepsy who only received monotherapy to eliminate the confounding effect of different antiseizure medications (ASMs). Patients with major systemic or psychiatric disorder comorbidities were excluded. For HRV analysis, electroencephalography and 5-minute well-qualified electrocardiogram segment recording were conducted during stage N1 or N2 sleep. In addition, the association between age, gender, seizure onset type, ASMs, and the time domain and frequency-domain HRV measures was analyzed. Results: HRV negatively correlated with advanced age. Patients with focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure (FBTCS) had a significantly lower HRV than focal impaired awareness seizures (FIAS). HRV was not associated with any gender and ASMs. Conclusions: HRV negatively correlated with age, and patients with FBTCS had a decreased HRV. Thus, these patients may have a declining autonomic function. Therefore, different seizure types may carry different risks of autonomic dysfunction in patients with medically controlled focal epilepsy.

However, clear neurophysiological markers that would identify at-risk individuals represent still an unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate possible alterations in the resting alpha oscillatory activity in normal population high on schizotypy trait, a physiological condition known to be severely altered in patients with schizophrenia. Direct comparison of resting-state EEG oscillatory activity between Low and High Schizotypy Group (LSG and HSG) has revealed a clear right hemisphere alteration in alpha activity of the HSG. Specifically, HSG shows a significant slowing down of right hemisphere posterior alpha frequency and an altered distribution of its amplitude, with a tendency towards a reduction in the right hemisphere in comparison to LSG. Furthermore, altered and reduced connectivity in the right fronto-parietal network within the alpha range was found in the HSG. Crucially, a trained pattern classifier based on these indices of alpha activity was able to successfully differentiate HSG from LSG on tested participants further confirming the specific importance of right hemispheric alpha activity and intrahemispheric functional connectivity. By combining alpha activity and connectivity measures with a machine learning predictive model optimized in a nested stratified cross-validation loop, current research offers a promising clinical tool able to identify individuals at-risk of developing psychosis (i.e., high schizotypy individuals).

One specific class of theories, intrinsic clock theories, postulate that temporal information of a stimulus is represented much like other features such as color and location, bound together to form a coherent percept. Here, we explored to what extent this holds for temporal information after it has been perceived and is held in working memory for subsequent comparison. We recorded EEG of participants who were asked to time stimuli at lateral positions of the screen followed by comparison stimuli presented in the center. Using well-established markers of working memory maintenance, we investigated whether the usage of temporal information evoked neural signatures that were indicative of the location where the stimuli had been presented, both during maintenance and during comparison. Behavior and neural measures including the contralateral delay activity, lateralized alpha suppression, and decoding analyses through time all supported the same conclusion: The representation of location was strongly involved during perception of temporal information, but when temporal information was to be used for comparison, it no longer showed a relation to spatial information. These results support a model where the initial perception of a stimulus involves intrinsic computations, but that this information is subsequently translated to a stimulusindependent format to be used to further guide behavior.

Contribution of left supramarginal and angular gyri to episodic memory encoding: An intracranial EEG study	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Episodic memory; Ventral parietal cortex; Subsequent memory effect; Spectral tilt; iEEG	HIGH-FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PARIETAL CORTEX; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; SUBSEQUENT MEMORY; INFERIOR; NETWORK; LOBE; REGISTRATION; METAANALYSIS	The role of the left ventral lateral parietal cortex (VPC) in episodic memory is hypothesized to include bottom-up attentional orienting to recalled items, according to the dual-attention model (Cabeza et al., 2008). However, its role in memory encoding could be further clarified, with studies showing both positive and negative subsequent memory effects (SMEs). Furthermore, few studies have compared the relative contributions of sub-regions in this functionally heterogeneous area, specifically the anterior VPC (supramarginal gyrus/BA40) and the posterior VPC (angular gyrus/BA39), on a within-subject basis. To elucidate the role of the VPC in episodic encoding, we compared SMEs in the intracranial EEG across multiple frequency bands in the supramarginal gyrus (SmG) and angular gyrus (AnG), as twenty-four epilepsy patients with indwelling electrodes performed a free recall task. We found a significant SME of decreased theta power and increased high gamma power in the VPC overall, and specifically in the SmG. Furthermore, SmG exhibited significantly greater spectral tilt SME from 0.5 to 1.6 s post-stimulus, in which power spectra slope differences between recalled and unrecalled words were greater than in the AnG (p = 0.04). These results affirm the contribution of VPC to episodic memory encoding, and suggest an anterior-posterior dissociation within VPC with respect to its electrophysiological underpinnings.

J	Muralidharan, V; Aron, AR				Muralidharan, Vignesh; Aron, Adam R.			Behavioral Induction of a High Beta State in Sensorimotor Cortex Leads to Movement Slowing	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HZ OSCILLATORY SYNCHRONY; MOTOR CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; BURSTS; EEG; MECHANISMS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; STIMULATION; MODULATIONS; PERFORMANCE	The sensorimotor beta rhythm (similar to 13- 30 Hz) is commonly seen in relation to movement. It is important to understand its functional/ behavioral significance in both health and disease. Sorting out competing theories of sensorimotor beta is hampered by a paucity of experimental protocols in humans that manipulate/induce beta oscillations and test their putative effects on concurrent behavior. Here, we developed a novel behavioral paradigm to generate beta and then test its functional relevance. In two human experiments with scalp EEG (n = 11 and 15), we show that a movement instruction generates a high beta state (postmovement beta rebound), which then slows down subsequent movements required during that state. We also show that this high initial beta rebound related to reduced mu-beta desynchronization for the subsequent movement and, further, that the temporal features of the beta state, that is, the beta bursts, related to the degree of slowing. These results suggest that increased sensorimotor beta in the postmovement period corresponds to an inhibitory state-insofar as it retards subsequent movement. By demonstrating a behavioral method by which people can proactively create a high beta state, our paradigm provides opportunities to test the effect of this state on sensations and affordances. It also suggests related experiments using motor imagery rather than actual movement, and this could later be clinically relevant, for example, in tic disorder.

Recently, neural activity in the gamma band has been identified as a driver of arteriolar vasomotion while, on the other hand, gamma activity induction on preclinical models of AD has been shown to promote protein clearance and cognitive protection. Methods: In two open-label studies, we assessed the possibility to modulate cerebral perfusion in 15 mild to moderate AD participants via 40Hz (gamma) transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) administered 1 h daily for 2 or 4 weeks, primarily targeting the temporal lobe. Perfusion-sensitive MRI scans were acquired at baseline and right after the intervention, along with electrophysiological recording and cognitive assessments. Results: No serious adverse effects were reported by any of the participants. Arterial spin labeling MRI revealed a significant increase in blood perfusion in the bilateral temporal lobes after the tACS treatment. Moreover, perfusion changes displayed a positive correlation with changes in episodic memory and spectral power changes in the gamma band. Conclusions: Results suggest 40Hz tACS should be further investigated in larger placebo-controlled trials as a safe, non-invasive countermeasure to increase fast brain oscillatory activity and increase perfusion in critical brain areas in AD patients.

Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) interpret human intent into machine reactions, and the visual stimulation (VS) paradigm is one of the most widely used of these approaches. Although VS-based BMIs have a relatively high information transfer rate (ITR), it is still difficult for BMIs to control machines in dynamic environments (for example, grabbing a dynamic object or targeting a walking person). Approach. In this study, we utilized a BMI based on augmented reality (AR) VS (AR-VS). The proposed VS was dynamically generated based on machine vision, and human intent was interpreted by a dynamic decision time interval approach. A robot based on the coordination of a task and self-motion system was controlled by the proposed paradigm in a fast and flexible state. Methods. Objects in scenes were first recognized by machine vision and tracked by optical flow. AR-VS was generated based on the objects' parameters. The number and distribution of VS was confirmed by the recognized objects. Electroencephalogram (EEG) features corresponding to VS and human intent were collected by a dry-electrode EEG cap and determined by the filter bank canonical correlation analysis method. Key parameters in the AR-VS, including the effect of VS size, frequency, dynamic object moving speed, ITR and the performance of the BMI-controlled robot, were analyzed. Conclusion and significance. The ITR of the proposed AR-VS paradigm for nine healthy subjects was 36.3 +/- 20.1 bits min(-1). In the online robot control experiment, brain-controlled hybrid tasks including self-moving and grabbing objects were 64% faster than when using the traditional steady-state visual evoked potential paradigm. The proposed paradigm based on AR-VS could be optimized and adopted in other kinds of VS-based BMIs, such as P300, omitted stimulus potential, and miniature event-related potential paradigms, for better results in dynamic environments.

Using a large multi-site prospective longitudinal dataset of infants with low and high familial risk for ASD, metrics of PAF at 12 months were extracted and growth curves estimated for cognitive development between 12?36 months. Analyses tested whether PAF 1) differs between low and high risk infants, 2) is associated with concurrent non-verbal/verbal cognitive ability and 3) predicts developmental change in non-verbal/verbal ability. Moderation of associations between PAF and cognitive ability by familial risk status was also tested. No differences in 12-month PAF were found between low and high risk infants. PAF was associated with concurrent non-verbal cognitive ability, but did not predict change in non-verbal cognitive over development. No associations were found between PAF and verbal ability, along with no evidence of moderation. PAF is not related to familial risk for ASD, and is a neural marker of concurrent non-verbal cognitive ability, but not verbal ability, in young infants at low and high risk for ASD	[Leno, Virginia Carter; Pickles, Andrew] Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, London, England; [van Noordt, Stefon; Huberty, Scott; Elsabbagh, Mayada] McGill Univ, Azrieli Ctr Autism Res, Montreal Neurol Inst, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Desjardins, James] Compute Ontario, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Webb, Sara Jane] Seattle Childrens Res Inst, Ctr Child Hlth Behav & Dev, Seattle, WA USA		Leno, VC (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Inst Psychiat Psychol & Neurosci, Dept Biostat & Hlth Informat, 16 De Crespigny Pk, London SE5 8AF, England.	virginia.carter_leno@kcl.ac.uk	; Pickles, Andrew/A-9625-2011	Carter Leno, Virginia/0000-0002-7455-5514; Huberty, Scott/0000-0003-2637-031X; Pickles, Andrew/0000-0003-1283-0346; Elsabbagh, Mayada/0000-0002-7311-9059	UK Medical Research Council; Autistica; NIMH [U19 MH108206]; NIH [P50 HD055782]; Autism Science Foundation; Azrieli Centre for Autism Research; Transforming Autism Care Consortium (TACC); NIHR [NF-SI-0617-10120]; Biomedical Research Centre at South London; Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust; Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship [213608/Z/18/Z]; King's College London	UK Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Autistica(Autistica); NIMH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Autism Science Foundation; Azrieli Centre for Autism Research; Transforming Autism Care Consortium (TACC); NIHR(National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)); Biomedical Research Centre at South London; Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust; Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship; King's College London(General Electric)	ASIS data were collected with support from the UK Medical Research Council and Autistica.

To address this issue, a simulation was designed based on the principle of electroencephalogram (EEG) generation of equivalent dipole current in deep brain, where a single oscillatory dipole current represented the rhythm generator, the dipole moment for the rhythm generator's conducting direction (which was orthogonal and rotating every 30 degrees and at pointing to or parallel to the frontal lobe surface) and the (an)isotropic conduction medium for the 3D (a)symmetrical brain tissue. Both the power above average (significant power value, SP value) and its space (SP area) of low-frequency oscillatory FPs were employed to respectively evaluate the strength and the space of the influence. The computation was conducted using the finite element method (FEM) and Hilbert transform. The finding was that either the SP value or the SP area could be reduced or extended, depending on the conducting direction of deep-brain rhythm generator flowing in the (an)isotropic medium, suggesting that the 3D (a)symmetrical brain tissue could decay or strengthen the spatial spread of a rhythm generator conducting in a different direction.

Prior work has demonstrated that these models can recognize the mental state in a variety of tasks, but few have specifically explored their performance concerning human factors that come into play with the use of brain-computer interfaces in day-to-day applications. For this research, we explored the use of 1D-convolutional neural networks to recognize two mental states-mental arithmetic and rest-from electroencephalograph signals. We focused our analysis on three parameters that affect the design and usability of brain-computer interfaces: input data representation (i.e. domain), window size (i.e. latency), and electrode montage (i.e. form-factor). In line with prior work, we found a clear bias in performance towards the frequency domain representation. We also found that training our model with short windows of time (i.e. 0.25s) provided close to peak accuracy. Furthermore, high accuracy was maintained with sparse electrode subsets of the full 10-20 system. We discuss these findings and how they can contribute to ongoing work to bring deep learning enabled brain-computer interfaces into day-to-day applications.

Method: Retrospective pediatric case series of patients presenting focal PMG-related refractory epilepsy undergoing an invasive exploration (iEEG) at Fondation Rothschild Hospital. We reviewed clinical data, structural MRI, and visual analysis of iEEG recordings. Moreover, time-frequency analysis of SEEG signals with a neuroimaging approach (epileptogenicity maps) was used to support visual analysis. Results: Between 2012 and 2019, eight patients were selected. Five patients were explored with stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) only, one patient with subdural exploration (SDE) only and two patients first underwent SEEG and then SDE. T he mean age at seizure onset was 40.3 months (range 3-120), and the mean age for the iEEG 10.8 years (range 7-15). The epileptogenic zone (EZ) appeared concordant to the PMG lesion in only one case, was larger in three cases, smaller in two cases and different in one case. Four cases were selected for tailored resective surgery and one for total callosotomy. Two patients remained seizure-free at their last follow-up (mean 32.6 months, range 7-98). Epileptogenicity mapping (EM) refined the qualitative analysis, showing in four patients an EZ larger than visually defined. Conclusion: This study is the first pediatric study to analyze the value of iEEG and EM as well as operability in focal PMG-related refractory epilepsy. The results illustrate the complexity of this pathology with variable concordance between the EZ and the lesion and mixed response to surgery.

J	Torres, FA; Orio, P; Escobar, MJ				Torres, Felipe A.; Orio, Patricio; Escobar, Maria-Jose			Selection of stimulus parameters for enhancing slow wave sleep events with a neural-field theory thalamocortical model	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; CLOSED-LOOP STIMULATION; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; SPINDLES; RIPPLES; PHASE; TDCS	Author summary During the non-REM (NREM) phase of sleep, events that are known as slow oscillations (SO) and spindles (SP) can be detected by EEG. These events have been associated with the consolidation of declarative memories and learning. Thus, there is an ongoing interest in promoting them during sleep by non-invasive manipulations such as sensory stimulation. In this paper, we used a computational model of brain activity that generates SO and SP, to investigate which type of sensory stimulus -shape, amplitude, duration, periodicity- would be optimal for increasing the events' frequency and their co-occurrence. We found that a decreasing ramp of 50 ms duration is the most effective. The effectiveness increases when the stimulus pulse is delivered in a closed-loop configuration triggering the pulse at a target phase of the ongoing SO activity. A desirable secondary effect is to promote SPs at the rising phase of the SO oscillation. Slow-wave sleep cortical brain activity, conformed by slow-oscillations and sleep spindles, plays a key role in memory consolidation. The increase of the power of the slow-wave events, obtained by auditory sensory stimulation, positively correlates to memory consolidation performance. However, little is known about the experimental protocol maximizing this effect, which could be induced by the power of slow-oscillation, the number of sleep spindles, or the timing of both events' co-occurrence. Using a mean-field model of thalamocortical activity, we studied the effect of several stimulation protocols, varying the pulse shape, duration, amplitude, and frequency, as well as a target-phase using a closed-loop approach. We evaluated the effect of these parameters on slow-oscillations (SO) and sleep-spindles (SP), considering: (i) the power at the frequency bands of interest, (ii) the number of SO and SP, (iii) co-occurrences between SO and SP, and (iv) synchronization of SP with the up-peak of the SO. The first three targets are maximized using a decreasing ramp pulse with a pulse duration of 50 ms. Also, we observed a reduction in the number of SO when increasing the stimulus energy by rising its amplitude. To assess the target-phase parameter, we applied closed-loop stimulation at 0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees of the phase of the narrow-band filtered ongoing activity, at 0.85 Hz as central frequency. The 0 degrees stimulation produces better results in the power and number of SO and SP than the rhythmic or random stimulation. On the other hand, stimulating at 45 degrees or 90 degrees change the timing distribution of spindles centers but with fewer co-occurrences than rhythmic and 0 degrees phase. Finally, we propose the application of closed-loop stimulation at the rising zero-cross point using pulses with a decreasing ramp shape and 50 ms of duration for future experimental work.

Timing-dependent differential effects of unexpected events on error processing reveal the interactive dynamics of surprise and error processing	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						cognitive control; delta-to-theta oscillation; error processing; surprise; unexpected event	ADJUSTMENTS; NETWORK; BRAIN; COMPONENT; THETA; SUPPRESSION; ATTENTION; MECHANISM; NOVELTY	When unexpected events occur during goal-directed behavior, they automatically trigger an orienting-related cascade of psychological and neural processes through which they influence behavior and cognition. If the unexpected event was caused by an action error, additional error-specific, strategic-related processes have been proposed to follow the initial orienting period. Little is known about the neural interactions between action errors and unexpected perceptual events, two instantiations of unexpected events, in these two putative stages of post-error processing. Here, we aimed to address this by investigating the electrophysiological dynamics associated with action errors and unexpected perceptual events using scalp EEG with a focus on the frontal midline (FM) delta-to-theta oscillations (1-8 Hz) indicative of the performance-monitoring system. Specifically, we examined how the timing of unexpected sounds would influence behavior and neural oscillations after action errors, depending on the length of the intertrial interval (ITI). Our data showed that unexpected sounds aggravated post-error decreases in accuracy when they occurred (1) immediately after errors (i.e., post-error orienting period), regardless of ITI and (2) immediately after the post-error stimulus (i.e., post-error strategic period), at short ITIs. Meanwhile, action errors and unexpected sounds independently produced increased FM delta-to-theta power during the post-error orienting period, regardless of ITIs. However, when unexpected sounds occurred during the post-error strategic period, action errors produced lower FM delta-to-theta power than correct responses, at short ITIs. These differential effects of unexpected events on behavior and FM delta-to-theta dynamics support the notion of the two post-error periods during which different processes are implemented.

Lappaconitine (LA), a potent analgesic drug extracted from the root of natural Aconitum species, has been clinically used for years because of its effective analgesic and non-addictive properties. However, being limited to ethological experiments, previous studies have mainly investigated the analgesic effect of LA at the behavioral level, and the associated antinociceptive mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, electrocorticogram (ECoG) technology was used to investigate the analgesic effects of two homologous derivatives of LA, Lappaconitine hydrobromide (LAH) and Lappaconitine trifluoroacetate (LAF), on Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to nociceptive laser stimuli, and to further explore their antinociceptive mechanisms. We found that both LAH and LAF were effective in reducing pain, as manifested in the remarkable reduction of nocifensive behaviors and laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) amplitudes (N2 and P2 waves, and gamma-band oscillations), and significantly prolonged latencies of the LEP-N2/P2. These changes in LEPs reflect the similar antinociceptive mechanism of LAF and LAH, i.e., inhibition of the fast signaling pathways. In addition, there were no changes in the auditory-evoked potential (AEP-N1 component) before and after LAF or LAH treatment, suggesting that neither drug had a central anesthetic effect. Importantly, compared with LAH, LAF was superior in its effects on the magnitudes of gamma-band oscillations and the resting-state spectra, which may be associated with their differences in the octanol/water partition coefficient, degree of dissociation, toxicity, and glycine receptor regulation. Altogether, jointly applying nociceptive laser stimuli and ECoG recordings in rats, we provide solid neural evidence for the analgesic efficacy and antinociceptive mechanisms of derivatives of LA.

We analyzed the ability of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to distinguish EZ and non-EZ HFOs. Nineteen medically intractable epilepsy patients with good surgical outcomes 2 years after surgery were studied. Five-minute interictal intracranial electroencephalogram epochs of slow-wave sleep were selected randomly. Then 5 s segments of ripples (80-200 Hz) and fast ripples (FRs, 200-500 Hz) were detected automatically. The EZs and non-EZs were identified using the surgery resection range. We innovatively converted all epochs into four types of images using two scales: original waveforms, filtered waveforms, wavelet spectrum images, and smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (SPWVD) spectrum images. Two scales were fixed and fitted scales. We then used a CNN model to classify the HFOs into EZ and non-EZ categories. As a result, 7,000 epochs of ripples and 2,000 epochs of FRs were randomly selected from the EZ and non-EZ data for analysis. Our CNN model can distinguish EZ and non-EZ HFOs successfully. Except for original ripple waveforms, the results from CNN models that are trained using fixed-scale images are significantly better than those from models trained using fitted-scale images (p < 0.05). Of the four fixed-scale transformations, the CNN based on the adjusted SPWVD (ASPWVD) produced the best accuracies (80.89 +/- 1.43% and 77.85 +/- 1.61% for ripples and FRs, respectively, p < 0.05). The CNN using ASPWVD transformation images is an effective deep learning method that can be used to classify EZ and non-EZ HFOs.

FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						high frequency oscillations; epilepsy surgery; mesial temporal lobe epilepsy; hippocampal volumetry; cognition	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; FAST RIPPLES; SURGERY; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHY; CORRELATE; PATTERNS; ATROPHY; AREAS	Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of refractory focal epilepsy and is often associated with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and cognitive disturbances. Over the last decade, high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the intraoperative electrocorticography (ioECoG) have been proposed to be biomarkers for the delineation of epileptic tissue but hippocampal ripples have also been associated with memory consolidation. Healthy hippocampi can show prolonged ripple activity in stereo- EEG. We aimed to identify how the HFO rates [ripples (80-250 Hz, fast ripples (250-500 Hz); prolonged ripples (80-250 Hz, 200-500 ms)] in the pre-resection ioECoG over subtemporal area (hippocampus) and lateral temporal neocortex relate to presence of hippocampal sclerosis, the hippocampal volume quantified on MRI and the severity of cognitive impairment in TLE patients. Volumetric measurement of hippocampal subregions was performed in 47 patients with TLE, who underwent ioECoG. Ripples, prolonged ripples, and fast ripples were visually marked and rates of HFOs were calculated. The intellectual quotient (IQ) before resection was determined. There was a trend toward higher rates of ripples and fast ripples in subtemporal electrodes vs. the lateral neocortex (ripples: 2.1 vs. 1.3/min; fast ripples: 0.9 vs. 0.2/min). Patients with HS showed higher rates of subtemporal fast ripples than other patients (Z = -2.51, p = 0.012). Prolonged ripples were only found in the lateral temporal neocortex. The normalized ratio (smallest/largest) of hippocampal volume was correlated to pre-resection IQ (r = 0.45, p = 0.015). There was no correlation between HFO rates and hippocampal volumes or HFO rates and IQ. To conclude, intra-operative fast ripples were a marker for HS, but ripples and fast ripples were not linearly correlated with either the amount of hippocampal atrophy, nor for pre-surgical IQ.

We simultaneously recorded electroencephalogram from the mPFC and local field potentials from the STN using deep brain stimulation electrodes in 13 Parkinson's disease patients while they performed a Stroop task. Both mPFC and STN showed significant increases in theta activities (2-8 Hz) in incongruent trials compared to the congruent trials. The theta activity in incongruent trials also demonstrated significantly increased phase synchronization between mPFC and STN. Furthermore, the amplitude of gamma oscillation was modulated by the phase of theta activity at the STN in incongruent trials. Such theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) was much stronger for incongruent trials with faster reaction times than those with slower reaction times. Elevated theta-gamma PAC in the STN provides a novel mechanism by which the STN may operationalize its proposed "hold-your-horses " role. The co-occurrence of mPFC-STN theta phase synchronization and STN theta-gamma PAC reflects a neural substrate for fronto-subthalamic communication during conflict processing. More broadly, it may be a general mechanism for neuronal interactions in the cortico-basal ganglia circuits via a combination of long-range, within-frequency phase synchronization and local cross-frequency PAC.

However, the mechanism through which this control is achieved remains elusive. Here, we emulated the generation of an attentional signal using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to activate the FEFs and tracked its consequences over the visual cortex. First, we documented changes to brain oscillations using electroencephalography and found evidence for a phase reset over occipital sites at beta frequency. We then probed for perceptual consequences of this top-down triggered phase reset and assessed its anatomical specificity. We show that FEF activation leads to cyclic modulation of visual perception and extrastriate but not primary visual cortex excitability, again at beta frequency. We conclude that top-down signals originating in FEF causally shape visual cortex activity and perception through mechanisms of oscillatory realignment. Visual attention requires top-down modulation from the frontal eye fields to change cortical excitability of visual cortex. Here, the authors show that these top-down signals shape perception through mechanisms of oscillatory phase realignment at the beta frequency.

It is thought that these feedforward mechanisms rely on predictions from internal models. We investigate whether the brain uses an internal model of physical laws (gravitational and inertial forces) to help estimate body equilibrium when tactile inputs from the foot sole are depressed by carrying extra weight. As direct experimental evidence for such a model is limited, we used Judoka athletes thought to have built up internal models of external loads (i.e., opponent weight management) as compared with Non-Athlete participants and Dancers (highly skilled in balance control). Using electroencephalography, we first (experiment 1) tested the hypothesis that the influence of tactile inputs was amplified by descending cortical efferent signals. We compared the amplitude of P1N1 somatosensory cortical potential evoked by electrical stimulation of the foot sole in participants standing still with their eyes closed. We showed smaller P1N1 amplitudes in the Load compared to No Load conditions in both Non-Athletes and Dancers. This decrease neural response to tactile stimulation was associated with greater postural oscillations. By contrast in the Judoka's group, the neural early response to tactile stimulation was unregulated in the Load condition. This suggests that the brain can selectively increase the functional gain of sensory inputs, during challenging equilibrium tasks when tactile inputs were mechanically depressed by wearing a weighted vest. In Judokas, the activation of regions such as the right posterior inferior parietal cortex (PPC) as early as the P1N1 is likely the source of the neural responses being maintained similar in both Load and No Load conditions. An overweight internal model stored in the right PPC known to be involved in maintaining a coherent representation of one's body in space can optimize predictive mechanisms in situations with high balance constraints (Experiment 2). This hypothesis has been confirmed by showing that postural reaction evoked by a translation of the support surface on which participants were standing wearing extra-weight was improved in Judokas.

The what and when of olfactory working memory in humans	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							THETA-OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL REPRESENTATIONS; DISTRIBUTED PATTERNS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL STIMULI; PHASE; GAMMA; HIPPOCAMPUS; EEG; SEQUENCES	Encoding and retaining novel sequences of sensory stimuli in working memory is crucial for adaptive behavior. A fundamental challenge for the central nervous system is to maintain each sequence item in an active and discriminable state, while also preserving their temporal context. Nested neural oscillations have been postulated to disambiguate the "what"and "when"of sequences, but the mechanisms by which these multiple streams of information are coordinated in the human brain remain unclear. Drawing from foundational animal studies, we recorded local field potentials from the human piriform cortex and hippocampus during a working memory task in which subjects experienced sequences of three distinct odors. Our data revealed a unique organization of odor memories across multiple timescales of the theta rhythm. During encoding, odors elicited greater gamma at distinct theta phases in both regions, time stamping their positions in the sequence, whereby the robustness of this effect was predictive of temporal order memory. During maintenance, stimulus-driven patterns of theta-coupled gamma were spontaneously reinstated in piriform cortex, recapitulating the order of the initial sequence. Replay events were time compressed across contiguous theta cycles, coinciding with periods of enhanced piriform-hippocampal theta-phase synchrony, and their prevalence forecasted subsequent recall accuracy on a trial-by-trial basis. Our data provide a novel link between endogenous replay orchestrated by the theta rhythm and short-term retention of sequential memories in the human brain.

J	Chaoul, AI; Siegel, M				Chaoul, Andrea Ibarra; Siegel, Markus			Cortical correlation structure of aperiodic neuronal population activity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Human brain; Neuronal coupling; Oscillations; Aperiodic; 1; frequency; MEG	HUMAN CONNECTOME PROJECT; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; POWER SPECTRA; OSCILLATIONS; MEG; SYNCHRONY; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; CORTEX; EEG	Electrophysiological population signals contain oscillatory and non-oscillatory aperiodic (1/frequency-like) com-ponents. So far research has largely focused on oscillatory activity, and only recently, interest in aperiodic pop-ulation activity has gained momentum. Accordingly, while the cortical correlation structure of oscillatory pop-ulation activity has been characterized, little is known about the correlation of aperiodic neuronal activity. To address this, we investigated aperiodic neuronal population activity in the human brain using resting-state mag-netoencephalography (MEG). We combined source-analysis, signal orthogonalization and irregular-resampling auto-spectral analysis (IRASA) to systematically characterize the cortical distribution and correlation of aperi-odic neuronal activity. We found that aperiodic population activity is robustly correlated across the cortex and that this correlation is spatially well structured. Furthermore, we found that the cortical correlation structure of aperiodic activity is similar but distinct from the correlation structure of oscillatory neuronal activity. Ante-rior cortical regions showed the strongest differences between oscillatory and aperiodic correlation patterns. Our results suggest that correlations of aperiodic population activity serve as robust markers of cortical network inter-actions. Furthermore, our results show that aperiodic and oscillatory signal components provide non-redundant information about large-scale neuronal correlations. This may reflect at least partly distinct neuronal mechanisms underlying and reflected by oscillatory and aperiodic neuronal population activity.

While the localizing value of SISCOM has been widely investigated, its relationship to the underlying electrophysiology has not been extensively studied and is therefore not well understood. In the present study, we set to investigate this relationship in a cohort of 70 consecutive patients who underwent ictal and interictal SPECT studies and subsequent stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) monitoring for localization of the epileptogenic focus and surgical intervention. Seizures recorded during SEEG evaluation (SEEG seizures) were matched to semiologically-similar seizures during the preoperative ictal SPECT evaluation (SPECT seizures) by comparing the semiological changes in the course of each seizure. The spectral changes of the ictal SEEG with respect to interictal ones over 7 traditional frequency bands (0.1 to 150Hz) were analyzed at each SEEG site. Neurovascular (SEEG/SPECT) relations were assessed by comparing the estimated spectral power density changes of the SEEG at each site with the perfusion changes (SISCOM z-scores) estimated from the acquired SISCOM map at that site. Across patients, a significant correlation (p < 0.05) was observed between spectral changes during the SEEG seizure and SISCOM perfusion z scores. Brain sites with high perfusion z-score exhibited higher increased SEEG power in theta to ripple frequency bands with concurrent suppression in delta and theta frequency bands compared to regions with lower perfusion z-score. The dynamics of the correlation of SISCOM perfusion and SEEG spectral power from ictal onset to seizure end and immediate postictal period were also derived. Forty-six (46) of the 70 patients underwent resective epilepsy surgery. SISCOM z-score and power increase in beta to ripple frequency bands were significantly higher in resected than non-resected sites in the patients who were seizure-free following surgery. This study provides for the first time concrete evidence that both hyper-perfusion and hypo-perfusion patterns observed in SISCOM maps have strong electrophysiological underpinnings, and that integration of the information from SISCOM and SEEG can shed light on the location and dynamics of the underlying epileptic brain networks, and thus advance our anatomo-electro-clinical understanding and approaches to targeted diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

In the current MEG study, we investigated how ongoing oscillatory activity of both sensory and non-sensory brain regions are differentially impacted by attentional focus. Low-frequency phase alignment of neural activity in primary sensory areas, with respect to attended/ignored features has been suggested to support top-down prioritization. However, phase adjustment in frontoparietal regions has not been widely studied, despite general implication of these in top down selection of information. To investigate this, we let participants perform an established intermodal selective attention task, where low-frequency auditory (1.6 Hz) and visual (1.8 Hz) stimuli were presented simultaneously. We instructed them to either attend to the auditory or to the visual stimuli and to detect targets while ignoring the other stimulus stream. As expected, the strongest phase adjustment was observed in primary sensory regions for auditory and for visual stimulation, independent of attentional focus. We found greater differences in phase locking between attended and ignored stimulation for the visual modality. Interestingly, auditory temporal regions show small but significant attention-dependent neural entrainment even for visual stimulation. Extending findings from invasive recordings in non-human primates, we demonstrate an effect of attentional focus on the phase of the entrained oscillations in auditory and visual cortex which may be driven by phase locked increases of induced power. While sensory areas adjusted the phase of the respective stimulation frequencies, attentional focus adjusted the peak frequencies in nonsensory areas. Spatially these areas show a striking overlap with core regions of the dorsal attention network and the frontoparietal network. This suggests that these areas prioritize the attended modality by optimally exploiting the temporal structure of stimulation. Overall, our study complements and extends previous work by showing a differential effect of attentional focus on entrained oscillations (or phase adjustment) in primary sensory areas and frontoparietal areas.

J	Aung, ST; Wongsawat, Y				Aung, Si Thu; Wongsawat, Yodchanan			Prediction of epileptic seizures based on multivariate multiscale modified-distribution entropy	PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Distribution entropy; ANN; EEG; Entropy; Epilepsy		Epilepsy is a common neurological disease that affects a wide range of the world population and is not limited by age. Moreover, seizures can occur anytime and anywhere because of the sudden abnormal discharge of brain neurons, leading to malfunction. The seizures of approximately 30% of epilepsy patients cannot be treated with medicines or surgery; hence these patients would benefit from a seizure prediction system to live normal lives. Thus, a system that can predict a seizure before its onset could improve not only these patients' social lives but also their safety. Numerous seizure prediction methods have already been proposed, but the performance measures of these methods are still inadequate for a complete prediction system. Here, a seizure prediction system is proposed by exploring the advantages of multivariate entropy, which can reflect the complexity of multivariate time series over multiple scales (frequencies), called multivariate multiscale modified-distribution entropy (MM-mDistEn), with an artificial neural network (ANN). The phase-space reconstruction and estimation of the probability density between vectors provide hidden complex information. The multivariate time series property of MM-mDistEn provides more understandable information within the multichannel data and makes it possible to predict of epilepsy. Moreover, the proposed method was tested with two different analyses: simulation data analysis proves that the proposed method has strong consistency over the different parameter selections, and the results from experimental data analysis showed that the proposed entropy combined with an ANN obtains performance measures of 98.66% accuracy, 91.82% sensitivity, 99.11% specificity, and 0.84 area under the curve (AUC) value. In addition, the seizure alarm system was applied as a postprocessing step for prediction purposes, and a false alarm rate of 0.014 per hour and an average prediction time of 26.73 min before seizure onset were achieved by the proposed method. Thus, the proposed entropy as a feature extraction method combined with an ANN can predict the ictal state of epilepsy, and the results show great potential for all epilepsy patients.

The missing N1 or jittered P2: Electrophysiological correlates of pattern glare in the time and frequency domain	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cortical excitability; EEG; headache; pattern glare; visual stress	VISUAL-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BILATERAL STIMULUS ARRAYS; INDEX FOCUSED ATTENTION; CORTICAL HYPEREXCITABILITY; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; MIGRAINE PATIENTS; STIMULATION; HABITUATION; FMRI	Excessive sensitivity to certain visual stimuli (cortical hyperexcitability) is associated with a number of neurological disorders including migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, autism and possibly dyslexia. Others show disruptive sensitivity to visual stimuli with no other obvious pathology or symptom profile (visual stress) which can extend to discomfort and nausea. We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the neural correlates of visual stress and headache proneness. We analysed ERPs in response to thick (0.37 cycles per degree [c/deg]), medium (3 c/deg) and thin (12 c/deg) gratings, using mass univariate analysis, considering three factors in the general population: headache proneness, visual stress and discomfort. We found relationships between ERP features and the headache and discomfort factors. Stimulus main effects were driven by the medium stimulus regardless of participant characteristics. Participants with high discomfort ratings had larger P1 components for the initial presentation of medium stimuli, suggesting initial cortical hyperexcitability that is later suppressed. The participants with high headache ratings showed atypical N1-P2 components for medium stripes relative to the other stimuli. This effect was present only after repeated stimulus presentation. These effects were also explored in the frequency domain, suggesting variations in intertrial theta band phase coherence. Our results suggest that discomfort and headache in response to striped stimuli are related to different neural processes; however, more exploration is needed to determine whether the results translate to a clinical migraine population.

J	Wang, WJ; Wang, WX				Wang, Wenjing; Wang, Wenxu			Effect of reward on electrophysiological signatures of grid cell population activity in human spatial navigation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							COGNITIVE MAP; INTEGRATION	The regular equilateral triangular periodic firing pattern of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex is considered a regular metric for the spatial world, and the grid-like representation correlates with hexadirectional modulation of theta (4-8 Hz) power in the entorhinal cortex relative to the moving direction. However, researchers have not clearly determined whether grid cells provide only simple spatial measures in human behavior-related navigation strategies or include other factors such as goal rewards to encode information in multiple patterns. By analysing the hexadirectional modulation of EEG signals in the theta band in the entorhinal cortex of patients with epilepsy performing spatial target navigation tasks, we found that this modulation presents a grid pattern that carries target-related reward information. This grid-like representation is influenced by explicit goals and is related to the local characteristics of the environment. This study provides evidence that human grid cell population activity is influenced by reward information at the level of neural oscillations.

Such naturalistic paradigms are in sharp contrast to the tradition of experimental reductionism in neuroscience research. Being complex, dynamic, and diverse, naturalistic stimuli set up a more ecologically relevant condition and induce highly reproducible brain responses across a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. Here, we review recent technical advances and scientific findings on imaging the brain under naturalistic stimuli. Then, we elaborate on the premise of using naturalistic paradigms for multiscale, multimodal, and high-throughput functional characterization of the human brain. We further highlight the growing potential of using deep learning models to infer neural information processing from brain responses to naturalistic stimuli. Finally, we advocate large-scale collaborations to combine brain imaging and recording data across experiments, subjects, and labs that use the same set of naturalistic stimuli.

There is ample evidence that both state and trait boredom are associated with failures of attention in both experimental and everyday settings. The neural correlates of boredom, however, remain underexplored. We recorded electroencephalographic signal from 83 participants during a resting state and while performing a go/no-go task. We found a negative correlation between trait boredom proneness and power in the alpha and theta bands during the resting state. Furthermore, higher levels of task-induced boredom were associated with reduced amplitudes for the P3 and error-related negativity event-related potentials. Increased commission error rates were also associated with higher levels of task-induced boredom. We conclude that state and trait boredom are associated with inadequate engagement of attentional resources.

Changes in Intermuscular Coherence as a Function of Age and Phase of Speech Production During an Overt Reading Task	MOTOR CONTROL			English	Article						aging; motor planning; neuromuscular control; speech	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EEG-EMG; MECHANISMS; DIAPHRAGM; LANGUAGE	Purpose: The authors evaluated changes in intermuscular coherence (IMC) of orofacial and speech breathing muscles across phase of speech production in healthy younger and older adults. Method: Sixty adults (30 younger = M: 26.97 year; 30 older = M: 66.37 year) read aloud a list of 40 words. IMC was evaluated across phase: preparation (300 ms before speech onset), initiation (300 ms after onset), and total execution (entire word). Results: Orofacial IMC was lowest in the initiation, higher in preparation, and highest for the total execution phase. Chest wall IMC was lowest for the preparation and initiation and highest for the total execution phase. Despite age-related differences in accuracy, neuromuscular modulation for phase was similar between groups. Conclusion: These results expand our knowledge of speech motor control by demonstrating that IMC is sensitive to phase of speech planning and production.

J	Shiraishi, M; Shimada, S				Shiraishi, Masahiro; Shimada, Sotaro			Inter-brain synchronization during a cooperative task reflects the sense of joint agency	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Hyperscanning; Inter-brain synchronization; The sense of joint agency; We-mode; EEG		People feel the sense of ?joint agency?, which is the sense that ?we? did it, during a mutually cooperative action. Previous studies have reported that the inter-brain synchronization occurs during a mutually cooperative action, nevertheless the neural correlates of the sense of joint agency remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether the sense of joint agency reflects the inter-brain synchronization during a joint action. The pairs of participants engaged in constant rhythm tapping tasks with alternative (turn-taking) or sequential (non-turn-taking) coor-dination. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) of the participant pair during the tasks were simultaneously measured (hyperscanned), and the participants were subsequently asked to rate the sense of joint agency. The results showed that the participants felt strong sense of joint agency in the turn-taking cooperative actions, but not in the non-turn-taking actions. Moreover, EEG theta (4?7 Hz) oscillations were more synchronized between the frontal region in the leader, who tapped the first, and the right temporo-parietal region in the follower, who tapped following the leader, during the turn-taking cooperative actions than during the non-turn-taking cooperative actions. Furthermore, the degree of inter-brain synchronization was significantly correlated with the sense of joint agency, as well as the temporal accuracy of the tapping actions of the pair. These results indicate that the sense of joint agency strongly reflects the inter-brain synchronization, which depends on the quality of mutual cooperation during a joint action.

The state of ongoing oscillatory activity can influence subsequent processing throughout this network. In particular the ongoing theta-band power can be relevant for later pain processing, however a direct functional relation to post-stimulus processing or behaviour is missing. Here, we used a non-invasive brain-computer interface to either increase or decrease ongoing theta-band power originating in the insular cortex. Our results show a differential modulation of oscillatory power and even more important a transfer to independently measured pain processing and sensation. Pain evoked neural power and subjective pain discrimination were differentially affected by the induced modulations of the oscillatory state. The results demonstrate a functional relevance of insular based theta-band oscillatory states for the processing and subjective discrimination of nociceptive stimuli and offer the perspective for clinical applications.

The present study adopted a personality and cognitive neuroscience approach to investigate if participation in ballroom dancing is associated with sensation-seeking temperament and elevated cerebral cortical arousal during freely chosen musical recall. Methods: Preferred tempo, indicated by tapping speed during melodic recall, and a measure of fundamental disposition or temperament were assessed in 70 ballroom dancers and 71 nondancers. All participants completed a trait personality inventory (i.e., the Chen Huichang 60 Temperaments Inventory) to determine four primary types: choleric, sanguine, phlegmatic and melancholic. Participants separately recalled their favorite musical piece and tapped to it with their index finger for 40 beats using a computer keyboard. A subset of 59 participants (29 ballroom dancers and 30 nondancers) also repeated the same tapping task while electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded. Results: The results revealed that the dancers were more extraverted, indicative of a heightened need for arousal, exhibited a preference for faster musical tempo, and exhibited elevated EEG beta power during the musical recall task relative to nondancers. Paradoxically, dancers also showed elevated introversion (i.e., melancholic score) relative to nondancers, which can be resolved by consideration of interactional personality theory if one assumes reasonably that dance performance environment is perceived in a stimulating manner. Conclusion: The results are generally consistent with arousal theory, and suggest that ballroom dancers seek elevated stimulation and, thereby, choose to engage with active and energetic rhythmic auditory stimulation, thus providing the nervous system with the requisite stimulation for desired arousal. These results also suggest an underlying predisposition for engagement in ballroom dance and support the gravitational hypothesis, which propose that personality traits and perception lead to the motivation to engage in specific forms of human performance.

Parametric Cortical Representations of Complexity and Preference for Artistic and Computer-Generated Fractal Patterns Revealed by Single-Trial EEG Power Spectral Analysis	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Fractal; Power spectra; Perception; Preference; Aesthetic	THETA; OSCILLATIONS; RECOGNITION; DIMENSION; MEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; COMPONENTS; RELEVANCE; NETWORK	Fractals are self-similar patterns that repeat at different scales, the complexity of which are expressed as a fractional Euclidean dimension D between 0 (a point) and 2 (a filled plane). The drip paintings of American painter Jackson Pollock (JP) are fractal in nature, and Pollock's most illustrious works are of the high-D (similar to 1.7) category. This would imply that people prefer more complex fractal patterns, but some research has instead suggested people prefer lower-D fractals. Furthermore, research has suggested that parietal and frontal brain activity tracks the complexity of fractal patterns, but previous research has artificially binned fractals depending on fractal dimension, rather than treating fractal dimension as a parametrically varying value. We used white layers extracted from JP artwork as stimuli, and constructed statistically matched 2-dimensional random Cantor sets as control stimuli. We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) while participants viewed the JP and matched random Cantor fractal patterns. Participants then rated their subjective preference for each pattern. We used a single-trial analysis to construct within-subject models relating subjective preference to fractal dimension D, as well as relating D and subjective preference to single-trial EEG power spectra. Results indicated that participants preferred higher-D images for both JP and Cantor stimuli. Power spectral analysis showed that, for artistic fractal images, parietal alpha and beta power parametrically tracked complexity of fractal patterns, while for matched mathematical fractals, parietal power tracked complexity of patterns over a range of frequencies, but most prominently in alpha band. Furthermore, parietal alpha power parametrically tracked aesthetic preference for both artistic and matched Cantor patterns. Overall, our results suggest that perception of complexity for artistic and computer-generated fractal images is reflected in parietal-occipital alpha and beta activity, and neural substrates of preference for complex stimuli are reflected in parietal alpha band activity.

Their alterations after stroke, such as reduced movement-related beta desynchronization in the primary motor cortex, have been repeatedly related to the level of impairment. However, there is only little data whether such measures of brain function might directly relate to structural brain changes after stroke. Methods: This multimodal study investigated 18 well-recovered patients with stroke (mean age 65 years, 12 males) by means of task-related EEG and diffusion-weighted structural MRI 3 months after stroke. Beta power at rest and movement-related beta desynchronization was assessed in 3 key motor areas of the ipsilesional hemisphere that are the primary motor cortex (M1), the ventral premotor area and the supplementary motor area. Template trajectories of corticospinal tracts (CST) originating from M1, premotor cortex, and supplementary motor area were used to quantify the microstructural state of CST subcomponents. Linear mixed-effects analyses were used to relate tract-related mean fractional anisotropy to EEG measures. Results: In the present cohort, we detected statistically significant reductions in ipsilesional CST fractional anisotropy but no alterations in EEG measures when compared with healthy controls. However, in patients with stroke, there was a significant association between both beta power at rest (P=0.002) and movement-related beta desynchronization (P=0.003) in M1 and fractional anisotropy of the CST specifically originating from M1. Similar structure-function relationships were neither evident for ventral premotor area and supplementary motor area, particularly with respect to their CST subcomponents originating from premotor cortex and supplementary motor area, in patients with stroke nor in controls. Conclusions: These data suggest there might be a link connecting microstructure of the CST originating from M1 pyramidal neurons and beta oscillatory activity, measures which have already been related to motor impairment in patients with stroke by previous reports.

The instructor in the video may involuntarily produce beat gestures with their hands, as occurs in real teaching settings. Beat gestures highlight key information in speech by conveying the rhythm of the language, but do not themselves convey semantic meaning. However, little is known about how the instructor's beat gestures affect L2 vocabulary learning. We conducted two experiments on the effects of the instructor's purposeful (scripted) beat gestures in instructional videos that included an instructor and slides, with English L2 vocabulary as the topic. In Experiment 1, using a within-participant design, we tested the hypothesis that an instructor's gestures (beat gesture vs. no gesture) would improve learning performance. The results showed that the instructor's use of beat gestures increased learners' accuracy and reduced reaction time on an L2 learning performance test. In Experiment 2, using a between-participants design, we tested the assumption that the benefits of beat gestures in L2 vocabulary learning are in part due to reductions in cognitive load while learning. This assumption was supported by both a self-report measurement of cognitive load and electroencephalogram (EEG) data showing lower theta power and lower alpha power when the instructor used beat gestures. The results of this study have applied value for designing effective instructional videos on the topic of L2 vocabulary learning.

In contrast, the motor-cognitive model implies that MI additionally involves frontal executive control processes. However, according to some authors MI may actually be more comparable to motor preparation (MP). In the current electroencephalographic study, a version of the discrete sequence production paradigm was employed in which human participants initially had to prepare a sequence of five finger movements that subsequently had to be executed, imagined, or withheld. MI, ME, and MP were compared by computing event-related (de)-synchronization in the theta, alpha/mu, and beta bands. Results revealed a major increase in frontal theta power during MI as compared to ME and MP. At the end of the examined intervals, a posterior reduction in alpha power was present during ME and MP, but not during MI. Finally, above sensorimotor areas a decrease in beta power was observed that was most pronounced in the case of ME. The increase of frontal theta activity during MI may reflect increased effort, while the absence of a reduction in posterior alpha power suggests no major involvement of visuospatial attention and/or visual imagery. The present findings favor the motor-cognitive model, as it predicts extra involvement of frontal executive processes during MI.	[Van der Lubbe, Rob H.

Chronic intermittent ethanol during adolescence and adulthood alters dendritic spines in the primary motor and visual cortex in rats	ALCOHOL			English	Article						Adolescence; Alcohol; Dendrites; Motor cortex; Sleep; Spines; Visual cortex	EVENT-RELATED OSCILLATIONS; ALCOHOL EXPOSURE; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; SLEEP QUALITY; EEG POWER; THETA EEG; PLASTICITY; NEURONS; BRAIN; DENSITY	Prolonged adolescent binge drinking can disrupt sleep quality and increase the likelihood of alcohol induced sleep disruptions in young adulthood in rodents and in humans. Striking changes in spine density and morphology have been seen in many cortical and subcortical regions after adolescent alcohol exposure in rats. However, there is little known about the impact of alcohol exposure on dendritic spines in the same motor and sensory cortices that EEG sleep is typically recorded from in rats. The aim of this study is to investigate whether an established model of chronic intermittent ethanol vapor in rats that has been demonstrated to disrupt sleep during adolescence or adulthood, also significantly alters cortical dendritic spine density and morphology. To this end, adolescent and adult Wistar rats were exposed to 5 weeks of ethanol vapor or control air exposure. After a 13-day withdrawal, primary motor cortex (M1) and primary/secondary visual cortex (V1/V2) layer V dendrites were analyzed for differences in spine density and morphology. Spines were classified into four categories (stubby, long, filopodia, and mushroom) based on the spine length and the width of the spine head and neck. The main results indicate an age-specific effect of adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure decreasing spine density in the M1 cortex compared to age-matched controls. Reductions in the density of M1 long-shaped spine subclassifications were seen in adolescent ethanol-exposed rats, but not adult-exposed rats, compared to their air-controls. Irrespective of age, there was an overall reduction produced by ethanol exposure on the density of filopodia and the length of long-shaped spines in V1/V2 cortex as compared to their air exposed controls. Together, these data add to growing evidence that some cortical circuits are vulnerable to the effects of alcohol during adolescence and begin to elucidate potential mechanisms that may influence brain plasticity following early alcohol use.

Previous behavioral studies have demonstrated that female's risk decisions vary along with their menstrual cycle phases. However, little is known how females' neural processes of risk stimuli change in different menstrual cycle phases. To address this, the present study adopted a sequential economic risk-taking task and EEG technique. Thirty eligible female participants completed the task twice with EEG recordings, once in the late follicular phase and once in the midluteal phase, separately. We found that the risk stimuli induced an evident frontal N1 in the early time window of 90-180 ms. The results on N1 showed no significant difference between two phases for low- and medium-risk stimuli; whereas, for highrisk stimuli, females in midluteal phase exhibited a significantly larger N1 than that in late follicular phase. Further, by exploiting time-frequency transformation, we observed a pronounced low alpha (similar to 8 Hz) activity in frontal area from stimuli onset to 175 ms. The results indicated that, only for high-risk stimuli, the alpha power was significantly greater in midluteal phase than that in late follicular phase. Our neural results demonstrated a stronger early neural response to high-risk stimuli of females in midluteal phase, which suggests women are more sensitive to high risk in midluteal than in late follicular phase.

To this end, we define different correlation-based measures of the multivariate interaction (MI) within and between the brain and body subnetworks of the human physiological network, represented, respectively, by the time series of delta, theta, alpha, and beta electroencephalographic (EEG) wave amplitudes, and of heart rate, respiration amplitude, and pulse arrival time (PAT) variability (eta, rho, pi). MI is computed: (i) considering all variables in the two subnetworks to evaluate overall brain-body interactions; (ii) focusing on a single target variable and dissecting its global interaction with all other variables into contributions arising from the same subnetwork and from the other subnetwork; and (iii) considering two variables conditioned to all the others to infer the network topology. The framework is applied to the time series measured from the EEG, electrocardiographic (ECG), respiration, and blood volume pulse (BVP) signals recorded synchronously via wearable sensors in a group of healthy subjects monitored at rest and during mental arithmetic and sustained attention tasks. We find that the human physiological network is highly connected, with predominance of the links internal of each subnetwork (mainly eta-rho and delta-theta, theta-alpha, alpha-beta), but also statistically significant interactions between the two subnetworks (mainly eta-beta and eta-delta). MI values are often spatially heterogeneous across the scalp and are modulated by the physiological state, as indicated by the decrease of cardiorespiratory interactions during sustained attention and by the increase of brain-heart interactions and of brain-brain interactions at the frontal scalp regions during mental arithmetic. These findings illustrate the complex and multi-faceted structure of interactions manifested within and between different physiological systems and subsystems across different levels of mental stress.

However, recent accounts suggest that the P1 is associated with inhibiting the irrelevant visual field evidenced by a pronounced ipsilateral P1 during sustained attention to peripherally presented stimuli. The current EEG study further investigated this issue to reveal how lateralized ERP findings are modulated by face and emotional information. Therefore, participants were asked to fixate the center of the screen and pay sustained attention either to the right or left visual field, where angry or neutral faces or their Fourier phase-scrambled versions were presented. We found a bilateral P1 to all stimuli with relatively increased, but delayed, ipsilateral P1 amplitudes to faces but not to scrambles. Explorative independent component analyses dissociated an earlier lateralized larger contralateral P1 from a later bilateral P1. By contrast, the N170 showed a contralateral enhancement to all stimuli, which was most pronounced for neutral faces attended in the left hemifield. Finally, increased contralateral alpha power was found for both attended hemifields but was not significantly related to poststimulus ERPs. These results provide evidence against a general inhibitory role of the P1 but suggest stimulus-specific relative enhancements of the ipsilateral P1 for the irrelevant visual hemifield. The lateralized N170, however, is associated with stimulus amplification as a function of facial features.

J	Cui, C; Wang, KY; Long, YT; Jiang, YJ				Cui, Can; Wang, Kaiyu; Long, Yiting; Jiang, Yingjie			Differential modulation of creative problem solving by monetary rewards: Electrophysiological evidence	CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						Creative problemsolving; Monetary reward; Subliminal; EEG; P200-600	BAND OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL ACTIVITY; SUDDEN INSIGHT; TASK; EEG; RESPONSES; FLEXIBILITY; MOTIVATION; ASSOCIATE; COMPONENT	Previous studies have suggested that facilitating creative problem solving via supraliminal monetary rewards is unsuccessful and controversial. In contrast, subliminal monetary rewards have been found to facilitate creative problem solving. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of subliminal and supraliminal monetary rewards on creative problem solving remain unclear. The present study investigated the impact of monetary rewards on Chinese verbal compound remote-associated (CRA) problem solving using electrophysiological techniques and behavioral measures. The results showed that people solved more CRA problems when motivated by subliminal monetary rewards than supraliminal monetary rewards and solved CRA problems more often via insight solutions under low-reward conditions. The electrophysiological results showed that subliminal monetary rewards induced a more positive P200-600 amplitude than supraliminal monetary rewards. Supraliminal rewards induced a larger beta-band event-related desynchronization (beta-ERD) during the early problem-solving phase and alpha-band event-related synchronization (alpha-ERS) during the late problem-solving phase than subliminal rewards. Moreover, the brain-behavior correlations revealed a relationship between the P200-600 amplitude and behavior performance, indicating differential effects between subliminal rewards and supraliminal rewards on creative problem solving. These results extend prior research and indicate that compared with supraliminal rewards, subliminal rewards could facilitate creative problem solving and insight solutions by lowering attentional selectivity. In general, the present study provided the first strong evidence of the differential modulation of creative problem solving by subliminal and supraliminal monetary rewards from behavioral, neurophysiological and brain-behavior correlation dimensions.

J	Shokri, A; Nosratabadi, M				Shokri, Abbas; Nosratabadi, Masoud			Comparison of Biofeedback and Combined Interventions on Athlete's Performance	APPLIED PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY AND BIOFEEDBACK			English	Article						Neurofeedback; Biofeedback; Sport; Athletic performance	EEG ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SENSORIMOTOR RHYTHM; NEUROFEEDBACK; ATTENTION; MODEL; COMPONENTS; ASYMMETRY; POWER	The aim of this study was the comparison of neurofeedback and biofeedback as a combination, against biofeedback intervention alone on athletic performance. 45 novice basketball players were allocated into three groups and assigned accordingly, two experimental and one control group. The experimental group 1 received 24 biofeedback sessions only, experimental group 2 received 24 biofeedback and neurofeedback sessions combined, whereas the control group didn't receive any form of intervention. Athletic performance scales were used before and after each intervention and multivariate analysis of covariance was used to compare the two groups. Results showed that in comparison to the control group, the athletic performance scales scores in both experimental groups were significantly increased. Furthermore, in experimental group 2 (combined method), we noticed a significantly greater improvement in performance levels than experimental group 1. We concluded that neurofeedback and biofeedback interventions combined, can be used as an effective method to enhance athletic performance.

Effects of intranasal guanosine administration on brain function in a rat model of ischemic stroke	PURINERGIC SIGNALLING			English	Article						Stroke; Guanosine Intranasal administration; Neuroprotection; Quantitative electroencephalogram; Blood-brain barrier; Cell signaling	TISSUE-PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR; PERIODIC EEG PATTERNS; BLOOD-BRAIN; QUANTITATIVE EEG; BARRIER DYSFUNCTION; TIME WINDOW; THROMBECTOMY; INJURY; PARAMETERS; PATHWAY	Ischemic stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and only few affected patients are able to receive treatment, especially in developing countries. Detailed pathophysiology of brain ischemia has been extensively studied in order to discover new treatments with a broad therapeutic window and that are accessible to patients worldwide. The nucleoside guanosine (Guo) has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in animal models of brain diseases, including ischemic stroke. In a rat model of focal permanent ischemia, systemic administration of Guo was effective only when administered immediately after stroke induction. In contrast, intranasal administration of Guo (In-Guo) was effective even when the first administration was 3 h after stroke induction. In order to validate the neuroprotective effect in this larger time window and to investigate In-Guo neuroprotection under global brain dysfunction induced by ischemia, we used the model of thermocoagulation of pial vessels in Wistar rats. In our study, we have found that In-Guo administered 3 h after stroke was capable of preventing ischemia-induced dysfunction, such as bilateral suppression and synchronicity of brain oscillations and ipsilateral cell death signaling, and increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier. In addition, In-Guo had a long-lasting effect on preventing ischemia-induced motor impairment. Our data reinforce In-Guo administration as a potential new treatment for brain ischemia with a more suitable therapeutic window.

Since conversation requires constant monitoring, updating and selecting information, auditory working memory decline, rather than impoverished hearing acuity, has been suggested a core factor. However, in stark contrast to the visual domain, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying auditory working memory deficits in healthy aging remain poorly understood, especially those related to on-the-fly information processing under increasing load. Therefore, we investigated the behavioral costs and electrophysiological differences associated with healthy aging and working memory load during continuous auditory processing. We recorded EEG activity from 27 younger (-25 years) and 29 older (-70 years) participants during their performance on an auditory version of the n-back task with speech syllables and 2 workload levels ( 1-back; 2-back ). Behavioral measures were analyzed as indices of function; event-related potentials as proxies for sensory and cognitive processes; and theta oscillatory power as a reflection of memory and central executive function. Our results show age-related differences in auditory information processing within a latency range that is consistent with a series of impaired functions, from sensory gating to cognitive resource allocation during constant information updating, especially under high load.

To capture the millisecond-resolved neural activations associated with fine visual-motor skills, we devised a co-registration system to simultaneously record electroencephalogram and handwriting kinematics while participants were performing four handwriting tasks (writing in Chinese/English scripts with their dominant/non-dominant hand). The neural activation associated with each stroke was clearly identified with a well-structured and reliable pattern. The functional significance of this pattern was validated by its significant associations with language, hand and the cognitive stages and kinematics of handwriting. Furthermore, the handwriting rhythmicity was found to be synchronised to the brain's ongoing theta oscillation, and the synchronisation was associated with the factor of language and hand. These major findings imply an implication between motor skill formation and the interplay between the rhythms in the brain and the peripheral systems.

Characterizing neural phase-space trajectories via Principal Louvain Clustering	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Louvain clustering; Neural oscillations; Cortex; Neural synchronization; Principal components analysis	DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION	Background: With the growing size and richness of neuroscience datasets in terms of dimension, volume, and resolution, identifying spatiotemporal patterns in those datasets is increasingly important. Multivariate dimension-reduction methods are particularly adept at addressing these challenges. New method: In this paper, we propose a novel method, which we refer to as Principal Louvain Clustering (PLC), to identify clusters in a low-dimensional data subspace, based on time-varying trajectories of spectral dynamics across multisite local field potential (LFP) recordings in awake behaving mice. Data were recorded from prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and parietal cortex in eleven mice while they explored novel and familiar environments. Results: PLC-identified subspaces and clusters showed high consistency across animals, and were modulated by the animals' ongoing behavior. Conclusions: PLC adds to an important growing literature on methods for characterizing dynamics in highdimensional datasets, using a smaller number of parameters. The method is also applicable to other kinds of datasets, such as EEG or MEG.

Suggested visual blockade during hypnosis: Top-down modulation of stimulus processing in a visual oddball task	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVOKED POTENTIALS; INTRACEREBRAL POTENTIALS; RARE TARGET; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; HYPNOTIC ANALGESIA; NEURAL MECHANISMS; BRAIN; P300; EEG; ATTENTION	Several theories of hypnosis assume that responses to hypnotic suggestions are implemented through top-down modulations via a frontoparietal network that is involved in monitoring and cognitive control. The current study addressed this issue re-analyzing previously published event-related-potentials (ERP) (N1, P2, and P3b amplitudes) and combined it with source reconstruction and connectivity analysis methods. ERP data were obtained from participants engaged in a visual oddball paradigm composed of target, standard, and distractor stimuli during a hypnosis (HYP) and a control (CON) condition. In both conditions, participants were asked to count the rare targets presented on a video screen. During HYP participants received suggestions that a wooden board in front of their eyes would obstruct their view of the screen. The results showed that participants' counting accuracy was significantly impaired during HYP compared to CON. ERP components in the N1 and P2 window revealed no amplitude differences between CON and HYP at sensor-level. In contrast, P3b amplitudes in response to target stimuli were significantly reduced during HYP compared to CON. Source analysis of the P3b amplitudes in response to targets indicated that HYP was associated with reduced source activities in occipital and parietal brain areas related to stimulus categorization and attention. We further explored how these brain sources interacted by computing time-frequency effective connectivity between electrodes that best represented frontal, parietal, and occipital sources. This analysis revealed reduced directed information flow from parietal attentional to frontal executive sources during processing of target stimuli. These results provide preliminary evidence that hypnotic suggestions of a visual blockade are associated with a disruption of the coupling within the frontoparietal network implicated in top-down control.

Their neuronal underpinnings remain unclear. Using connectome-based modeling, we link the fast temporal microscopic neuronal scale to the slow emergent whole-brain dynamics. We show that cascades of neuronal activations spontaneously propagate in resting state-like conditions. The largest neuronal cascades result in the co-fluctuation of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals at pairs of brain regions, which in turn translate to stable brain states. Thus, we provide a theoretical framework for the emergence and the dynamics of resting-state networks (RSNs). We verify these predictions in empirical mouse functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and human EEG/fMRI datasets measured in resting states conditions. Our work sheds light on the multiscale mechanisms of brain function. At rest, mammalian brains display remarkable spatiotemporal complexity, evolving through recurrent functional connectivity (FC) states on a slow timescale of the order of tens of seconds. While the phenomenology of the resting state dynamics is valuable in distinguishing healthy and pathologic brains, little is known about its underlying mechanisms. Here, we identify neuronal cascades as a potential mechanism. Using full-brain network modeling, we show that neuronal populations, coupled via a detailed structural connectome, give rise to large-scale cascades of firing rate fluctuations evolving at the same time scale of resting-state networks (RSNs). The ignition and subsequent propagation of cascades depend on the brain state and connectivity of each region. The largest cascades produce bursts of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) co-fluctuations at pairs of regions across the brain, which shape the simulated RSN dynamics. We experimentally confirm these theoretical predictions. We demonstrate the existence and stability of intermittent epochs of FC comprising BOLD co-activation (CA) bursts in mice and human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We then provide evidence for the existence and leading role of the neuronal cascades in humans with simultaneous EEG/fMRI recordings. These results show that neuronal cascades are a major determinant of spontaneous fluctuations in brain dynamics at rest.

MethodsPatients were subjected to clinical evaluation, routine EEG, and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Whole exome sequencing, repeat-primed PCR, long-range PCR, and PacBio sequencing were performed to characterize the disease-causing mutation in this family. ResultsAll evaluated patients manifested adult-onset seizures and presented with progressive myoclonic postural tremors starting after the third or fourth decade of life. Seizures typically diminished markedly in frequency with implementation of antiseizure medications but did not completely cease. The electroencephalogram of affected individuals showed generalized or multifocal spikes and slow wave complexes. An expansion of TTTTA motifs with addition of TTTCA motifs in intron 4 of SAMD12 was identified to segregate with the disease phenotype in this family. Furthermore, we found that the mutant allele is unstable and can undergo both contraction and expansion by changes in the number of repeat motifs each time it is passed to the next generation. The size of mutant allele varied from 5 to 5.5 kb with 549-603 copies of TTTTA and 287-343 copies of TTTCA repeat motifs in this family. SignificanceOur study provides a detailed description of clinical progression of FCMTE symptoms and its management with antiseizure medications. Our method of repeat analysis by PacBio sequencing of long-range PCR products does not require high-quality DNA and hence can be easily applied to other families to elucidate any correlation between the repeat size and phenotypic variables, such as, age of onset, and severity of symptoms.

Conventional ictal electrocorticography (ECoG) onset is generally used to detect the EZ but is insufficient in achieving seizure-free outcomes. By contrast, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) could be useful markers of the EZ. Hence, we aimed to detect the EZ using interictal spikes and investigated whether the onset area of interictal spike-related HFOs was within the EZ.Methods: The EZ is considered to be included in the resection area among patients with seizure-free outcomes after surgery. Using a complex demodulation technique, we developed a method to determine the onset channels of interictal spike-related ripples (HFOs of 80-200 Hz) and investigated whether they are within the resection area.Results: We retrospectively examined 12 serial patients who achieved seizure-free status after focal resection surgery. Using the method that we developed, we determined the onset channels of interictal spike-related ripples and found that for all 12 patients, they were among the resection channels. The onset frequencies of ripples were in the range of 80-150 Hz. However, the ictal onset channels (evaluated based on ictal ECoG patterns) and ripple onset channels coincided in only 3 of 12 patients.Conclusions: Determining the onset area of interictal spike-related ripples could facilitate EZ estimation. This simple method that utilizes interictal ECoG may aid in preoperative evaluation and improve epilepsy surgery outcomes.

Using magnetoencephalography, we have now compared the neural signatures of attention refocusing between three age groups (19-30, 40-49 and 60+ years) and found differences in task-related modulation and cortical localisation of alpha and theta oscillations. Efficient, faster refocusing in the youngest group compared to both middle age and older groups was reflected in parietal theta effects that were significantly reduced in the older groups. Residual parietal theta activity in older individuals was beneficial to attentional refocusing and could reflect preserved attention mechanisms. Slowed refocusing of attention, especially when a target required consolidation, in the older and middle-aged adults was accompanied by a posterior theta deficit and increased recruitment of frontal (middle-aged and older groups) and temporal (older group only) areas, demonstrating a posterior to anterior processing shift. Theta but not alpha modulation correlated with task performance, suggesting that older adults' stronger and more widely distributed alpha power modulation could reflect decreased neural precision or dedifferentiation but requires further investigation. Our results demonstrate that older adults present with different alpha and theta oscillatory signatures during attentional control, reflecting cognitive decline and, potentially, also different cognitive strategies in an attempt to compensate for decline.

Methods: We studied 30 patients who underwent epilepsy surgery following extraoperative electrocorticography and electrooculography recordings. We determined whether high-gamma activity at 70- 110 Hz preceding saccade onset would predict upcoming ocular behaviors. We assessed how accurately the model incorporating saccade-related high-gamma modulations would localize the primary visual cortex defined by electrical stimulation. Results: The dynamic atlas demonstrated transient high-gamma suppression in the striatal cortex before saccade onset and high-gamma augmentation subsequently involving the widespread posterior brain regions. More intense striatal high-gamma suppression predicted the upcoming saccade directed to the ipsilateral side and lasting longer in duration. The bagged-tree-ensemble model demonstrated that intense saccade-related high-gamma modulations localized the visual cortex with an accuracy of 95%. Conclusions: We successfully animated the neural dynamics supporting saccadic suppression, a principal mechanism minimizing the perception of blurred vision during rapid eye movements. The primary visual cortex per se may prepare actively in advance for massive image motion expected during upcoming prolonged saccades. Significance: Measuring saccade-related electrocorticographic signals may help localize the visual cortex and avoid misperceiving physiological high-frequency activity as epileptogenic.

A 12-year-old girl presented with two types seizures: type A, tonic extension and subsequent clonic movements of the right arm; and type B, tonic and clonic movements of the right leg. MRI was normal and karyotype genetic analysis revealed 46,X,t(X;14)(q13;p12). She underwent placement of chronic subdural electrodes over the left hemisphere. We recorded a total of nine seizures during 10 days of epilepsy monitoring. Type A seizures started from the lower part of the left SMA proper and early spread to the hand motor area of the PMA. Type B seizures started from the upper part of the SMA proper and early spread to the leg motor area of the PMA. CCEPs of both SMA proper and PMA activated two identical routes for evoked potentials correlating with separate pathways. Corticectomy of the left SMA proper and PMA achieved seizure-free without hemiparesis. Within a small homunculus of the SMA proper, separate epileptic networks were proven and validated by seizure semiology, ictal HFO, and CCEP. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Although many Drosophila mutants of epilepsy-related genes display clear behavioral spasms and motor unit hyperexcitability, field potential measurements of aberrant hypersynchronous activity across brain regions during seizures have yet to be described. Here, we report a straightforward method to observe local field potentials (LFPs) from the Drosophila brain to monitor ensemble neural activity during seizures in behaving tethered flies. High frequency stimulation across the brain reliably triggers a stereotypic sequence of electroconvulsive seizure (ECS) spike discharges readily detectable in the dorsal longitudinal muscle (DLM) and coupled with behavioral spasms. During seizure episodes, the LFP signal displayed characteristic large-amplitude oscillations with a stereotypic temporal correlation to DLM flight muscle spiking. ECS-related LFP events were clearly distinct from rest- and flight-associated LFP patterns. We further characterized the LFP activity during different types of seizures originating from genetic and pharmacological manipulations. In the 'bang-sensitive' sodium channel mutant bangsenseless (bss), the LFP pattern was prolonged, and the temporal correlation between LFP oscillations and DLM discharges was altered. Following administration of the pro-convulsant GABA(A) blocker picrotoxin, we uncovered a qualitatively different LFP activity pattern, which consisted of a slow (1-Hz), repetitive, waveform, closely coupled with DLM bursting and behavioral spasms. Our approach to record brain LFPs presents an initial framework for electrophysiological analysis of the complex brain-wide activity patterns in the large collection of Drosophila excitability mutants.

J	Reddy, L; Cichy, RM; VanRullen, R				Reddy, Leila; Cichy, Radoslaw Martin; VanRullen, Rufin			Representational Content of Oscillatory Brain Activity during Object Recognition: Contrasting Cortical and Deep Neural Network Hierarchies	ENEURO			English	Article						brain oscillations; deep neural networks; fMRI; MEG; object recognition; representational similarity analysis	FEEDFORWARD; FEEDBACK; ALPHA	Numerous theories propose a key role for brain oscillations in visual perception. Most of these theories postulate that sensory information is encoded in specific oscillatory components (e.g., power or phase) of specific frequency bands. These theories are often tested with whole-brain recording methods of low spatial resolution (EEG or MEG), or depth recordings that provide a local, incomplete view of the brain. Opportunities to bridge the gap between local neural populations and whole-brain signals are rare. Here, using representational similarity analysis (RSA) in human participants we explore which MEG oscillatory components (power and phase, across various frequency bands) correspond to low or high-level visual object representations, using brain representations from fMRI, or layer-wise representations in seven recent deep neural networks (DNNs), as a template for low/high-level object representations. The results showed that around stimulus onset and offset, most transient oscillatory signals correlated with low-level brain patterns (V1). During stimulus presentation, sustained beta (similar to 20 Hz) and gamma(>60 Hz) power best correlated with V1, while oscillatory phase components correlated with IT representations. Surprisingly, this pattern of results did not always correspond to low-level or high-level DNN layer activity. In particular, sustained beta band oscillatory power reflected high-level DNN layers, suggestive of a feed-back component. These results begin to bridge the gap between whole-brain oscillatory signals and object representations supported by local neuronal activations.

Here, we aim to extend the scope of our work to epileptic periventricular heterotopias (PVH) and examine whether the PVH tissue also exhibits normal neurophysiological responses and network-level integration with other non-lesional cortical regions. As part of routine clinical assessment, three adult patients with PVH underwent implantation of intracranial electrodes and participated in experimental cognitive tasks. We obtained simultaneous recordings from PVH and remote cortical sites during rest as well as controlled experimental conditions. In all three subjects (two females), cognitive experimental conditions evoked significant electrophysiological responses in discrete locations within the PVH tissue that were correlated with responses seen in non-epileptic cortical sites. Moreover, the responsive PVH sites exhibited correlated electrophysiological activity with responsive, non-lesional cortical sites during rest conditions. Taken together, our work clearly demonstrates that the PVH tissue may be functionally organized and it may be functionally integrated within cognitively engaged cortical networks despite its anatomic displacement during neurodevelopment.

Neurophysiological, Oculomotor, and Computational Modeling of Impaired Reading Ability in Schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						fixation-related potential; magnocellular; visual; oculomotor; lexical; word skipping; reading; saccade	E-Z-READER; EYE-MOVEMENT CONTROL; FIXATION-RELATED POTENTIALS; SURVIVAL ANALYSIS; WORD-FREQUENCY; DEFICITS; PREDICTABILITY; ATTENTION; INDIVIDUALS; RISK	Schizophrenia (Sz) is associated with deficits in fluent reading ability that compromise functional outcomes. Here, we utilize a combined eye-tracking, neurophysiological, and computational modeling approach to analyze underlying visual and oculomotor processes. Subjects included 26 Sz patients (SzP) and 26 healthy controls. Eye-tracking and electroencephalography data were acquired continuously during the reading of passages from the Gray Oral Reading Tests reading battery, permitting between-group evaluation of both oculomotor activity and fixation-related potentials (FRP). Schizophrenia patients showed a marked increase in time required per word (d = 1.3, P < .0001), reflecting both a moderate increase in fixation duration (d = .7, P = .026) and a large increase in the total saccade number (d = 1.6, P < .0001). Simulation models that incorporated alterations in both lower-level visual and oculomotor function as well as higher-level lexical processing performed better than models that assumed either deficit-type alone. In neurophysiological analyses, amplitude of the fixation-related P1 potential (P1(f)) was significantly reduced in SzP (d = .66, P = .013), reflecting reduced phase reset of ongoing theta-alpha band activity (d = .74, P = .019). In turn, P1(f) deficits significantly predicted increased saccade number both across groups (P = .017) and within SzP alone (P = .042). Computational and neurophysiological methods provide increasingly important approaches for investigating sensory contributions to impaired cognition during naturalistic processing in Sz. Here, we demonstrate deficits in reading rate that reflect both sensory/oculomotor- and semantic-level impairments and that manifest, respectively, as alterations in saccade number and fixation duration. Impaired P1(f) generation reflects impaired fixation-related reset of ongoing brain rhythms and suggests inefficient information processing within the early visual system as a basis for oculomotor dyscontrol during fluent reading in Sz.

The aging slow wave: a shifting amalgam of distinct slow wave and spindle coupling subtypes define slow wave sleep across the human lifespan	SLEEP			English	Article						slow wave; sleep spindle; memory; coupling; biomarker; EEG	MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; RIPPLES; EEG; HIPPOCAMPUS; DYNAMICS; INSIGHTS	Study Objectives: Slow wave and spindle coupling supports memory consolidation, and loss of coupling is linked with cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Coupling is proposed to be a possible biomarker of neurological disease, yet little is known about the different subtypes of coupling that normally occur throughout human development and aging Here we identify distinct subtypes of spindles within slow wave upstates and describe their relationships with sleep stage across the human lifespan. Methods: Coupling within a cross-sectional cohort of 582 subjects was quantified from stages N2 and N3 sleep across ages 6-88 years old. Results were analyzed across the study population via mixed model regression. Within a subset of subjects, we further utilized coupling to identify discrete subtypes of slow waves by their coupled spindles. Results: Two different subtypes of spindles were identified during the upstates of (distinct) slow waves: an "early-fast" spindle, more common in stage N2 sleep, and a "late-fast" spindle, more common in stage N3. We further found stages N2 and N3 sleep contain a mixture of discrete subtypes of slow waves, each identified by their unique coupled-spindle timing and frequency. The relative contribution of coupling subtypes shifts across the human lifespan, and a deeper sleep phenotype prevails with increasing age. Conclusions: Distinct subtypes of slow waves and coupled spindles form the composite of slow wave sleep. Our findings support a model of sleep-dependent synaptic regulation via discrete slow wave/spindle coupling subtypes and advance a conceptual framework for the development of coupling-based biomarkers in age-associated neurological disease.

HFOs may comprise different subgroups that either play a role in physiologic or pathologic brain functions. An exact differentiation between physiologic and pathologic HFOs would help elucidate their relevance for cognitive and epileptogenic brain mechanisms, but the criteria for differentiating between physiologic and pathologic HFOs remain controversial. In particular, the separation of pathologic HFOs from physiologic HFOs could improve the identification of epileptogenic brain regions during the pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsy patients. In this study, we performed intracranial electroencephalography recordings from the hippocampus of epilepsy patients before, during, and after the patients completed a spatial navigation task. We isolated hippocampal ripples from the recordings and categorized the ripples into the putative pathologic group iesRipples, when they coincided with interictal spikes, and the putative physiologic group isolRipples, when they did not coincide with interictal spikes. We found that the occurrence of isolRipples significantly decreased during the task as compared to periods before and after the task. The rate of iesRipples was not modulated by the task. In patients who completed the spatial navigation task on two consecutive days, we furthermore examined the occurrence of ripples in the intervening night. We found that the rate of ripples that coincided with sleep spindles and were therefore putatively physiologic correlated with the performance improvement on the spatial navigation task, whereas the rate of all ripples did not show this relationship. Together, our results suggest that the differentiation of HFOs into putative physiologic and pathologic subgroups may help identify their role for spatial memory and memory consolidation processes. Conversely, excluding putative physiologic HFOs from putative pathologic HFOs may improve the HFO-based identification of epileptogenic brain regions in future studies.

This study uses phase amplitude coupling (PAC) in resting state magnetoencephalography to automatically lateralize TLE focus. Methods: Fifty-four patients with drug resistant TLE and 21 healthy controls who underwent MEG were considered for the study. Classification was carried out for PAC calculated for source transformed resting state of controls vs left TLE (LTLE)/right TLE (RTLE) and LTLE vs RTLE between beta, low-gamma and high-gamma as high frequency (HF) bands and low frequency (LF) 1-13 Hz, with decision tree (DT), support vector machines (SVM) and naive Bayes with feature selection by chi-square test. Further, lateralization classification was also calculated with LF sub-bands (delta, theta, alpha). Results: PAC was higher in the TLE compared to controls. LTLE and RTLE showed differences in low gamma-alpha and high gamma-delta coupling (p < 0.05). Accuracy was highest with SVM between controls and LTLE in the low gamma-LF (92.92%, AUC-1), between controls and RTLE in DT and SVM (93.54%, AUC-0.97, 1) in the low gamma-LF band and in low gamma-delta band in SVM (92.04%, AUC-1) between LTLE and RTLE. Conclusions: PAC shows distinct patterns of coupling in each subject group. Feature selection showed involvement of major network hubs and resting state networks. SVM showed best classification potential in the low gamma band. Significance: PAC in resting state MEG can supplement pre-surgical evaluation in drug resistant TLE.

These structures have statistically significant correlations with sensory stimuli and reinforcement contingencies perceived by the subject. The repeated collapse of self-organized structures at theta/alpha rates generates laterally propagating phase gradients (phase cones), ignited at some specific location of the cortical sheet. Phase cones have been interpreted as neural signatures of transient perceptual experiences according to the cinematic theory of brain dynamics. The rapid expansion of essentially isotropic phase cones is consistent with the propagation of perceptual broadcasts postulated by Global Workspace Theory (GWT). What is the evolutionary advantage of brains operating with repeatedly collapsing dynamics? This question is answered using thermodynamic concepts. According to neuropercolation theory, waking brains are described as non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems operating at the edge of criticality, undergoing repeated phase transitions. This work analyzes the role of long-range axonal connections and metabolic processes in the regulation of critical brain dynamics. Historically, the near 10 Hz domain has been associated with conscious sensory integration, cortical "ignitions" linked to conscious visual perception, and conscious experiences. We can therefore combine a very large body of experimental evidence and theory, including graph theory, neuropercolation, and GWT. This cortical operating style may optimize a tradeoff between rapid adaptation to novelty vs. stable and widespread self-organization, therefore resulting in significant Darwinian benefits.

Although gaze communication, a well-established nonverbal social behavior, has shown its importance in inferring others' mental states, not much is known about the effects of irrelevant gaze signals on cognitive conflict markers during collaborative settings. In the present study, participants completed a categorization task where they categorized objects based on their color while observing images of a robot. On each trial, participants observed the robot iCub grasping an object from a table and offering it to them to simulate a handover. Once the robot "moved" the object forward, participants were asked to categorize the object according to its color. Before participants were allowed to respond, the robot made a lateral head/gaze shift. The gaze shifts were either congruent or incongruent with the object's color. We expected that incongruent head cues would induce more errors (Study 1), would be associated with more curvature in eye-tracking trajectories (Study 2), and induce larger amplitude in electrophysiological markers of cognitive conflict (Study 3). Results of the three studies show more oculomotor interference as measured in error rates (Study 1), larger curvatures eye-tracking trajectories (Study 2), and higher amplitudes of the N2 ERP component of the EEG signals as well as higher event-related spectral perturbation amplitudes (Study 3) for incongruent trials compared with congruent trials. Our findings reveal that behavioral, ocular, and electrophysiological markers can index the influence of irrelevant signals during goal-oriented tasks.

These disorders typically result from an issue in the phonological component of language that causes problems to represent and manipulate the phonological structure of words at the syllable and/or phoneme level. We used Auditory Steady-State Responses (ASSRs) in EEG recordings to investigate the brain activation and hemisphere asymmetry of theta, alpha, beta and low-gamma range oscillations in typical readers and readers with dyslexia. The aim was to analyse whether the group differences found in previous electrode level studies were caused by a different source activation pattern or conversely was an effect that could be found on the active brain sources. We could not find differences in the brain locations of the main active brain sources. However, we observed differences in the extracted waveforms. The group average of the first DSS component of all signal-to-noise ratios of ASSR at source level was higher than the group averages at the electrode level. These analyses included a lower alpha synchronisation in adolescents with dyslexia and the possibility of compensatory mechanisms in theta, beta and low-gamma frequency bands. The main brain auditory sources were located in cortical regions around the auditory cortex. Thus, the differences observed in auditory EEG experiments would, according to our findings, have their origin in the intrinsic oscillatory mechanisms of the brain cortical sources related to speech perception.

We examined how human attachments facilitate efficient, resource-sensitive performance of social goals by balancing neural and behavioral synchrony. Using hyperscanning EEG, we collected neural data from male-female pairs in three groups (N=158, 79 pairs); long-term couples, best friends, and unfamiliar group members, during two ecologically-valid naturalistic tasks; motor coordination and empathy giving. Across groups and tasks, neural synchrony was supported by behavior coordination and orchestrated multiple neural rhythms. In the goal-directed motor task, interbrain synchrony implicated beta and gamma rhythms localized to sensorimotor areas. Couples showed the highest neural synchrony combined with greatest behavioral synchrony and such brain-behavior linkage resulted in speedy performance, conserving energy in the long run. The socially-oriented empathy task triggered neural synchrony in widely-distributed sensorimotor and bilateral temporal regions, integrated alpha, beta, and gamma rhythms, and implicated brain-behavior complementarity; couples displayed the highest behavioral synchrony combined with lowest neural synchrony toward greatest felt support while strangers exhibited the opposite pattern. Findings suggest that human attachments provide a familiar backdrop of temporal regularities, required for the brain's allostatic function, and interbrain and behavioral synchrony are sculpted by familiarity and closeness toward resource-sensitive performance of survival-related social goals, toiled by two.

Parietal P3 and midfrontal theta prospectively predict the development of adolescent alcohol use	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Adolescent alcohol use; EEG; ERP; endophenotype; longitudinal design; P3; theta	SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; EVENT-RELATED OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIAL AMPLITUDE; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; DECISION-MAKING; HEAVY-DRINKING; FOLLOW-UP; HIGH-RISK; DRUG-USE; BRAIN	Background Subclinical adolescent alcohol use is highly prevalent and may have deleterious effects on important psychosocial and brain outcomes. Prior research has focused on identifying endophenotypes of pathological drinking, and the predictors of normative drinking remain understudied. This study investigated the incremental predictive value of two potential psychophysiological endophenotypes, P3 amplitude (an index of decision making) and midfrontal theta power (a correlate of attentional control), for prospectively predicting the expression and initiation of alcohol use emerging in adolescence. Methods A large (N = 594) epidemiological sample was prospectively assessed at ages 11/14/17. Alcohol/substance use was assessed at all ages via a computerized self-report inventory. EEG was recorded at age-14 during a visual oddball task to elicit P3 and theta. Results Reduced target-related P3 and theta at age-14 prospectively predicted drinking at age-17 independent of one another. Among alcohol-naive individuals at age-14, attenuated P3 and theta increased the odds of new-onset alcohol behaviors 3 years later. Importantly, the endophenotypes provided significant incremental predictive power of future non-clinical alcohol use beyond relevant risk factors (prior alcohol use; tobacco/illicit drug initiation; parental alcohol use disorder). Conclusions The current report is the first of our knowledge to demonstrate that deviations in parietal P3 and midfrontal theta prospectively predict the emergence of normative/non-pathological drinking. P3 and theta provide modest yet significant explanatory variance beyond prominent self-report and familial risk measures. Findings offer strong evidence supporting the predictive utility of P3 and theta as candidate endophenotypes for adolescent drinking.

REM periods consist of the alternation of phasic and tonic REM microstates that differ in spontaneous and evoked neural activity. Although previous studies indicate, that cortical and thalamo-cortical activity differs across phasic and tonic microstates, the characterization of neural activity, particularly in subcortical structures that are critical in the initiation and maintenance of REM sleep is still limited in humans. Here, we examined electric activity patterns of the anterior nuclei of the thalamus as well as their functional connectivity with scalp EEG recordings during REM microstates and wakefulness in a group of epilepsy patients (N = 12, 7 females). Anterothalamic local field potentials showed increased high-alpha and beta frequency power in tonic compared to phasic REM, emerging as an intermediate state between phasic REM and wakefulness. Moreover, we observed increased thalamocortical synchronization in phasic compared to tonic REM sleep, especially in the slow and fast frequency ranges. Wake-like activity in tonic REM sleep may index the regulation of arousal and vigilance facilitating environmental alertness. On the other hand, increased thalamocortical synchronization may reflect the intrinsic activity of fronto-limbic networks supporting emotional and memory processes during phasic REM sleep. In sum, our findings highlight that the heterogeneity of phasic and tonic REM sleep is not limited to cortical activity, but is also manifested by anterothalamic local field potentials and thalamocortical synchronization.

J	Zebarjadi, N; Levy, J				Zebarjadi, Niloufar; Levy, Jonathan			Neural shifts in alpha rhythm's dual functioning during empathy	BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Alpha rhythm; development; fMRI; MEG; Pain empathy; Social neuroscience	OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; MU-SUPPRESSION; BAND ACTIVITY; PAIN; SENSORIMOTOR; MODULATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; PERCEPTION; INCREASES	Introduction Alpha oscillations are unique in their capacity to relay neuronal information through a dual-process named "gating by inhibition": rhythmic enhancement inhibits task-irrelevant regions while rhythmic suppression engages task-relevant regions in the brain. A social-cognitive process that operates by relying on the suppression of the alpha rhythm in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is the ability to generate empathy. This phenomenon has been evidenced in dozens of electrophysiological studies targeting adult human subjects. Yet, recent studies on the neurodevelopment of empathy indicate that in younger age, empathy does not involve alpha suppression in S1 but only enhancement. More interestingly, right before adulthood, this rhythm is still enhanced, but in a remarkable shift, a pattern of suppression emerges. In this registered magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we will capture frequency-decomposed neural activity particularly at the alpha range and its corresponding hemodynamic response and target subjects at around 20 years old as a unique time-window in development that allows investigating in parallel both low-alpha suppression and high-alpha enhancement. We aim to address two questions: (a) Does alpha power suppression in the S1 region during empathy correspond to BOLD increase in this region? (b) What is the functional role of alpha power enhancement during empathy development (BOLD signal increase or decrease)? Addressing these questions will particularly advance knowledge on the process of empathy in the brain, and the way in which it is underpinned by alpha oscillations. Moreover, examining these experimental outcomes can potentially lay the ground for future studies that would further examine the role of alpha oscillations in empathy during the course of development. Methods Brain data of forty healthy individuals close to 20 years old will be recorded in two consecutive MEG and fMRI sessions while subjects observing physical pain versus neutral stimuli. Besides, each participant's subjective experiences wll be measred by questionnaires, interviews and rating of the stimuli.

Theta synchronization (especially over the frontal midline areas) is related to cognitive control and executive processes during WM encoding and retention. Alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) is associated with information processing and attention. Methods: Participants (35 patients and 39 matched controls) performed a modified Sternberg WM task, containing salient and non-salient distractor items in the retention period. A high-density 128 channel EEG was recorded during the task. Theta (4-7 Hz) and fast alpha (10-13 Hz) event-related spectral per-turbation (ERSP) were analyzed during the retention and encoding period. Results: Patients with schizophrenia showed worse WM performance and increased attentional dis-tractibility in terms of lower hit rates and increased distractor-related commission errors compared to healthy controls. Theta synchronization was modulated by condition (learning vs. distractor) in both groups but it was modulated by salience only in controls. Furthermore, salience of distractors modulated less the fast alpha ERD in patients. Conclusions: Our results suggest that patients with schizophrenia process salient and non-salient dis-tracting information less efficiently and show weaker cognitive control compared to controls. Significance: These differences may partly account for diminished WM performance and increased dis-tractibility in schizophrenia. (c) 2021 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Motor engagement relates to accurate perception of phonemes and audiovisual words, but not auditory words	COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY			English	Article							SPEECH-PERCEPTION; PREMOTOR CORTEX; CORTICAL ORGANIZATION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; BAND OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL SPEECH; BROCAS AREA; ALPHA; SENSORIMOTOR; SUPPRESSION	A longstanding debate has surrounded the role of the motor system in speech perception, but progress in this area has been limited by tasks that only examine isolated syllables and conflate decision-making with perception. Using an adaptive task that temporally isolates perception from decision-making, we examined an EEG signature of motor activity (sensorimotor mu /beta suppression) during the perception of auditory phonemes, auditory words, audiovisual words, and environmental sounds while holding difficulty constant at two levels (Easy/Hard). Results revealed left-lateralized sensorimotor mu /beta suppression that was related to perception of speech but not environmental sounds. Audiovisual word and phoneme stimuli showed enhanced left sensorimotor mu /beta suppression for correct relative to incorrect trials, while auditory word stimuli showed enhanced suppression for incorrect trials. Our results demonstrate that motor involvement in perception is left-lateralized, is specific to speech stimuli, and it not simply the result of domain-general processes. These results provide evidence for an interactive network for speech perception in which dorsal stream motor areas are dynamically engaged during the perception of speech depending on the characteristics of the speech signal. Crucially, this motor engagement has different effects on the perceptual outcome depending on the lexicality and modality of the speech stimulus.

Outcomes in the treatment of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) with CBTip: Response in seizure frequency, depression, anxiety, and quality of life	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						PNES; Seizures; Psychogenic; Conversion; CBT; Counseling	EPILEPSY; PSYCHOEDUCATION; PSYCHOTHERAPY; VALIDATION; DISORDER; THERAPY; PHQ-9	Rationale: Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES) are seizure-like episodes without EEG abnormality, and are of psychological origin. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), a type of psychological counseling, is known to be the best intervention to treat PNES and the underlying psychiatric symptoms. Yet, many remain untreated because of limited access to specialized counseling programs. In this study, first we intended to see if the positive outcomes of the CBTip can be replicated in our patient population using within-group comparison. We also aimed to examine the outcomes of patients who received a variable dose of treatment than the established treatment protocol. Method: We obtained retrospective patient reported outcomes (PRO) data from patients treated with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-informed psychotherapy (CBT-ip) from January 2015 to January 2020 in an outpatient tertiary care epilepsy center. The CBTip program is a 12-session intervention delivered weekly by a seizure counselor. Although the program comprises 12 sessions of treatment, we included patients who attended at least 7 sessions consistent with previous research that used a similar cutoff. We had a total of 160 patient PROs included in the analysis. Outcome variables including seizure fre-quency, depression, anxiety, and quality of life were examined using self-report outcome scores. Demographic and other clinical and psychosocial confounding variables were controlled. Results: In the first analysis in which we compared pre-treatment scores with 3-month posttreatment scores, there was no significant change in seizure frequency, depression, anxiety, and quality-of-life out-comes. In the second analysis when we compared pre-and posttreatment scores in patients who com-pleted the treatment in longer than 3-month time, there were significant improvement in primary and secondary outcomes. For seizure frequency, 10 patients had data for "seizures per day in the last 6 months" and 5 participants (50%) improved by 50% or more in the number of seizures per day. There were also significant reductions in depression and anxiety scores but not in quality of life. Implication and conclusions: Our analysis showed that patients treated with CBTip with a minimum of 7 sessions in 3 months did not have significant improvement. However, attending at least 7 sessions of CBTip in longer than 3 months was effective for seizure control, depression, and anxiety. The observa-tional and exploratory nature of our study, however, limits the generalizability of our findings outside of the single tertiary clinical care setting. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Recent advances in biomedical engineering, computer science, and neuroscience are making brain-computer interfaces a reality, paving the way to restoring and potentially augmenting human physical and mental capabilities. Applications of brain-computer interfaces are being explored in applications as diverse as security, lie detection, alertness monitoring, gaming, education, art, and human cognition augmentation. The present tutorial aims to survey the principal features and challenges of brain-computer interfaces (such as reliable acquisition of brain signals, filtering and processing of the acquired brainwaves, ethical and legal issues related to brain-computer interface (BCI), data privacy, and performance assessment) with special emphasis to biomedical engineering and automation engineering applications. The content of this paper is aimed at students, researchers, and practitioners to glimpse the multifaceted world of brain-computer interfacing.

While research has helped elucidate how NU relates to neurobiological functioning with respect to alcohol use, no known work has contextualized such functioning within existing neurobiological theories in addiction. Therefore, we elucidated mechanisms contributing to the NU-hazardous alcohol use relationship by combining NU theories with neurobiological dual models of addiction, which posit addiction is related to cognitive control and reinforcement processing. Fifty-five undergraduates self-reported NU and hazardous alcohol use. We recorded EEG while participants performed a reinforced flanker task. We measured cognitive control using N2 activation time-locked to the incongruent flanker stimulus, and we measured reinforcement processing using the feedback-related negativity (FRN) time locked to better-than-expected negative reinforcement feedback. We modeled hazardous drinking using hierarchical regression, with NU, N2, and FRN plus their interactions as predictors. The regression model significantly predicted hazardous alcohol use, and the three-way interaction (NU x N2 x FRN) significantly improved model fit. In the context of inefficient processing (i.e., larger N2s and FRNs), NU demonstrated a strong relationship with hazardous alcohol use. In the context of efficient processing (i.e., smaller N2s and FRNs), NU was unrelated to hazardous alcohol use. Control analyses ruled out the potential impact of other impulsivity sub scales, individual differences in dimensional negative affect or anxiety, and use of substances other than alcohol, and post hoc specificity analyses showed that this effect was driven primarily by heavy drinking, rather than frequency of drinking. This analysis provides preliminary evidence that brain mechanisms of cognitive control and reinforcement processing influence the relationship between NU and hazardous alcohol use, and confirms a specific influence of negative reinforcement processing. Future clinical research could leverage these neurobiological moderators for substance misuse treatment.

Neurophysiology of Human Perceptual Decision-Making	ANNUAL REVIEW OF NEUROSCIENCE, VOL 44, 2021	Annual Review of Neuroscience		English	Review; Book Chapter						perceptual decision-making; evidence accumulation; cognitive modeling; EEG; MEG; fMRI	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; TRIAL FLUCTUATIONS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; DIFFUSION-MODEL; CORTEX; SIGNALS; SPEED	The discovery of neural signals that reflect the dynamics of perceptual decision formation has had a considerable impact. Not only do such signals enable detailed investigations of the neural implementation of the decision-making process but they also can expose key elements of the brain's decision algorithms. For a long time, such signals were only accessible through direct animal brain recordings, and progress in human neuroscience was hampered by the limitations of noninvasive recording techniques. However, recent methodological advances are increasingly enabling the study of human brain signals that finely trace the dynamics of the unfolding decision process. In this review, we highlight how human neurophysiological data are now being leveraged to furnish new insights into the multiple processing levels involved in forming decisions, to inform the construction and evaluation of mathematical models that can explain intra- and interindividual differences, and to examine how key ancillary processes interact with core decision circuits.

Previous research has found that when participants switch attention either between two perception-based tasks (within-domain switches) or between a memory- and a perception-based task (between-domain switches), a substantial and similar processing cost was observed compared to the repetition of the same task (Verschooren, Schindler, De Raedt, & Pourtois, 2019). Here, we recorded 64-channel EEG while participants carried out within- versus between-domain switches of attention. ERP results showed that during early sensory processing, a marked P1 attenuation was associated with both switch types, suggesting that switching was associated with an early bottleneck during information processing. This early gating effect was stronger when switching from an internal to an external task, compared to switching between external tasks, suggesting different top-down requirements for them. These findings are in line with earlier proposals in the literature.

Nevertheless, while the brain temporal dynamics underlying the process of giving value to music are beginning to be understood, little is known about how familiarity might modulate the oscillatory activity associated with music-evoked pleasantness. The goal of the present experiment was to study the influence of familiarity in the relation between theta phase synchronization and music-evoked pleasantness. EEG was recorded from 22 healthy participants while they were listening to both familiar and unfamiliar music and rating the experienced degree of evoked pleasantness. By exploring interactions, we found that right fronto-temporal theta synchronization was positively associated with music-evoked pleasantness when listening to unfamiliar music. On the contrary, inter-hemispheric temporo-parietal theta synchronization was positively associated with music-evoked pleasantness when listening to familiar music. These results shed some light on the possible oscillatory mechanisms underlying fronto-temporal and temporo-parietal connectivity and their relationship with music-evoked pleasantness and familiarity.

The goal of this study was to examine the role of home environment on executive function (EF) in 6-12-year-old children through the mediating role of alpha, beta, and theta brain waves. Parents of 133 children filled out the Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale (BDEFS) and Home Executive Function Environment (HEFE). Children's brain waves were also assessed. Data were analyzed using correlation and path analysis. The results suggested that there is a positive and significant relationship with mediating role of alpha and beta brain waves, between HEFE and BDEFS. Findings of this study supported the idea that environmental factors such as HEFE affect the function of brain waves and thus the daily EF of children. As a result, modifying home environment based on the executive functioning needs of children is recommended to parents.

We seek to uncover the intrinsic relationship among brain regions fundamental to their functional activity by constructing a pairwise maximum entropy model (MEM) of the inter-ictal activation patterns of five patients with medically refractory epilepsy over an average of similar to 14 hours of band-passed intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings per patient. We find that the pairwise MEM accurately predicts iEEG electrodes' activation patterns' probability and their pairwise correlations. We demonstrate that the estimated pairwise MEM's interaction weights predict structural connectivity and its strength over several frequencies significantly beyond what is expected based solely on sampled regions' distance in most patients. Together, the pairwise MEM offers a framework for explaining iEEG functional connectivity and provides insight into how the brain's structural connectome gives rise to large-scale activation patterns by promoting co-activation between connected structures.

Using machine learning analyses, with rigorous between-subject cross-validation and non-parametric permutation testing, we show that memorized sound content is strongly represented in phase-synchronization patterns between subregions of auditory and front-oparietal cortices. These phase-synchronization patterns predict the memorized sound content steadily across the studied maintenance period. In addition to connectivity-based representations, there are indices of more local, "activity silent" representations in auditory cortices, where the decoding accuracy of WM content significantly increases after task-irrelevant "impulse stimuli." Our results demonstrate that synchronization patterns across auditory sensory and association areas orchestrate neuronal coding of auditory WM content. This connectivity-based coding scheme could also extend beyond the auditory domain.

Postnatal Arx transcriptional activity regulates functional properties of PV interneurons	ISCIENCE			English	Article							HIPPOCAMPAL SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; 2/3 PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; NMDA RECEPTOR; MOUSE MODEL; PARVALBUMIN INTERNEURONS; EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX; ABNORMAL GENITALIA; GENE; MUTATIONS; EPILEPSY	The transcription factor Aristaless-related X-linked gene (Arx) is a monogenic factor in early onset epileptic encephalopathies (EOEEs) and a fundamental regulator of early stages of brain development. However, Arx expression persists in mature GABAergic neurons with an unknown role. To address this issue, we generated a conditional knockout (CKO) mouse in which postnatal Arx was ablated in parvalbumin interneurons (PVIs). Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in CKO mice revealed an increase in theta oscillations and the occurrence of occasional seizures. Behavioral analysis uncovered an increase in anxiety. Genome-wide sequencing of fluorescence activated cell sorted (FACS) PVIs revealed that Arx impinged on network excitability via genes primarily associated with synaptic and extracellular matrix pathways. Whole-cell recordings revealed prominent hypoexcitability of various intrinsic and synaptic properties. These results revealed important roles for postnatal Arx expression in PVIs in the control of neural circuits and that dysfunction in those roles alone can cause EOEE-like network abnormalities.

However, being aggregate signals that lack cellular resolution, these signals are not easy to interpret directly in terms of neural functions. Developing tools for a reliable estimation of key neural parameters from these signals, such as the interaction between excitation and inhibition or the level of neuromodulation, is important both for neuroscience and clinical applications. Over the years we have developed tools based on the combination of neural network modelling and computational analysis of empirical data to estimate neural parameters from aggregate neural signals. The purpose of this paper, which accompanies an Invited Plenary Lecture in this conference, is to review the main tools that we have developed to estimate neural parameters from mass signals, and to outline future challenges and directions for developing computational tools to invert aggregate neural signals in terms of neural circuit parameters.

Input-independent homeostasis of developing thalamocortical activity	ENEURO			English	Article							VISUAL-CORTEX; EEG; EMERGENCE; NEOCORTEX; SLEEP	The isocortex of all mammals studied to date shows a progressive increase in the amount and continuity of background activity during early development. In humans the transition from a discontinuous (mostly silent, intermittently bursting) cortex to one that is continuously active is complete soon after birth and is a critical prognostic indicator. In the visual cortex of rodents this switch from discontinuous to continuous background activity occurs during the two days before eye-opening, driven by activity changes in relay thalamus. The factors that regulate the timing of continuity development, which enables mature visual processing, are unknown. Here we test the role of the retina, the primary input, in the development of continuous spontaneous activity in the visual cortex of mice using depth electrode recordings from Enucleated mice in vivo. Bilateral enucleation at postnatal day (P)6, one week prior to the onset of continuous activity, acutely silences cortex, yet firing rates and early oscillations return to normal within two days and show a normal developmental trajectory through P12. Enucleated animals showed differences in silent period duration and continuity on P13 that resolved on P16, and an increase in low frequency power that did not. Our results show that the timing of cortical activity development is not determined by the major driving input to the system. Rather, even during a period of rapid increase in firing rates and continuity, neural activity in the visual cortex is under homeostatic control that is largely robust to the loss of the primary input. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Uncovering the mechanistic underpinnings of EEG development is critical to increasing the diagnostic potential of this cheap and portable methodology. An important component of this maturation is the acquisition of activity that is continuous, i.e. lacking silent periods. Here we used background activity in the visual cortex of developing unanesthetized mice to show that the primary sensory input plays little role in the development of continuity and normal firing rates, which instead appear to be regulated by mechanism internal to thalamus and cortex. These findings suggest that damage to driving thalamic inputs will be difficult to detect by EEG, and point to the importance of firing rate homeostasis in regulating even early development.

Twenty-two psychology students underwent neurofeedback training, employing beta/theta protocol to enhance beta1 power (13-21 Hz) and suppress theta (4-7 Hz) power. Neurofeedback efficacy was evaluated by behavioral components measured on pre-tests and post-tests employing a visual continuous performance task. The results revealed a significant interaction term between change in reaction time from pre-test to post-test and expectancy effect, indicating that participants with high prognostic expectations showed better improvement in reaction time scores. The data did not reveal that actual neurofeedback performance influenced the post-test measurements of the visual continuous performance task. No significant differences were found for reaction time variability, omission, or commission errors. Possible factors contributing to the results are discussed, and directions for future research are suggested.

Recently, the brain-computer interface (BCI) has seen rapid development, which may promote the recovery of motor function in chronic stroke patients. Methods. Twelve stroke patients with severe upper limb and hand motor impairment were enrolled and randomly assigned into two groups: motor imagery (MI)-based BCI training with multimodal feedback (BCI group, n = 7) and classical motor imagery training (control group, n = 5). Motor function and electrophysiology were evaluated before and after the intervention. The Fugl-Meyer assessment-upper extremity (FMA-UE) is the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures include an increase in wrist active extension or surface electromyography (the amplitude and cocontraction of extensor carpi radialis during movement), the action research arm test (ARAT), the motor status scale (MSS), and Barthel index (BI). Time-frequency analysis and power spectral analysis were used to reflect the electroencephalogram (EEG) change before and after the intervention. Results. Compared with the baseline, the FMA-UE score increased significantly in the BCI group (p = 0.006). MSS scores improved significantly in both groups, while ARAT did not improve significantly. In addition, before the intervention, all patients could not actively extend their wrists or just had muscle contractions. After the intervention, four patients regained the ability to extend their paretic wrists (two in each group). The amplitude and area under the curve of extensor carpi radialis improved to some extent, but there was no statistical significance between the groups. Conclusion. MI-based BCI combined with sensory and visual feedback might improve severe upper limb and hand impairment in chronic stroke patients, showing the potential for application in rehabilitation medicine.

This review is also an opportunity to produce a brief, up-to-date critical survey of current data modalities and analytical methods available for deriving both static and dynamic connectomes from electrophysiology. We review hurdles that challenge the significance and impact of current electrophysiology connectome research. We then encourage the field to take a leap of faith and embrace the wealth of electrophysiological signals, despite their apparent, disconcerting complexity. Our position is that electrophysiology connectomics is poised to inform testable mechanistic models of information integration in hierarchical brain networks, constructed from observable oscillatory and aperiodic signal components and their polyrhythmic interactions.

Clinical Efficacy and Dosing of Vibrotactile Coordinated Reset Stimulation in Motor and Non-motor Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease: A Study Protocol	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						coordinated reset; vibrotactile stimulation; Parkinson's disease; study protocol; sensorimotor; non-motor symptoms; non-invasive stimulation	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; DEEP-BRAIN-STIMULATION; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; SENSORIMOTOR INTEGRATION; MOVEMENT; SPEECH; OSCILLATIONS; VALIDATION; POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION	Enhanced neuronal synchronization of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is commonly found in PD patients and corresponds to decreased motor ability. Coordinated reset (CR) was developed to decouple synchronized states causing long lasting desynchronization of neural networks. Vibrotactile CR stimulation (vCR) was developed as non-invasive therapeutic that delivers gentle vibrations to the fingertips. A previous study has shown that vCR can desynchronize abnormal brain rhythms within the sensorimotor cortex of PD patients, corresponding to sustained motor relief after 3 months of daily treatment. To further develop vCR, we created a protocol that has two phases. Study 1, a double blinded randomized sham-controlled study, is designed to address motor and non-motor symptoms, sensorimotor integration, and potential calibration methods. Study 2 examines dosing effects of vCR using a remote study design. In Study 1, we will perform a 7-month double-blind sham-controlled study including 30 PD patients randomly placed into an active vCR or inactive (sham) vCR condition. Patients will receive stimulation for 4 h a day in 2-h blocks for 6 months followed by a 1-month pause in stimulation to assess long lasting effects. Our primary outcome measure is the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III off medication after 6 months of treatment. Secondary measures include a freezing of gait (FOG) questionnaire, objective motor evaluations, sensorimotor electroencephalography (EEG) results, a vibratory temporal discrimination task (VTDT), non-motor symptom evaluations/tests such as sleep, smell, speech, quality of life measurements and Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD). Patients will be evaluated at baseline, 3, 6, and 7 months. In the second, unblinded study phase (Study 2), all patients will be given the option to receive active vCR stimulation at a reduced dose for an additional 6 months remotely. The remote MDS-UPDRS part III off medication will be our primary outcome measure. Secondary measures include sleep, quality of life, objective motor evaluations, FOG and LEDD. Patients will be evaluated in the same time periods as the first study. Results from this study will provide clinical efficacy of vCR and help validate our investigational vibrotactile device for the purpose of obtaining FDA clearance.<br>	[Pfeifer, Kristina J.; Cook, Alex J.; Yankulova, Jessica K.; Tass, Peter A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Mortimer, Bruce J.

Brain-controlled robotic arms have shown broad application prospects with the development of robotics, science and information decoding. However, disadvantages, such as poor flexibility restrict its wide application. Approach. In order to alleviate these drawbacks, this study proposed a robotic arm asynchronous control system based on steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) in an augmented reality (AR) environment. In the AR environment, the participants were able to concurrently see the robot arm and visual stimulation interface through the AR device. Therefore, there was no need to switch attention frequently between the visual stimulation interface and the robotic arm. This study proposed a multi-template algorithm based on canonical correlation analysis and task-related component analysis to identify 12 targets. An optimization strategy based on dynamic window was adopted to adjust the duration of visual stimulation adaptively. Main results. Experimental results of this study found that the high-frequency SSVEP-based brain-computer interface (BCI) realized the switch of the system state, which controlled the robotic arm asynchronously. The average accuracy of the offline experiment was 94.97%, whereas the average information translate rate was 67.37 +/- 14.27 bits.min(-1). The online results from ten healthy subjects showed that the average selection time of a single online command was 2.04 s, which effectively reduced the visual fatigue of the subjects. Each subject could quickly complete the puzzle task. Significance. The experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and potential of this human-computer interaction strategy and provided new ideas for BCI-controlled robots.

J	Bahador, N; Kortelainen, J				Bahador, Nooshin; Kortelainen, Jukka			Deep learning-based classification of multichannel bio-signals using directedness transfer learning	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Spectral-phase-spatial fusion; Multivariate data; Transfer learning; Deep learning; Bi-dimensional mapping	TIME-SERIES; FUSION; REPRESENTATIONS; RECOGNITION; CNN	The problem with processing of multivariate/multichannel signals lies in adapting of existing classifiers on data. Reformulating time-series data as visual clues and assigning visual patterns to different categories help the classification of time series in a wide range of applications. These series-to-image transformations have benefits including better noise robustness and more options regarding augmentation. They also provide the possibility of achieving discriminative features by employing transfer learning paradigm in cases dealing with highly small training datasets. In this respect, this work aimed to encode spectral-phase information into a bi-dimensional map. Transferring knowledge was done using bi-dimensional transformation capitalizing on the direction and propagation pattern of one channel influence on the others. EEG data from patients diagnosed with delirium (N = 15) recorded using a 10-channel BrainStatus device were used for this analysis. Considering leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, classification outcomes demonstrated that directedness transfer learning via Alexnet yields a promising performance showing 97.17% precision and outperforming other approaches. Comparison with nine different deep networks pretrained on ImageNet database was included. Directedness transfer learning resulted in precision of 95.29 +/- 1.46 (mu +/- sigma)% among all networks. For further evaluation, directedness bi-dimensional transformation was also compared with six other 2D maps. Applying different networks resulted in average precision of (91.99 +/- 2.23)% for polar-, (91.69 +/- 1.57)% for correlation-, (90.46 +/- 1.71)% for Spectrogram-, (87.82 +/- 2.16)% for Wavelet-, (84.24 +/- 1.72)% for Wigner-Ville-and (82.84 +/- 2.46)% for Mel-frequency Cepstrum maps. To conclude, the proposed technique shows significant benefit in compressing spatio-spectral patterns of multichannel signals in just a unified visual representation.

Previous studies have provided behavioral evidence of atypical auditory processing towards IDS in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), while the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remain unknown. This event-related potential (ERP) study investigated the neural coding of formant-exaggerated speech and nonspeech in 24 4- to 11-year-old children with ASD and 24 typically-developing (TD) peers. The EEG data were recorded using an alternating block design, in which each stimulus type (exaggerated/non-exaggerated sound) was presented with equal probability. ERP waveform analysis revealed an enhanced P1 for vowel formant exaggeration in the TD group but not in the ASD group. This speech-specific atypical processing in ASD was not found for the nonspeech stimuli which showed similar P1 enhancement in both ASD and TD groups. Moreover, the time-frequency analysis indicated that children with ASD showed differences in neural synchronization in the delta-theta bands for processing acoustic formant changes embedded in nonspeech. Collectively, the results add substantiating neurophysiological evidence (i.e., a lack of neural enhancement effect of vowel exaggeration) for atypical auditory processing of IDS in children with ASD, which may exert a negative effect on phonetic encoding and language learning. Lay summary Atypical responses to motherese might act as a potential early marker of risk for children with ASD. This study investigated the neural responses to such socially relevant stimuli in the ASD brain, and the results suggested a lack of neural enhancement responding to the motherese even in individuals without intellectual disability.

However, the developmental trajectory of resting-state activity in relation to cognitive performance has not been studied in detail. The present study assessed spectral characteristics of theta (5-8 Hz) and alpha (9-13 Hz) frequency bands during resting-state in a priori selected regions of the frontoparietal network (FPN). We also examined the relationship between resting-state activity and cognitive performance in typically developing children. We hypothesized that older children and children with high attentional scores would have higher parietal alpha activity and frontal theta activity while at rest compared to young children and those with lower attentional scores. MEG data were collected in 65 typically developing children, ages 9-14 years, as part of the Developmental Chronnecto-Genomics study. Resting-state data were collected during eyes open and eyes closed for 5 min. Participants completed the NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control (FICA) and Attention Test and Dimensional Change Card Sort Test (DCCS) to assess top-down attentional control. Spectral power density was used to characterize the FPN. We found during eyes open and eyes closed, all participants had higher theta and alpha power in parietal regions relative to frontal regions. The group with high attentional scores had higher alpha power during resting-state eyes closed compared to those with low attentional scores. However, there were no significant differences between age groups, suggesting changes in the maturation of neural oscillations in theta and alpha are not evident among children in the 9-14-year age range.

Mitochondrial, exosomal miR137-COX6A2 and gamma synchrony as biomarkers of parvalbumin interneurons, psychopathology, and neurocognition in schizophrenia	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							INCREASED OXIDATIVE STRESS; REDOX DYSREGULATION; BIPOLAR DISORDER; TARGETED ANTIOXIDANT; DOUBLE-BLIND; OSCILLATIONS; NEURONS; GENE; INTERVENTION; POLYMORPHISM	Early detection and intervention in schizophrenia requires mechanism-based biomarkers that capture neural circuitry dysfunction, allowing better patient stratification, monitoring of disease progression and treatment. In prefrontal cortex and blood of redox dysregulated mice (Gclm-KO +/- GBR), oxidative stress induces miR-137 upregulation, leading to decreased COX6A2 and mitophagy markers (NIX, Fundc1, and LC3B) and to accumulation of damaged mitochondria, further exacerbating oxidative stress and parvalbumin interneurons (PVI) impairment. MitoQ, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, rescued all these processes. Translating to early psychosis patients (EPP), blood exosomal miR-137 increases and COX6A2 decreases, combined with mitophagy markers alterations, suggest that observations made centrally and peripherally in animal model were reflected in patients' blood. Higher exosomal miR-137 and lower COX6A2 levels were associated with a reduction of ASSR gamma oscillations in EEG. As ASSR requires proper PVI-related networks, alterations in miR-137/COX6A2 plasma exosome levels may represent a proxy marker of PVI cortical microcircuit impairment. EPP can be stratified in two subgroups: (a) a patients' group with mitochondrial dysfunction "Psy-D", having high miR-137 and low COX6A2 levels in exosomes, and (b) a "Psy-ND" subgroup with no/low mitochondrial impairment, including patients having miR-137 and COX6A2 levels in the range of controls. Psy-D patients exhibited more impaired ASSR responses in association with worse psychopathological status, neurocognitive performance, and global and social functioning, suggesting that impairment of PVI mitochondria leads to more severe disease profiles. This stratification would allow, with high selectivity and specificity, the selection of patients for treatments targeting brain mitochondria dysregulation and capture the clinical and functional efficacy of future clinical trials.

Delta-modulated cortical alpha oscillations support new knowledge generation through memory integration	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Cross-frequency coupling; Episodic memory; Knowledge representation; Prefrontal cortex; Reactivation; Semantic memory	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURAL MECHANISMS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; EEG; HIPPOCAMPAL; DYNAMICS; RETRIEVAL; REPRESENTATION; ATTENTION	The ability to generate new knowledge depends on integration of separate information. For example, in one episode an individual may learn that apple seeds are called pips. In a separate episode, the individual may then learn that pips contain cyanide. Integration of the related facts in memory may then support derivation of the new knowledge that apple seeds contain cyanide. Past studies show that adults form relational memories that represent the commonalities among discrete events, and that such integrated representation supports the ability to infer new knowledge. Although these integrated representations are thought to result from linking separate memories to the same neuronal ensemble, the neural mechanisms that underlie formation of such linkages are not well understood. Here we examined whether self-derivation of new, integrated knowledge was supported by oscillatory coherence, a means of linking discrete neuronal ensembles. Cortical alpha coherence was greater when adults encoded new facts that could be integrated with existing knowledge, relative to encoding unrelated facts, particularly in participants who showed better performance on the subsequent test of knowledge generation via fact integration. In high performers, posterior alpha amplitude was also modulated by delta phase, a form of cross-frequency coupling previously implicated in coordinating information stored widely throughout the cortex. Examination of the timing and topography of these respective signatures suggested that these oscillatory dynamics work in concert to encode and represent new knowledge with respect to prior knowledge that is reactivated, thus revealing fundamental mechanisms through which related memories are linked into integrated knowledge structures.

Three-year reliability of MEG resting-state oscillatory power	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; Resting-State; ICC; Oscillations; Stability; Test-retest	TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; LONG-TERM STABILITY; BAND OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; EEG; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; SENSOR; FMRI; REGISTRATION; CONSISTENCY	Introduction: Resting-state oscillatory activity has been extensively studied across a wide array of disorders. Establishing which spectrally-and spatially-specific oscillatory components exhibit test-retest reliability is essential to move the field forward. While studies have shown short-term reliability of MEG resting-state activity, no studies have examined test-retest reliability across an extended period of time to establish the stability of these signals, which is critical for reproducibility. Methods: We examined 18 healthy adults age 23 -61 who completed three visits across three years. For each visit, participants completed both a resting state MEG and structural MRI scan. MEG data were source imaged, and the cortical power in canonical frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, low gamma, high gamma) was computed. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were then calculated across the cortex for each frequency band. Results: Over three years, power in the alpha and beta bands displayed the highest reliability estimates, while gamma showed the lowest estimates of three-year reliability. Spatially, delta, alpha, and beta all showed the highest degrees of reliability in the parietal cortex. Interestingly, the peak signal for each of these frequency bands was located outside of the parietal cortex, suggesting that reliability estimates were not solely dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio. Conclusion: Oscillatory resting-state power in parietal delta, posterior beta, and alpha across most of the cortex are reliable across three years and future MEEG studies may focus on these measures for the development of specific markers.

However, 40-Hz ASSR was not studied in relation to SHANK3 functioning. Here, we present a 15-year-old girl (SH01) with previously unreported duplication of the first seven exons of the SHANK3 gene (22q13.33). SH01's electroencephalogram (EEG) during 40-Hz click trains of 500 ms duration binaurally presented with inter-trial intervals of 500-800 ms were compared with those from typically developing children (n = 32). SH01 was diagnosed with mild mental retardation and learning disabilities (F70.88), dysgraphia, dyslexia, and smaller vocabulary than typically developing (TD) peers. Her clinical phenotype resembled the phenotype of previously described patients with 22q13.33 microduplications (approximate to 30 reported so far). SH01 had mild autistic symptoms but below the threshold for ASD diagnosis and microcephaly. No seizures or MRI abnormalities were reported. While SH01 had relatively preserved auditory event-related potential (ERP) with slightly attenuated P1, her 40-Hz ASSR was totally absent significantly deviating from TD's ASSR. The absence of 40-Hz ASSR in patients with microduplication, which affected the SHANK3 gene, indicates deficient temporal resolution of the auditory system, which might underlie language problems and represent a neurophysiological biomarker of SHANK3 abnormalities.

Due to the low-quality, large-amount, high-dimensionality characteristics of SEEG data, it is still challenging to comprehensively employ the SEEG signals to automatically and precisely determine the seizure onset zone (SOZ). This is because there is lack of an effective criterion for clinicians to select the target electrodes, which is of great importance for SOZ localization. Methods: We propose a SOZ localization method via analyzing the long-term SEEG monitoring for preoperative planning of epilepsy surgery. Considering that high frequency oscillations can reflect physiological brain activity of epileptic patients, we first extract the high-frequency features of the SEEG signals and utilize the convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect the interictal and seizure segments. Then we propose a novel criterion, namely adaptive high frequency epileptogenicity index (AHFEI), to determine the target electrodes. Results: We compare our SEEG-determined target electrodes with three preoperative planning of successful focal epilepsy resective surgery cases, finding that most localization results of our method are in consistent with clinical successful decision making, while the performance of our method outperforms than the state-of-the-art method for SOZ localization. Conclusion: Our SEEG-determined SOZ localization method can assist clinicians in preliminarily selecting the potential target electrodes according to long-term SEEG data automatically and effectively. Clinical Impact: The proposed automatic SOZ localization method has achieved satisfactory performance in the preliminary study, which has the great potential to be integrated into function-structure fused clinical decision-making system.

Magnetoencephalography was used to record the resting-state brain activity of healthy controls as well as patients with episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM). The source-based oscillatory dynamics of the pain-related cortical regions, which comprises 10 node regions (the bilateral primary [SI] and secondary somatosensory cortices, insula, medial frontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex [ACC]), were calculated to determine the intrinsic connectivity and node strength at 1 to 40 Hz. The total node strength within the pain-related cortical regions was smaller in the beta band in patients with migraine (70 EM and 80 CM) than in controls (n = 65). In the beta band, the node strength and functional connectivity values of patients with CM and patients with EM differed from those of controls in specific cortical areas, notably the left SI (EM < control) and bilateral ACC (CM < control); moreover, the node strength was lower in patients with CM than in those with EM. In all patients with migraine, negative correlations were observed between headache frequency and node strength in the bilateral ACC. In conclusion, migraine is characterized by reduced beta oscillatory connectivity within the pain-related cortical regions. Reduced beta connectivity in the ACC is linked to migraine chronification. Longitudinal studies should verify whether this oscillation change is a brain signature and a potential neuromodulation target for migraine.

Here we investigate nonlinear causal interactions between hippocampus and lateral PFC using intracranial EEG recordings (26 participants, 16 females) during verbal memory encoding and recall tasks. Direction-specific information theoretic analysis revealed higher causal information flow from the hippocampus to PFC than in the reverse direction. Crucially, this pattern was observed during both memory encoding and recall, and the strength of causal interactions was significantly greater during memory task performance than resting baseline. Further analyses revealed frequency specificity of interactions with greater causal information flow from hippocampus to the PFC in the delta-theta frequency band (0.5-8 Hz); in contrast, PFC to hippocampus causal information flow were stronger in the beta band (12-30 Hz). Across all hippocampus-PFC electrode pairs, propagation delay between the source and target signals was estimated to be 17.7 ms, which is physiologically meaningful and corresponds to directional signal interactions on a timescale consistent with monosynaptic influence. Our findings identify distinct asymmetric feedforward and feedback signaling mechanisms between the hippocampus and PFC and their dissociable roles in memory recall, demonstrate that these regions preferentially use different frequency channels, and provide novel insights into the electrophysiological basis of directed information flow during episodic memory formation in the human brain.

The administration of the opioid buprenorphine decreases motivational error signals	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Opioids; Buprenorphine; Error processing; Pe; Delta oscillations; Motivation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; NEGATIVITY; SYSTEM; THETA; DRUG; ERN; NEUROBIOLOGY; SENSITIVITY; MODULATION	While opioid addiction has reached pandemic proportions, we still lack a good understanding of how the administration of opioids interacts with cognitive functions. Error processing - the ability to detect erroneous actions and correct one's behaviour afterwards - is one such cognitive function that might be susceptible to opioidergic influences. Errors are hypothesised to induce aversive negative arousal, while opioids have been suggested to reduce aversive arousal induced by unpleasant and stressful stimuli. Thus, this study investigated whether the acute administration of an opioid would affect error processing. In a double-blind between-subject study, 42 male volunteers were recruited and received either 0.2 mg buprenorphine (a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and kappa-opioid receptor antagonist) or a placebo pill before they performed a stimulus-response task provoking errors. Electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded while participants performed the task. We observed no group differences in terms of reaction times, error rates, and affective state ratings during the task between buprenorphine and control participants. Additional measures of adaptive control, however, showed interfering effects of buprenorphine administration. On the neural level, decreased Pe (Error Positivity) amplitudes were found in buprenorphine compared to control participants following error commission. Further, frontal delta oscillations were decreased in the buprenorphine group after all responses. Our neural results jointly demonstrate a general reduction in error processing in those participants who received an opioid before task completion, thereby suggesting that opioids might have indeed the potential to dampen motivational error signals. Importantly, the effects of the opioid were evident in more elaborate error processing stages, thereby impacting on processes of conscious error appraisal and evidence accumulation.	[Pfabigan, D.

Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) is an essential paradigm of electroencephalogram based brain-computer interface (BCI). Previous studies in the BCI research field mostly focused on enhancing classification accuracy and reducing stimuli duration. This study, however, concentrated on increasing the number of available targets in the BCI systems without calibration. Approach. Motivated by the idea of multiple frequency sequential coding, we developed a calibration-free SSVEP-BCI system implementing 160 targets by four continuous sinusoidal stimuli that lasted four seconds in total. Taking advantage of the benchmark dataset of SSVEP-BCI, this study optimized an arrangement of stimuli sequences, maximizing the response distance between different stimuli. We proposed an effective classification algorithm based on filter bank canonical correlation analysis. To evaluate the performance of this system, we conducted offline and online experiments using cue-guided selection tasks. Eight subjects participated in the offline experiments, and 12 subjects participated in the online experiments with real-time feedbacks. Main results. Offline experiments indicated the feasibility of the stimulation selection and detection algorithms. Furthermore, the online system achieved an average accuracy of 87.16 +/- 11.46% and an information transfer rate of 78.84 +/- 15.59 bits min(-1). Specifically, seven of 12 subjects accomplished online experiments with accuracy higher than 90%. This study proposed an intact solution of applying numerous targets to SSVEP-based BCIs. Results of experiments confirmed the utility and efficiency of the system. Significance. This study firstly provides a calibration-free SSVEP-BCI speller system that enables more than 100 commands. This system could significantly expand the application scenario of SSVEP-based BCI. Meanwhile, the design criterion can hopefully enhance the overall performance of the BCI system.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of epilepsy	COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS			English	Review						Drug Resistant Epilepsy [physiopathology] [*therapy]; Electroencephalography; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; *Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation [adverse eGects]; Humans	FREQUENCY	Background Epilepsy is a highly prevalent neurological condition characterised by repeated unprovoked seizures with various aetiologies. Although antiepileptic medications produce clinical improvement in many individuals, nearly a third of individuals have drug-resistant epilepsy that carries significant morbidity and mortality, and even individuals who have clinical improvement from antiepileptic medications oFen report iatrogenic symptoms. There remains a need for non-invasive and more eGective therapies for this population. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses electromagnetic coils to excite or inhibit neurons, with repetitive pulses at low-frequency producing an inhibitory eGect that could conceivably reduce cortical excitability associated with epilepsy. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in 2016. Objectives To assess the evidence for the use of TMS in individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy compared with other available treatments in reducing seizure frequency, improving quality of life, reducing epileptiform discharges, antiepileptic medication use, and side eGects. Search methods For the latest update, we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE (Ovid 1946 to 2 June 2020). CRS Web includes randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the specialised registers of Cochrane Review Groups including Epilepsy. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials that were double-blinded, single-blinded, or unblinded, and placebo controlled, no treatment, or active controlled, which used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) without restriction of frequency, coil, duration or intensity on participants with drug-resistant epilepsy. Data collection and analysis We extracted information from each trial including methodological data; participant demographics including baseline seizure frequency, type of epileptic drugs taken; intervention details and intervention groups for comparison; potential biases; and outcomes and time points, primarily change in seizure frequency or responder rates, as well as quality of life and epileptiform discharges, adverse eGects, and changes in medication use. Main results The original search revealed 274 records from the databases that aFer selection provided seven full-text relevant studies for inclusion. The latest search identified 179 new records from the databases that aFer evaluation against the inclusion and exclusion criteria provided one additional full-text relevant study. The eight included studies (241 participants) were all randomised trials; seven of the studies were blinded. Methodological and design information in the included studies was unclear, particularly relating to randomisation and allocation concealment methods. We were not able to combine the results of the trials in analysis due to diGerences in the studies' designs. For the current update, two of the eight studies analysed showed a statistically significant reduction in seizure rate from baseline (72% and 78.9% reduction of seizures per week from the baseline rate, respectively), whilst the other six studies showed no statistically significant diGerence in seizure frequency following rTMS treatment compared with controls (low-certainty evidence). One study assessed quality of life and found that more participants showed improvement in quality of life scores with active treatments compared to the sham treatment, but this only involved seven participants (very low-certainty evidence). Four studies evaluated our secondary endpoint of mean number of epileptic discharges, three of which showed a statistically significant reduction in discharges aFer active rTMS treatment. Adverse eGects were uncommon in the studies and typically involved headache, dizziness, and tinnitus; however increased seizure frequency did occur in a small number of individuals. The included trials reported no significant changes in medication use. Overall the risk of bias was either low or unclear, and the certainty of the evidence was low to very low. Authors' conclusions Overall, we judged the certainty of evidence for the primary outcomes of this review to be low to very low. We found some evidence to suggest that rTMS is safe but some adverse events were experienced. The variability in technique and outcome reporting prevented meta-analysis, and the evidence for eGicacy of rTMS for seizure reduction is still lacking, despite reasonable evidence that it is eGective at reducing epileptiform discharges.

This study aims to explore the relationship between electroencephalography sensorimotor rhythm and motor impairment to provide reference for a BCI design. Twenty-eight stroke survivors with varying levels of motor dysfunction and spasticity status in the subacute or chronic stage were enrolled in the study to perform MA and MI tasks. Event-related desynchronization (ERD)/event-related synchronization (ERS) during and immediately after motor tasks were calculated. The Fugl-Meyer assessment scale (FMA) and the modified Ashworth scale (MAS) were applied to characterize upper-limb motor dysfunction and spasticity. There was a positive correlation between FMA total scores and ERS in the contralesional hemisphere in the MI task (P < .05) and negative correlations between FMA total scores and ERD in both hemispheres in the MA task (P < .05). Negative correlations were found between MAS scores of wrist flexors and ERD in the ipsilesional hemisphere (P < .05) in the MA task. It suggests that motor dysfunction may be more correlated to ERS in the MI task and to ERD in the MA task while spasticity may be more correlated to ERD in the MA task.

In this review, we focus on the electrophysiological auditory steady-state response (ASSR) driven by high-frequency stimulus trains as an index for disease-associated sensory processing deficits. The ASSR amplitude is suppressed within the gamma band (>= 30 Hz) among these patients, suggesting an imbalance between GABAergic and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated neurotransmission. The reduced power and synchronization of the 40-Hz ASSR are robust in patients with schizophrenia. In recent years, similar ASSR deficits at gamma frequencies have also been reported in patients with bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. We summarize ASSR abnormalities in each of these psychiatric disorders and suggest that the observed commonalities reflect shared pathophysiological mechanisms. We reviewed studies on phase resetting in which a salient sensory stimulus affects ASSR. Phase resetting induces the reduction of both the amplitude and phase of ASSR. Moreover, phase resetting is also affected by rare auditory stimulus patterns or superimposed stimuli of other modalities. Thus, sensory memory and multisensory integration can be investigated using phase resetting of ASSR. Here, we propose that ASSR amplitude, phase, and resetting responses are sensitive indices for investigating sensory processing dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.

However, little is known about the neural mechanisms by which different types of gestures affect learning. We conducted two experiments on the effects of gestures in video lectures that included an instructor and slides, with English vocabulary as the topic. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the instructor's gestures (beat gestures vs. pointing gestures vs. depictive gestures) on neural oscillations and learning performance. The electroencephalogram results showed that students had higher alpha power and higher beta power when the instructor used pointing gestures, suggesting lower sensorimotor involvement in processing. Pointing gestures produced lower learning performance than beat gestures and depictive gestures. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the instructor's pointing gestures and the richness of visual materials in video lectures. The results showed that the effectiveness of pointing gestures was moderated by the richness of the visual materials on the slide. Specifically, pointing gestures were more effective for complex versus simple learning materials. The findings suggest that electroencephalogram oscillations and learning performance vary with the type of gesture the instructor uses and the richness of visual materials in video lectures. This study has applied value for designing effective video lectures in many disciplines: (1) When a video lecture includes simple visual materials, a beat gesture and depictive gesture would be better; (2) when a video lecture includes complex visual materials, the instructor can produce pointing gestures to single out the learning content they are talking about. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Instructors commonly produce gestures while they teach, and their gestures and speech are tightly integrated. Instructors often use three types of gestures: beat gestures, pointing gestures and depictive gestures. Different types of gestures influence learning via different neural mechanisms. What this paper adds Students' alpha power and beta power had lower amplitudes when observing an instructor's beat gestures, compared to pointing and depictive gestures. Students showed higher learning performance after viewing the video lectures with the instructor's beat and depictive gestures. An instructor's pointing gestures facilitated learning performance primarily in video lectures with complex visual materials (CVM) rather than simple visual material (SVM). Implications for practice and/or policy When a video lecture includes SVM, the instructor is encouraged to produce beat gestures and depictive gestures rather than pointing gestures. When a video lecture includes CVM, the instructor is encouraged to produce pointing gestures to single out the learning content they are talking about.

Research into their neurobiological implementation has focused on two potential auditory filter strategies: the lateralization of alpha power and selective neural speech tracking. However, the functional interplay of the two neural filter strategies and their potency to index listening success in an ageing population remains unclear. Using electroencephalography and a dual-talker task in a representative sample of listeners (N=155; age=39-80 years), we here demonstrate an often-missed link from single-trial behavioural outcomes back to trial-by-trial changes in neural attentional filtering. First, we observe preserved attentional-cue-driven modulation of both neural filters across chronological age and hearing levels. Second, neural filter states vary independently of one another, demonstrating complementary neurobiological solutions of spatial selective attention. Stronger neural speech tracking but not alpha lateralization boosts trial-to-trial behavioural performance. Our results highlight the translational potential of neural speech tracking as an individualized neural marker of adaptive listening behaviour. Successful listening requires attentional filtering into behaviourally relevant and irrelevant sounds. Here, the authors demonstrate the role of neural speech tracking over alpha lateralization as a potential neural marker of an individual's adaptive listening behaviour.

A hidden Markov model reliably characterizes ketamine-induced spectral dynamics in macaque local field potentials and human electroencephalograms	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							CONSCIOUSNESS; SLEEP; PHARMACOLOGY; MECHANISMS; ANESTHESIA; SIGNATURES; DISCRETE; RHYTHMS	1 Author summary Monitoring brain activity during anesthesia can provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of how anesthetics elicit altered states of consciousness. Ketamine, a commonly used anesthetic, is known to cause short duration bursts of high frequency electrophysiological activity in the brain, but the neural mechanisms underlying this activity are not well understood. A key limitation in developing accurate models of the underlying mechanism is a lack of detailed knowledge of the dynamic structure and spectral properties of ketamine-induced oscillations. In this work, we address this limitation by developing a statistical framework to quantify ketamine-induced neural activity. Our framework is based on a hidden Markov model, which assumes that the neural activity switches among discrete states, each of which has its own distinctive probabilistic spectral representation. By estimating this versatile statistical model from electrophysiology data, we generated detailed descriptions of the dynamic properties and oscillatory signatures associated with ketamine-induced neurophysiological states in non-human primates and in human patients. Furthermore, we identified additional ketamine-induced states that have not yet been reported. In summary, our detailed quantitative descriptions of ketamine-induced spectra can aid further developments of neurophysiological mechanistic models of ketamine as well as biomarker discovery for clinical anesthesia monitoring. Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist commonly used to maintain general anesthesia. At anesthetic doses, ketamine causes high power gamma (25-50 Hz) oscillations alternating with slow-delta (0.1-4 Hz) oscillations. These dynamics are readily observed in local field potentials (LFPs) of non-human primates (NHPs) and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from human subjects. However, a detailed statistical analysis of these dynamics has not been reported. We characterize ketamine's neural dynamics using a hidden Markov model (HMM). The HMM observations are sequences of spectral power in seven canonical frequency bands between 0 to 50 Hz, where power is averaged within each band and scaled between 0 and 1. We model the observations as realizations of multivariate beta probability distributions that depend on a discrete-valued latent state process whose state transitions obey Markov dynamics. Using an expectation-maximization algorithm, we fit this beta-HMM to LFP recordings from 2 NHPs, and separately, to EEG recordings from 9 human subjects who received anesthetic doses of ketamine. Our beta-HMM framework provides a useful tool for experimental data analysis. Together, the estimated beta-HMM parameters and optimal state trajectory revealed an alternating pattern of states characterized primarily by gamma and slow-delta activities. The mean duration of the gamma activity was 2.2s([1.7,2.8]s) and 1.2s([0.9,1.5]s) for the two NHPs, and 2.5s([1.7,3.6]s) for the human subjects. The mean duration of the slow-delta activity was 1.6s([1.2,2.0]s) and 1.0s([0.8,1.2]s) for the two NHPs, and 1.8s([1.3,2.4]s) for the human subjects. Our characterizations of the alternating gamma slow-delta activities revealed five sub-states that show regular sequential transitions. These quantitative insights can inform the development of rhythm-generating neuronal circuit models that give mechanistic insights into this phenomenon and how ketamine produces altered states of arousal.

Previous reports showed important differences between men and women concerning basic perceptual tinnitus characteristics (i.e., laterality, frequency, tinnitus loudness) as well as psychological reactions linked to this condition. Therapeutic approaches based on acoustic stimulation involve processes beyond a pure masking effect and consist of sound presentation temporarily altering or alleviating tinnitus perception via residual and/or lateral inhibition mechanisms. Presented stimuli may include pure tones, noise, and music adjusted to or modulated to filter out tinnitus pitch and therefore trigger reparative functional and structural changes in the auditory system. Furthermore, recent findings suggest that in tonal tinnitus, the presentation of pitch-adjusted sounds which were altered by a 10Hz modulation of amplitude was more efficient than unmodulated stimulation. In this paper, we investigate sex differences in the outcome of different variants of acoustic stimulation, looking for factors revealing predictive value in the efficiency of tinnitus relief.

This however, contrasts with recent studies showing that conflict processing, a key component of executive functions that relies on ACC, remains relatively intact in SZ. The current study aimed to investigate this issue through two well-known electrophysiological signatures of conflict processing that have been suggested to originate from ACC, i.e., the N2 component of event-related potentials (ERPs) and frontal midline theta (FMO) oscillations. We recorded 64-channel scalp electroencephalography from 29 SZ (17 women; mean age: 30.4 years) and 31 healthy control subjects (HC; 17 women; mean age: 29.1 years) performing a modified flanker task. Behavioral data revealed no significant differences in flanker conflict effects (lower accuracy and longer reaction times in incongruent trials than in congruent trials) between HC and SZ. Trial-averaged ERP and spectral analysis suggested that both N2 and FMO were significantly impaired in SZ relative to HC. Furthermore, by sorting incongruent trials according to their reaction times within individual subjects, we found that the trial-by-trial modulation of N2 (larger amplitude and longer latency in slower trials) which was observed and localized in ACC for HC was totally absent for SZ. By contrast, the trial-by-trial modulation of FMO (larger power in slower trials) was observed and localized in ACC for both groups, despite a smaller magnitude in SZ, which suggested that FMO, not N2, might serve as the neural substrate of conflict processing in SZ. Taken together, our results enrich the current neurocognitive models of SZ by revealing dissociable neural responses between N2 and FMO during conflict processing in SZ.

Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials and Feature-based Attention: Preregistered Null Results and a Focused Review of Methodological Considerations	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review							FEATURE-SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PUBLICATION BIAS; TOP-DOWN; NEURAL RESPONSES; CUED SHIFTS; TIME-COURSE; SUPPRESSION; FACILITATION; MECHANISMS; STIMULUS	Feature-based attention is the ability to selectively attend to a particular feature (e.g., attend to red but not green items while looking for the ketchup bottle in your refrigerator), and steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) measured from the human EEG signal have been used to track the neural deployment of feature-based attention. Although many published studies suggest that we can use trial-by-trial cues to enhance relevant feature information (i.e., greater SSVEP response to the cued color), there is ongoing debate about whether participants may likewise use trial-by-trial cues to voluntarily ignore a particular feature. Here, we report the results of a preregistered study in which participants either were cued to attend or to ignore a color. Counter to prior work, we found no attention-related modulation of the SSVEP response in either cue condition. However, positive control analyses revealed that participants paid some degree of attention to the cued color (i.e., we observed a greater P300 component to targets in the attended vs. the unattended color). In light of these unexpected null results, we conducted a focused review of methodological considerations for studies of feature-based attention using SSVEPs. In the review, we quantify potentially important stimulus parameters that have been used in the past (e.g., stimulation frequency, trial counts) and we discuss the potential importance of these and other task factors (e.g., feature-based priming) for SSVEP studies.

Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is increasingly being used to explore functional mechanisms of the brain and induce the therapeutic modulation of behavior, cognition, and emotion. Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), a safe and well-tolerated NIBS technique, is capable of modulating activity in various cortical and subcortical areas involved in vestibular and multisensory processing. A key facet of GVS is that the resultant effects may, in part, be a function of the individual being treated and the stimulus waveform that is delivered. Yet, most GVS studies have utilized the same generic stimulus, chosen from a reduced repertoire of candidates, across all subjects. The future use and, ultimately, clinical adoption of this technology will rely on contributions from the signal processing community to customize stimuli that are optimized for their effect and to exert maximum influence on brain imaging biomarkers. We provide a signal processing-focused overview of the current GVS state of the art in neurorehabilitation, including general stimulation design, concurrent analysis with neuroimaging data, and suggestions for future directions.

Although there is growing consensus that temporal expectations enhance the speed and accuracy of perceptual decisions, it remains unclear whether they affect the decision process itself, or non-decisional (sensory/motor) processes. Here, healthy human participants (N=21; 18 female) used predictive auditory cues to anticipate the timing of low-contrast visual stimuli they were required to detect. Modeling of the behavioral data using a prominent sequential sampling model indicated that temporal expectations speeded up non-decisional processes but had no effect on decision formation. Electrophysiological recordings confirmed and extended this result: temporal expectations hastened the onset of a neural signature of decision formation but had no effect on its build-up rate. Anticipatory x band power was modulated by temporal expectation and co-varied with intrinsic trial-by-trial variability in behavioral and neural signatures of the onset latency of the decision process. These findings highlight how temporal predictions optimize our interaction with unfolding sensory events.

Throughout life, but most obviously in infancy, we learn without explicit instruction. We propose a detailed biological mechanism for the widely embraced idea that learning is driven by the differences between predictions and actual outcomes (i.e., predictive error-driven learning). Specifically, numerous weak projections into the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus generate top-down predictions, and sparse driver inputs from lower areas supply the actual outcome, originating in Layer 5 intrinsic bursting neurons. Thus, the outcome representation is only briefly activated, roughly every 100 msec (i.e., 10 Hz, alpha), resulting in a temporal difference error signal, which drives local synaptic changes throughout the neocortex. This results in a biologically plausible form of error backpropagation learning. We implemented these mechanisms in a large-scale model of the visual system and found that the simulated inferotemporal pathway learns to systematically categorize 3-D objects according to invariant shape properties, based solely on predictive learning from raw visual inputs. These categories match human judgments on the same stimuli and are consistent with neural representations in inferotemporal cortex in primates.

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of a thiol-ene/acrylate based microECoG (micro - electrocorticography, mu ECoG) device with 31 sputtered iridium oxide electrodes. Long-term electrochemical measurements provide firm evidence on the reliability of the novel layer structure and the related packaging method. In vivo impedance measurements indicated stable electrode yield (over 75%), without apparent signs of delamination or material degradation over 75 days. Awake recordings of theta oscillations with signal-to-noise ratio between 1.04 and 5.74 over this extended period also confirmed the applicability of the device. Chronic immune response characterized by Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein staining of astrocytes and fluorescent Nissl (NeuroTrace) staining of neurons revealed only modest foreign body reaction after 80 days of implantation. The study presents novel data that confirms the feasibility of softening polymer-based mu ECoG devices as chronically implantable neural interfaces.

Envelope reconstruction of speech and music highlights stronger tracking of speech at low frequencies	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; CORTICAL ENTRAINMENT; NEURONAL ENTRAINMENT; TEMPORAL CONTEXT; BEAT TRACKING; PERCEPTION; BRAIN; OSCILLATIONS; STATISTICS; MODULATION	The human brain tracks amplitude fluctuations of both speech and music, which reflects acoustic processing in addition to the encoding of higher-order features and one's cognitive state. Comparing neural tracking of speech and music envelopes can elucidate stimulus-general mechanisms, but direct comparisons are confounded by differences in their envelope spectra. Here, we use a novel method of frequency-constrained reconstruction of stimulus envelopes using EEG recorded during passive listening. We expected to see music reconstruction match speech in a narrow range of frequencies, but instead we found that speech was reconstructed better than music for all frequencies we examined. Additionally, models trained on all stimulus types performed as well or better than the stimulus-specific models at higher modulation frequencies, suggesting a common neural mechanism for tracking speech and music. However, speech envelope tracking at low frequencies, below 1 Hz, was associated with increased weighting over parietal channels, which was not present for the other stimuli. Our results highlight the importance of low-frequency speech tracking and suggest an origin from speech-specific processing in the brain.

The 8- to 12-Hz activity in the alpha band has long been a focus of this research, but our understanding of its links to cognitive mechanisms has been rapidly evolving recently. Here, we review and discuss the existing evidence for two competing perspectives about alpha activity. One view proposes that the suppression of alpha-band power following the onset of a stimulus array measures attentional selection. The competing view is that this same activity measures the buffering of the task-relevant representations in working memory. We conclude that alpha-band activity following the presentation of stimuli appears to be due to the operation of an attentional selection mechanism, with characteristics that mirror the classic views of attention as selecting both perceptual inputs and representations already stored in memory.

Although previous studies have acknowledged the importance of this top-down process, it was only recently that a growing interest was gained in exploring the underlying neural mechanism quantitatively. By utilizing the attentional blink (AB) effect, this study is aimed to identify the neural mechanism of brain states preceding T2 and predict its behavioral performance. Interarea phase synchronization and its role in prediction were explored using the phase-locking value and support vector machine classifiers. Our results showed that the phase coupling in alpha and beta frequency bands pre-T1 and during the T1-T2 interval could predict the detection of T2 in lag 3 with high accuracy. These findings indicated the important role of brain state before stimuli appear in predicting the behavioral performance in AB, thus, supporting the attention control theories.

Some of these studies have been reviewed, but only in combination with experiments conducted in young adults or with studies seeking to modify functions not related to cognition. The purpose of the present review is to assess whether neurofeedback interventions benefit cognition in elderly adults. We included all neurofeedback studies conducted in older adults, whether healthy or affected by a clinical condition, that attempted to ameliorate any domain of cognition, with no restrictions by publication date. Fourteen studies were eligible for this review. Neurofeedback improved memory in healthy and unhealthy participants mainly when the theta and sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) frequencies were trained. In addition, other cognitive domains benefited from this intervention. Conversely, neurofeedback had no effect on attention processes. Although different studies used markedly different methods, almost all of them reported positive effects of neurofeedback in at least one cognitive domain. New interventions under consideration should be tested using placebo-controlled, double-blind experimental designs with follow-up evaluations.

Glial Modulation of Electrical Rhythms in a Neuroglial Network Model of Epilepsy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Picture archiving and communication systems; Clocks; Biological system modeling; Hidden Markov models; Epilepsy; Brain modeling; Mathematical model; Phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling; cognitive rhythm generator; neuroglial network; epilepsy; postictal generalized EEG suppression; state classification; hidden markov model	OSCILLATIONS; MICROGLIA; DYNAMICS; PHASE; INSIGHTS; SIGNALS; ROLES; SLEEP	Objective: An important EEG-based biomarker for epilepsy is the phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling (PAC) of electrical rhythms; however, the underlying pathways of these pathologic markers are not always clear. Since glial cells have been shown to play an active role in neuroglial networks, it is likely that some of these PAC markers are modulated via glial effects. Methods: We developed a 4-unit hybrid model of a neuroglial network, consisting of 16 sub-units, that combines a mechanistic representation of neurons with an oscillator-based Cognitive Rhythm Generator (CRG) representation of glial cells-astrocytes and microglia. The model output was compared with recorded generalized tonic-clonic patient data, both in terms of PAC features, and state classification using an unsupervised hidden Markov model (HMM). Results: The neuroglial model output showed PAC features similar to those observed in epileptic seizures. These generated PAC features were able to accurately identify spontaneous epileptiform discharges (SEDs) as seizure-like states, as well as a postictal-like state following the long-duration SED, when applied to the HMM machine learning algorithm trained on patient data. The evolution profile of the maximal PAC during the SED compared well with patient data, showing similar association with the duration of the postictal state. Conclusion: The hybrid neuroglial network model was able to generate PAC features similar to those observed in ictal and postictal epileptic states, which has been used for state classification and postictal state duration prediction. Significance: Since PAC biomarkers are important for epilepsy research and postictal state duration has been linked with risk of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy, this model suggests glial synaptic effects as potential targets for further analysis and treatment.

However, how we retrieve real-life routine episodes and how the retrieval of these episodes changes with the passage of time remain unclear. Here, we asked participants to use a wearable camera that auto-matically captured pictures to record instances during a week of their routine life and implemented a deep neural network-based algorithm to identify picture sequences that represented episodic events. We then asked each participant to return to the lab to retrieve AMs for single episodes cued by the selected pictures 1 week, 2 weeks and 6-14 months after encoding while scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded. We found that participants were more accurate in recognizing pictured scenes depicting their own past than pictured scenes encoded in the lab, and that memory recollection of personally experienced events rapidly decreased with the passing of time. We also found that the retrieval of real-life picture cues elicited a strong and positive 'ERP old/new effect' over frontal regions and that the magnitude of this ERP effect was similar throughout memory tests over time. However, we observed that recognition memory induced a frontal theta power decrease and that this effect was mostly seen when memories were tested after 1 and 2 weeks but not after 6-14 months from encoding. Altogether, we discuss the implications for neuroscientific accounts of episodic retrieval and the potential benefits of developing individual-based AM exploration strategies at the clinical level.

J	Hsu, SM				Hsu, Shen-Mou			A neural-based account of sequential bias during perceptual judgment	PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW			English	Review						Sequential effect; Spectral power; Judgment bias; Context; Brain oscillation		Sequential effects are prominent and pervasive phenomena that exist in most perceptual judgments. Of importance, these effects reflect dynamic aspects in our judgment bias induced by the recent context. When making successive judgments in response to a sequence of stimuli, two opposing consequences have frequently been observed: assimilation effects - current stimuli judged as being closer to preceding stimuli than they actually are, and contrast effects - current stimuli judged as being further from preceding stimuli than they actually are. Although several cognitive accounts have been previously proposed, there is still a lack of consensus on the underlying mechanism, particularly regarding the insights of the temporal dynamics. Building upon accumulating human M/EEG findings, I propose a framework to explain how sequential bias is generated, unfolded over time, and eventually incorporated into the formation of current biased judgment. By bringing sequential effects closer to a biologically plausible framework, this synthetic view could account for how the opposing consequences of sequential effects differentially evolve, distinguish the effects from other perceptual phenomena with similar behavioral outcomes (such as aftereffects and priming), and illuminate how perceptual judgment is adaptively adjusted under the impact of temporal context.

Activity-Dependent TMS - Combination of Spatial and Temporal Information	PSYCHOLOGY-JOURNAL OF THE HIGHER SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS			Russian	Article						software; neuronavigation; activity-dependent stimulation; transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS); electromyography (EMG); latency	OSCILLATIONS	Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive method allowing both investigating and modulating human brain in normal and pathological conditions. One of the most serious problems limiting TMS use in research and clinical practice is the high variability of its effects. In recent years, it became widely accepted that the effects of TMS protocols is not just a property of a TMS protocol itself, but a consequence of the interactions of the intervention with the individual neuronal phenotype and ongoing functional state, which is primarily based on the ongoing neuronal activity. Thus, it is necessary to develop TMS approaches that take into account the ongoing neuronal activity, the so-called state/activity-dependent TMS. Here we present software that allows considering both the position of the magnetic stimulator and the ongoing biological activity for the purpose of TMS triggering. The software allows automatic TMS triggering when several conditions are met: the beginning of the movement/activation of a target muscle, lack of the preactivation of a non-target muscle and a correct positioning of a magnetic coil. The novelty of the developed neuronavigation software is due to a combination of spatial information about the position of a magnetic coil ("where?") and temporal information about the ongoing biological activity ("when?"). The time lag for the stimulation triggering was tested in an experiment with TMS triggered by a movement onset; and it was about 20 ms. Further software development is planned towards the introduction of EEG-dependent TMS approaches. The latency for TMS triggering was tested in an experiment with TMS triggered by a movement onset. In the future implementation of EEG-based TMS approaches is planned. We believe that the development of such a technical solution for neuronavigated activity-dependent TMS is important to bring TMS methodology to a new level of the spatio-temporal specificity.

These circuitry imbalances are commonly probed in adults using auditory steady-state responses (ASSR, driven at 40 Hz) to elicit coherent electrophysiological responses (EEG/MEG) from intact circuitry. Challenges to the ASSR methodology occur during development, where the optimal ASSR driving frequency may be unknown. An alternative approach (more agnostic to driving frequency) is the amplitude-modulated (AM) sweep in which the amplitude of a tone (with carrier frequency 500 Hz) is modulated as a sweep from 10 to 100 Hz over the course of similar to 15 s. Phase synchrony of evoked responses, measured via intra-trial coherence, is recorded (by EEG or MEG) as a function of frequency. We applied such AM sweep stimuli bilaterally to 40 typically developing and 80 children with ASD, aged 6-18 years. Diagnoses were confirmed by DSM-5 criteria as well as autism diagnostic observation schedule (ADOS) observational assessment. Stimuli were presented binaurally during MEG recording and consisted of 20 AM swept stimuli (500 Hz carrier; sweep 10-100 Hz up and down) with a duration of similar to 30 s each. Peak intra-trial coherence values and peak response frequencies of source modeled responses (auditory cortex) were examined. First, the phase synchrony or inter-trial coherence (ITC) of the ASSR is diminished in ASD; second, hemispheric bias in the ASSR, observed in typical development (TD), is maintained in ASD, and third, that the frequency at which the peak response is obtained varies on an individual basis, in part dependent on age, and with altered developmental trajectories in ASD vs. TD. Finally, there appears an association between auditory steady-state phase synchrony (taken as a proxy of neuronal circuitry integrity) and clinical assessment of language ability/impairment. We concluded that (1) the AM sweep stimulus provides a mechanism for probing ASSR in an unbiased fashion, during developmental maturation of peak response frequency, (2) peak frequencies vary, in part due to developmental age, and importantly, (3) ITC at this peak frequency is diminished in ASD, with the degree of ITC disturbance related to clinically assessed language impairment.

We describe normative values for sleep macrostructure and sleep spindles at 4-5 months of age. Methods: Healthy term infants were recruited at birth and had daytime sleep electroencephalograms (EEGs) at 4-5 months. Sleep staging was performed and five features were analyzed. Sleep spindles were annotated and seven quantitative features were extracted. Features were analyzed across sex, recording time (am/pm), infant age, and from first to second sleep cycles. Results: We analyzed sleep recordings from 91 infants, 41% females. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) macrostructure results: sleep duration 49.0 (37.8-72.0) min (n = 77); first sleep cycle duration 42.8 (37.0-51.4) min; rapid eye movement (REM) percentage 17.4 (9.5-27.7)% (n = 68); latency to REM 36.0 (30.5-41.1) min (n = 66). First cycle median (IQR) values for spindle features: number 241.0 (193.0-286.5), density 6.6 (5.7-8.0) spindles/min (n = 77); mean frequency 13.0 (12.8-13.3) Hz, mean duration 2.9 (2.6-3.6) s, spectral power 7.8 (4.7-11.4) mu V-2, brain symmetry index 0.20 (0.16-0.29), synchrony 59.5 (53.2-63.8)% (n = 91). In males, spindle spectral power (mu V-2) was 24.5% lower (p = .032) and brain symmetry index 24.2% higher than females (p = .011) when controlling for gestational and postnatal age and timing of the nap. We found no other significant associations between studied sleep features and sex, recording time (am/pm), or age. Spectral power decreased (p < .001) on the second cycle. Conclusion: This normative data may be useful for comparison with future studies of sleep dysfunction and atypical neurodevelopment in infancy.

While frontal midline theta activity is theorized to be a general marker of the need for cognitive control, a stringent test of this hypothesis would require a quantitative, within-subject comparison of the neural activation patterns indexing many different cognitive control strategies, an experiment lacking in the current literature. We recorded EEG from 176 participants as they performed tasks that tested inhibitory control (Go/Nogo Task), proactive and reactive control (AX-Continuous Performance Task), and resolving response conflict (Global/Local Task-modified Flanker Task). As activity in the theta (4-8 Hz) frequency band is thought to be a common signature of cognitive control, we assessed frontal midline theta activation underlying each cognitive control strategy. In all strategies, we found higher frontal midline theta power for trials that required more cognitive control (target conditions) versus control conditions. Additionally, reactive control and inhibitory control had higher theta power than proactive control and response conflict, and proactive control had higher theta power than response conflict. Using decoding analyses, we were able to successfully decode control from target trials using classifiers trained exclusively on each of the other strategies, thus firmly demonstrating that theta representations of cognitive control generalize across multiple cognitive control strategies. Our results confirm that frontal midline theta-band activity is a common mechanism for initiating and executing cognitive control, but theta power also differentiates between cognitive control mechanisms. As theta activation reliably differs depending on the cognitive control strategy employed, future work will need to focus on the differential role of theta in differing cognitive control strategies.

While enhanced phase-amplitude coupling has been proposed as a biomarker of Parkinson's disease, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the abnormal coupling and its relationship to motor impairments in Parkinson's disease remain unclear. To address these issues, we performed an in-depth analysis of high-density EEG recordings at rest in 19 patients with Parkinson's disease and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. EEG signals were projected onto the individual cortical surfaces using source reconstruction techniques and separated into spatiotemporal components using independent component analysis. Compared to healthy controls, phase-amplitude coupling of Parkinson's disease patients was enhanced in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, premotor cortex, primary motor cortex and somatosensory cortex, the difference being statistically significant in the hemisphere contralateral to the clinically more affected side. beta and gamma signals involved in generating abnormal phase-amplitude coupling were not strictly phase-phase coupled, ruling out that phase-amplitude coupling merely reflects the abnormal activity of a single oscillator in a recurrent network. We found important differences for couplings between the beta and gamma signals from identical components as opposed to those from different components (originating from distinct spatial locations). While both couplings were abnormally enhanced in patients, only the latter were correlated with clinical motor severity as indexed by part III of the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Correlations with parkinsonian motor symptoms of such inter-component couplings were found in premotor, primary motor and somatosensory cortex, but not in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, suggesting motor domain specificity. The topography of phase-amplitude coupling demonstrated profound differences in patients compared to controls. These findings suggest, first, that enhanced phase-amplitude coupling in Parkinson's disease patients originates from the coupling between distinct neural networks in several brain regions involved in motor control. Because these regions included the somatosensory cortex, abnormal phase-amplitude coupling is not exclusively tied to the hyperdirect tract connecting cortical regions monosynaptically with the subthalamic nucleus. Second, only the coupling between beta and gamma signals from different components appears to have pathophysiological significance, suggesting that therapeutic approaches breaking the abnormal lateral coupling between neuronal circuits may be more promising than targeting phase-amplitude coupling per se.

Methods: We used a large set of intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings with DES from 45 subjects with electrodes implanted both subdurally on the cortical surface and subcortically into the brain parenchyma. Subjects were stimulated in blocks of alternating frequency and amplitude parameters during quiet wakefulness. Results: Stimulating at different frequencies and amplitudes of electric current revealed a persistent pattern of response in the slow and the fast neural activities. In particular, amplification of the theta (4-7 Hz) and attenuation of the gamma (29-52 Hz) power-in-band was observed with increasing the stimulation parameters. This opposite effect on the low and high frequency bands was found across a network of selected local and distal sites proportionally to the proximity and magnitude of the electric current. Power increase in the theta and decrease in the gamma band was driven by the total electric charge delivered with either increasing the frequency or amplitude of the stimulation current. This inverse effect on the theta and gamma activities was consistently observed in response to different stimulation frequencies and amplitudes. Conclusion: Our results suggest a uniform DES effect of amplifying theta and suppressing gamma neural activities in the human brain. Significance: These findings reveal the utility of simple power-in-band features for understanding and optimizing the effects of electrical stimulation on brain functions.

J	Heidlmayr, K; Ferragne, E; Isel, F				Heidlmayr, Karin; Ferragne, Emmanuel; Isel, Frederic			Neuroplasticity in the phonological system: The PMN and the N400 as markers for the perception of non-native phonemic contrasts by late second language learners	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Second language acquisition; Neuroplasticity; Phonology; Semantic unification; PMN; N400	SPEECH-PERCEPTION; SELECTIVE-ATTENTION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; BAND OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; AMERICAN ENGLISH; 1ST LANGUAGE; ERP EVIDENCE; DYNAMICS; REPRESENTATION	Second language (L2) learners frequently encounter persistent difficulty in perceiving certain non-native sound contrasts, i.e., a phenomenon called ?phonological deafness?. However, if extensive L2 experience leads to neuroplastic changes in the phonological system, then the capacity to discriminate non-native phonemic contrasts should progressively improve. Such perceptual changes should be attested by modifications at the neurophysiological level. We designed an EEG experiment in which the listeners? perceptual capacities to discriminate second language phonemic contrasts influence the processing of lexical-semantic violations. Semantic congruency of critical words in a sentence context was driven by a phonemic contrast that was unique to the L2, English (e.g.,/?/-/i:/, ship ? sheep). Twenty-eight young adult native speakers of French with intermediate proficiency in English listened to sentences that contained either a semantically congruent or incongruent critical word (e.g., The anchor of the ship/*sheep was let down) while EEG was recorded. Three ERP effects were found to relate to increasing L2 proficiency: (1) a left frontal auditory N100 effect, (2) a smaller fronto-central phonological mismatch negativity (PMN) effect and (3) a semantic N400 effect. No effect of proficiency was found on oscillatory markers. The current findings suggest that neuronal plasticity in the human brain allows for the late acquisition of even hard-wired linguistic features such as the discrimination of phonemic contrasts in a second language. This is the first time that behavioral and neurophysiological evidence for the critical role of neural plasticity underlying L2 phonological processing and its interdependence with semantic processing has been provided. Our data strongly support the idea that pieces of information from different levels of linguistic processing (e.g., phonological, semantic) strongly interact and influence each other during online language processing.

Methods: Clinical data and 70 EEGs of 12 patients (5 intdup15, 7 idic15), followed from 4.5 m.o to 17y4m (median follow-up 8y3m), were retrospectively reviewed. EEGs were analyzed visually and using power spectrum analysis. Results: Seventy video-EEGs were analyzed (1-16 per patient, median 6), follow-up lasting up to 8y10m (median 4y2m): 25 EEGs in intdup15 (8 m.o to 12y.o, median 4y6m) and 45 EEGs in idic15 (7 m.o to 12 y. o, median 15 m). Epilepsy: 6 West syndrome (WS) (2intdup15, 4idic15); 4 Lennox-Gastaut syndromes (LGS) (1 intdup15, 3 idic15), 2 evolving from WS; focal epilepsy (3 intdup15). In idic15, WS displayed additional myoclonic seizures (3), atypical (4) or no hypsarrhythmia (2) and posterior predominant spike and polyspike bursts (4). Beta-band rapid-rhythms (RR): present in 11 patients, power decreased during non-REM-sleep, localization shifted from diffuse to anterior, peak frequency increased with age. Conclusion: WS with peculiar electro-clinical features and LGS, along with beta-band RR decreasing in non-REM-sleep and shifting from diffuse to anterior localization with age are recognizable features pointing towards dup15q diagnosis in children with autism spectrum disorder and developmental delay. Significance: This study describes electroclinical features in both interstitial and isodicentric duplications of chromosome 15q, in epileptic children, including some recent extensions regarding sleep features; and illustrates how the temporo-spatial organization of beta oscillations can be of significant help in directing towards dup15q diagnosis hypothesis.

The aesthetic evaluation of music is strongly dependent on the listener and reflects manifold brain processes that go well beyond the perception of incident sound. Being a high-level cognitive reaction, it is difficult to predict merely from the acoustic features of the audio signal and this poses serious challenges to contemporary music recommendation systems. We attempted to decode music appraisal from brain activity, recorded via wearable EEG, during music listening. Approach. To comply with the dynamic nature of music stimuli, cross-frequency coupling measurements were employed in a time-evolving manner to capture the evolving interactions between distinct brain-rhythms during music listening. Brain response to music was first represented as a continuous flow of functional couplings referring to both regional and inter-regional brain dynamics and then modelled as an ensemble of time-varying (sub)networks. Dynamic graph centrality measures were derived, next, as the final feature-engineering step and, lastly, a support-vector machine was trained to decode the subjective music appraisal. A carefully designed experimental paradigm provided the labeled brain signals. Main results. Using data from 20 subjects, dynamic programming to tailor the decoder to each subject individually and cross-validation, we demonstrated highly satisfactory performance (MAE = 0.948, R-2 = 0.63) that can be attributed, mostly, to interactions of left frontal gamma rhythm. In addition, our music-appraisal decoder was also employed in a part of the DEAP dataset with similar success. Finally, even a generic version of the decoder (common for all subjects) was found to perform sufficiently. Significance. A novel brain signal decoding scheme was introduced and validated empirically on suitable experimental data. It requires simple operations and leaves room for real-time implementation. Both the code and the experimental data are publicly available.

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) decode information from neural activity and send it to external devices. The use of Deep Learning approaches for decoding allows for automatic feature engineering within the specific decoding task. Physiologically plausible interpretation of the network parameters ensures the robustness of the learned decision rules and opens the exciting opportunity for automatic knowledge discovery. Approach. We describe a compact convolutional network-based architecture for adaptive decoding of electrocorticographic (ECoG) data into finger kinematics. We also propose a novel theoretically justified approach to interpreting the spatial and temporal weights in the architectures that combine adaptation in both space and time. The obtained spatial and frequency patterns characterizing the neuronal populations pivotal to the specific decoding task can then be interpreted by fitting appropriate spatial and dynamical models. Main results. We first tested our solution using realistic Monte-Carlo simulations. Then, when applied to the ECoG data from Berlin BCI competition IV dataset, our architecture performed comparably to the competition winners without requiring explicit feature engineering. Using the proposed approach to the network weights interpretation we could unravel the spatial and the spectral patterns of the neuronal processes underlying the successful decoding of finger kinematics from an ECoG dataset. Finally we have also applied the entire pipeline to the analysis of a 32-channel EEG motor-imagery dataset and observed physiologically plausible patterns specific to the task. Significance. We described a compact and interpretable CNN architecture derived from the basic principles and encompassing the knowledge in the field of neural electrophysiology. For the first time in the context of such multibranch architectures with factorized spatial and temporal processing we presented theoretically justified weights interpretation rules. We verified our recipes using simulations and real data and demonstrated that the proposed solution offers a good decoder and a tool for investigating motor control neural mechanisms.

Over a long period of time, many people have been fascinated by the question of how creativity emerges in our brain and how it can be enhanced. Recently, a growing number of studies have revealed that some types of environmental stimuli can enhance human creativity. Further, specific temporal dynamics of cognitive processes are crucial for generating creative ideas. However, how the temporal dynamics of creativity are influenced by the environment remains unclear. Through a literature review of neural and psychological research, this study aimed to elucidate the environmental settings that enhance cognitive performance. We found that each stage of the temporal dynamics of creativity may be differently correlated with neural function. Further, environmental factors may have various, and sometimes contrasting, effects on the temporal dynamics of creativity. We propose a hypothesis that the optimal environmental condition varies depending on the stages of temporal dynamics since each stage requires different cognitive processes. However, there is a need for future studies to elucidate how creativity is modulated by social conditions and the physical environment as well as whether there are differences in the ideal environment for individual and group creativity. Nonetheless, this is the first study to clarify the influence of environmental settings on the temporal dynamics of creativity from the perspective of neuroscience and psychology.

However, there aren't studies that compare the cortical responses of the time estimate between these groups. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the influence of the level of physical activity in time estimation and beta band activity in frontal regions, specifically in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex during the task of estimating time in practitioners and non-practitioners of physical activity. After characterizing the sample, the signal was captured using an electroencephalogram during a task to estimate the time of four intervals of supraseconds. The results indicated that the practitioners of physical activity had lower errors in the evaluation of time for the intervals of 1 s, 7 s, and 9 s. The beta band showed less activity among practitioners of physical activity. The correlation between task performance and the absolute power of the beta band proved to be positive in the task of estimating time in the 7 s, and 9 s intervals. It was concluded that participants involved in the regular practice of physical activity showed underestimation in the temporal judgment and lower absolute power of the beta band during the time estimate.

Blockade of the presynaptic H3 receptors activates the downstream pathway(s) involved in the processes of learning and memory, making it a potential therapeutic option for ameliorating cognitive dysfunction. Samelisant (SUVN-G3031) is a potent and selective inverse agonist at the H3 receptors. Aim: The aim of this research is to study the effects of Samelisant in diverse animal models of cognitive functions. Methods: The effects of Samelisant on cognitive functions were studied using social recognition, object recognition and Morris water maze tasks. Neurochemical and electrophysiological effects of Samelisant were monitored using microdialysis and electroencephalography techniques. Results: Samelisant showed procognitive effects in diverse animal models of cognition at doses ranging from 0.3 to 3 mg/kg, per os (p.o.) (social recognition and object recognition task). Samelisant significantly increased the brain acetylcholine levels in the cortex at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg, p.o. In the Morris water maze task, combined administration of suboptimal doses of Samelisant and donepezil resulted in procognitive effects significantly larger than the either treatment. Similarly, Samelisant significantly potentiated the effects of donepezil on pharmacodynamic biomarkers of cognition i.e. acetylcholine levels in brain and neuronal theta oscillations. Conclusion: Samelisant may have potential utility in the treatment of cognitive deficits associated with hypocholinergic state.

The circuit of ANT and hippocampus has been widely demonstrated to be associated with memory function. Both lesions to each region and disrupting inter-regional information flow can induce working memory impairment. However, the role of this circuit in working memory precision remains unknown. Objective: To test the role of the hippocampal-anterior thalamic pathway in working memory precision, we delivered intracranially electrical stimulation to the ANT. We hypothesize that ANT stimulation can improve working memory precision. Methods: Presurgical epilepsy patients with depth electrodes in ANT and hippocampus were recruited to perform a color-recall working memory task. Participants were instructed to point out the color they were supposed to recall by clicking a point on the color wheel, while the intracranial EEG data were synchronously recorded. For randomly selected half trials, a bipolar electrical stimulation was delivered to the ANT electrodes. Results: We found that compared to non-stimulation trials, working memory precision judgements were significantly improved for stimulation trials. ANT electrical stimulation significantly increased spectral power of gamma (30-100 Hz) oscillations and decreased interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) in the hippocampus. Moreover, the increased gamma power during the pre-stimulus and retrieval period predicted the improvement of working memory precision judgements. Conclusion: ANT electrical stimulation can improve working memory precision judgements and modulate hippocampal gamma activity, providing direct evidence on the role of the human hippocampalanterior thalamic axis in working memory precision.

J	Zhang, YH; Lu, YZ; Wang, DD; Zhou, CL; Xu, C				Zhang, Yanhui; Lu, Yingzhi; Wang, Dandan; Zhou, Chenglin; Xu, Chang			Relationship between individual alpha peak frequency and attentional performance in a multiple object tracking task among ice-hockey players	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EEG ALPHA; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; OSCILLATIONS; SPEED; TIME	Individual alpha peak frequency (IAPF), the discrete frequency with the highest power value in the alpha oscillation range of the electroencephalogram, is a stable neurophysiological marker and is closely associated with various cognitive functions, including aspects of attention and working memory. However, the relationship between IAPF and attentional performance as well as the effects of engaging attention on IAPF are unknow. Here, we examined whether IAPF values were associated with attentional performance by evaluating accuracy during the performance of a multiple object tracking (MOT) task, a well-established paradigm for investigating goal-driven attention in dynamic environments, and whether engagement in the task affected IAPF values. In total, 18 elite players and 20 intermediate players completed the study. Resting electroencephalogram recordings were obtained for 120 s while players kept their eyes open and an additional 120 s while players' eyes were closed, before and again after performing the MOT task. Tracking accuracy in the MOT task and IAPF values before and after the MOT task were analyzed. As expected, tracking accuracies were higher in elite players than in intermediate-level players. Baseline IAPF values were significantly and positively correlated with the accuracy of target tracking in the MOT task. IAPF values were higher in elite than intermediate players in both the eyes open and closed conditions and both before and after MOT task performance. Interindividual IAPF values did not differ before and after the MOT task. These findings indicate that IAPF is a stable marker, without intraindividual changes associated with engagement in the MOT task. Elite players had higher IAPF values and exhibited more accurate MOT performance than intermediate-level players; thus, baseline IAPF values may be useful to predict attentional performance in the MOT task among athletes.

Common neural processes during action-stopping and infrequent stimulus detection: The frontocentral P3 as an index of generic motor inhibition	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Motor inhibition; Infrequency detection; Action-stopping; Frontocentral P3; Event-related potentials	RESPONSE-INHIBITION; FUNCTIONAL-SIGNIFICANCE; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; ATTENTION-DEFICIT; UNEXPECTED EVENTS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; ODDBALL PARADIGM; REACTION-TIME; EEG DYNAMICS	The stop-signal task (SST) is used to study action-stopping in the laboratory. In SSTs, the P3 event-related potential following stop-signals is considered to be a neural index of motor inhibition. However, a similar P3 deflection is often observed following infrequent events in non-inhibition tasks. Moreover, within SSTs, stopsignals are indeed infrequent events, presenting a systematic confound that hampers the interpretation of the stop-signal P3 (and other candidate neural indices of motor inhibition). Therefore, we performed two studies to test whether the stop-signal P3 is uniquely related to motor inhibition or reflects infrequency detection. In Study 1, participants completed the SST and a visually identical change-detection task requiring the detection of a taskrelevant, frequent signal (but not motor inhibition). We observed a P3 associated with motor inhibition in the SST, but no such positivity in the change-detection task. In Study 2, we modified the change-detection task. Some task-relevant events were now infrequent, matching the frequency of stop-signals in the SST. These events indeed evoked a P3, though of smaller amplitude than the P3 in the SST. Independent component analysis suggested that stop-signal P3 and infrequency-P3 ERPs were non-independent and shared a common neural generator. Further analyses suggested that this common neural process likely reflects motor inhibition in both tasks: infrequent events in the change-detection task lead to a non-instructed, incidental slowing of motor responding, the degree of which was strongly correlated with P3 amplitude. These results have wide-reaching implications for the interpretation of neural signals in both stop-signal and infrequency/oddball-tasks.

From a frequentist perspective of the classic oddball paradigm, deviant stimuli are unexpected because of their low probability. However, the amount of PE elicited by a stimulus can be dissociated from its probability of occurrence: when the observer cannot make confident predictions, any event holds little surprise value, no matter how improbable. Here we tested the hypothesis that the magnitude of the neural response elicited to an improbable sound (D) would scale with the precision of the prediction derived from the repetition of another sound (S), by manipulating repetition stability. We recorded the Electroencephalogram (EEG) from 20 participants while passively listening to 4 types of isochronous pure tone sequences differing in the probability of the S tone (880 Hz) while holding constant the probability of the D tone [1,046 Hz; p(D) = 1/11]: Oddball [p(S) = 10/11]; High confidence (7/11); Low confidence (4/11); and Random (1/11). Tones of 9 different frequencies were equiprobably presented as fillers [p(S) + p(D) + p(F) = 1]. Using a mass-univariate non-parametric, cluster-based correlation analysis controlling for multiple comparisons, we found that the amplitude of the deviant-elicited ERP became more negative with increasing S probability, in a time-electrode window consistent with the MMN (ca. 120-200 ms; frontal), suggesting that the strength of a PE elicited to an improbable event indeed increases with the precision of the predictive model.

J	Tokimoto, S; Miyaoka, Y; Tokimoto, N				Tokimoto, Shingo; Miyaoka, Yayoi; Tokimoto, Naoko			An EEG Analysis of Honorification in Japanese: Human Hierarchical Relationships Coded in Language	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Japanese honorification; social cognition; human relationship; event; related potential; event-related spectral perturbation; N400; dipole fitting; independent component clustering	ERP EVIDENCE; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PERSPECTIVE-TAKING; BRAIN POTENTIALS; WORLD KNOWLEDGE; CONTEXT; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION; AGREEMENT	This study examines the neural substrate of the understanding of human relationships in verbal communication with Japanese honorific sentences as experimental materials. We manipulated two types of Japanese verbs specifically used to represent respect for others, i.e., exalted and humble verbs, which represent respect for the person in the subject and the person in the object, respectively. We visually presented appropriate and anomalous sentences containing the two types of verbs and analyzed the electroencephalogram elicited by the verbs. We observed significant parietal negativity at a latency of approximately 400 ms for anomalous verbs compared with appropriate verbs. This parietal negativity could be a manifestation of the pragmatic process used to integrate the linguistic forms with the human relationships represented in the sentences. The topographies of these event-related potentials (ERPs) corresponded well with those of ERPs for two second-person pronouns in Chinese (plain ni and respectful nin). This correspondence suggests that the pragmatic integration process in honorific expressions is cross-linguistically common in part. Furthermore, we assessed the source localization by means of independent component (IC) analysis and dipole fitting and observed a significant difference in ERP between the honorific and control sentences in the IC cluster centered in the precentral gyrus and in the cluster centered in the medial part of the occipital lobe, which corresponded well with the functional magnetic resonance imaging findings for Japanese honorification. We also found several significant differences in the time-frequency analyses for the medial occipital cluster. These significant differences in the medial occipital cluster suggested that the circuit of the theory of mind was involved in the processing of Japanese honorification. Our results suggest that pragmatic and syntactic processing are performed in parallel because the person to be respected must fulfill the grammatical function appropriate for the honorific verb.

Since the publication of the first hyperscanning study in 2002, it has developed rapidly in the past decade. Brain-to-brain coupling (BBC) technology of human interaction was widely used in the research of action coordination, cooperative game, classroom teaching and other interactive tasks, which involved the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and other neuroimaging technologies. In addition, hyperscanning research experienced a leap from pseudo-interaction to real interaction, a leap from a strictly controlled laboratory paradigm to the "field research" paradigm in nature situations. Based on the differentiation and analysis of the core concepts such as coupling and synchronization, taking the development of time and technology as the main line, this paper reviewed the common BBC indicators and their application conditions, introduced the related theories and forecasted the future research direction of BBC. In hyperscanning study, BBC refers to the interaction and influence of two or more brains, or between two or more brain regions within a single brain, while the inter-brain synchronization (IBS) refers to the consistency (relative stability) in frequency, phase, and other characteristics of signals from different brain or different regions of the brain. Thus, the similarities and differences between hyperscanning, BBC and IBS can be summarized as follows: Hyperscanning is the technique of recording the neural activity of two or more brains simultaneously. BBC refers to the interaction or interaction between two or more brains. BBC sometimes manifests as IBS, the degree of IBS can represent the strength of BBC in this case, but BBC is not the same as IBS: (1) In addition to IBS, BBC can also be manifested as functional connections and interactions between the brains; (2) due to the possibility of pseudo-synchronization, the occurrence of IBS does not mean that there must be BBC. In the field of physics and electronic engineering, the characteristics of a signal can be described by multiple indicators such as amplitude, period, frequency and phase. Accordingly, neurologic studies have found that brain activity induced by external events may take the form of phase response, frequency response, amplitude response, and production of new components. Therefore, it is not surprising that many different indicators are used to characterize the strength of BBC in existing hyperscanning studies. These indicators including the circular correlation coefficient (CCorr), wavelet transform coherence (WTC), directed coherence, phase-locking value (PLV), the coupling indexes based on the event-related potentials (ERP) such as the latency difference and the amplitude difference, the coupling indexes based on the Graph Theory such as the shortest path length, global efficiency, local efficiency, divisibility, modularity, small-word network. Through the review, we found the following three issues deserve the attention of the future hyperscanning research. Firstly, as different coupling indicators have different characteristics and applicable conditions, we suggest that the selection of indicators should be based on specific research methods, technical equipment and research problems. There are no best indicators, only the most suitable ones. Secondly, the existing theory of BBC is not complete, integrating existing theories and proposing theories with stronger explanatory power should be the focus of future hyperscanning theory research. Thirdly, there are many forms of coupling in neural processing, and the meaning of coupling is different in different forms. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the comprehensive consideration of the specific research task type, interactive mode and other factors when discussing the significance of coupling.

Stratified sampling was conducted in different altitude 133 active-duty soldiers who were stationed in Weinan (347 m, n = 34), Nyingchi (2,950 m, n = 32), Lhasa (3,860 m, n = 33), and Nagqu (4,890 m, n = 34) for 2 years. The Go/NoGo paradigm with event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related oscillations (EROs) was used to explore the time and neural oscillation courses of response inhibition. Behavioral results revealed that at the 4,890-m altitude area, the soldiers had the highest false alarm rate, the longest reaction time, and the slowest information transmission rate. The electrophysiological results revealed that NoGo-N2 and N2d decreased with increasing altitude, with significant changes at 3,860 m; the amplitudes of NoGo-P3 and P3d in plateau groups were significantly more negative than the plain and changed significantly at 2,950 m. The results of correlation analysis showed that NoGo-P3 was negatively correlated with altitude (r = -0.358, p = 0.000), positively correlated with SpO(2) (r = 0.197, p = 0.041) and information translation rate (ITR) (r = 0.202, p = 0.036). P3d was negatively correlated with altitude (r = -0.276, p = 0.004) and positively correlated with ITR (r = 0.228, p = 0.018). N2d was negatively correlated with ITR (r = 0.204, p = 0.034). The power spectrum analysis of NoGo-N2 and NoGo-P3 showed that the power of delta and theta bands at the plateau area was significantly lower than the plain area and showed a significant step-by-step decrease; the alpha-band power increases significantly only in the area of 4,890 m. The effect of chronic hypoxia exposure at different altitudes of the plateau on the response inhibition of soldiers was manifested: 3,860 m was the altitude at which the brain response inhibition function decreased during the conflict monitoring stage, and 2,950 m was the altitude at which it dropped during the response inhibition stage. In addition, the soldier's brain's executive function was closely related to SpO(2), and a reduction in SpO(2) may lead to a decline in response inhibition.

Effects of Midfrontal Brain Stimulation on Sustained Attention	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE ENHANCEMENT			English	Article						Vigilance; Sustained attention; Prefrontal cortex; tDCS; tACS	MENTAL FATIGUE; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; THETA ACTIVITY; FRONTAL THETA; VIGILANCE; PERFORMANCE; MOTIVATION; CORTEX; TDCS; EEG	Sustained attention is defined as the ability to maintain attention over longer periods of time, which typically declines with time on task (i.e., the vigilance decrement). Previous studies have suggested an important role for the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in sustained attention. In two experiments, we aimed to enhance sustained attention by applying transcranial electrical current stimulation over the mPFC during a sustained attention task. In the first experiment, we applied transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in a between-subject design (n = 97): participants received either anodal, cathodal, or sham stimulation. Contrary to our prediction, we found no effect of stimulation on the vigilance decrement. In the second experiment, participants received theta and alpha transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in two separate sessions (n = 47, within-subject design). Here, we found a frequency-dependent effect on the vigilance decrement, such that contrary to our expectation, participants' performance over time became worse after theta compared with alpha stimulation. However, this result needs to be interpreted with caution given that this effect could be driven by differential side effects between the two stimulation frequencies. To conclude, across two studies, we were not able to reduce the vigilant decrement using tDCS or theta tACS.

J	Dasgupta, A; Routray, A				Dasgupta, Anirban; Routray, Aurobinda			Piecewise empirical mode Bayesian estimation-A new method to denoise electrooculograms	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						EOG; Baseline wander; Quadratic variation; Denoising; Empirical mode decomposition	REMOVAL; SIGNALS; SYSTEM; EEG	Electrooculograms (EOG) indicate the magnitude and direction of eye movements. The EOG contain several types of noise and interference, which makes their analysis difficult. The existing denoising methods fail to preserve certain eye movement signatures, mainly in regions where there is a change of eye movement type, for e.g., fixation to saccades. Hence, the prime aim of the study is to denoise EOG signals, while preserving the signatures in such conditions. In this paper, we propose a new denoising method that addresses the aforementioned issue. In this algorithm, we first divide the signal into sub-signals based on the region of changes in the eye movement type. For each sub-signal, we separate the intrinsic mode oscillations from noise. Finally, the filtered sub-signals are concatenated to form the reconstructed signal. The reconstruction artifacts at the joining region are removed by Bayesian estimation. We name this algorithm as the Piecewise Empirical Mode Bayesian Estimation (PEMBE). We demonstrate that PEMBE is more effective in the denoising process as compared to the existing methods, as tested on the Physiosig EOG. The PEMBE is also found to be useful in the removal of the baseline wander.

If so, any behavioral or cognitive dysfunction should lend itself to depiction in terms of information processing deficiencies. Information is characterized by recursive, hierarchical complexity. The brain accommodates this complexity by a hierarchy of large/slow and small/fast spatiotemporal loops of activity. Thus, successful information processing hinges upon tightly regulating the spatiotemporal makeup of activity, to optimally match the underlying multiscale delay structure of such hierarchical networks. Reduced capacity for information processing will then be expressed as deviance from this requisite multiscale character of spatiotemporal activity. This deviance is captured by a general family of multiscale criticality measures (MsCr). MsCr measures reflect the behavior of conventional criticality measures (such as the branching parameter) across temporal scale. We applied MsCr to MEG and EEG data in several telling degraded information processing scenarios. Consistently with our previous modeling work, MsCr measures systematically varied with information processing capacity: MsCr fingerprints showed deviance in the four states of compromised information processing examined in this study, disorders of consciousness, mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia and even during pre-ictal activity. MsCr measures might thus be able to serve as general gauges of information processing capacity and, therefore, as normative measures of brain health.

Numerous studies have used neuroimaging modalities to assess the cognitive state and response of the brain with various external stimulations. The virtual reality-based devices are well known to incur visual, auditory, and haptic induced perceptions. Neurophysiological recordings together with virtual stimulations can assist in correlating humans' physiological perception with response in the environment designed virtually. The effective combination of these two has been utilized to study human behavior, spatial navigation performance, and spatial presence, to name a few. Moreover, virtual reality-based devices can be evaluated for the neurophysiological correlates of cognition through neurophysiological recordings. Challenges exist in the integration of real-time neuronal signals with virtual reality-based devices, and enhancing the experience together with real-time feedback and control through neuronal signals. This article provides an overview of neurophysiological correlates of cognition as revealed by virtual reality experience, together with a description of perception and virtual reality-based neuromodulation, various applications, and existing challenges in this field of research.

The two major challenges in evaluating sleep quality are the scoring of sleep stages and sleep apnea detection. In addition to sleep apnea, hypopnea is also a respiratory event that occurs at an equal or even higher frequency compared to that of apnea. However, the two phenomena are not only different in terms of physical manifestation, there are also significant differences in the methods and means of clinical treatment. Therefore, in this study we propose an effective algorithm to distinguish between hypopnea and apnea events. We consider two aspects of feature extraction. On the one hand, from the original time-domain waveform of electrocardiogram signals, we extract the time difference sequence between the appearance of the R-R wave in two adjacent QRS waves (RR intervals) and explore the way they change when apnea and hypopnea event occur. On the other hand, considering that the degree of sequence disorder caused by hypopnea and apnea events is different, multi-scale entropy and complexity are chosen as the features that describe this change. The results obtained using the proposed algorithm show that the classification between hypopnea events and any type of apnea events all reach an accuracy rate greater than 90%. For obstructive apnea events, which occur most frequently among the three different types of apneas, the classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F1-score were 91.78%, 92.21%, 91.30%, 92.20%, respectively. The classification results between central apnea events and hypopnea events reached an accuracy of 93.18%, sensitivity of 95.00%, specificity of 91.67% and F1-score of 92.68%. At the same time, the algorithm achieved an accuracy of 92.59%, sensitivity of 90.38%, specificity of 94.64% and F1-score of 92.16% when classifying mixed apnea and hypopnea events. In the classification of normal breathing, hypopnea events and apnea events, the total accuracy rate achieved was 91.92%, with that for normal breathing reaching 93.62%, for hypopnea events reaching 90.39%, and 91.91% for apnea events, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.99.

Graphene active sensor arrays for long-term and wireless mapping of wide frequency band epicortical brain activity	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							NETWORK DYNAMICS; EEG; LIGHT; FLUCTUATIONS; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; ELECTRODES; RESPONSES; NEURONS; SURFACE	Graphene active sensors have demonstrated promising capabilities for the detection of electrophysiological signals in the brain. Their functional properties, together with their flexibility as well as their expected stability and biocompatibility have raised them as a promising building block for large-scale sensing neural interfaces. However, in order to provide reliable tools for neuroscience and biomedical engineering applications, the maturity of this technology must be thoroughly studied. Here, we evaluate the performance of 64-channel graphene sensor arrays in terms of homogeneity, sensitivity and stability using a wireless, quasi-commercial headstage and demonstrate the biocompatibility of epicortical graphene chronic implants. Furthermore, to illustrate the potential of the technology to detect cortical signals from infra-slow to high-gamma frequency bands, we perform proof-of-concept long-term wireless recording in a freely behaving rodent. Our work demonstrates the maturity of the graphene-based technology, which represents a promising candidate for chronic, wide frequency band neural sensing interfaces. Graphene active sensors have emerged as a promising building block for large-scale neural interfaces. The authors evaluate their performance in terms of wide frequency band sensitivity, stability and biocompatibility and perform proof-of-concept long-term wireless recording in a freely behaving rodent.

Insight is the sudden realization of a novel idea or problem solution accompanied by an "aha" experience. Analysis occurs in a conscious, deliberate fashion without an "aha" experience. Previous research has shown that brain activity during a preparatory period immediately before a problem is presented can predict whether the subsequently presented problem will be solved by insight or by analysis. Those prior studies used a type of brief verbal problem called compound remote associates (CRA). To determine whether prestimulus activity predicts subsequent insight versus analytic solving for other types of problems, the present study used an anagram task. We examined high-density electroencephalograms (EEGs) immediately preceding the presentation of anagrams and found that during the 2-s prestimulus interval there was greater beta-band activity recorded over right central-parietal cortex prior to analytic solving compared with insightful solving. EEG source reconstruction showed that this activity originated in left mid-cingulate cortex (MCC) and the right postcentral gyrus. In contrast to prior work, we found no evidence of a significant interaction between insight-related prestimulus brain activity and positive mood, although positive mood was associated with greater activity in anterior cingulate cortex and with a larger number of insight solutions. The present MCC results suggest that participants' anagram-solving strategies may be influenced by allostasis, that is, the estimation and marshalling of neurocognitive resources required to cope with an expected task. Specifically, when a participant adequately prepares for an upcoming problem, then MCC activity is high, enabling solution by resource-intensive analytic processing. Alternatively, when preparation is insufficient for analytic processing, then MCC activity is low and subsequent solving occurs by low-demand insight processing. The current findings and explanatory model differ from those of previous studies that used a CRA task, suggesting the possibility of complex interactions between task-type and procedure-type in determining the nature of prestimulus preparation. Future research examining such interactions may yield results that benefit educators who teach students problem-solving strategies.

Fortunately, these improvements work well, reducing the number of accident occurrences. However, while the number of accidents due to mechanical failures has decreased, the number of accidents due to human errors seems to grow. On that basis, this work presents a contribution regarding the brain's beta-band activities for different levels of volunteers' expertise on flight simulator, i.e., experienced, mid-level and beginner, in which they acted as pilots in command during several simulated flights. Spectrogram analysis and statistical measurements of each volunteer's brain's beta-band were carried out. These were based on seven flight tasks: takeoff, climb, cruise flight, descent, approach, final approach and landing. The results of the proposed experiment showed that the takeoff, approach and landing corresponded to the highest brain activities, i.e., close to 37.06-67.33% more than the brain activity of the other flight tasks: when some accidents were about to occur, the intensities of the brain activity were similar to those of the final approach task. When the volunteers' expertise and confidence on flight simulation were considered, it was shown that the highest brain magnitudes and oscillations observed of more experienced and confident volunteers were on average close to 68.44% less, compared to less experienced and less confident volunteers. Moreover, more experienced and confident volunteers in general presented different patterns of brain activities compared to volunteers with less expertise or less familiarity with fight simulations and/or electronic games.

Methods: We adopted the modulation index based on the Kullback-Leibler distance, phase-amplitude coupling co-modulogram, and time-varying phase-amplitude modulogram to explore the temporal-spatial patterns and characterization of PAC strength during the period from inter- seizure to post-seizure. Taking the resected area as the gold standard, the epileptogenic zone was located based on MI values of 7 different seizure periods, and the accuracy of localization was measured by the area under the receiver operating curve. Results: (1) The PAC in the inter- and pre-seizure periods was weak and paroxysmal, but strong PAC channels were confined more to the seizure-onset zone and resection region. PAC during the seizure period was intense and persistent, but gradually deviated from the seizure-onset zone. (2) The characteristics of coupling strength of the inter- and pre-seizure EEG can be used to accurately locate the epileptogenic zone, which is better than that in periods after the beginning of a seizure. (3) In an epileptic seizure, the preferred phases of coupling were usually in the rising branches at the pre- and early-seizure stages, while those in the middle- and terminal-seizure were usually in the falling branch. We thus speculate that the coupling occurred in the rising branch can promote the recruitment of abnormal discharge, while the coupling occurred in the falling branch can inhibit the abnormal discharge. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the phase-amplitude coupling during inter- and pre-seizure is a promising marker of epileptic focus location. The preferred phase of coupling changed regularly with the time of epileptic seizure, suggesting that the surge and suppression of abnormal discharges are related to different phases.

Pieter			Cortical beta-band power modulates with uncertainty in effector selection during motor planning	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						action selection; beta band; EEG; hand choice; motor planning	POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; DECISIONS; CHOICE; PLANS	Although beta-band activity during motor planning is known to be modulated by uncertainty about where to act, less is known about its modulations to uncertainty about how to act. To investigate this issue, we recorded oscillatory brain activity with EEG while human participants (n = 17) performed a hand choice reaching task. The reaching hand was either predetermined or of participants' choice, and the target was close to one of the two hands or at about equal distance from both. To measure neural activity in a motion artifact-free time window, the location of the upcoming target was cued 1,000-1,500 ms before the presentation of the target, whereby the cue was valid in 50% of trials. As evidence for motor planning during the cuing phase, behavioral observations showed that the cue affected later hand choice. Furthermore, reaction times were longer in the choice trials than in the predetermined trials, supporting the notion of a competitive process for hand selection. Modulations of beta-band power over central cortical regions, but not alpha-band or theta-band power, were in line with these observations. During the cuing period, reaches in predetermined trials were preceded by larger decreases in beta-band power than reaches in choice trials. Cue direction did not affect reaction times or beta-band power, which may be due to the cue being invalid in 50% of trials, retaining effector uncertainty during motor planning. Our findings suggest that effector uncertainty modulates beta-band power during motor planning. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Although reach-related beta-band power in central cortical areas is known to modulate with the number of potential targets, here we show, using a cuing paradigm, that the power in this frequency band, but not in the alpha or theta band, is also modulated by the uncertainty of which hand to use. This finding supports the notion that multiple possible effector-specific actions can be specified in parallel up to the level of motor preparation.	[van Helvert, Milou J.

To investigate surgical prognostic factors in order to establish a surgical plan for children with drug-resistant epileptic spasms. Methods. We retrospectively analysed 64 children with drug-resistant spasms who were operated on in Beijing; the electroclinical features, surgical procedures, and surgical outcomes of these children were discussed in detail. We divided the seizure-free patients into several groups according to imaging, aetiology, and application of stereo-electroencephalography in order to investigate the extent of the various influencing factors. Results. Fifty-three (82.8%) patients had favourable outcome, and 11 (17.2%) had unfavourable outcome. Based on the univariate analysis, the factors associated with favourable seizure outcome were interictal high gamma frequency (chi 2 = 4.161; p = 0.041), concordance between MRI and interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) (chi 2 = 6.148; p = 0.013), and concordance between PET and IEDs (chi 2 = 4.281; p = 0.039). Concordance between MRI and IEDs (OR = 0.083, 95% CI = 0.014-0.483; p = 0.006) and continuous discharges on electrocorticography (OR = 0.109, 95% CI = 0.019-0.639; p = 0.014) were important factors associated with a favourable surgical outcome. Significance. Resective surgery is an effective treatment for drug-resistant ES in children. A deeper understanding of the predictors of seizure outcome is beneficial for establishing a standard, one-stage resection procedure for spasms in order to benefit more patients who have not previously considered surgery. We propose a workflow for presurgical evaluation in children with epileptic spasms.

Each process is thought to be supported by a network consisting of local and long-range connections bridging between major cortical areas. Both temporal and extratemporal lobe regions have functional compartments responsible for distinct language domains, including the perception and production of phonological and semantic components. This study provides quantitative evidence of how directly connected inter-lobar neocortical networks support distinct stages of linguistic processing across brain development. Novel six-dimensional tractography was used to intuitively visualize the strength and temporal dynamics of direct inter-lobar effective connectivity between cortical areas activated during each linguistic processing stage. We analysed 3401 non-epileptic intracranial electrode sites from 37 children with focal epilepsy (aged 5-20 years) who underwent extra-operative electrocorticography recording. Principal component analysis of auditory naming-related high-gamma modulations determined the relative involvement of each cortical area during each linguistic processing stage. To quantify direct effective connectivity, we delivered single-pulse electrical stimulation to 488 temporal and 1581 extratemporal lobe sites and measured the early cortico-cortical spectral responses at distant electrodes. Mixed model analyses determined the effects of naming-related high-gamma co-augmentation between connecting regions, age, and cerebral hemisphere on the strength of effective connectivity independent of epilepsy-related factors. Direct effective connectivity was strongest between extratemporal and temporal lobe site pairs, which were simultaneously activated between sentence offset and verbal response onset (i.e. response preparation period); this connectivity was approximately twice more robust than that with temporal lobe sites activated during stimulus listening or overt response. Conversely, extratemporal lobe sites activated during overt response were equally connected with temporal lobe language sites. Older age was associated with increased strength of inter-lobar effective connectivity especially between those activated during response preparation. The arcuate fasciculus supported approximately two-thirds of the direct effective connectivity pathways from temporal to extratemporal auditory language-related areas but only up to half of those in the opposite direction. The uncinate fasciculus consisted of <2% of those in the temporal-to-extratemporal direction and up to 6% of those in the opposite direction. We, for the first time, provided an atlas which quantifies and animates the strength, dynamics, and direction specificity of inter-lobar neural communications between language areas via the white matter pathways. Language-related effective connectivity may be strengthened in an age-dependent manner even after the age of 5.

Locating efficiently these abnormal sources among magnetoencephalography (MEG) biomarker is obtained by several inverse problem techniques. These techniques present different assumptions and particular epileptic network connectivity. Here, we proposed to evaluate performances of distributed inverse problem in defining EZ. First, we applied an advanced technique based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to recover only pure transitory activities (interictal epileptiform discharges). We evaluated our technique's robustness in separation between transitory and ripples versus frequency range, transitory shapes, and signal to noise ratio on simulated data (depicting both epileptic biomarkers and respecting time series and spectral properties of realistic data). We validated our technique on MEG signal using detector precision on 5 patients. Then, we applied four methods of inverse problem to define cortical areas and neural generators of excessive discharges. We computed network connectivity of each technique. Then, we confronted obtained noninvasive networks to intracerebral EEG transitory network connectivity using nodes in common, connection strength, distance metrics between concordant nodes of MEG and IEEG, and average propagation delay. Coherent Maximum Entropy on the Mean (cMEM) proved a high matching between MEG network connectivity and IEEG based on distance between active sources, followed by Exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA), Dynamical Statistical Parametric Mapping (dSPM), and Minimum norm estimation (MNE). Clinical performance was interesting for entire methods providing in an average of 73.5% of active sources detected in depth and seen in MEG, and vice versa, about 77.15% of active sources were detected from MEG and seen in IEEG. Investigated problem techniques succeed at least in finding one part of seizure onset zone. dSPM and eLORETA depict the highest connection strength among all techniques. Propagation delay varies in this range [18, 25]ms, knowing that eLORETA ensures the lowest propagation delay (18 ms) and the closet one to IEEG propagation delay.

In this regard, the robot-assisted interventions have gained popularity as they can provide the objective and quantifiable assessment of the motor performance by taking the kinematics parameters into the account. Neurophysiological parameters have also been proposed for this purpose due to the novel advances in the non-invasive signal processing techniques. In addition, other parameters linked to the motor learning and brain plasticity occurring during the rehabilitation have been explored, looking for a more holistic rehabilitation approach. However, the majority of the research done in this area is still exploratory. These parameters have shown the capability to become the "biomarkers" that are defined as the quantifiable indicators of the physiological/pathological processes and the responses to the therapeutical interventions. In this view, they could be finally used for enhancing the robot-assisted treatments. While the research on the biomarkers has been growing in the last years, there is a current need for a better comprehension and quantification of the neuromechanical processes involved in the rehabilitation. In particular, there is a lack of operationalization of the potential neuromechanical biomarkers into the clinical algorithms. In this scenario, a new framework called the "Rehabilomics" has been proposed to account for the rehabilitation research that exploits the biomarkers in its design. This study provides an overview of the state-of-the-art of the biomarkers related to the robotic neurorehabilitation, focusing on the translational studies, and underlying the need to create the comprehensive approaches that have the potential to take the research on the biomarkers into the clinical practice. We then summarize some promising biomarkers that are being under investigation in the current literature and provide some examples of their current and/or potential applications in the neurorehabilitation. Finally, we outline the main challenges and future directions in the field, briefly discussing their potential evolution and prospective.

Increasing load has been shown to dampen its performance and affect oscillatory neural activity in different frequency bands. Nevertheless, mixed results regarding fast frequencies activity and a lack of research on WM load modulations of cross-frequency phaseamplitude coupling mechanisms preclude a better understanding of the impact of increased WM load levels on brain activity as well as inter-regional communication and coordination supporting WM processes. Hence, we analyzed the EEG activity of 25 participants while performing a delayed-matching-to-sample (DMS) WM task with three WM load levels. Current density power and distribution at the source level for theta, beta, and gamma frequencies during the task's delay period were compared for each pair of WM load conditions. Results showed maximal increases of theta activity in frontal areas and of fast frequencies' activity in posterior regions with WM load, showing the involvement of frontal theta activity in WM maintenance and the control of attentional resources and visual processing by beta and gamma activity. To study whether WM load modulates communication between cortical areas, posterior beta and gamma amplitudes distribution across frontal theta phase was also analysed for those areas showing the largest significant WM load modulations. Higher beta activity amplitude at bilateral cuneus and right middle occipital gyrus, and higher gamma activity amplitude at bilateral posterior cingulate were observed during frontal theta phase peak in low than high memory load conditions. Moreover, greater fast beta amplitude at the right postcentral gyrus was observed during theta phase trough at right middle frontal gyrus in high than low memory load conditions. These results show that WM load modulates whether interregional communication occurs during theoretically optimal or non-optimal time windows, depending on the demands of frontal control of posterior areas required to perform the task successfully.

Previous work with direct neural recordings has found beta-band (13-30 Hz) modulation in both movement execution and inhibition throughout the motor system, but the role of beta-band modulation in the hippocampus during movement inhibition is not well understood. Here, we perform a Go/No-Go reaching task in ten patients with medically refractory epilepsy to study human hippocampal beta-power changes during movement. Materials and Methods Ten epilepsy patients (5 female; ages 21-46) were implanted with intracranial depth electrodes for seizure monitoring and localization. Local field potentials were sampled at 2000 Hz during a Go/No-Go movement task. Comparison of beta-band power between Go and No-Go conditions was conducted using Wilcoxon signed-rank hypothesis testing for each patient. Sub-analyses were conducted to assess differences in the anterior vs. posterior contacts, ipsilateral vs. contralateral contacts, and male vs. female beta power values. Results Eight out of ten patients showed significant beta-power decreases during the Go movement response (p < 0.05) compared to baseline. Eight out of ten patients also showed significant beta power increases in the No-Go condition, occurring in the absence of movement. No significant differences were noted between ipsilateral vs. contralateral contacts, nor in anterior vs. posterior hippocampal contacts. Female participants had a higher task success rate than males and had significantly greater beta-power increases in the No-Go condition (p < 0.001). Conclusion These findings indicate that increases in hippocampal beta power are associated with movement inhibition. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report this phenomenon in the human hippocampus. The beta band may represent a state-change signal involved in motor processing. Future focus on the beta band in understanding human motor and impulse control will be vital.

Sex differences in neuronal systems function and behaviour: beyond a single diagnosis in autism spectrum disorders	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Review							GLYCOGEN-SYNTHASE KINASE-3; MOUSE MODEL; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; BAND CONNECTIVITY; NEURAL ACTIVITY; VERBAL MEMORY; EEG COHERENCE; RAT MODEL; CHILDREN	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is associated with functional brain alterations that underlie the expression of behaviour. Males are diagnosed up to four times more than females, and sex differences have been identified in memory, cognitive flexibility, verbal fluency, and social communication. Unfortunately, there exists a lack of information on the sex-dependent mechanisms of ASD, as well as biological markers to distinguish sex-specific symptoms in ASD. This can often result in a standardized diagnosis for individuals across the spectrum, despite significant differences in the various ASD subtypes. Alterations in neuronal connectivity and oscillatory activity, such as is observed in ASD, are highly coupled to behavioural states. Yet, despite the well-identified sexual dimorphisms that exist in ASD, these functional patterns have rarely been analyzed in the context of sex differences or symptomology. This review summarizes alterations in neuronal oscillatory function in ASD, discusses the age, region, symptom and sex-specific differences that are currently observed across the spectrum, and potential targets for regulating neuronal oscillatory activity in ASD. The need to identify sex-specific biomarkers, in order to facilitate specific diagnostic criteria and allow for more targeted therapeutic approaches for ASD will also be discussed.

However, a recent neurophenomenological framework proposes a graded view on empathy (i.e., "Graded Empathy") that extends this dichotomy and considers multiple levels while integrating complex neural patterns and representations of subjective experience. In the current magnetoencephalography study, we conducted a multidimensional investigation of neural oscillatory modulations and their cortical sources in 44 subjects while observing stimuli that convey vicarious pain (vs no-pain) in a broad time window and frequency range to explore rich neural representations of pain empathy. Furthermore, we collected participants' subjective-experience of sensitivity to vicarious pain, as well as their self-reported trait levels of affective and cognitive empathy to examine the possible associations between neural mechanisms and subjective experiences and reports. While extending previous electrophysiological studies that mainly focused on alpha suppression, we found here four significant power modulation patterns corresponding to multiple facets of empathy: an early central (peaking in the paracentral sulcus) alpha (6-11 Hz) suppression pattern plausibly reflecting sensory processing, two early beta (15-23 Hz) suppression patterns in the mid-cingulate cortex (plausibly reflecting the affective component) and in the precuneus (plausibly reflecting the cognitive component), and a late anterior (peaking in the orbitofrontal cortex) alpha-beta (11-19 Hz) enhancement pattern (plausibly reflecting cognitive-control inhibitory response). Interestingly, the latter measure was negatively correlated with the subjective sensitivity to vicarious pain, thereby possibly revealing a novel inhibitory neural mechanism determining the subjective sensitivity to vicarious pain. Altogether, these multilevel findings cannot be accommodated by the dichotomous model of empathy (i.e., affective-cognitive), and provide empirical support to the Graded Empathy neurophenomenological framework. Furthermore, this work emphasizes the importance of examining multiple neural rhythms, their cortical generators, and reports of subjective-experience in the aim of elucidating the complex nature of empathy.

Mind-body awareness training (MBAT) can improve BCI learning, but how it does so remains unknown. Here, we show that MBAT allows participants to learn to volitionally increase alpha band neural activity during BCI tasks that incorporate intentional rest. We trained individuals in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR; a standardized MBAT intervention) and compared performance and brain activity before and after training between randomly assigned trained and untrained control groups. The MBAT group showed reliably faster learning of BCI than the control group throughout training. Alpha-band activity in electroencephalogram signals, recorded in the volitional resting state during task performance, showed a parallel increase over sessions, and predicted final BCI performance. The level of alpha-band activity during the intentional resting state correlated reliably with individuals' mindfulness practice as well as performance on a breath counting task. Collectively, these results show that MBAT modifies a specific neural signal used by BCI. MBAT, by increasing patients' control over their brain activity during rest, may increase the effectiveness of BCI in the large population who could benefit from alternatives to direct motor control.

Recording BOLD signals with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an important noninvasive diagnostic tool; however, 1-2% of fMRI examinations have to be aborted due to claustrophobia. In the present study, we investigated the information flow between regions of interest (ROI's) in the cortex and brain stem by using a frequency band close to 0.1 Hz. Causal coupling between signals important in brain-heart interaction (cardiac intervals, respiration, and BOLD signals) was studied by means of Directed Transfer Function based on the Granger causality principle. Compared were initial resting states with elevated anxiety and final resting states with low or no anxiety in a group of fMRI-naive young subjects. During initial high anxiety the results showed an increased information flow from the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) to the pre-central gyrus (PCG) and to the brainstem. There also was an increased flow from the brainstem to the PCG. While the top-down flow during increased anxiety was predominant, the weaker ascending flow from brainstem structures may characterize a rhythmic pacemaker-like activity that (at least in part) drives respiration. We assume that these changes in information flow reflect successful anxiety processing.

However, to advance its technical development and further our understanding, implementation of the method in animal models is indispensable. Here, we report the successful employment of slow waves' phase-targeted closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS) in rats. To validate this new tool both conceptually and functionally, we tested the effects of up- and down-phase CLAS on proportions and spectral characteristics of sleep, and on learning performance in the single-pellet reaching task, respectively. Without affecting 24 hr sleep-wake behavior, CLAS specifically altered delta (slow waves) and sigma (sleep spindles) power persistently over chronic periods of stimulation. While up-phase CLAS does not elicit a significant change in behavioral performance, down-phase CLAS exerted a detrimental effect on overall engagement and success rate in the behavioral test. Overall CLAS-dependent spectral changes were positively correlated with learning performance. Altogether, our results provide proof-of-principle evidence that phase-targeted CLAS of slow waves in rodents is efficient, safe, and stable over chronic experimental periods, enabling the use of this high-specificity tool for basic and preclinical translational sleep research.

Frontal increase of beta modulation during the practice of a motor task is enhanced by visuomotor learning	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; MOVEMENT; SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; DESYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; ADAPTATION; ACTIVATION; PATTERNS; SLEEP	Movement is accompanied by beta power changes over frontal and sensorimotor regions: a decrease during movement (event-related desynchronization, ERD), followed by an increase (event-related synchronization, ERS) after the movement end. We previously found that enhancements of beta modulation (from ERD to ERS) during a reaching test (mov) occur over frontal and left sensorimotor regions after practice in a visuo-motor adaptation task (ROT) but not after visual learning practice. Thus, these enhancements may reflect local cumulative effects of motor learning. Here we verified whether they are triggered by the learning component inherent in ROT or simply by motor practice in a reaching task without such learning (MOT). We found that beta modulation during mov increased over frontal and left areas after three-hour practice of either ROT or MOT. However, the frontal increase was greater after ROT, while the increase over the left area was similar after the two tasks. These findings confirm that motor practice leaves local traces in beta power during a subsequent motor test. As they occur after motor tasks with and without learning, these traces likely express the cost of processes necessary for both usage and engagement of long-term potentiation mechanisms necessary for the learning required by ROT.

Thirty-six 18-30 years adults were recruited to perform a 20-min bout of HIIT, MICE, and rest on separate days in counterbalanced order. Following interventions, frontal alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) was measured during a modified Sternberg task requiring varying amounts of working memory (3-, 5-, 7-letter tasks). Behavioral analyses showed a condition effect, indicating shorter response times following HIIT compared to rest. Analysis of frontal alpha ERD showed an interaction of condition and task, indicating no differences across tasks following rest but a task effect following HIIT and MICE, with frontal alpha ERD increasing in the 7-letter task compared with the 3-letter task. Following HIIT, this task-related contrast of frontal alpha ERD extended to the time period when memory retrieval occurred. Although both HIIT and MICE resulted in alterations in neuroelectric underpinnings of memory encoding and retention in response to increased memory load, only HIIT enhanced the processing speed and brain activation during memory retrieval. These findings provide evidence for potential applications of exercise to enhance working memory and the role of exercise type to such effect.

The density of local spindles is higher than global spindles, emphasizing the importance of local plastic neural processes. In children, findings on the association of spindles with cognition are more variable. Hence, we aim to study whether the local spindles are also important for neurobehavioral performance in children. Methods: We studied the correlations between local (occurring in only one channel: Fp1, Fp2, C3, or C4), bilateral, and diffuse (occurring in all four channels) spindles and neurobehavioral performance in 17 healthy children (median age 9.6 years). Results: Local spindles were not as frequent as bilateral spindles (P-values < 0.05). Central spindle types had significant correlations with sensorimotor and language functions (e.g., the density of bilateral central spindles correlated positively with the Object Assembly in NEPSY, r = 0.490). Interestingly, frontopolar spindles correlated with behavior (e.g., the more bilateral the frontopolar spindles, the less hyperactive the children, r = -0.618). Conclusions: In children, the local spindles, but also more widespread central spindles, seem to be involved in the cognitive processes. Based on our findings, it is important that ageadjusted frequency limits are used in studies evaluating the frequencies of spindles in children.

The objective of the study is to identify phase coupling patterns that are shared across subjects via a machine learning approach that utilises source space magnetoencephalography (MEG) phase coupling data from a working memory (WM) task. Indeed, phase coupling of neural oscillations is putatively a key factor for communication between distant brain areas and is therefore crucial in performing cognitive tasks, including WM. Previous studies investigating phase coupling during cognitive tasks have often focused on a few a priori selected brain areas or a specific frequency band, and the need for data-driven approaches has been recognised. Machine learning techniques have emerged as valuable tools for the analysis of neuroimaging data since they catch fine-grained differences in the multivariate signal distribution. Here, we expect that these techniques applied to MEG phase couplings can reveal WM-related processes that are shared across individuals. Approach. We analysed WM data collected as part of the Human Connectome Project. The MEG data were collected while subjects (n = 83) performed N-back WM tasks in two different conditions, namely 2-back (WM condition) and 0-back (control condition). We estimated phase coupling patterns (multivariate phase slope index) for both conditions and for theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands. The obtained phase coupling data were then used to train a linear support vector machine in order to classify which task condition the subject was performing with an across-subject cross-validation approach. The classification was performed separately based on the data from individual frequency bands and with all bands combined (multiband). Finally, we evaluated the relative importance of the different features (phase couplings) for classification by the means of feature selection probability. Main results. The WM condition and control condition were successfully classified based on the phase coupling patterns in the theta (62% accuracy) and alpha bands (60% accuracy) separately. Importantly, the multiband classification showed that phase coupling patterns not only in the theta and alpha but also in the gamma bands are related to WM processing, as testified by improvement in classification performance (71%). Significance. Our study successfully decoded WM tasks using MEG source space functional connectivity. Our approach, combining across-subject classification and a multidimensional metric recently developed by our group, is able to detect patterns of connectivity that are shared across individuals. In other words, the results are generalisable to new individuals and allow meaningful interpretation of task-relevant phase coupling patterns.

Functional coupling between two signals appears with a delay time which can be used to infer the directionality of information flow. Functional coupling of brain and muscle depends on the type of muscle contraction and motor task performance. Although there have been many studies of functional coupling with types of muscle contraction and force level, there has been a lack of investigation with various motor task performances. Motor task types play an essential role that can reflect the amount of functional interaction. Thus, we examined functional coupling under four different motor tasks: real movement, intention, motor imagery and movement observation tasks. We explored interaction of two signals with linear and nonlinear information flow. The aim of this study is to investigate the synchronization between brain and muscle signals in terms of functional coupling and delay time. The results proved that brain-muscle functional coupling and delay time change according to motor tasks. Quick synchronization of localized cortical activity and motor unit firing causes good functional coupling and this can lead to short delay time to oscillate between signals. Signals can flow with bidirectionality between efferent and afferent pathways.

General Anesthesia Disrupts Complex Cortical Dynamics in Response to Intracranial Electrical Stimulation in Rats	ENEURO			English	Article						anesthesia; connectivity; consciousness; OFF period; perturbational complexity index; rat	NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; NETWORK MECHANISMS; LESS-THAN-1 HZ; MOTOR CORTEX; SLEEP; PROPOFOL; CONSCIOUSNESS; SYNCHRONIZATION; STATES; OSCILLATIONS	The capacity of human brain to sustain complex cortical dynamics appears to be strongly associated with conscious experience and consistently drops when consciousness fades. For example, several recent studies in humans found a remarkable reduction of the spatiotemporal complexity of cortical responses to local stimulation during dreamless sleep, general anesthesia, and coma. However, this perturbational complexity has never been directly estimated in non-human animals in vivo previously, and the mechanisms that prevent neocortical neurons to engage in complex interactions are still unclear. Here, we quantify the complexity of electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to intracranial electrical stimulation in rats, comparing wakefulness to propofol, sevoflurane, and ketamine anesthesia. The evoked activity changed from highly complex in wakefulness to far simpler with propofol and sevoflurane. The reduced complexity was associated with a suppression of high frequencies that preceded a reduced phase-locking, and disruption of functional connectivity and pattern diversity. We then showed how these parameters dissociate with ketamine and depend on intensity and site of stimulation. Our results support the idea that brief periods of activity-dependent neuronal silence can interrupt complex interactions in neocortical circuits, and open the way for further mechanistic investigations of the neuronal basis for consciousness and loss of consciousness across species.

This study aims to characterize the relation between reduced brain volumes and spectral power in multiple sclerosis patients and matched healthy subjects. During resting-state eyes closed, we collected magnetoencephalographic data in 67 multiple sclerosis patients and 47 healthy subjects, matched for age and gender. Additionally, we quantified different brain volumes through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). First, a principal component analysis of MRI-derived brain volumes demonstrates that atrophy can be largely described by two components: one overall degenerative component that correlates strongly with different cognitive tests, and one component that mainly captures degeneration of the cortical grey matter that strongly correlates with age. A multimodal correlation analysis indicates that increased brain atrophy and lesion load is accompanied by increased spectral power in the lower alpha (8-10 Hz) in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Increased lower alpha power in the TPJ was further associated with worse results on verbal and spatial working memory tests, whereas an increased lower/upper alpha power ratio was associated with slower information processing speed. In conclusion, multiple sclerosis patients with increased brain atrophy, lesion and thalamic volumes demonstrated increased lower alpha power in the TPJ and reduced cognitive abilities.

Since there is not yet a comprehensive mathematical model for simulating brainwaves, we proposed a cellular automaton (CA) model of a neuronal population by considering the different states of an action potential at the cellular level and simple connectivity patterns . Some important characteristics of a neural network are included in the model, such as different states of activation of a neuron, and excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Our computational model can display different dynamics from fixed-point and limit-cycle to chaotic behaviors similar to different dynamics of a real neuronal population in the brain. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the real electroencephalogram data and the CA simulations in the linear and nonlinear domains demonstrated the efficiency of our CA network to simulate the electrical brain activity. Time series from the proposed model display a high-dimensional stochastic behavior that corresponds to the behavior of a healthy brain. Therefore, this model can be used to study biological neuronal populations and provide more insight into their different mechanisms.

Potential targets for the treatment of ADHD using transcranial electrical current stimulation	NON-INVASIVE BRAIN STIMULATION (NIBS) IN NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS	Progress in Brain Research		English	Review; Book Chapter						Non-invasive brain stimulation; Transcranial alternating current stimulation; Transcranial direct current stimulation; Transcranial random noise stimulation; ADHD	DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; RANDOM NOISE STIMULATION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; EEG; EXCITABILITY; P300; MODULATION	Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric disease with a prevalence of 2%-7.5% among the population. It is characterized by three core symptoms: hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention. Although the majority of ADHD patients respond to a combination of psychotherapy and standard pharmacotherapy with Methylphenidate, there is a significant minority of patients that do not respond to these substances. Additionally, the treatment with Methylphenidate can cause a variety of side effects like insomnia, headache, decreased appetite, and xerostomia. It would be favorable to have an alternative treatment-option that could circumnavigate the shortcomings of traditional pharmacological treatments. Recent results show that transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) might offer a promising approach. Since research has shown that ADHD is associated with various alterations in brain activity, brain stimulation methods targeting different facets of neuronal functions are currently under investigation. In this article, we briefly review different tES techniques like transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and explain the modes of action of these brain stimulations. We will specifically focus on transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) as a potential method of treating ADHD.

However, local asynchrony has been predicted in theoretical studies and reported in patients with pre-existing focal pathology. Method: We used high-speed widefield calcium imaging to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of isoflurane-induced BS in rats. Results: We found that isoflurane-induced BS is not a globally synchronous rhythm. In the neocortex, neural activity first emerged in a spatially shifting, variably localized focus. Subsequent propagation across the whole cortex was rapid, typically within <100 milliseconds, giving the superficial resemblance to global synchrony. Neural activity remained locally asynchronous during the bursts, forming complex recurrent propagating waves. Despite propagation variability, spatial sequences of burst propagation were largely preserved between the hemispheres, and neural activity was highly correlated between the homotopic areas. The critical role of the thalamus in cortical burst initiation was demonstrated by using unilateral thalamic tetrodotoxin injection. Conclusion: The classical impression that anesthetics-induced BS is a state of global brain synchrony is inaccurate. Bursts are a series of shifting local cortical events facilitated by thalamic projection that unfold as rapid, bilaterally asynchronous propagating waves.

Extensions of Granger Causality Calculations on Brain Networks for Efficient and Accurate Seizure Focus Identification via iEEGs	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						network centrality; epilepsy surgery; seizure networks; intracranial EEG; surgical planning; Monte Carlo sampling	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS	Current epilepsy surgery planning protocol determines the seizure onset zone (SOZ) through resource-intensive, invasive monitoring of ictal events. Recently, we have reported that Granger Causality (GC) maps produced from analysis of interictal iEEG recordings have potential in revealing SOZ. In this study, we investigate GC maps' network connectivity patterns to determine possible clinical correlation with patients' SOZ and resection zone (RZ). While building understanding of interictal network topography and its relationship to the RZ/SOZ, we identify algorithmic tools with potential applications in epilepsy surgery planning. These graph algorithms are retrospectively tested on data from 25 patients and compared to the neurologist-determined SOZ and surgical RZ, viewed as sources of truth. Centrality algorithms yielded statistically significant RZ rank order sums for 16 of 24 patients with RZ data, representing an improvement from prior algorithms. While SOZ results remained largely the same, this study validates the applicability of graph algorithms to RZ/SOZ detection, opening the door to further exploration of iEEG datasets. Furthermore, this study offers previously inaccessible insights into the relationship between interictal brain connectivity patterns and epileptic brain networks, utilizing the overall topology of the graphs as well as data on edge weights and quantity of edges contained in GC maps.

In this study, we tried to apply the modified multi-scale entropy (MMSE) approach, based on variational mode decomposition (VMD), to driving fatigue detection. Firstly, the VMD was used to decompose EEG into multiple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), then the best IMFs and scale factors were selected using the least square method (LSM). Finally, the MMSE features were extracted. Compared with the traditional sample entropy (SampEn), the VMD-MMSE method can identify the characteristics of driving fatigue more effectively. The VMD-MMSE characteristics combined with a subjective questionnaire (SQ) were used to analyze the change trends of driving fatigue under two driving modes: normal driving mode and interesting auditory stimulation mode. The results show that the interesting auditory stimulation method adopted in this paper can effectively relieve driving fatigue. In addition, the interesting auditory stimulation method, which simply involves playing interesting auditory information on the vehicle-mounted player, can effectively relieve driving fatigue. Compared with traditional driving fatigue-relieving methods, such as sleeping and drinking coffee, this interesting auditory stimulation method can relieve fatigue in real-time when the driver is driving normally.

Fluoxetine (FLU), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, can improve cognitive deficits in demented patients. The present study investigated the effects of FLU on spatial learning and memory cognitions in 6-OHDA lesioned rats. Morris water maze (MWM) test showed that FLU significantly improved spatial cognitive deficits in rats with unilateral 6-OHDA injection at 4 and 7 weeks after 6-OHDA injection. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that the number and duration of high voltage spindles(HVSs)in the ipsilateral hippocampus of 6-OHDA lesioned rats were decreased by the administration of FLU. Furthermore, the spectral analysis of per frequency revealed increases in delta and theta rhythm power and decreases in alpha, beta and gamma rhythm power in the ipsilateral hippocampus of 6-OHDA lesioned rats in contrast to the saline-treated rats. Acute FLU treatment can reduce delta and theta rhythm power, and enhance alpha, beta and gamma rhythm power in the ipsilateral hippocampus of 6-OHDA lesioned rats. These findings suggest that FLU improves impaired cognition by tuning oscillatory activities in the hippocampus of 6-OHDA lesioned rats.

The transition from voluntary to involuntary swallowing is executed within milliseconds. We hypothesized that the underlying neural mechanism of swallowing would be revealed by high-frequency cortical activities. Methods: Eight epileptic participants fitted with intracranial electrodes over the orofacial cortex were asked to swallow a water bolus and cortical oscillatory changes, including the high gamma band (75150 Hz) and beta band (13-30 Hz), were investigated at the time of mouth opening, water injection, and swallowing. Results: Increases in high gamma power associated with mouth opening were observed in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) with water injection in the lateral central sulcus and with swallowing in the region along the Sylvian fissure. Mouth opening induced a decrease in beta power, which continued until the completion of swallowing. The high gamma burst of activity was focal and specific to swallowing; however, the beta activities were extensive and not specific to swallowing. In the interim between voluntary and involuntary swallowing, swallowing-related high gamma power achieved its peak, and subsequently, the power decreased. Interpretation: We demonstrated three distinct activities related to mouth opening, water injection, and swallowing induced at different timings using high gamma activities. The peak of high gamma power related to swallowing suggests that during voluntary swallowing phases, the cortex is the main driving force for swallowing as opposed to the brain stem.

J	Mangaroska, K; Sharma, K; Gasevic, D; Giannakos, M				Mangaroska, Katerina; Sharma, Kshitij; Gasevic, Dragan; Giannakos, Michail			Exploring students' cognitive and affective states during problem solving through multimodal data: Lessons learned from a programming activity	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING			English	Article						code-debugging task; cognitive-affective states; higher education; multimodal data; multimodal learning analytics	ALPHA-POWER INCREASES; INSTRUCTIONAL-DESIGN; LOAD THEORY; USER FRUSTRATION; EEG; ATTENTION; PERFORMANCE; ANALYTICS; EMOTION; INFORMATION	Background Problem-solving is a multidimensional and dynamic process that requires and interlinks cognitive, metacognitive, and affective dimensions of learning. However, current approaches practiced in computing education research (CER) are not sufficient to capture information beyond the basic programming process data (i.e., IDE-log data). Therefore, how cognition and affect intertwine and unfold over time in programming problem-solving activities are rarely investigated. Objectives In this study, we examined how the theory-informed measures from multimodal data that we have selected as proxies for cognitive and affective dimensions of learning, are associated with student performance, and in comparison, to prior-knowledge. Methods A high-frequency temporal data was collected with a camera, an electroencephalogram, and an eye-tracker from 40 computer science students (bachelor and master studies) in the context of a code-debugging activity. To study the cognitive processes associated with learning we focused on cognitive load theory (CLT) and the human information processing model. In addition, we complemented CLT with the model of affective dynamics in learning to avoid the machine reductionism perspective. Results Our findings demonstrated that attention, convergent thinking, and frustration were positively correlated with students' successful code-debugging (i.e., performance), and frequently manifested by high performing participants. Cognitive load, memory load, and boredom were negatively correlated with students' performance, and typically manifested by low performing participants. Implications Extending the context of analysis in reference to student cognitive processes and affective states, affords educators not just to identify lower performers, but also to understand the potential reasons behind their performance, making our method an important contribution in the confluence of CER and the learning technology communities. In addition, the insights extracted from our analyses allow us to discuss potential avenues for improving learning design and the design of interactive learning systems to support the development of students' problem-solving skills.

The healthcare industry produces a huge amount of digital data, by utilizing information from all sources of healthcare, including the patients' demographics, medications, vital signs, physician's observations, laboratory data, billing data, data from various wearable sensors, etc. With the rapid growth of the wireless technology applications, there has also been a significant increase in the digital health data. New medical discoveries and new eHealth-related technologies, such as mobile apps, novel sensors, and wearable technology have contributed as important data sources for healthcare data. Nowadays, there is a huge potential to improve the healthcare quality and customer satisfaction with the help of machine learning (ML) algorithms applied on time-domain and frequency-domain healthcare data obtained from wearables and sensors. This systematic literature review examines in depth how health data from sensors can be processed and analyzed using ML techniques. The review focuses on the following diseases for obtaining the eHealth data: diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2, hypertension and hypotension, atrial fibrillation, bradykinesia, dyskinesia, and fever related diseases. The data for the systematic literature review was collected from four databases, Medline, Proquest, Scopus, and Web of Science. We selected 67 studies for the final in-depth review out of the initial 1530 pre-selected papers. Our study identified that the major part of eHealth data is obtained from the sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscopes, ECG (Electrocardiogram), EEG (Electroencephalogram) monitors, and blood glucose sensors. This study also examines the different feature types, feature extraction methods, and ML algorithms used for eHealth data analysis. Our review also shows that neural network (NN) algorithms and support vector machines (SVM) have shown so far the best performance for analyzing the healthcare data among other ML algorithms studied in the literature.

J	Fan, Y; Han, QM; Guo, SM; Luo, H				Fan, Ying; Han, Qiming; Guo, Simeng; Luo, Huan			Distinct Neural Representations of Content and Ordinal Structure in Auditory Sequence Memory	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory working memory; hidden state; multivariate decoding; reactivations; sequence structure	WORKING-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TEMPORAL-ORDER; TIME CELLS; HIPPOCAMPUS; INFORMATION; BRAIN; OBJECTS; OSCILLATIONS; MAINTENANCE	Two forms of information, frequency (content) and ordinal position (structure), have to be stored when retaining a sequence of auditory tones in working memory (WM). However, the neural representations and coding characteristics of content and structure, particularly during WM maintenance, remain elusive. Here, in two EEG studies in human participants (both sexes), by transiently perturbing the "activity-silent" WM retention state and decoding the reactivated WM information, we demon-strate that content and structure are stored in a dissociative manner with distinct characteristics throughout WM process. First, each tone in the sequence is associated with two codes in parallel, characterizing its frequency and ordinal position, respectively. Second, during retention, a structural retrocue successfully reactivates structure but not content, whereas a fol-lowing white noise triggers content but not structure. Third, structure representation remains stable, whereas content code undergoes a dynamic transformation through memory progress. Finally, the noise-triggered content reactivations during retention correlate with subsequent WM behavior. Overall, our results support distinct content and structure representations in auditory WM and provide an efficient approach to access the silently stored WM information in the human brain. The dis-sociation of content and structure could facilitate efficient memory formation via generalizing stable structure to new audi-tory contents.

Although cariprazine is clinically classified as a low-somnolence drug, to date no detailed polysomnographic study is available on its effect on sleep. Aims: This study examined the acute systemic effects of cariprazine on the rat sleep architecture and electroencephalography spectral power. Methods: Sprague Dawley rats were recorded during their normal sleep period for four hours, and their sleep stages were classified. Results: Cariprazine (0.3 mg/kg i.p.) reduced the time spent in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and increased REM latency. This dose of cariprazine decreased the gamma (40-80 Hz) band frequency oscillations and increased the theta (4-9 Hz) and alpha (9-15 Hz) frequencies during the wake periods but not during slow-wave sleep. The 0.03 mg/kg dose of cariprazine only increased the alpha power during the wake periods, while the 0.003 mg/kg dose was without any effect. Conclusion: Taken together, the present results suggest that the REM-suppressing effect of cariprazine may be related to its effectiveness in improving depressive symptoms, as various drugs with similar REM-reducing properties effectively treat the depressive state, whereas the gamma power-reducing effect of cariprazine may be indicative of its efficacy in schizophrenia or mania, as similar effects have been observed with other D-2 and 5-HT2 receptor antagonist drugs. These data contribute to our understanding of the complex mechanism of action that may stand behind the clinical efficacy of cariprazine.

Although disrupted thalamic function is a suggested important pathophysiological mechanism underlying schizophrenia, knowledge regarding the TCD model in schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD) patients and individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis is limited. A total of 169 SSD patients, 106 individuals at CHR for psychosis, and 105 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state electroencephalography recordings. We performed mean global field power (MGFP) spectral analysis between 1 and 49 Hz as well as source-level theta phase-gamma amplitude coupling (TGC) analysis and compared resting-state oscillatory patterns across groups. Correlations between altered TGC values and psychotic symptom severity in the patient group were investigated. Spectral MGFP of low- and high-frequencies was larger in the SSD and CHR groups than in the HC group. The TGC of SSD patients was greater than that of HCs in the right frontal, right parietal, and left and right limbic lobes. Greater TGC in the right frontal and limbic lobes was associated with positive symptom severity in SSD patients. However, TGC in the CHR group was comparable to that in the HCs and was smaller than that in the SSD group in widespread cortical regions. The TCD pattern may be apparent after frank psychotic disorder onset in tandem with overt positive symptoms. A psychosis-risk state without overt psychotic symptoms could be characterized by abnormally increased low- and high-frequency activities with relatively preserved TGC.

We previously identified that methoxetamine (MXE), a ketamine analog, and an N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, produced rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in mice. MXE (R, S (+/-)-MXE) is a racemic mixture containing equal parts of S (+)-MXE and R (-)-MXE. However, studies have yet to investigate the antidepressant effects of its enantiomers. Here, we examined the potential antidepressant properties and behavioral side effects of S- and R-MXE in mice. Both S- and R-MXE showed significant NMDA receptor affinity and appreciable inhibitory activity on serotonin transporter. Also, S- and R-MXE (10 mg kg-1) exerted antidepressant effects and increased gamma waves (electroencephalography) but were inhibited by NBQX (an AMPA receptor antagonist). Subsequently, they increased mammalian target of rapamycin phosphorylation and AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2 protein levels in the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, they increased 5HT2a and 5HT2c receptor mRNA levels in the prefrontal cortex, with their antidepressant effects inhibited by ketanserin (a 5HT2a/c receptor antagonist). Taken together, S-MXE and R-MXE elicit antidepressant effects that are probably mediated via glutamatergic and serotonergic mechanisms. Unlike S-MXE, R-MXE did not induce prepulse inhibition deficits, hyperlocomotion, conditioned place preference, and locomotor sensitization, although it acutely altered motor coordination. This suggests that R-MXE induces fewer behavioral side effects and is a safer antidepressant than S-MXE. Overall, this study provides significant implications for future research on the next generation of rapid-acting, glutamate-based antidepressant drugs.

J	Yu, YY; Yuan, CX; Gu, C				Yu, YangYang; Yuan, CanXing; Gu, Chao			Clinical efficacy and safety of removing blood stasis and removing phlegm in the treatment of epilepsy with cognitive impairment A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis	MEDICINE			English	Review						effectiveness; epilepsy with cognitive impairment; removing blood stasis and phlegm; safety	BIAS	Background: Epilepsy is a chronic encephalopathy caused by abnormal discharge of neurons in the brain, resulting in brain dysfunction. Cognitive impairment is one of the most common complications of epilepsy. The current treatment of epilepsy in the control of symptoms at the same time cause a lot of side effects, especially the aggravation of cognitive impairment. Many literatures have stated that the efficacy and safety of integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine in the treatment of epilepsy with cognitive impairment is superior to that of western medicine alone. In this systematic review, we intend to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of removing stasis and resolving phlegm in the treatment of epilepsy with cognitive impairment. Methods: We will search The Cochrane Library, EMbase, Pubmed, Web of Science, Chinese Journal Full-Text Database (CNKI), Wanfang Database, and VIP database. Simultaneously we will retrieval relevant meeting minutes, eligible research reference lists, symposium abstracts, and gray literatures. We will not apply any restrictions to the language and publication date. All randomized controlled trials about the efficacy and safety of removing blood stasis and phlegm in the treatment of epilepsy with cognitive impairment will be included. Two authors will independently carry out. Any objections will be worked out by a third author through consultation. We will use the Revman 5.3 and Stata 13.0 software for data synthesis, sensitivity analysis, meta regression, subgroup analysis, and risk of bias assessment. The grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation standard will be used to evaluate the quality of evidence. Results: This systematic review will synthesize the data from the present eligible high quality randomized controlled trials to assess whether the treatment of removing blood stasis and phlegm is effective and safety for epilepsy with cognitive impairment from various evaluation aspects including clinical efficacy of epilepsy, EEG improvement rate, MOCA score, QOLIE-31 cognitive function score, traditional Chinese medicine symptom score, incidence of adverse reactions, frequency of seizures of epilepsy, and duration of seizure of epilepsy. Conclusion: The systematic review will provide evidence to assess the efficacy and safety of removing blood stasis and phlegm in the treatment of patients with epilepsy with cognitive impairment.

Only the Fastest Corticospinal Fibers Contribute to beta Corticomuscular Coherence	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						beta rhythm; corticomuscular coherence; corticospinal tract; electroencephalography; electromyography; motor units	MONKEY MOTOR CORTEX; SURFACE EMG; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; TIME-DELAY; MUSCLES; TASK; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; PATHWAYS; MACAQUE	Human corticospinal transmission is commonly studied using brain stimulation. However, this approach is biased to activity in the fastest conducting axons. It is unclear whether conclusions obtained in this context are representative of volitional activity in mild-to-moderate contractions. An alternative to overcome this limitation may be to study the corticospinal transmission of endogenously generated brain activity. Here, we investigate in humans (N = 19; of either sex), the transmission speeds of cortical beta rhythms (similar to 20 Hz) traveling to arm (first dorsal interosseous) and leg (tibialis anterior; TA) muscles during tonic mild contractions. For this purpose, we propose two improvements for the estimation of corticomuscular beta transmission delays. First, we show that the cumulant density (cross-covariance) is more accurate than the commonly-used directed coherence to estimate transmission delays in bidirectional systems transmitting band-limited signals. Second, we show that when spiking motor unit activity is used instead of interference electromyography, corticomuscular transmission delay estimates are unaffected by the shapes of the motor unit action potentials (MUAPs). Applying these improvements, we show that descending corticomuscular beta transmission is only 1-2 ms slower than expected from the fastest corticospinal pathways. In the last part of our work, we show results from simulations using estimated distributions of the conduction velocities for descending axons projecting to lower motoneurons (from macaque histologic measurements) to suggest two scenarios that can explain fast corticomuscular transmission: either only the fastest corticospinal axons selectively transmit beta activity, or else the entire pool does. The implications of these two scenarios for our understanding of corticomuscular interactions are discussed.

Theta Phase Synchrony Is Sensitive to Corollary Discharge Abnormalities in Early Illness Schizophrenia but Not in the Psychosis Risk Syndrome	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						oscillations; N1; delusions; phase resetting; power; psychosis risk syndrome		Background: Prior studies have shown that the auditory N1 event-related potential component elicited by self-generated vocalizations is reduced relative to played back vocalizations, putatively reflecting a corollary discharge mechanism. Schizophrenia patients and psychosis risk syndrome (PRS) youth show deficient N1 suppression during vocalization, consistent with corollary discharge dysfunction. Because N1 is an admixture of theta (4-7 Hz) power and phase synchrony, we examined their contributions to N1 suppression during vocalization, as well as their sensitivity, relative to N1, to corollary discharge dysfunction in schizophrenia and PRS individuals.Methods. Theta phase and power values were extracted from electroencephalography data acquired from PRS youth (n = 71), early illness schizophrenia patients (ESZ; n = 84), and healthy controls (HCs; n = 103) as they said "ah" (Talk) and then listened to the playback of their vocalizations (Listen). A principal component analysis extracted theta intertrial coherence (ITC; phase consistency) and event-related spectral power, peaking in the N1 latency range. Talk-Listen suppression scores were analyzed.Resufts: Talk-Listen suppression was greater for theta ITC (Cohen's d = 1.46) than for N1 in HC (d = 0.63). Both were deficient in ESZ, but only N1 suppression was deficient in PRS. When deprived of variance shared with theta ITC suppression, N1 suppression no longer differentiated ESZ and PRS individuals from HC. Deficits in theta ITC suppression were correlated with delusions (P = .007) in ESZ. Theta power suppression did not differentiate groups.Conclusions. Theta ITC-suppression during vocalization is a more sensitive index of corollary discharge-mediated auditory cortical suppression than N1 suppression and is more sensitive to corollary discharge dysfunction in ESZ than in PRS individuals.

However, its role in processing non-emotional conflict is not well understood. Previous studies have utilized the Stroop Task to examine brain modulation of humans under the color-word conflict scenario, which is non-emotional conflict processing, and found hippocampal theta-band (4-7 Hz) modulation. This study aims to survey amygdaloid theta power changes during non-emotional conflict processing using intracranial depth electrodes in nine epileptic patients (3 female; age 20-62). All patients were asked to perform a modified Stroop task. During task performance, local field potential (LFP) data was recorded from macro contacts sampled at 2 K Hz and used for analysis. Mean theta power change from baseline was compared between the incongruent and congruent task condition groups using a paired sample t-test. Seven patients were available for analysis after artifact exclusion. In five out of seven patients, statistically significant increases in theta-band power from baseline were noted during the incongruent task condition (paired sample t-test p < 0.001), including one patient exhibiting theta power increases in both task conditions. Average response time was 1.07 s (failure trials) and 1.04 s (success trials). No speed-accuracy tradeoff was noted in this analysis. These findings indicate that human amygdaloid theta-band modulation may play a role in processing non-emotional conflict. It builds directly upon work suggesting that the amygdala processes emotional conflict and provides a neurophysiological mechanism for non-emotional conflict processing as well.

J	Senftleben, U; Scherbaum, S				Senftleben, Ulrike; Scherbaum, Stefan			Mid-frontal Theta during Conflict in a Value-based Decision Task	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; COMPUTATIONAL MODEL; FRONTAL THETA; ACTION DYNAMICS; CHOICE; TIME; OSCILLATIONS; DIFFICULTY; POWER; INTERFERENCE	Mid-frontal theta is a sensitive marker for cognitive conflict. However, most research focuses on cognitive control paradigms (e.g., the Flanker task). Here, we ask if mid-frontal theta is also sensitive to response conflicts within value-based decision-making. We recorded electroencephalography activity during a value-based binary decision task. In this task, participants collected rewards in a virtual two-dimensional world. In each trial, we presented two reward options that were either quick to collect but were smaller in value, or took longer to collect but were larger in value. The subjective value of each option was driven by the options' value and how quickly it could be reached. We used this task to investigate three types of potential conflicts: choice ambiguity, choice repetitions, and temporal delay. We manipulated choice ambiguity by varying the subjective values of the decision options. For choice repetition, we biased participants toward one option for two trials and then tested how that affected the subsequent decision. We manipulated temporal delay by making one option quick to collect and one longer to collect. The behavioral results showed the expected effects: Decision times were shorter for unambiguous choices, participants showed a tendency to repeat the previous choice and decision times were shorter for repetitions, and decision times were shorter for earlier available choices. Response-locked mid-frontal theta power was increased for choice switches as compared to choice repetitions, and for the later available as compared to the earlier available option, but we found no effect of ambiguity.

We investigated the effect of EPI noise on resting state activity and connectivity using magnetoencephalography (MEG), by reproducing the acoustic characteristics of rs-fMRI environment during the recordings. As compared to fMRI, MEG has little sensitivity to brain activity generated in deep brain structures, but has the advantage to capture both the dynamic of cortical magnetic oscillations with high temporal resolution and the slow magnetic fluctuations highly correlated with BOLD signal. Methods: Thirty healthy subjects were enrolled in a counterbalanced design study including three conditions: a) silent resting state (Silence), b) resting state upon EPI noise (fMRI), and c) resting state upon white noise (White). White noise was employed to test the specificity of fMRI noise effect. The amplitude envelope correlation (AEC) in alpha band measured the connectivity of seven Resting State Networks (RSN) of interest (default mode network, dorsal attention network, language, left and right auditory and left and right sensory-motor). Vigilance dynamic was estimated from power spectral activity. Results: fMRI and White acoustic noise consistently reduced connectivity of cortical networks. The effects were widespread, but noise and network specificities were also present. For fMRI noise, decreased connectivity was found in the right auditory and sensory-motor networks. Progressive increase of slow theta-delta activity related to drowsiness was found in all conditions, but was significantly higher for fMRI. Theta-delta significantly and positively correlated with variations of cortical connectivity. Discussion: rs-fMRI connectivity is biased by unavoidable environmental factors during scanning, which warrant more careful control and improved experimental designs. MEG is free from acoustic noise and allows a sensitive estimation of resting state connectivity in cortical areas. Although underutilized, MEG could overcome issues related to noise during fMRI, in particular when investigation of motor and auditory networks is needed.

Reorganization of Brain Functional Connectivity Network and Vision Restoration Following Combined tACS-tDCS Treatment After Occipital Stroke	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						brain networks; vision recovery; stroke; neuron rehabilitation; tACS; tDCS	DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; ALTERNATING-CURRENT STIMULATION; INTER-SUBJECT VARIABILITY; RECOVERY; THERAPY; SAFETY; ENHANCEMENT; MODULATION; ACTIVATION; IMPAIRMENT	Objective: Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is already known to improve visual field functions in patients with optic nerve damage and partially restores the organization of brain functional connectivity networks (FCNs). However, because little is known if NIBS is effective also following brain damage, we now studied the correlation between visual field recovery and FCN reorganization in patients with stroke of the central visual pathway.</p> Method: In a controlled, exploratory trial, 24 patients with hemianopia were randomly assigned to one of three brain stimulation groups: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)/transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) (ACDC); sham tDCS/tACS (AC); sham tDCS/sham tACS (Sham), which were compared to age-matched controls (n = 24). Resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) was collected at baseline, after 10 days stimulation and at 2 months follow-up. EEG recordings were analyzed for FCN measures using graph theory parameters, and FCN small worldness of the network and long pairwise coherence parameter alterations were then correlated with visual field performance.</p> Result: ACDC enhanced alpha-band FCN strength in the superior occipital lobe of the lesioned hemisphere at follow-up. A negative correlation (r = -0.80) was found between the intact visual field size and characteristic path length (CPL) after ACDC with a trend of decreased alpha-band centrality of the intact middle occipital cortex. ACDC also significantly decreased delta band coherence between the lesion and the intact occipital lobe, and coherence was enhanced between occipital and temporal lobe of the intact hemisphere in the low beta band. Responders showed significantly higher strength in the low alpha band at follow-up in the intact lingual and calcarine cortex and in the superior occipital region of the lesioned hemisphere.</p> Conclusion: While ACDC decreases delta band coherence between intact and damaged occipital brain areas indicating inhibition of low-frequency neural oscillations, ACDC increases FCN connectivity between the occipital and temporal lobe in the intact hemisphere. When taken together with the lower global clustering coefficient in responders, these findings suggest that FCN reorganization (here induced by NIBS) is adaptive in stroke. It leads to greater efficiency of neural processing, where the FCN requires fewer connections for visual processing.</p>	[Xu, Jiahua; Wu, Zheng; Sabel, Bernhard A.] Otto V Guericke Univ Magdeburg, Med Fac, Inst Med Psychol, Magdeburg, Germany; [Xu, Jiahua; Wu, Zheng; Nuernberger, Andreas] Otto V Guericke Univ Magdeburg, Fac Comp Sci, Magdeburg, Germany		Sabel, BA (corresponding author), Otto V Guericke Univ Magdeburg, Med Fac, Inst Med Psychol, Magdeburg, Germany.	bernhard.sabel@med.ovgu.de							94	0	0	6	10	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND	1664-2295			FRONT NEUROL	Front.

Altered electroencephalographic networks in developmental dyslexia after remedial training: a prospective case-control study	NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH			English	Article						adjusted post-training network; developmental dyslexia; EEG; frequency oscillations; functional connectivity; visual training tasks; visual word/pseudoword discrimination	GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; COMPLEX BRAIN NETWORKS; MINIMUM SPANNING TREE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RESTING-STATE; EEG; CHILDREN; ORGANIZATION; METAANALYSIS; REGIONS	Electroencephalographic studies using graph theoretic analysis have found aberrations in functional connectivity in children with developmental dyslexia. However, how the training with visual tasks can change the functional connectivity of the semantic network in developmental dyslexia is still unclear. We looked for differences in local and global topological properties of functional networks between 21 healthy controls and 22 dyslexic children (8-9 years old) before and after training with visual tasks in this prospective case-control study. The minimum spanning tree method was used to construct the subjects' brain networks in multiple electroencephalographic frequency ranges during a visual word/pseudoword discrimination task. We found group differences in the theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands for four graph measures suggesting a more integrated network topology in dyslexics before the training compared to controls. After training, the network topology of dyslexic children had become more segregated and similar to that of the controls. In the theta, alpha and beta 1-frequency bands, compared to the controls, the pre-training dyslexics exhibited a reduced degree and betweenness centrality of the left anterior temporal and parietal regions. The simultaneous appearance in the left hemisphere of hubs in temporal and parietal (alpha, beta 1), temporal and superior frontal cortex (theta, alpha), parietal and occipitotemporal cortices (beta 1), identified in the networks of normally developing children was not present in the brain networks of dyslexics. After training, the hub distribution for dyslexics in the theta and beta1 bands had become similar to that of the controls. In summary, our findings point to a less efficient network configuration in dyslexics compared to a more optimal global organization in the controls. This is the first study to investigate the topological organization of functional brain networks of Bulgarian dyslexic children.

A Power Spectral Density and multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis	HELIYON			English	Article						Multiscale entropy; Power Spectral Density; Aristotle's syllogism; ASD-ADHD; Systems of thinking I&II; Cognitive load	DUAL-PROCESS THEORIES; MENTAL MODELS; DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; FUNCTIONING AUTISM; BAND OSCILLATIONS; EEG COMPLEXITY; WORKING-MEMORY; EFFICIENCY; SAMPLE; THETA	Objective: We aim to investigate whether EEG dynamics differ in adults with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders), ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder), compared with healthy subjects during the performance of an innovative cognitive task: Aristotle's valid and invalid syllogisms. We follow the Neuroanatomical differences type of criterion in assessing the results of our study in supporting or not the dual-process theory of Kahneman, 2011) (Systems I & II of thinking). Method: We recorded EEGs from 14 scalp electrodes in 30 adults with ADHD, 30 with ASD and 24 healthy, normal subjects. The subjects were exposed in a set of innovative cognitive tasks (inducing varying cognitive loads), the Aristotle's four types of syllogism mentioned above. The multiscale entropy (MSE), a nonlinear informationtheoretic measure or tool was computed to extract features that quantify the complexity of the EEG. Results: The dynamics of the curves of the grand average of MSE values of the ADHD and ASD participants was significantly in higher levels for the majority of time scales, than the healthy subjects over a number of brain regions (electrodes locations), during the performance of both valid and invalid types of syllogism. This result is seemingly not in accordance of the broadly accepted 'theory' of complexity loss in 'pathological' subjects, but actually this is not the case as explained in the text. ADHD subjects are engaged in System II of thinking, for both Valid and Invalid syllogism, ASD and Control in System I for valid and invalid syllogism, respectively. A surprising and 'provocative' result of this paper, as shown in the next sections, is that the Complexity-variability of ASD and ADHD subjects, when they face Aristotle's types of syllogisms, is higher than that of the control subjects. An explanation is suggested as described in the text. Also, in the case of invalid type of Aristotelian syllogisms, the linguistic and visuo-spatial systems are both engaged ONLY in the temporal and occipital regions of the brain, respectively, of ADHD subjects. In the case of valid type, both above systems are engaged in the temporal and occipital regions of the brain, respectively, of both ASD and ADHD subjects, while in the control subjects only the visuo-spatial type is engaged (Goel et al., 2000; Knauff, 2007). Conclusion: Based on the results of the analysis described in this work, the differences in the EEG complexity between the three groups of participants lead to the conclusion that cortical information processing is changed in ASD and ADHD adults, therefore their level of cortical activation may be insufficient to meet the peculiar cognitive demand of Aristotle's reasoning. Significance: The present paper suggest that MSE, is a powerful and efficient nonlinear measure in detecting neural dysfunctions in adults with ASD and ADHD characteristics, when they are called on to perform in a very demanding as well as innovative set of cognitive tasks, that can be considered as a new diagnostic 'benchmark' in helping detecting more effectively such type of disorders. A linear measure alone, as the typical PSD, is not capable in making such a distinction. The work contributes in shedding light on the neural mechanisms of syllogism/reasoning of Aristotelian type, as well as toward understanding how humans reason logically and why 'pathological' subjects deviate from the norms of formal logic.

Studies showed that this activation enhances the early cortical processing of co-localized visual stimuli presented after, reflected by better detection rates, better discrimination, and sharper perceived contrast. We replicated the ACOP, using earphones, and tested whether auditory cuing can influence temporal order judgments (TOJ) for two visual stimuli (horizontal arrangement) as well as if the ACOP would predict the amplitude of this influence. A lateral salient sound was followed, after 150 or 630 ms, by the visual presentation of a pair of disks, one in left and one in right hemifield, with variable SOA. The TOJ task was to indicate which disk appeared first or which disk appeared second (controlling for response bias). We observed an ACOP at posterior electrode sites and confirmed our hypothesis that the lateral sound influenced TOJ by accelerating the perception of the disk presented on the cued side, even though the sound was irrelevant to the task. Furthermore, the ACOP amplitude was correlated to this visual perceptual change, indicating that a larger change in brain activity was associated with a faster processing of co-localized visual stimuli.

This paper summarizes the various ways to use acoustic input before sleep or stimulation during sleep. It thereby focuses on the respective methodological requirements, advantages, disadvantages, potentials and difficulties of acoustic sleep mod-ulation. It highlights differences in subjective and objective outcome measures, immediate and whole night effects and short versus long term effects. This recognizes the fact that not all outcome parameters are relevant in every research field. The same applies to conclusions drawn from other outcome dimensions, consideration of mediating factors, levels of stimula-tion processing and the impact of inter-individual differences. In addition to the deliberate influences of acoustic input on sleep, one paragraph describes adverse environmental acous-tic influences. Finally, the possibilities for clinical and basic research-related applications are discussed, and emerging opportunities are presented. This overview is not a systematic review but aims to present the current perspective and hence summarizes the most up-to -date research results and reviews. This is the first review providing a summary of the broad spectrum of possibilities to acoustically influence sleep.

However, individuals with schizophrenia suffer from impairments in MSI, which could explain typical symptoms like hallucination and reality distortion. Because the neural correlates of aberrant MSI in schizophrenia help us understand the physiognomy of this psychiatric disorder, we performed a systematic review of the current research on this subject. The literature search concerned investigated MSI in diagnosed schizophrenia patients compared to healthy controls using brain imaging. Seventeen of 317 identified studies were finally included. To assess risk of bias, the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment was used, and the review was written according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA). The results indicated that multisensory processes in schizophrenia are associated with aberrant, mainly reduced, neural activity in several brain regions, as measured by event-related potentials, oscillations, activity and connectivity. The conclusion is that a fronto-temporal region, comprising the frontal inferior gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus/sulcus, along with the fusiform gyrus and dorsal visual stream in the occipital-parietal lobe are possible key regions of deficient MSI in schizophrenia.

J	Grigg-Damberger, M; Foldvary-Schaefer, N				Grigg-Damberger, Madeleine; Foldvary-Schaefer, Nancy			Bidirectional relationships of sleep and epilepsy in adults with epilepsy	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Review						Sleep; Epilepsy; Sleep disorders; Polysomnography; Circadian rhythms; Electroencepalography		This targeted review addresses the best accepted and most intriguing recent observations on the complex relationships between sleep and epilepsy. Ten to 15% of all epilepsies are sleep-related. Included in these is sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy, renamed from nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy by a 2016 consensus conference since 30% of cases are extra-frontal, seizures are related to sleep rather than clock time, and the predominant semiology is hypermotor. Stereo-EEG is providing crucial insights into network activation in sleep-related epilepsies and definition of the epileptogenic zone. Pathologic high-frequency oscillations, a promising biomarker for identifying the epileptogenic zone, are most frequent in NREM sleep, lowest in wakefulness and REM sleep, similar to interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Most sleep-related seizures are followed by awakening or arousal and IEDs cause arousals and increase after arousals, likely contributing to sleep/wake complaints. Sleep/wake disorders are 2-3 times more common in adults with epilepsy than the general population; these comorbidities are associated with poorer quality of life and may impact seizure control. Treatment of sleep apnea reduces seizures in many cases. An emerging area of research is in circadian biology and epilepsy. Over 90% of people with epilepsy have seizures with circadian periodicity, in part related to sleep itself, and the majority of SUDEP cases occur in sleep. Recognizing these bidirectional relationships is important for patient and caregiver education and counseling and optimizing epilepsy outcomes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The aim of this work is to assess the relationship between rhythm propagation, FC and brain functioning using data generated from neural mass models of connected Regions of Interest (ROIs). We simulated networks of four interconnected ROIs, each with a different intrinsic rhythm (in theta, alpha, beta and gamma ranges). Connectivity was estimated using eight estimators and the relationship between structural connectivity and FC was assessed as a function of the connectivity strength and of the inputs to the ROIs. Results show that the Granger estimation provides the best accuracy, with a good capacity to evaluate the connectivity strength. However, the estimated values strongly depend on the input to the ROIs and hence on nonlinear phenomena. When a population works in the linear region, its capacity to transmit a rhythm increases drastically. Conversely, when it saturates, oscillatory activity becomes strongly affected by rhythms incoming from other regions. Changes in functional connectivity do not always reflect a physical change in the synapses. A unique connectivity network can propagate rhythms in very different ways depending on the specific working conditions.

However, to be applicable in these contexts, the machine learning methods must provide a degree of insight into their decision-making processes during training and deployment phases. We propose the use of a hierarchical architecture with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) for explainable multiclass classification of neural states. This approach provides both local and global explainability and is suitable for identifying neurophysiological biomarkers, for assessing models based on established domain knowledge during development, and for validation during deployment. We develop a hierarchical classifier composed of multilayer perceptrons (MLP) for sleep stage classification using rodent electroencephalogram (EEG) data and compare this implementation to a standard multiclass MLP classifier with LRP. The hierarchical classifier obtained explainability results that better aligned with domain knowledge than the standard multiclass classifier. It identified alpha (10-12 Hz), theta (5-9 Hz), and beta (13-30 Hz) and theta as key features for discriminating awake versus sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) versus non-REM (NREM), respectively. The standard multiclass MLP did not identify any key frequency bands for the NREM and REM classes, but did identify delta (1-4 Hz), theta, and alpha as more important than beta, slow-gamma (31-55 Hz), and fast-gamma (65-100Hz) oscillations. The two methods obtained comparable classification performance. These results suggest that LRP with hierarchical classifiers is a promising approach to identifying biomarkers that differentiate multiple neurophysiological states.

A non-invasive olfactory bulb measure dissociates Parkinson's patients from healthy controls and discloses disease duration	NPJ PARKINSONS DISEASE			English	Article							ODOR IDENTIFICATION; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; DYSFUNCTION; IMPAIRMENT; SYSTEM; DISCRIMINATION; BIOMARKERS; GAMMA; EEG	Olfactory dysfunction is a prevalent non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). This dysfunction is a result of neurodegeneration within the olfactory bulb (OB), the first processing area of the central olfactory system, and commonly precedes the characteristic motor symptoms in PD by several years. Functional measurements of the OB could therefore potentially be used as an early biomarker for PD. Here, we used a non-invasive method, so-called electrobulbogram (EBG), to measure OB function in PD and age-matched healthy controls to assess whether EBG measures can dissociate PDs from controls. We estimated the spectrogram of the EBG signal during exposure to odor in PD (n = 20) and age-matched controls (n = 18) as well as identified differentiating patterns of odor-related synchronization in the gamma, beta, and theta frequency bands. Moreover, we assessed if these PD-EBG components could dissociate PD from control as well as their relationship with PD characteristics. We identified six EBG components during the initial and later stages of odor processing which dissociated PD from controls with 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity with links to PD characteristics. These PD-EBG components were related to medication, disease duration, and severity, as well as clinical odor identification performance. These findings support using EBG as a tool to experimentally assess PD interventions, potentially aid diagnosis, and the potential development of EBG into an early biomarker for PD.

Occipital neural dynamics in cannabis and alcohol use: independent effects of addiction	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							VISUAL-ATTENTION; OSCILLATIONS; EEG; BRAIN; MEG; MECHANISMS; MARIJUANA; BIOMARKERS; MOTION; AUDIT	Alcohol and cannabis use disorder (AUD/CUD) are two of the most common addictive disorders. While studies are beginning to understand the neural changes related to acute and chronic use, few studies have examined the independent effects of AUD and CUD on neural oscillatory activity. We examined 45 adults who reported current use of both cannabis and alcohol. Participants underwent the SCID-V to determine whether they met criteria for AUD and/or CUD. Participants also completed a visual-spatial processing task while undergoing magnetoencephalography (MEG). ANCOVA with a 2 x 2 design was then used to identify the main effects of AUD and CUD on source-level oscillatory activity. Of the 45 adults, 17 met criteria for AUD, and 26 met criteria for CUD. All participants, including comparison groups, reported use of both cannabis and alcohol. Statistical analyses showed a main effect of AUD, such that participants with AUD displayed a blunted occipital alpha (8-16 Hz) response. Post-hoc testing showed this decreased alpha response was related to increased AUD symptoms, above and beyond amount of use. No effects of AUD or CUD were identified in visual theta or gamma activity. In conclusion, AUD was associated with reduced alpha responses and scaled with increasing severity, independent of CUD. These findings indicate that alpha oscillatory activity may play an integral part in networks affected by alcohol addiction.

Although children express higher levels of REM sleep and N3, it is still not understood why sleep does not benefit the consolidation of motor memory in children as in adults. Here, we aimed to manipulate sleep by daytime physical exercise in typically developing boys (N = 12; range 9-12 yrs) to test the impact on sleep and motor learning. The manipulation consisted of 1 h of intense ergometer exercise during the daytime before a night of restorative sleep. In a rest control condition, children were seated comfortably and listened to an audio drama. Motor learning was assessed with a visuomotor finger sequence tapping task; in both conditions learning took place before either exercise or rest. Prior to sleep in the sleep laboratory, motor memory was assessed as a baseline. Motor memory was again collected in the morning after a night of sleep in the lab. While there was no change in N3, we found prolonged REM sleep latency after physical activity compared to rest, corresponding to a prolonged first sleep cycle. With respect to motor learning, we found superior accuracy of motor performance after physical exercise compared to rest. Our findings suggest that physical exercise during the daytime stabilizes sleep-dependent motor learning.

Therefore, we investigated in a paediatric population whether stimulation success of multichannel tDCS over the lDLPFC depends on concurrent task performance and individual head anatomy. In a randomised, sham-controlled, double-blind crossover study 22 healthy participants (10-17 years) received 2 mA multichannel anodal tDCS (atDCS) over the lDLPFC with and without a 2-back working memory (WM) task. After stimulation, the 2-back task and a Flanker task were performed. Resting state and task-related EEG were recorded. In 16 participants we calculated the individual electric field (E-field) distribution. Performance and neurophysiological activity in the 2-back task were not affected by atDCS. atDCS reduced reaction times in the Flanker task, independent of whether atDCS had been combined with the 2-back task. Flanker task related beta oscillation increased following stimulation without 2-back task performance. atDCS effects were not correlated with the E-field. We found no effect of multichannel atDCS over the lDLPFC on WM in children/adolescents but a transfer effect on interference control. While this effect on behaviour was independent of concurrent task performance, neurophysiological activity might be more sensitive to cognitive activation during stimulation. However, our results are limited by the small sample size, the lack of an active control group and variations in WM performance.

With many claims based on the anodal-excitation and cathodal-inhibition dichotomy originally observed in the motor cortex, surprisingly few studies have examined these fundamental polarity-specific effects beyond the motor cortex. The after-effects of tDCS on the visual cortex are of particular interest because of their potential application to vision restoration and migraine treatment. Yet the limited studies revealed conflicting results. Here we investigated whether polarity-specific tDCS effects exist in the visual cortex. In a counterbalanced within-subject crossover design, 20 healthy subjects each completed three sessions of anodal, cathodal and sham tDCS (2 mA for 20 min) applied over the visual cortex. Pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (VEP) and their habituation slopes were measured at five time-points immediately before, after and every 15 min following the end of tDCS. Compared to sham, we found no significant tDCS induced after-effects on VEP amplitudes or habituation slopes, supported by strong evidence from Bayesian statistics. Neither were there any after-effects of tDCS on EEG power of the frequency of stimulus presentation, theta or alpha band. In conclusion, our results challenge previous findings of robust polarity-dependent after-effects of tDCS over the visual cortex.

J	Robinson, PA				Robinson, P. A.			Discrete spectral eigenmode-resonance network of brain dynamics and connectivity	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							NEURAL FIELD-THEORY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; EEG RESPONSES; DEFAULT-MODE; FREQUENCY; PHASE; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; INFORMATION	The problem of finding a compact natural representation of brain dynamics and connectivity is addressed using an expansion in terms of physical spatial eigenmodes and their frequency resonances. It is demonstrated that this discrete expansion via the system transfer function enables linear and nonlinear dynamics to be analyzed in compact form in terms of natural dynamic "atoms," each of which is a frequency resonance of an eigenmode. Because these modal resonances are determined by the system dynamics, not the investigator, they are privileged over widely used phenomenological patterns, and obviate the need for artificial discretizations and thresholding in coordinate space. It is shown that modal resonances participate as nodes of a discrete spectral network, are noninteracting in the linear regime, but are linked nonlinearly by wave-wave coalescence and decay processes. The modal resonance formulation is shown to be capable of speeding numerical calculations of strongly nonlinear interactions. Recent work in brain dynamics, especially based on neural field theory (NFT) approaches, allows eigenmodes and their resonances to be estimated from data without assuming a specific brain model. This means that dynamic equations can be inferred using system identification methods from control theory, rather than being assumed, and resonances can be interpreted as control-systems data filters. The results link brain activity and connectivity with control-systems functions such as prediction and attention via gain control and can also be linked to specific NFT predictions if desired, thereby providing a convenient bridge between physiologically based theories and experiment. Amplitudes of modes and resonances can also be tracked to provide a more direct and temporally localized representation of the dynamics than correlations and covariances, which are widely used in the field. By synthesizing many different lines of research, this work provides a way to link quantitative electrophysiological and imaging measurements, connectivity, brain dynamics, and function. This underlines the need to move between coordinate and spectral representations as required. Moreover, standard theoretical-physics approaches and mathematical methods can be used in place of ad hoc statistical measures such as those based on graph theory of artificially discretized and decimated networks, which are highly prone to selection effects and artifacts.

In rodent models, various metrics have been used to quantify inter-regional neuronal communication. However, in individual studies, typically, only very few measures of coupling are reported and, hence, redundancy across such indicators is implicitly assumed. Results In order to test this assumption, we here comparatively assessed a broad range of directional and non-directional metrics like coherence, Weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI), phase-locking value (PLV), pairwise phase consistency (PPC), parametric and non-parametric Granger causality (GC), partial directed coherence (PDC), directed transfer function (DTF), spike-phase coupling (SPC), cross-regional phase-amplitude coupling, amplitude cross-correlations and others. We applied these analyses to simultaneous field recordings from the prefrontal cortex and the ventral and dorsal hippocampus in the schizophrenia-related Gria1-knockout mouse model which displays a robust novelty-induced hyperconnectivity phenotype. Using the detectability of coupling deficits in Gria1(-/-) mice and bivariate correlations within animals as criteria, we found that across such measures, there is a considerable lack of functional redundancy. Except for three pairwise correlations-PLV with PPC, PDC with DTF and parametric with non-parametric Granger causality-almost none of the analysed metrics consistently co-varied with any of the other measures across the three connections and two genotypes analysed. Notable exceptions to this were the correlation of coherence with PPC and PLV that was found in most cases, and partial correspondence between these three measures and Granger causality. Perhaps most surprisingly, partial directed coherence and Granger causality-sometimes regarded as equivalent measures of directed influence-diverged profoundly. Also, amplitude cross-correlation, spike-phase coupling and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling each yielded distinct results compared to all other metrics. Conclusions Our analysis highlights the difficulty of quantifying real correlates of inter-regional information transfer, underscores the need to assess multiple coupling measures and provides some guidelines which metrics to choose for a comprehensive, yet non-redundant characterization of functional connectivity.

As the risk and pathogenesis of AD varies greatly among different genotypes precise treatment strategies should be implemented depending upon genotype, which has not been proved by clinical studies. Apart from that, the published clinical studies are highly heterogeneous, and therefore, systematic and well-developed randomized controlled Trails (RCT) and demonstration of precise administration protocols are required. To verify this hypothesis, this project designed a RCT study, and randomly divided apoE4 carrier AD and non-carrier AD into high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS) or low-frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS) treatment groups. Specifically, 80 patients with AD, namely 48 APOE4 carriers and 32 non-APOE4 carriers will be included in the study. After that, based on different stimulation frequencies of rTMS, they will be divided into the HF-rTMS group and the LF-rTMS group, when patients with AD will be randomly assigned to different treatment groups. After AD patients are involved in the study, their memory, cognition, anxiety, depression and activities of daily living will be tested before and during 2 weeks of rTMS. Furthermore, peripheral blood will be collected before and after treatment to detect changes in pathological indexes via MSD platform (Meso Scale Discovery), while 32-channel EEG data will be also collected to detect and analyze changes in gamma oscillation. In addition, these patients will be followed up for 6 months and their neuropsychological scale was also evaluated every month. At present, our study has included 18 AD patients (10 APOE4 carriers; 8 non-carriers). Our study is still in progress. The grouping has not been unblinded. But the preliminary data demonstrated that non-carriers had better MoCA score improvement than APOE4 carriers. The results indicated that the two populations of AD patients should be treated differently. Thus, this project will provide direction for precision rTMS in AD and also promotes a shift in relevant treatment philosophy.

Methods We studied the SEEG recordings of a large series of patients (74 patients, 157 seizures) with an electrode sampling the thalamus and in some cases also the basal ganglia (caudate nucleus, 22 patients; and putamen, 4 patients). We applied visual analysis and signal quantification methods (Epileptogenicity Index [EI]) to their ictal recordings and compared electrophysiologic with clinical data. Results We found that in 86% of patients, thalamus was involved during seizures (visual analysis) and 20% showed high values of epileptogenicity (EI >0.3). Basal ganglia may also disclose high values of epileptogenicity (9% in caudate nucleus) but to a lesser degree than thalamus (p < 0.01). We observed different seizure onset patterns including low voltage high frequency activities. We found high values of thalamic epileptogenicity in different epilepsy localizations, including opercular and motor epilepsies. We found no difference between epilepsy etiologies (cryptogenic vs malformation of cortical development, p = 0.77). Thalamic epileptogenicity was correlated with the extension of epileptogenic networks (p = 0.02, rho 0.32). We found a significant effect (p < 0.05) of thalamic epileptogenicity regarding the postsurgical outcome (higher thalamic EI corresponding to higher probability of surgical failure). Conclusions Thalamic involvement during seizures is common in different seizure types. The degree of thalamic epileptogenicity is a possible marker of the epileptogenic network extension and of postsurgical prognosis.

Music interventions inclusive of music therapy (MT) have been shown to improve such symptoms, but rigorous clinical trials investigating specific music therapy methods in adult burn patients are scarce. Methods: This is a single center Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) protocol with two parallel arms. Participants are 81 adult burn patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the University Hospital Fundacion Santa Fe de Bogota in Colombia. The intervention consists of a Music Assisted Relaxation (MAR) protocol, a music therapy technique composed of entrained live music combined with a guided relaxation and/or the use of imagery. The effects of the MAR will be compared to a control group (treatment as usual) over a period of maximum 2 weeks or six interventions. The primary outcome measure is perceived background pain, as measured with a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) before and after each intervention. Secondary outcomes are anxiety and depression levels; vital signs; and the use of pain medication. Additionally, some patients in the intervention group will be invited to participate in electroencephalography, electromyography, and electrocardiography recordings during the MAR. Discussion: This study protocol follows the SPIRIT guidelines for defining items of clinical trials and is the first study in Colombia to evaluate the effects of music therapy for adult burn patients. With this RCT it is hoped to gather new knowledge about the potential of music therapy to help critical care patients cope and recover from their injuries during the hospitalization in the ICU.

Our aim was to identify meaningful biotypes of psychosis based on network properties of the electroencephalogram. We hypothesized that these parameters would be more altered in a subgroup of patients also characterized by more severe deficits in other clinical, cognitive, and biological measurements. Methods A clustering analysis was performed using the electroencephalogram-based network parameters derived from graph-theory obtained during a P300 task of 137 schizophrenia (of them, 35 first episodes) and 46 bipolar patients. Both prestimulus and modulation of the electroencephalogram were included in the analysis. Demographic, clinical, cognitive, structural cerebral data, and the modulation of the spectral entropy of the electroencephalogram were compared between clusters. Data from 158 healthy controls were included for further comparisons. Results We identified two clusters of patients. One cluster presented higher prestimulus connectivity strength, clustering coefficient, path-length, and lower small-world index compared to controls. The modulation of clustering coefficient and path-length parameters was smaller in the former cluster, which also showed an altered structural connectivity network and a widespread cortical thinning. The other cluster of patients did not show significant differences with controls in the functional network properties. No significant differences were found between patients ' clusters in first episodes and bipolar proportions, symptoms scores, cognitive performance, or spectral entropy modulation. Conclusion These data support the existence of a subgroup within psychosis with altered global properties of functional and structural connectivity.

The development of control strategies for synchronizing a network of chaotic neurons with time delays, different direction-dependent coupling (unidirectional and bidirectional), and noise, particularly under external disturbances, is an essential and very challenging task. Researchers have extensively studied the synchronization mechanism of two coupled time-delayed neurons with bidirectional coupling and without incorporating the effect of noise, but not for time-delayed neural networks. To overcome these limitations, this study investigates the synchronization problem in a network of coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons by incorporating time delays, different direction-dependent coupling (unidirectional and bidirectional), noise, and ionic and external disturbances in the mathematical models. More specifically, this study investigates the synchronization of time-delayed unidirectional and bidirectional ring-structured FHN neuronal systems with and without external noise. Different gap junctions and delay parameters are used to incorporate time-delay dynamics in both neuronal networks. We also investigate the influence of the time delays between connected neurons on synchronization conditions. Further, to ensure the synchronization of the time-delayed FHN neuronal networks, different adaptive control laws are proposed for both unidirectional and bidirectional neuronal networks. In addition, necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve synchronization are provided by employing the Lyapunov stability theory.

We here present an incidental finding from a simultaneous EEG-TMS experiment as well as a replication of this unexpected effect. Our results reveal that stimulating the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with slow repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) leads to enhanced word memory performance. A total of 40 healthy human participants engaged in a list learning paradigm. Half of the participants (N = 20) received 1 Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC, while the other half (N = 20) received 1 Hz rTMS to the vertex and served as a control group. Participants receiving left DLPFC stimulation demonstrated enhanced memory performance compared to the control group. This effect was replicated in a within-subjects experiment where 24 participants received 1 Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC and vertex. In this second experiment, DLPFC stimulation also induced better memory performance compared to vertex stimulation. In addition to these behavioural effects, we found that 1 Hz rTMS to DLPFC induced stronger beta power modulation in posterior areas, a state that is known to be beneficial for memory encoding. Further analysis indicated that beta modulations did not have an oscillatory origin. Instead, the observed beta modulations were a result of a spectral tilt, suggesting inhibition of these parietal regions. These results show that applying 1 Hz rTMS to DLPFC, an area involved in episodic memory formation, improves memory performance via modulating neural activity in parietal regions.

J	Balconi, M; Angioletti, L				Balconi, Michela; Angioletti, Laura			One's Interoception Affects the Representation of Seeing Others' Pain: A Randomized Controlled qEEG Study	PAIN RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Objective. This research demonstrates that interoceptive attentiveness (IA) can modulate cortical oscillations related to the emotional and cognitive representations of observing pain in others. Methods. Twenty participants were required to observe painful/nonpainful stimuli in an individual versus the interactive condition during the recording of the electroencephalogram. The sample was divided into experimental (EXP) and control (CTR) groups, and the EXP group was explicitly required to direct the attention on its interoceptive correlates while observing the stimuli. Results. Mixed repeated measures, analyses of variance, were applied to each EEG frequency band. Significant findings were obtained mainly for theta and beta bands for the two groups. A hemispheric lateralisation effect was found, with right lateralisation of the theta band for the EXP group when observing painful stimuli and enhanced left activation of theta and beta bands for the CTR group when observing nonpainful stimuli. For both groups, frontal cortical regions were significantly sensitive to social scenarios, while posterior parietal activation was found for stimuli depicting the individual condition. Conclusions. The results suggest that IA might enhance the emotional representation of painful stimuli, highlighting their negative and unpleasant features in the EXP group, while the attention of the CTR group was mainly drawn to nonpainful stimuli in social and individual conditions, with a positive valence. The role of frontal regions in the processing of social stimuli through social cognition, inducing emotional mirroring and requiring deeper analysis of the social context, was underlined. We propose that IA could be trained for promoting emotion regulation and empathic response.

'Sleep-dependent' memory consolidation? Brief periods of post-training rest and sleep provide an equivalent benefit for both declarative and procedural memory	LEARNING & MEMORY			English	Article							SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; REM-SLEEP; REPLAY; OSCILLATIONS; SPINDLES; RIPPLES; INTERFERENCE; HIPPOCAMPUS; IMPROVEMENT; PERFORMANCE	Sleep following learning facilitates the consolidation of memories. This effect has often been attributed to sleep-specific factors, such as the presence of sleep spindles or slow waves in the electroencephalogram (EEG). However, recent studies suggest that simply resting quietly while awake could confer a similar memory benefit. In the current study, we examined the effects of sleep, quiet rest, and active wakefulness on the consolidation of declarative and procedural memory. We hypothesized that sleep and eyes-closed quiet rest would both benefit memory compared with a period of active wakefulness. After completing a declarative and a procedural memory task, participants began a 30-min retention period with PSG (polysomnographic) monitoring, in which they either slept (n = 24), quietly rested with their eyes closed (n = 22), or completed a distractor task (n = 29). Following the retention period, participants were again tested on their memory for the two learning tasks. As hypothesized, sleep and quiet rest both led to better performance on the declarative and procedural memory tasks than did the distractor task. Moreover, the performance advantages conferred by rest were indistinguishable from those of sleep. These data suggest that neurobiology specific to sleep might not be necessary to induce the consolidation of memory, at least across very short retention intervals. Instead, offline memory consolidation may function opportunistically, occurring during either sleep or stimulus-free rest, provided a favorable neurobiological milieu and sufficient reduction of new encoding.

However, it is not clear how and to what extent those mechanisms interact with each other. On the one hand, richer semantic context could enhance the perceptual representation of a predictable stimulus, thus improving speech entrainment. On the other hand, pre-activating an upcoming item could inhibit further bottom-up analyses to minimize processing costs, thus weakening speech entrainment. To test these competing hypotheses, we recorded EEG activity from 27 participants while they listened to a 14-min recording of text reading. The passage contained target words presented twice: once in a highly constraining and once in a minimally constraining context. First, we measured event related potentials on target words in the two conditions. In line with previous research, we showed that semantic predictability modulated the N400 amplitude: words in minimally constraining contexts elicited larger negative amplitudes than words in highly constraining contexts between 250 and 450 ms. Second, we evaluated speech entrainment effects by analyzing phase alignment between neural activity and the envelope of target words. Importantly, we found increased speech entrainment for words in minimally constraining compared to highly constraining contexts between 400 and 450 ms. Both effects were located in central electrodes and were significantly correlated. Our results indicate a trade-off between semantic pre-activation and cortical entrainment to speech and support the cost minimization hypothesis.

Since then, the P300 has become the focus of many basic and clinical neuroscience studies. However, despite its wide applications, the underlying function of the P300 is not yet clearly understood. One line of research among the many studies that have attempted to elucidate the underlying subroutine of the P300 in the brain has suggested that the physiological function of the P300 is related to inhibition. While some intracranial, behavioral, and event-related potential studies have provided support for this theory, little is known about the inhibitory mechanism. In this study, using alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) and effective connectivity, based on the causal (one-way directed) relationship between alpha ERD and P300 sources, we demonstrated that P300's associated inhibition is implemented at a higher information processing stage in a localized brain region. We discuss how inhibition as the primary function of the P300 is not inconsistent with 'resource allocation' and 'working memory updating' theories about its cognitive function. In light of our findings regarding the scope and information processing stage of inhibition of the P300, we reconcile the inhibitory account of the P300 with working memory updating theory. Finally, based on the compensatory behavior of alpha ERD at the time of suppression of the P300, we propose two distinct yet complementary working memory mechanisms (inhibition and desynchronizing excitation) that render target perception possible.

It underlies the understanding of other individuals? thoughts and intentions. In natural settings, individuals have to infer relevant associations that have proven to be reliable or precise predictors. Salience theory suggests that the attribution of meaning to stimulus depends on their contingency, saliency, and relevance to adaptation. So far, subjective estimates of relevance have mostly been explored in motivation and implicit learning. Mechanisms underlying formation of associations in abstract thinking with regard to their subjective relevance, or salience, are not clear. Applying novel computational methods, we investigated relevance detection in categorization tasks in 17 healthy individuals. Two models of relevance detection were developed: a conventional one with nouns from the same semantic category, an aberrant one based on an insignificant common feature. Control condition introduced non-related words. The participants were to detect either a relevant principle or an insignificant feature to group presented words. In control condition they inferred that the stimuli were irrelevant to any grouping idea. Cross-frequency phase coupling analysis revealed statistically distinct patterns of synchronization representing search and decision in the models of normal and aberrant relevance detection. Significantly distinct frontotemporal functional networks with central and parietal components in the theta and alpha frequency bands may reflect differences in relevance detection. ? 2020 Elsevier B.V. and Japan Neuroscience Society.

Methods: We analyzed 10 RPLE patients who had presurgical MEG and underwent epilepsy surgery. We quantified LRTCs with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) at four frequency bands for 200 cortical regions estimated using individual source models. We correlated individually the DFA maps to the distance from the resection area and from cortical locations of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Additionally, three clinical experts inspected the DFA maps to visually assess the most likely EZ locations. Results: The DFA maps correlated with the distance to resection area in patients with type II focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) (p < 0:05), but not in other etiologies. Similarly, the DFA maps correlated with the IED locations only in the FCD II patients. Visual analysis of the DFA maps showed high interobserver agreement and accuracy in FCD patients in assigning the affected hemisphere and lobe. Conclusions: Aberrant LRTCs correlate with the resection areas and IED locations. Significance: This methodological pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of approximating cortical LRTCs from MEG that may aid in the EZ localization and provide new non-invasive insight into the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy.

The current study aims to reveal the cortical neural activity changes in the earliest stages of conscious perception using recordings from intracranial electrodes. Epilepsy patients (N = 158) were recruited from a multi-center collaboration and completed a visual word recall task. Broadband gamma activity (40-115Hz) was extracted with a band-pass filter and gamma power was calculated across subjects on a common brain surface. Our results show early gamma power increases within 0-50ms after stimulus onset in bilateral visual processing cortex, right frontal cortex (frontal eye fields, ventral medial/frontopolar, orbital frontal) and bilateral medial temporal cortex regardless of whether the word was later recalled. At the same early times, decreases were seen in the left rostral middle frontal gyrus. At later times after stimulus onset, gamma power changes developed in multiple cortical regions. These included sustained changes in visual and other association cortical networks, and transient decreases in the default mode network most prominently at 300-650ms. In agreement with prior work in this verbal memory task, we also saw greater increases in visual and medial temporal regions as well as prominent later ( > 300ms) increases in left hemisphere language areas for recalled versus not recalled stimuli. These results suggest an early signal detection network in the frontal, medial temporal, and visual cortex is engaged at the earliest stages of conscious visual perception.

CMC is more than a measure of corticospinal tract integrity in acute stroke patients	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Afferent input; Corticomuscular coherence; Corticospinal tract integrity; Magnetoencephalography; Motor cortex; Stroke	MOTOR-CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; CORTEX EXCITABILITY; DIFFUSION TENSOR; EEG-EMG; MUSCLE; SYNCHRONIZATION; CONTRACTION; REORGANIZATION; PRECISION	In healthy subjects, motor cortex activity and electromyographic (EMG) signals from contracting contralateral muscle show coherence in the beta (15-30 Hz) range. Corticomuscular coherence (CMC) is considered a sign of functional coupling between muscle and brain. Based on prior studies, CMC is altered in stroke, but functional significance of this finding has remained unclear. Here, we examined CMC in acute stroke patients and correlated the results with clinical outcome measures and corticospinal tract (CST) integrity estimated with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). During isometric contraction of the extensor carpi radialis muscle, EMG and magneto encephalographic oscillatory signals were recorded from 29 patients with paresis of the upper extremity due to ischemic stroke and 22 control subjects. CMC amplitudes and peak frequencies at 13-30 Hz were compared between the two groups. In the patients, the peak frequency in both the affected and the unaffected hemisphere was significantly (p < 0.01) lower and the strength of CMC was significantly (p < 0.05) weaker in the affected hemisphere compared to the control subjects. The strength of CMC in the patients correlated with the level of tactile sensitivity and clinical test results of hand function. In contrast, no correlation between measures of CST integrity and CMC was found. The results confirm the earlier findings that CMC is altered in acute stroke and demonstrate that CMC is bidirectional and not solely a measure of integrity of the efferent corticospinal tract.

Left anterior temporal alpha and theta band changes correlate with the beneficial effects of rehearsal on working memory	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Working memory; Delay activity; Rehearsal; Theta; Alpha	SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; SELECTIVE AMYGDALOHIPPOCAMPECTOMY; RECOGNITION MEMORY; OSCILLATIONS; LANGUAGE; PERFORMANCE; LOBECTOMY; ATTENTION; CAPACITY; STORAGE	Rehearsal during working memory (WM) maintenance is assumed to facilitate retrieval. Less is known about how rehearsal modulates WM delay activity. In the present study, 44 participants completed a Sternberg Task with either intact novel scenes or phase-scrambled scenes, which had similar color and spatial frequency but lacked semantic content. During the rehearsal condition participants generated a descriptive label during encoding and covertly rehearsed during the delay period. During the suppression condition participants did not generate a label during encoding and suppressed (repeated ?the?) during the delay period. This was easy in the former (novel scenes) but more difficult in the later condition (phase-scrambled scenes) where scenes lacked semantic content. Behavioral performance and EEG delay activity was analyzed as a function of maintenance strategy. Performance during WM revealed a benefit of rehearsal for phase-scrambled but not intact scenes. Examination of the absolute amplitude revealed three underlying sources of activity for rehearsal, including the left anterior temporal (ATL) and left and midline parietal regions. Increases in alpha and theta activity in ATL were correlated with improvement in performance on WM with rehearsal only when labeling was not automatic (e.g., phasescrambled scenes), which may reflect differences in labeling and rehearsal (i.e., semantic associations vs. shallow labels). We conclude that rehearsal only benefits memory for visual stimuli that lack semantic information, and that this is correlated with changes in alpha and theta rhythms.

In this study, we sought to investigate the brain-network properties of intractable TLE patients apart from the effects of structural abnormalities. The brain network properties of 20 left and 23 right MRI-negative TLE patients and 22 healthy controls were evaluated using magnetoencephalographic recordings in six main frequency bands. A slowing of oscillatory brain activity was observed for the left or right TLE group vs. healthy controls. The TLE groups presented significantly increased functional connectivity in the delta, theta, lower alpha and beta bands, and significantly greater values in the normalized clustering coefficient and path length, and significantly smaller values in the weighted small-world measure in the theta band when compared to healthy controls. Alterations in global and regional band powers can be attributed to spectral slowing in TLE patients. The brain networks of TLE patients displayed abnormally high synchronization in multi-frequency bands and shifted toward a more regular architecture with worse network efficiency in the theta band. Without the contamination of structural lesions, these significant findings can be helpful for better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of TLE. The theta band can be considered as a preferred frequency band for investigating the brain-network dysfunction of MRI-negative intractable TLE patients.

Recent research has presented the possibility that non-invasive acoustic stimulation during sleep could enhance memory consolidation. Herein, we report a random-effects model meta-analysis examining the impact of this intervention on memory and sleep architecture in healthy adults. Sixteen studies were identified through a systematic search. We found a medium significant effect of acoustic stimulation on memory task performance (g = 0.68, p = .031) in young adults <35 years of age, but no statistically significant effect in adults >35 years of age (g = -0.83, p = .223). In young adults, there was a large statistically significant effect for declarative memory tasks (g = 0.87, p = .014) but no effect for non-declarative tasks (g = -0.25, p = .357). There were no statistically significant differences in polysomnography-derived sleep architecture values between sham and stimulation conditions in either young or older adults. Based on these results, it appears that acoustic stimulation during sleep may only be an effective intervention for declarative memory consolidation in young adults. However, the small number of studies in this area, their small sample sizes, the short-term nature of most investigations and the high between-studies heterogeneity highlight a need for high-powered and long-term experiments to better elucidate, and subsequently maximise, any potential benefits of this novel approach.

Previous electrophysiological data suggested a slowing down of the alpha rhythm in the AD-continuum as well as a key role of this rhythmic brain activity for episodic memory processes. This study therefore investigates the link between alpha brain activity and alterations in episodic memory as assessed by the FCSRT. For that purpose, 37 patients with altered FCSRT performance underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment, supplemented by F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/structural magnetic resonance imaging ((18)FDG-PET/MR), and 10 min of resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG). The individual alpha peak frequency (APF) in MEG resting-state data was positively correlated with patients' encoding efficiency as well as with the efficacy of semantic cues in facilitating patients' retrieval of previous stored word. The APF also correlated positively with patients' hippocampal volume and their regional glucose consumption in the posterior cingulate cortex. Overall, this study demonstrates that alterations in the ability to learn and store new information for a relatively short-term period are related to a slowing down of alpha rhythmic activity, possibly due to altered interactions in the extended mnemonic system. As such, a decreased APF may be considered as an electrophysiological correlate of short-term episodic memory dysfunction accompanying pathological aging.

Heritability of Magnetoencephalography Phenotypes Among Patients With Genetic Generalized Epilepsy and Their Siblings	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							JUVENILE MYOCLONIC EPILEPSY; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; STATE; DEPENDENCE; US	Objective To assess whether neuronal signals in patients with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) are heritable, we examined magnetoencephalography resting-state recordings in patients and their healthy siblings. Methods In a prospective, cross-sectional design, we investigated source-reconstructed power and functional connectivity in patients, siblings, and controls. We analyzed 5 minutes of cleaned and awake data without epileptiform discharges in 6 frequency bands (1-40 Hz). We further calculated intraclass correlations to estimate heritability for the imaging patterns within families. Results Compared with controls (n = 45), patients with GGE (n = 25) showed widespread increased functional connectivity (theta to gamma frequency bands) and power (delta to gamma frequency bands) across the spectrum. Siblings (n = 18) fell between the levels of patients and controls. Heritability of the imaging metrics was observed in regions where patients strongly differed from controls, mainly in beta frequencies, but also for delta and theta power. Network connectivity in GGE was heritable in frontal, central, and inferior parietal brain areas and power in central, temporo-parietal, and subcortical structures. Presence of generalized spike-wave activity during recordings and medication were associated with the network patterns, whereas other clinical factors such as age at onset, disease duration, or seizure control were not. Conclusion Metrics of brain oscillations are well suited to characterize GGE and likely relate to genetic factors rather than the active disease or treatment. High power and connectivity levels co-segregated in patients with GGE and healthy siblings, predominantly in the beta band, representing an endophenotype of GGE.

Methods A total of 16 studies were included in this systematic review. Five studies described biological and/or neurocognitive characteristics between patients with BD and FTD, and 11 studies investigated whether BD was a risk factor for FTD. Results Individuals with FTD presented higher levels of serum neurofilament light chain, greater grey matter reduction in frontal, parietal and temporal lobes, and increased slow wave oscillations in channels F3, F4, T3, T5, T4 and T6 within an electroencephalogram (EEG), relative to individuals with BD. Patients with FTD presented greater deficits in executive function and theory of mind compared to patients with BD in a euthymic state, and more deficits in verbal fluency compared to patients with BD in a current mood episode. Patients with BD in a current mood episode showed greater impairment in attention, working memory, verbal memory and executive function relative to individuals with FTD. In addition, retrospective studies showed that 10.2%-11.6% of patients with behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD) had a preceding history of BD. Conclusion Biological and neurocognitive characteristics help to distinguish between BD and FTD, and it may help to reach a more precise diagnosis. In addition, individuals with BD are at higher risk of developing FTD. More studies are needed to identify the predictors of the conversion between BD to FTD.

Sleep has been extensively studied in rodents, although rodent sleep differs substantially from human sleep. Here we investigate sleep in tree shrews, small diurnal mammals phylogenetically close to primates, and compare it to sleep in rats and humans using electrophysiological recordings from frontal cortex of each species. Tree shrews exhibited consolidated sleep, with a sleep bout duration parameter, tau, uncharacteristically high for a small mammal, and differing substantially from the sleep of rodents that is often punctuated by wakefulness. Two NREM sleep stages were observed in tree shrews: NREM, characterized by high delta waves and spindles, and an intermediate stage (IS-NREM) occurring on NREM to REM transitions and consisting of intermediate delta waves with concomitant theta-alpha activity. While IS-NREM activity was reliable in tree shrews, we could also detect it in human EEG data, on a subset of transitions. Finally, coupling events between sleep spindles and slow waves clustered near the beginning of the sleep period in tree shrews, paralleling humans, whereas they were more evenly distributed in rats. Our results suggest considerable homology of sleep structure between humans and tree shrews despite the large difference in body mass between these species. Dimanico et al investigated sleep in tree shrews using electrophysiological recordings and compared it to equivalent read-outs in rats and humans. They reported that there was considerable homology of sleep structure between humans and tree shrews despite the difference in body mass between these species.

A large amount of evidence shows that PFC and HPC support the formation, consolidation and retrieval of episodic memory through the synchronous action of characteristic neural rhythms (theta, gamma, sharp wave ripples(SWRs) rhythms). Based on the study of the neural rhythms in the HPC-PFC network, this review summarizes the role of synchronous interaction of theta, gamma and SWRs rhythms between two brain regions in episodic memory. With the development of animal learning and memory, the HPC-PFC coherence of theta rhythm, as well as gamma rhythms, were significantly increased. These data indicated that HPC and PFC communicate closely through oscillatory information flow in this network when animals have strong memory capabilities. HPC SWRs during either sleep or awake rest were coordinated with cortical SWRs and some other low-frequency rhythms to promote memory consolidation, while awake SWRs can further promote memory retrieval. On the other hand, mental illness is often accompanied by learning and memory dysfunction. EEG studies based on humans and animals have found that the coupling of neural rhythms between HPC and PFC was disordered, which could be treated as an important indicator of pathological cognitive impairment. This review also summarizes the abnormal performance of neural rhythms in HPC-PFC network in schizophrenia and depression and their underlying mechanisms, providing objective evidence for the rapid diagnosis of psychiatric diseases in the future.

Previous studies have shown higher complexity for awake compared with deep anaesthesia states. However, little attention has been paid to complexity in intermediate states of sedation. Methods: We analysed the LempeleZiv complexity of EEG signals from subjects undergoing moderate propofol sedation, from an open access database, and related it to behavioural performance as a continuous marker of the level of sedation and to plasma propofol concentrations. We explored its relation to spectral properties, to propofol susceptibility, and its topographical distribution. Results: Subjects who retained behavioural performance despite propofol sedation showed increased brain activity complexity compared with baseline (M=13.9%, 95% confidence interval=7.5-20.3). This was not the case for subjects who lost behavioural performance. The increase was most prominent in frontal electrodes, and correlated with behavioural performance and propofol susceptibility. This effect was positively correlated with high-frequency activity. However, abolishing specific frequency ranges (e.g. alpha or gamma) did not reduce the propofol-induced increase in LempeleZiv complexity. Conclusions: Brain activity complexity can increase in response to propofol, particularly during low-dose sedation. Propofol-mediated LempeleZiv complexity increase was independent of frequency-specific spectral power manipulations, and most prominent in frontal areas. Taken together, these results advance our understanding of brain activity complexity and anaesthetics. They do not support models of consciousness that propose a direct relation between brain activity complexity and states of consciousness.

Activity of the Lateral Hypothalamus during Genetically Determined Absence Seizures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						epilepsy; spike-wave discharge; serotonin; hypothalamus	MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS; FEEDFORWARD INHIBITION; RAT MODEL; PROJECTIONS; ORGANIZATION; SEROTONIN; NEURONS; SPIKE; NEUROTRANSMISSION	(1) Background: Absence seizures (ASs) are sudden, transient lapses of consciousness associated with lack of voluntary movements and generalized 2.5-4 Hz spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in the EEG. In addition to the thalamocortical system, where these pathological oscillations are generated, multiple neuronal circuits have been involved in their modulation and associated comorbidities including the serotonergic system. Neuronal activity in one of the major synaptic input structures to the brainstem dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), the lateral hypothalamus (LH), has not been characterized. (2) Methods: We used viral tract tracing and optogenetics combined with in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology to assess the involvement of the LH in absence epilepsy in a genetic rodent model. (3) Results: We found that a substantial fraction of LH neurons project to the DRN of which a minority is GABAergic. The LH to DRN projection can lead to monosynaptic iGluR mediated excitation in DRN 5-HT neurons. Neuronal activity in the LH is coupled to SWDs. (4) Conclusions: Our results indicate that a brain area involved in the regulation of autonomic functions and heavily innervating the RN is involved in ASs. The decreased activity of LH neurons during SWDs could lead to both a decreased excitation and disinhibition in the DRN. These results support a long-range subcortical regulation of serotonergic neuromodulation during ASs and further our understanding of the state-dependence of these seizures and some of their associated comorbidities.

Neuronal heterogeneity modulates phase synchronization between unidirectionally coupled populations with excitation-inhibition balance	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							ANTICIPATED SYNCHRONIZATION; CORTICAL NETWORK; DIVERSITY; DYNAMICS; COMMUNICATION; OSCILLATIONS; MECHANISMS; RESPONSES; LATENCIES; RHYTHMS	Several experiments and models have highlighted the importance of neuronal heterogeneity in brain dynamics and function. However, how such a cell-to-cell diversity can affect cortical computation, synchronization, and neuronal communication is still under debate. Previous studies have focused on the effect of neuronal heterogeneity in one neuronal population. Here we are specifically interested in the effect of neuronal variability on the phase relations between two populations, which can be related to different cortical communication hypotheses. It has been recently shown that two spiking neuron populations unidirectionally connected in a sender-receiver configuration can exhibit anticipated synchronization (AS), which is characterized by a negative phase lag. This phenomenon has been reported in electrophysiological data of nonhuman primates and human EEG during a visual discrimination cognitive task. In experiments, the unidirectional coupling could be accessed by Granger causality and can be accompanied by either positive or negative phase difference between cortical areas. Here we propose a model of two coupled populations in which the neuronal heterogeneity can determine the dynamical relation between the sender and the receiver and can reproduce phase relations reported in experiments. Depending on the distribution of parameters characterizing the neuronal firing patterns, the system can exhibit both AS and the usual delayed synchronization regime (DS, with positive phase) as well as a zero-lag synchronization regime and phase bistability between AS and DS. Furthermore, we show that our network can present diversity in their phase relations maintaining the excitation-inhibition balance.	[Brito, Katiele V.

There has become of increasing interest in transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) since its inception nearly a decade ago. tACS in modulating brain state is an active area of research and has been demonstrated effective in various neuropsychological and clinical domains. In the visual domain, much effort has been dedicated to brain rhythms and rhythmic stimulation, i.e. tACS. However, less is known about the interplay between the rhythmic stimulation and visual stimulation. Approach. Here, we used steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), induced by flickering driving as a widely used technique for frequency-tagging, to investigate the aftereffect of tACS in healthy human subjects. Seven blocks of 64-channel electroencephalogram were recorded before and after the administration of 20min 10Hz tACS, while subjects performed several blocks of SSVEP tasks. We characterized the physiological properties of tACS aftereffect by comparing and validating the temporal, spatial, spatiotemporal and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) patterns between and within blocks in real tACS and sham tACS. Main results. Our result revealed that tACS boosted the 10Hz SSVEP significantly. Besides, the aftereffect on SSVEP was mitigated with time and lasted up to 5 min. Significance.

J	Castanheira, JD; Perez, HDO; Misic, B; Baillet, S				Castanheira, Jason da Silva; Perez, Hector Domingo Orozco; Misic, Bratislav; Baillet, Sylvain			Brief segments of neurophysiological activity enable individual differentiation	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN; ATTENTION; EEG; VARIABILITY; PREDICTION; NETWORKS; PATTERNS; REGIONS	We all have the intuition that our brain makes us unique. Here, the authors show that seconds of brain activity are sufficient to differentiate an individual, even when recorded weeks or months apart. Large, openly available datasets and current analytic tools promise the emergence of population neuroscience. The considerable diversity in personality traits and behaviour between individuals is reflected in the statistical variability of neural data collected in such repositories. Recent studies with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have concluded that patterns of resting-state functional connectivity can both successfully distinguish individual participants within a cohort and predict some individual traits, yielding the notion of an individual's neural fingerprint. Here, we aim to clarify the neurophysiological foundations of individual differentiation from features of the rich and complex dynamics of resting-state brain activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 158 participants. We show that akin to fMRI approaches, neurophysiological functional connectomes enable the differentiation of individuals, with rates similar to those seen with fMRI. We also show that individual differentiation is equally successful from simpler measures of the spatial distribution of neurophysiological spectral signal power. Our data further indicate that differentiation can be achieved from brain recordings as short as 30 seconds, and that it is robust over time: the neural fingerprint is present in recordings performed weeks after their baseline reference data was collected. This work, thus, extends the notion of a neural or brain fingerprint to fast and large-scale resting-state electrophysiological dynamics.

Bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy: How many seizures are required in chronic ambulatory electrocorticography to estimate the laterality ratio?	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						chronic electrocorticography; ECoG; epilepsy surgery; responsive neurostimulation; video-EEG	LOBECTOMY	Objective This study was undertaken to measure the duration of chronic electrocorticography (ECoG) needed to attain stable estimates of the seizure laterality ratio in patients with drug-resistant bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (BTLE). Methods We studied 13 patients with drug-resistant BTLE who were implanted for at least 1 year with a responsive neurostimulation device (RNS System) that provides chronic ambulatory ECoG. Bootstrap analysis and nonlinear regression were applied to model the relationship between chronic ECoG duration and the probability of capturing at least one seizure. Laterality of electrographic seizures in chronic ECoG was compared with the seizure laterality ratio from Phase 1 scalp video-electroencephalographic (vEEG) monitoring. The Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to evaluate time to seizure laterality ratio convergence. Results Seizure laterality ratios from Phase 1 scalp vEEG monitoring correlated poorly with those from RNS chronic ECoG (r = .31, p = .30). Across the 13 patients, average electrographic seizure frequencies ranged from 1.4 seizures/month to 5.1 seizures/day. A 50% probability of recording at least one electrographic seizure required 9.1 days of chronic ECoG, and 90% probability required 44.3 days of chronic ECoG. A median recording duration of 150.9 days (5 months), corresponding to a median of 16 seizures, was needed before confidence intervals for the seizure laterality ratio reliably contained the long-term value. The median recording duration before the point estimate of the seizure laterality ratio converged to a stationary value was 236.8 days (7.9 months). Significance RNS chronic ECoG overcomes temporal sampling limitations intrinsic to inpatient Phase 1 vEEG evaluations. In patients with drug-resistant BTLE, approximately 8 months of chronic RNS ECoG are needed to precisely estimate the seizure laterality ratio, with 75% of people with BTLE achieving convergence after 1 year of RNS recording. For individuals who are candidates for unilateral resection based on seizure laterality, optimized recording duration may help avert morbidity associated with delay to definitive treatment.

To the Question of the Possibility of Identifying the Psychophysiological Signs of "Ethnic Hearing" as Differential Perception of "Native" and "Alien" Music	PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORLDWIDE MUSIC CONFERENCE 2021, VOL 2	Current Research in Systematic Musicology		English	Proceedings Paper	Worldwide Music Conference (WWMC)	APR 22-23, 2021	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC			Listening; Ethnic hearing; Psycho-physiological features and observed indexes; Musical-psychological anthropology	EEG-EMG COHERENCE; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; BACKGROUND MUSIC; ALPHA RHYTHMS; RELAXATION; TASK; OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSES; ANXIETY; STIMULATION	The paper is devoted to the overview of studies and the summary of methodological approaches to psycho-physiological features of listening, selective hearing, and perception of music. The scientific substantiation of such applied studies is aimed at the development of functional music and music therapy techniques. It is shown that psycho-physiological signs of perception of "native" and "alien" music by listeners of various cultures have been insufficiently studied. The main research goal of this review is related to the fact that a productive method of determining the way music influences individuals with different psychological and ethnic cultural characteristics has not been yet identified. In fact, the influence of the ethnic cultural factor in hearing music has not been considered as such. There are still no viable methods for defining the phenomenon of "ethnic hearing" in psychophysiological terms and no way to identify the psychophysiological peculiarities of hearing "native" and "alien" music. This study was conducted to investigate the psychophysiological signs of the response to listening to music; the influence on the psychophysiological signs by socio-cultural, personal, psychometric and neurohumoral factors; and whether the psychophysiological signs that indicate if listening to music is pleasant or unpleasant to the listener are identical to the psychophysiological signs of the musical perception influenced by the musical style and the ethnic-cultural experience of listening to music. The collected data for the review provides a methodological basis for the study of the phenomenon of "ethno-hearing" in the context of musical-psychological anthropology.

Understanding the dynamics of brain activity modifications during these transitional phases could help to better understand the changes in cognitive functions according to vigilance states. In this study, we investigated the activity of memory-related areas (hippocampus and orbitofrontal cortex) during short (3 s to 2 min) arousing reactions detected from thalamic activity, using intracranial recordings in four drug-resistant epilepsy patients. The average power of the signal between 0.5 and 128 Hz was compared across four time windows: 10 s of preceding sleep, the first part and the end of the arousal/awakening, and 10 s of wakefulness. We observed that (a) in most frequency bands, the spectral power during hippocampal arousal/awakenings is intermediate between wakefulness and sleep whereas frontal cortex shows an early increase in low and fast activities during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep arousals/awakenings; (b) this pattern depends on the preceding sleep stage with fewer modifications for REM than for non-REM sleep arousal/awakenings, potentially reflecting the EEG similarities between REM sleep and wakefulness; (c) a greater activation at the arousing reaction onset in the prefrontal cortex predicts longer arousals/awakenings. Our findings suggest that hippocampus and prefrontal arousals/awakenings are progressive phenomena modulated by sleep stage, and, in the neocortex, by the intensity of the early activation. This pattern of activity could underlie the link between sleep stage, arousal/awakening duration and restoration of memory abilities including dream recall.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurological degenerative disease that cannot be completely cured, although drugs can improve or alleviate its symptoms. Optogenetic technology, which stimulates or inhibits neurons with excellent spatial and temporal resolution, provides a new idea and approach for the precise treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, the neural mechanism of photogenetic regulation remains unclear. Objective. In this paper, we want to study the nonlinear features of EEG signals in the striatum and globus pallidus through optogenetic stimulation of the substantia nigra compact part. Methods. Rotenone was injected stereotactically into the substantia nigra compact area and ventral tegmental area of SD rats to construct rotenone-treated rats. Then, for the optogenetic manipulation, we injected adeno-associated virus expressing channelrhodopsin to stimulate the globus pallidus and the striatum with a 1 mW blue light and collected LFP signals before, during, and after light stimulation. Finally, the collected LFP signals were analyzed by using nonlinear dynamic algorithms. Results. After observing the behavior and brain morphology, 16 models were finally determined to be successful. LFP results showed that approximate entropy and fractal dimension of rats in the control group were significantly greater than those in the experimental group after light treatment (p<0.05). The LFP nonlinear features in the globus pallidus and striatum of rotenone-treated rats showed significant statistical differences before and after light stimulation (p<0.05). Conclusion. Optogenetic technology can regulate the characteristic value of LFP signals in rotenone-treated rats to a certain extent. Approximate entropy and fractal dimension algorithm can be used as an effective index to study LFP changes in rotenone-treated rats.

Autonomic dysregulation and sleep homeostasis in insomnia	SLEEP			English	Article						noradrenergic system; sleep slow oscillations; sleep homeostasis; insomnia	PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; POWER SPECTRA; NREM SLEEP; NOREPINEPHRINE; PLASMA; CORTISOL; EEG	Study Objectives: Insomnia is common in older adults, and is associated with poor health, including cognitive impairment and cardio-metabolic disease. Although the mechanisms linking insomnia with these comorbidities remain unclear, age-related changes in sleep and autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation might represent a shared mechanistic pathway. In this study, we assessed the relationship between ANS activity with indices of objective and subjective sleep quality in older adults with insomnia. Methods: Forty-three adults with chronic insomnia and 16 age-matched healthy sleeper controls were studied. Subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), objective sleep quality by electroencephalogram spectral components derived from polysomnography, and ANS activity by measuring 24-h plasma cortisol and norepinephrine (NE). Results: Sleep cycle analysis displayed lower slow oscillatory (SO: 0.5-1.25 Hz) activity in the first cycle in insomnia compared to controls. In insomnia, 24-h cortisol levels were higher and 24-h NE levels were lower than controls. In controls, but not in insomnia, there was a significant interaction between NE level during wake and SO activity levels across the sleep cycles, such that in controls but not in insomnia, NE level during wake was positively associated with the amount of SO activity in the first cycle. In insomnia, lower 24-h NE level and SO activity in the first sleep cycle were associated with poorer subjective sleep quality. Conclusion: Dysregulation of autonomic activity may be an underlying mechanism that links objective and subjective measures of sleep quality in older adults with insomnia, and potentially contribute to adverse health outcomes.

Studies aimed at understanding whether mechanisms underlying IoR act at a perceptual/attentional or a later response-execution stage have offered divergent results. Though focusing on the brain's responses to cue-target intervals can offer significant information on the nature of IoR, few studies have investigated neural activity during this interval; these studies suggest the generation of inhibitory tags on the spatial coordinates of the previously attended position which, in turn, inhibit motor programming toward that position. As such, a cue-target task was administered in this study; the rhythmic activity of EEG signals on the entire cue-target interval was measured to determine whether IoR is referred to early or late response processing stages. A visually-guided force variation during isometric contraction, instead of a key press response, was required to reduce the effect of motor response initiation. Our results indicated the prominent involvement of the fronto-parietal and occipital cortical areas post-cue appearance, with a peculiar theta band modulation characterizing the posterior parietal cortex. Theta activity in this region was enhanced post-cue onset, decreased over time, and was enhanced again when a target appeared in an unexpected location rather than in a cued position. This suggests that the mechanism that generates IoR sequentially affects perceptual/attentional processing and motor preparation rather than response execution.

However, some people, such as children and the elderly, have difficulty concentrating on neurofeedback for a long time. Constant stressless neurofeedback for a long time may be achieved with auditory neurofeedback using music. The primary purpose of this study was to clarify whether music-based auditory neurofeedback increases the power of the alpha wave in healthy subjects. During neurofeedback, white noise was superimposed on classical music, with the noise level inversely correlating with normalized alpha wave power. This was a single-blind, randomized control crossover trial in which 10 healthy subjects underwent, in an assigned order, normal and random feedback (NF and RF), either of which was at least 4 weeks long. Cognitive functions were evaluated before, between, and after each neurofeedback period. The secondary purpose was to assess neurofeedback-induced changes in cognitive functions. A crossover analysis showed that normalized alpha-power was significantly higher in NF than in RF; therefore, music-based auditory neurofeedback facilitated alpha wave induction. A composite category-based analysis of cognitive functions revealed greater improvements in short-term memory in subjects whose alpha-power increased in response to NF. The present study employed a long period of auditory alpha neurofeedback and achieved successful alpha wave induction and subsequent improvements in cognitive functions. Although this was a pilot study that validated a music-based alpha neurofeedback system for healthy subjects, the results obtained are encouraging for those with difficulty in concentrating on conventional alpha neurofeedback.

Phase-Amplitude Coupling, Mental Health and Cognition: Implications for Adolescence	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						EEG; cross-frequency coupling; PAC; mental disorder; cognition; youth mental health; neurostimulation; DTI		Identifying biomarkers of developing mental disorder is crucial to improving early identification and treatment-a key strategy for reducing the burden of mental disorders. Cross-frequency coupling between two different frequencies of neural oscillations is one such promising measure, believed to reflect synchronization between local and global networks in the brain. Specifically, in adults phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) has been shown to be involved in a range of cognitive processes, including working and long-term memory, attention, language, and fluid intelligence. Evidence suggests that increased PAC mediates both temporary and lasting improvements in working memory elicited by transcranial direct-current stimulation and reductions in depressive symptoms after transcranial magnetic stimulation. Moreover, research has shown that abnormal patterns of PAC are associated with depression and schizophrenia in adults. PAC is believed to be closely related to cortico-cortico white matter (WM) microstructure, which is well established in the literature as a structural mechanism underlying mental health. Some cognitive findings have been replicated in adolescents and abnormal patterns of PAC have also been linked to ADHD in young people. However, currently most research has focused on cross-sectional adult samples. Whereas initial hypotheses suggested that PAC was a state-based measure due to an early focus on cognitive, task-based research, current evidence suggests that PAC has both state-based and stable components. Future longitudinal research focusing on PAC throughout adolescent development could further our understanding of the relationship between mental health and cognition and facilitate the development of new methods for the identification and treatment of youth mental health.

Here we tracked these interference dynamics electrophysiologically to further our understanding of the underlying processes. Twenty-seven Dutch native speakers learned 70 new Italian words over two days. On a third day, EEG was recorded as they performed naming tasks on half of these words in English and, finally, as their memory for all the Italian words was tested in a picture-naming task. Replicating Mickan et al. recall was slower and tended to be less complete for Italian words that were interfered with (i.e., named in English) than for words that were not. These behavioral interference effects were accompanied by an enhanced frontal N2 and a decreased late positivity (LPC) for interfered compared to not-interfered items. Moreover, interfered items elicited more theta power. We also found an increased N2 during the interference phase for items that participants were later slower to retrieve in Italian. We interpret the N2 and theta effects as markers of interference, in line with the idea that Italian retrieval at final test is hampered by competition from recently practiced English translations. The LPC, in turn, reflects the consequences of interference: the reduced accessibility of interfered Italian labels. Finally, that retrieval ease at final test was related to the degree of interference during previous English retrieval shows that FLA is already set in motion during the interference phase, and hence can be the direct consequence of using other languages.

JOURNAL OF SLEEP RESEARCH			English	Article						ACTH; EEG; prednisolone; sleep slow waves; vigabatrin; West syndrome	KINGDOM INFANTILE SPASMS; CORTICAL SYNCHRONIZATION; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; EPILEPSY OUTCOMES; MULTICENTER; HOMEOSTASIS; ENCEPHALOPATHY; OSCILLATIONS; PLASTICITY; TIAGABINE	Synaptic downscaling during sleep, a physiological process to restore synaptic homeostasis and maintain learning efficiency and healthy brain development, has been related to a reduction of the slope of sleep slow waves (SSW). However, such synaptic downscaling seems not to be reflected in high-amplitude SSW. Recently we have shown reduced SSW slopes during hormonal treatment (adrenocorticotrophic hormone, prednisolone) in patients with West syndrome (WS). Yet, whether this reduction was related to successful treatment or reflects a specific effect of hormone therapy is unknown. Thus, we retrospectively analysed nap electroencephalograms of 61 patients with WS successfully treated with hormones, vigabatrin (VGB), or both. The slope of SSW during treatment (T1) and 2-7 months later (T2) when hormonal treatment was tapered off were compared between the treatment groups and healthy, age-matched controls. At T1 hormone treatment reduced the slope of low-amplitude SSW, whereas VGB increased the slope of high-amplitude SSW (linear mixed effect model: F-Group = 7.04, p F-Amplitude = 1,646.68, p F-Group*Amplitude = 3.38, p < 0.001). At T2, untreated patients did not differ anymore from healthy controls, whereas those still under VGB showed the same alterations as those with VGB at T1. This result indicates a disparate effect of VGB and hormone on the SSW slope. In particular, hormones seem to reduce the slope of cortical generated low-amplitude SSW, similar to the physiological synaptic downscaling during sleep. Thus, a loss of functional neuronal connectivity might be an alternative explanation of the antiepileptic effect of hormonal treatment.

Power law scaling is a well-validated method in physics that has been used to describe the dynamics of a system in the frequency domain, ranging from noisy oscillation to complex fluctuations. In this research, we investigated the power-law characteristics in a large-scale resting-state fMRI data of schizophrenia and healthy participants derived from Taiwan Aging and Mental Illness cohort. We extracted the power spectral density (PSD) of resting signal by Fourier transform. Power law scaling of PSD was estimated by determining the slope of the regression line fitting to the logarithm of PSD. t-Test was used to assess the statistical difference in power law scaling between schizophrenia and healthy participants. The significant differences in power law scaling were found in six brain regions. Schizophrenia patients have significantly more positive power law scaling (i.e., more homogenous frequency components) at four brain regions: left precuneus, left medial dorsal nucleus, right inferior frontal gyrus, and right middle temporal gyrus and less positive power law scaling (i.e., more dominant at lower frequency range) in bilateral putamen compared with healthy participants. Moreover, significant correlations of power law scaling with the severity of psychosis were found. These findings suggest that schizophrenia has abnormal brain signal complexity linked to psychotic symptoms. The power law scaling represents the dynamical properties of resting-state fMRI signal may serve as a novel functional brain imaging marker for evaluating patients with mental illness.

Pharmacoresponsiveness of spontaneous recurrent seizures and the comorbid sleep disorder of epileptic Kcna1-null mice	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Phenobarbital; Phenytoin; Carbamazepine; Levetiracetam; Diurnal; Kv1.1	SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; MODEL; CARBAMAZEPINE; ARCHITECTURE; MOUSE; PHARMACOKINETICS; OSCILLATIONS; PERIODICITY	Drug resistant epilepsy affects similar to 30% of people with epilepsy and is associated with epilepsy syndromes with frequent and multiple types of seizures, lesions or cytoarchitectural abnormalities, increased risk of mortality and comorbidities such as cognitive impairment and sleep disorders. A limitation of current preclinical models is that spontaneous seizures with comorbidities take time to induce and test, thus making them low-throughput. Kcna1null mice exhibit all the characteristics of drug resistant epilepsy with spontaneous seizures and comorbidities occurring naturally; thus, we aimed to determine whether they also demonstrate pharmacoresistanct seizures and the impact of medications on their sleep disorder comorbidity. In this exploratory study, Kcna1-null mice were treated with one of four conventional antiseizure medications, carbamazepine, levetiracetam, phenytoin, and phenobarbital using a moderate throughput protocol (vehicle for 2 days followed by 2 days of treatment with high therapeutic doses selected based on published data in the 6 Hz model of pharmacoresistant seizures). Spontaneous recurrent seizures and vigilance states were recorded with video-EEG/EMG. Carbamazepine, levetiracetam and phenytoin had partial efficacy (67%, 75% and 33% were seizure free, respectively), whereas phenobarbital was fully efficacious and conferred seizure freedom to all mice. Thus, seizures of Kcna1-null mice appear to be resistant to three of the drugs tested. Levetiracetam failed to affect sleep architecture, carbamazepine and phenytoin had moderate effects, and phenobarbital, as predicted, restored sleep architecture. Data suggest Kcna1-null mice may be a moderate throughput model of drug resistant epilepsy useful in determining mechanisms of pharmacoresistance and testing novel therapeutic strategies.

Mismatch negativity (MMN) and gamma-band auditory steady-state response (ASSR) are robust translational biomarkers associated with schizophrenia and associated with cognitive dysfunction, negative symptom severity, and psychosocial disability. Although these biomarkers are conceptually linked as measures of early auditory information processing, it is unclear whether MMN and gamma-band ASSR account for shared vs. non-shared variance in cognitive, clinical, and psychosocial functioning. Methods: Multiple regression analyses with MMN, gamma-band ASSR, and clinical measures were performed in large cohorts of schizophrenia outpatients (N= 428) and healthy comparison subjects (N= 283). Results: Reduced MMN (d = 0.67), gamma-band ASSR (d = -0.40), and lower cognitive function were confirmed in schizophrenia patients. Regression analyses revealed that reducedMMN amplitude showed unique associations with lower verbal learning and negative symptoms, reduced gamma-band ASSR showed a unique association with working memory deficits, and both reduced MMN amplitude and reduced gamma-band ASSR showed an association with daily functioning impairment in schizophrenia patients. Conclusion: MMN and ASSR measures are non-redundant and complementary measures of early auditory information processing that are associated with important domains of functioning. Studies are needed to clarify the neural substrates of MMN and gamma-band ASSR to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and accelerate their use in the development of novel therapeutic interventions.

Cortical Stimulation Paired With Volitional Unimanual Movement Affects Interhemispheric Communication	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha coherence; electrical cortical stimulation; interhemispheric inhibition; motor cortex; non-human primate; timing-dependent plasticity	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; INHIBITION; OSCILLATIONS; PLASTICITY; COHERENCE; SYNCHRONIZATION; MODULATION; MECHANISMS; AREA; EEG	Cortical stimulation (CS) of the motor cortex can cause excitability changes in both hemispheres, showing potential to be a technique for clinical rehabilitation of motor function. However, previous studies that have investigated the effects of delivering CS during movement typically focus on a single hemisphere. On the other hand, studies exploring interhemispheric interactions typically deliver CS at rest. We sought to bridge these two approaches by documenting the consequences of delivering CS to a single motor cortex during different phases of contralateral and ipsilateral limb movement, and simultaneously assessing changes in interactions within and between the hemispheres via local field potential (LFP) recordings. Three macaques were trained in a unimanual reaction time (RT) task and implanted with epidural or intracortical electrodes over bilateral motor cortices. During a given session CS was delivered to one hemisphere with respect to movements of either the contralateral or ipsilateral limb. Stimulation delivered before contralateral limb movement onset shortened the contralateral limb RT. In contrast, stimulation delivered after the end of contralateral movement increased contralateral RT but decreased ipsilateral RT. Stimulation delivered before ipsilateral limb movement decreased ipsilateral RT. All other stimulus conditions as well as random stimulation and periodic stimulation did not have consistently significant effects on either limb. Simultaneous LFP recordings from one animal revealed correlations between changes in interhemispheric alpha band coherence and changes in RT, suggesting that alpha activity may be indicative of interhemispheric communication. These results show that changes caused by CS to the functional coupling within and between precentral cortices is contingent on the timing of CS relative to movement.

J	Abbasi, H; Kadel, H; Hickey, C; Schubo, A				Abbasi, Hossein; Kadel, Hanna; Hickey, Clayton; Schubo, Anna			Combined influences of strategy and selection history on attentional control	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						attention capture; early Pd; ERPs; N2pc; pre-stimulus alpha-band; selection history	TOP-DOWN; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; VISUAL-SEARCH; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; CAPTURE ATTENTION; TASK; EEG; SUPPRESSION; MECHANISMS; TARGET	Visual attention is guided by top-down mechanisms and pre-stimulus task preparation, but also by selection history (i.e., the bias to prioritize previously attended items). Here we examine how these influences combine. Two groups of participants completed two intermingled tasks. One task involved categorization of a unique target; one group categorized the target based on color, and the other based on shape. The other task involved searching for a target defined by unique shape while ignoring a distractor defined by unique color. Our expectation was that the search task would be difficult for the color-categorization group because their categorization task required attentional resolution of color, but the search task required that they ignore color. In some experimental blocks, trials from the two tasks appeared predictably, giving the color-categorization group an opportunity to strategically prepare by switching between color-prioritizing and shape-prioritizing attentional templates. We looked to pre-stimulus oscillatory activity as a direct index of this preparation, and to reaction times and post-stimulus ERPs for markers of resultant change in attentional deployment. Results showed that preparation in the color-categorization group optimized attentional templates, such that these participants became less sensitive to the color distractor in the search task. But preparation was not sufficient to entirely negate the influence of selection history, and participants in the color-categorization group continued to show a propensity to attend to the color distractor. These results indicate that preparatory effort can be scaled to the anticipated attentional requirements, but attention is nevertheless considerably biased by selection history.

Current source density (CSD) estimation from low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) and its standardized (sLORETA) and exact (eLORETA) variants, is a common approach to identify the spatiotemporal dynamics of the brain sources in physiological and pathological pain-related conditions. However, there is no consensus on the magnitude and variability of clinically or experimentally relevant effects for CSD estimations. Here, we systematically examined reports of sample size calculations and effect size estimations in all studies that included the keywords pain, and LORETA, sLORETA, or eLORETA in Scopus and PubMed. We also assessed the reliability of LORETA CSD estimations during non-painful and painful conditions to estimate hypothetical sample sizes for future experiments using CSD estimations. We found that none of the studies included in the systematic review reported sample size calculations, and less than 20% reported measures of central tendency and dispersion, which are necessary to estimate effect sizes. Based on these data and our experimental results, we determined that sample sizes commonly used in pain studies using CSD estimations are suitable to detect medium and large effect sizes in crossover designs and only large effects in parallel designs. These results provide a comprehensive summary of the effect sizes observed using LORETA in pain research, and this information can be used by clinicians and researchers to improve settings and designs of future pain studies.

Complex spatiotemporal neural activity encodes rich information related to behavior and cognition. Conventional research has focused on neural activity acquired using one of many different measurement modalities, each of which provides useful but incomplete assessment of the neural code. Multi-modal techniques can overcome tradeoffs in the spatial and temporal resolution of a single modality to reveal deeper and more comprehensive understanding of system-level neural mechanisms. Uncovering multi-scale dynamics is essential for a mechanistic understanding of brain function and for harnessing neuroscientific insights to develop more effective clinical treatment. Approach. We discuss conventional methodologies used for characterizing neural activity at different scales and review contemporary examples of how these approaches have been combined. Then we present our case for integrating activity across multiple scales to benefit from the combined strengths of each approach and elucidate a more holistic understanding of neural processes. Main results. We examine various combinations of neural activity at different scales and analytical techniques that can be used to integrate or illuminate information across scales, as well the technologies that enable such exciting studies. We conclude with challenges facing future multi-scale studies, and a discussion of the power and potential of these approaches. Significance. This roadmap will lead the readers toward a broad range of multi-scale neural decoding techniques and their benefits over single-modality analyses. This Review article highlights the importance of multi-scale analyses for systematically interrogating complex spatiotemporal mechanisms underlying cognition and behavior.

Methods We reviewed clinical, neuroimaging, electrocorticography (ECoG), operative, and histopathology findings in consecutively operated patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy and MRI-positive BOSD, all of whom underwent corticectomy guided by MRI and ECoG. Results Thirty-eight patients with a median age at surgery of 10.2 (interquartile range [IQR] 6.0-14.1) years were included. BOSDs involved eloquent cortex in 15 patients. Eighty-seven percent of patients had rhythmic spiking on preresection ECoG. Rhythmic spiking was present in 22 of 24 patients studied with combined depth and surface electrodes, being limited to the dysplastic sulcus in 7 and involving the dysplastic sulcus and gyral crown in 15. Sixty-eight percent of resections were limited to the dysplastic sulcus, leaving the gyral crown. Histopathology was focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type IIb in 29 patients and FCDIIa in 9. Dysmorphic neurons were present in the bottom of the sulcus but not the top or the gyral crown in 17 of 22 patients. Six (16%) patients required reoperation for postoperative seizures and residual dysplasia; reoperation was not correlated with ECoG, neuroimaging, or histologic abnormalities in the gyral crown. At a median 6.3 (IQR 4.8-9.9) years of follow-up, 33 (87%) patients are seizure-free, 31 off antiseizure medication. Conclusion BOSD can be safely and effectively resected with MRI and ECoG guidance, corticectomy potentially being limited to the dysplastic sulcus, without need for intracranial EEG monitoring and functional mapping. Classification of Evidence This study provides Class IV evidence that 1-stage, limited corticectomy for BOSD is safe and effective for control of seizures.

Hierarchical Pathways from Sensory Processing to Cognitive, Clinical, and Functional Impairments in Schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						mismatch negativity (MMN); gamma-band auditory steady-state response (ASSR); schizophrenia; functional outcomes; cognitive function	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY DEFICITS; AUDITORY CHANGE-DETECTION; STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; SOCIAL COGNITION; NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL BIOMARKERS; WORKING-MEMORY; GAMMA; OSCILLATIONS; DURATION	Cognitive impairment is a hallmark of schizophrenia and a robust predictor of functional outcomes. Impairments are found in all phases of the illness and are only moderately attenuated by currently approved therapeutics. Neurophysiological indices of sensory discrimination (ie, mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a amplitudes) and gamma-band auditory steady-state response (ASSR; power and phase locking) are translational biomarkers widely used in the development of novel therapeutics for neuropsychiatric disorders. It is unclear whether laboratory-based EEG measures add explanatory porter to well-established models that use only cognitive, clinical, and functional outcome measures. Moreover, it is unclear if measures of sensory discrimination and gamma-band ASSR uniquely contribute to putative causal pathways linking sensory discrimination, neurocognition, negative symptoms, and functional outcomes in schizophrenia. To answer these questions, hierarchical associations among sensory processing, neurocognition, clinical symptoms, and functional outcomes were assessed via structural equation modeling in a large sample of schizophrenia patients (n = 695) and healthy comparison subjects (n = 503). The results showed that the neurophysiologic indices of sensory discrimination and gamma-band ASSR both significantly contribute to and yield unique hierarchical, "bottom-up" effects on neurocognition, symptoms, and functioning. Measures of sensory discrimination showed direct effects on neurocognition and negative symptoms, while gamma-band ASSR had a direct effect on neurocognition in patients. Continued investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying abnormal networks of MMN/P3a and gamma-band ASSR is needed to clarify the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the development of novel therapeutic interventions.

Detecting impaired language processing in patients with mild cognitive impairment using around-the-ear cEEgrid electrodes	PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						cEEGrid; cognitive ageing; conversion to AD; language comprehension; mild cognitive impairment; sentence processing; word processing	DEMENTIA; WORD; MCI; OSCILLATIONS; METAANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; PROGRESSION; CONVERSION; RETRIEVAL; RESPONSES	Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the term used to identify those individuals with subjective and objective cognitive decline but with preserved activities of daily living and an absence of dementia. Although MCI can impact functioning in different cognitive domains, most notably episodic memory, relatively little is known about the comprehension of language in MCI. In this study, we used around-the-ear electrodes (cEEGrids) to identify impairments during language comprehension in patients with MCI. In a group of 23 patients with MCI and 23 age-matched controls, language comprehension was tested in a two-word phrase paradigm. We examined the oscillatory changes following word onset as a function of lexico-semantic single-word retrieval (e.g., swrfeq vs. swift) and multiword binding processes (e.g., horse preceded by swift vs. preceded by swrfeq). Electrophysiological signatures (as measured by the cEEGrids) were significantly different between patients with MCI and controls. In controls, lexical retrieval was associated with a rebound in the alpha/beta range, and binding was associated with a post-word alpha/beta suppression. In contrast, both the single-word retrieval and multiword binding signatures were absent in the MCI group. The signatures observed using cEEGrids in controls were comparable with those signatures obtained with a full-cap EEG setup. Importantly, our findings suggest that patients with MCI have impaired electrophysiological signatures for comprehending single words and multiword phrases. Moreover, cEEGrid setups provide a noninvasive and sensitive clinical tool for detecting early impairments in language comprehension in MCI.

Sleep spindles are known to play a protective role for sleep, and there are indications that melatonin agents can enhance spindles in healthy people. Whether agomelatine, a melatonin agonist indicated for the treatment of depression, may increase spindle density sufficiently to impact sleep continuity in people with depression remains unknown. This proof-of-concept study investigated changes in spindles following agomelatine intake in young adults with depression and assessed how they may relate to potential changes in sleep continuity and depressive symptoms. This study was based on an open-label design. Fifteen participants between 17 and 28 years of age (mean = 22.2; standard deviation [SD] = 3.4) with a diagnosis of a depressive disorder underwent polysomnography before and after an intervention including a 1 hr psychoeducation session centered on sleep and circadian rhythms, and an 8-week course of agomelatine (25-50 mg) with a guided sleep phase advance. Fast spindle density significantly increased from pre- to post-intervention. This increase in spindle density significantly correlated with a reduction in wake after sleep onset, and a similar trend was found with increased sleep efficiency. There was no significant correlation between spindle parameters and depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that agomelatine may contribute to enhanced sleep consolidation, possibly in part through the modulation of spindle production. This should be confirmed by larger randomized control trials.

Fatigability is evident in healthy subjects but is also often comorbid in several neuropsychiatric diseases. However, to date, clinical diagnostic almost solely relies on the self-reported subjective experience of fatigue. The goals of this present study were i) to complement the purely subjective fatigue diagnostic with objective electrophysiological fatigability parameters and ii) to prove the potential therapeutic application of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as a fatigability intervention. Methods: We performed a pseudo-randomized, sham-controlled, parallel-group trial. Forty healthy participants received either anodal or sham tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) while they performed an exhaustive cognitive task to induce cognitive fatigability. To assess fatigability changes, we analyzed variations of prepulse inhibition (PPI) and P50 suppression as well as frontomedial theta and occipital alpha power with time-on-task. Results: The task reliably induced subjective exhaustion in all participants. Furthermore, we confirmed fatigability-related increases in frontomedial theta and occipital alpha power throughout the task. Additionally, fatigability significantly reduced PPI as well as P50 sensory gating. Anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC successfully counteracted fatigability and reduced the fatigability-related increase in alpha power as well as the decline in both gating parameters. Conclusion: Occipital alpha and sensorimotor/sensory gating are suitable parameters to assess the severity of fatigability objectively. Anodal tDCS can counteract fatigability and has therapeutic potential for the treatment of fatigability in neuropsychiatric diseases. Significance: Fatigability can be objectively assessed by electrophysiological measures and attenuated by tDCS. (c) 2021 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Although HFA evaluation was described as a putative biomarker of cognition, its clinical relevance for mapping language networks was assessed predominantly by studies using electrocorticography (ECOG). METHODS Forty-two patients with epilepsy who underwent intracranial electrode implantation during both task-induced HFA and direct cortical stimulation (DCS) language mapping were evaluated. The spatial and functional relevance of each method in terms of specificity and sensitivity were evaluated. RESULTS The results showed that the two methods were able to map classic language regions, and a large and bilat-eral language network was obtained with induced HFA. At a regional level, differences were observed between methods for parietal and temporal lobes: HFA recruited a larger number of cortical parietal sites, while DCS involved more cortical temporal sites. Importantly, the results showed that HFA predicts language interference induced by DCS with high speci-ficity (92.4%; negative predictive value 95.9%) and very low sensitivity (8.9%; positive predictive value 4.8%). CONCLUSIONS DCS language mapping appears to be more appropriate for an extensive temporal mapping than induced HFA mapping. Furthermore, induced HFA should be used as a complement to DCS to preselect the number of stimulated sites during DCS, by omitting those reported as HFA-. This may be a considerable advantage because it allows a reduction in the duration of the stimulation procedure. Several parameters to be used for each method are dis-cussed and the results are interpreted in relation to previous results reported in ECOG studies.

Deep brain stimulation of the PPN has been proposed as an emerging treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) or multiple system atrophy (MSA) who have gait-related atypical parkinsonian syndromes. In this study, we investigated PPN activities during gait to better understand its functional role in locomotion. Specifically, we investigated whether PPN activity is rhythmically modulated by gait cycles during locomotion. PPN local field potential (LFP) activities were recorded from PD or MSA patients with gait difficulties during stepping in place or free walking. Simultaneous measurements from force plates or accelerometers were used to determine the phase within each gait cycle at each time point. Our results showed that activities in the alpha and beta frequency bands in the PPN LFPs were rhythmically modulated by the gait phase within gait cycles, with a higher modulation index when the stepping rhythm was more regular. Meanwhile, the PPN-cortical coherence was most prominent in the alpha band. Both gait phase-related modulation in the alpha/beta power and the PPN-cortical coherence in the alpha frequency band were spatially specific to the PPN and did not extend to surrounding regions. These results suggest that alternating PPN modulation may support gait control. Whether enhancing alternating PPN modulation by stimulating in an alternating fashion could positively affect gait control remains to be tested.

The utility of Magnetoencephalography in multiple sclerosis-A systematic review	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Review						Multiple sclerosis; Magnetoencephalography; Cognition; Connectivity; Neuroinflammation; Biomarker	CLINICORADIOLOGICAL PARADOX; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; ALPHA; EEG; INDIVIDUALS; COHERENCE; RESPONSES	Introduction: Magnetoencephalography (MEG), allows for a high degree temporal and spatial accuracy in recording cortical oscillatory activity and evoked fields. To date, no review has been undertaken to synthesise all MEG studies in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). We undertook a Systematic Review of the utility of MEG in MS. Methods: We identified MEG studies carried out in MS using EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane, TRIP and Psychinfo databases. We included original research articles with a cohort of minimum of five multiple sclerosis patients and quantifying of at least one MEG parameter. We used a modified version of the JBI (mJBI) for case-control studies to assess for risk of bias. Results: We identified 30 studies from 13 centres involving at least 433 MS patients and 347 controls. We found evidence that MEG shows perturbed activity (most commonly reduced power modulations), reduced connectivity and association with altered clinical function in Multiple Sclerosis. Specific replicated findings were decreased motor induced responses in the beta band, diminished increase of gamma power after visual stimulation, increased latency and reduced connectivity for somatosensory evoked fields. There was an association between upper alpha connectivity and cognitive measures in people with MS. Overall studies were of moderate quality (mean mJBI score 6.7). Discussion: We find evidence for the utility of MEG in Multiple Sclerosis. Event-related designs are of particular value and show replicability between centres. At this stage, it is not clear whether these changes are specific to Multiple Sclerosis or are also observable in other diseases. Further studies should look to explore cognitive control in more depth using in-task designs and undertake longitudinal studies to determine whether these changes have prognostic value.

However, it is unknown how normal brain activity develops into the highly synchronized discharging activity seen in disordered networks. This study aimed to explore the epilepsy brain network and the significant re-combined brain areas in childhood absence epilepsy (CAE). Methods: Twenty-two children with CAE were recruited to study the neural source activity during ictalonset and interictal periods at frequency bands of 1-30 Hz and 30-80 Hz with magnetoencephalography (MEG) scanning. Accumulated source imaging (ASI) was used to analyze the locations of neural source activity and peak source strength. Results: Most of the participants had more active source activity locations in the ictal-onset period rather than in the interictal period, both at 1-30 Hz and 30-80 Hz. The frontal lobe (FL), the temporo-parietal junction (T-P), and the parietal lobe (PL) became the main active areas of source activity during the ictal period, while the precuneus (PC), cuneus, and thalamus were relatively inactive. Conclusions: Some brain areas become more excited and have increased source activity during seizures. These significant brain regions might be re-combined to form an epilepsy network that regulates the process of absence seizures. Significance: The study confirmed that important brain regions are reorganized in an epilepsy network, which provides a basis for exploring the network mechanism of CAE development. Imaging findings may provide a reference for clinical characteristics. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Previous research has aimed to modulate cortical sleep slow-waves and spindles to facilitate episodic memory consolidation. Here, we instead aimed to modulate hippocampal activity during slow-wave sleep using transcranial direct current stimulation in 18 healthy humans. A pair-associate episodic memory task was used to evaluate sleep-dependent memory consolidation with face-occupation stimuli. Pre- and post-nap retrieval was assessed as a measure of memory performance. Anodal stimulation with 2 mA was applied bilaterally over the lateral temporal cortex, motivated by its particularly extensive connections to the hippocampus. The participants slept in a magnetic resonance (MR)-simulator during the recordings to test the feasibility for a future MR-study. We used a sham-controlled, double-blind, counterbalanced randomized, within-subject crossover design. We show that stimulation vs. sham significantly increased slow-wave density and the temporal coupling of fast spindles and slow-waves. While retention of episodic memories across sleep was not affected across the entire sample of participants, it was impaired in participants with below-average pre-sleep memory performance. Hence, bi-temporal anodal direct current stimulation applied during sleep enhanced sleep parameters that are typically involved in memory consolidation, but it failed to improve memory consolidation and even tended to impair consolidation in poor learners. These findings suggest that artificially enhancing memory-related sleep parameters to improve memory consolidation can actually backfire in those participants who are in most need of memory improvement.

Recently, interneuron activity responsible for fast oscillatory brain activity has been found to be impaired in a mouse model of FTD with consequent cognitive and behavioral alterations. In this study, we aim to investigate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a novel promising therapeutic intervention for FTD based on 40 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation thought to engage neural activity in a frequency-specific manner and thus suited to restore altered brain oscillatory patterns. Methods This is a multi-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on 50 patients with a diagnosis of behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD). Participants will be randomized to undergo either 30 days of 1-hour daily tACS or Sham (placebo) tACS. The outcomes will be assessed at baseline, right after the intervention and at a 3- to 6-months follow-up. The primary outcome measures are represented by the safety and feasibility of tACS administration, which will be assessed considering the nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events as well as attrition rate, respectively. To assess secondary outcomes, participants will undergo extensive neuropsychological and behavioral assessments and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scans to evaluate changes in brain metabolism, functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), resting and evoked electroencephalography, as well as blood biomarkers to measure changes in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory markers. Results The trial started in October 2020 and will end in October 2023. Study protocols have been approved by the local institutional review board (IRB) at each data-collection site. Discussion This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of 40 Hz tACS in bvFTD patients and its efficacy on gamma oscillatory activity, cognitive function, and brain glucose hypometabolism.

Recent work has suggested neuroanatomical and neurophysiological variability may alter tES efficacy. However, direct evidence is limited. Objective: We have previously replicated effects of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) on improving multitasking ability in young adults. Here, we attempt to assess whether these stimulation parameters have comparable effects in older adults (aged 60-80 years), which is a population known to have greater variability in neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. It is hypothesized that this variability in neuroanatomy and neurophysiology will be predictive of tACS efficacy. Methods: We conducted a pre-registered study where tACS was applied above the prefrontal cortex (between electrodes F3-F4) while participants were engaged in multitasking. Participants were randomized to receive either 6-Hz (theta) tACS for 26.67 min daily for three days (80 min total; Long Exposure Theta group), 6-Hz tACS for 5.33 min daily (16-min total; Short Exposure Theta group), or 1-Hz tACS for 26.67 min (80 min total; Control group). To account for neuroanatomy, magnetic resonance imaging data was used to form individualized models of the tACS-induced electric field (EF) within the brain. To account for neurophysiology, electroencephalography data was used to identify individual peak theta frequency. Results: Results indicated that only in the Long Theta group, performance change was correlated with modeled EF and peak theta frequency. Together, modeled EF and peak theta frequency accounted for 54%-65% of the variance in tACS-related performance improvements, which sustained for a month. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the importance of individual differences in neuroanatomy and neurophysiology in tACS research and help account for inconsistent effects across studies.

Complex biological systems consist of multi-level mechanism in terms of within- and cross-subsystems correlations, and they are primarily manifested in terms of connectivity, multiscale properties, and nonlinearity. Existing studies have each only explored one aspect of the functional corticocortical coupling (FCCC), which has some limitations in portraying the complexity of multivariable systems. The present study investigated the direct interactions of brain networks at multiple time scales. Approach. We extended the multivariate transfer entropy (MuTE) method and proposed a novel method, named multiscale multivariate transfer entropy (MSMVTE), to explore the direct interactions of brain networks across multiple time scale. To verify this aim, we introduced three simulation models and compared them with multiscale transfer entropy (MSTE) and MuTE methods. We then applied MSMVTE method to analyze FCCC during a unilateral right-hand steady-state force task. Main results. Simulation results showed that the MSMVTE method, compared with MSTE and MuTE methods, better detected direct interactions and avoid the spurious effects of indirect relationships. Further analysis of experimental data showed that the connectivity from left premotor/sensorimotor cortex to right premotor/sensorimotor cortex was significantly higher than that of opposite directionality. Furthermore, the connectivities from central motor areas to both sides of premotor/sensorimotor areas were higher than those of opposite directionalities. Additionally, the maximum coupling strength was found to occur at a specific scale (3-10). Significance. Simulation results confirmed the effectiveness of the MSMVTE method to describe direct relationships and multiscale characteristics in complex systems. The enhancement of FCCC reflects the interaction of more extended activation in cortical motor regions. Additionally, the neurodynamic process of brain depends not only on emergent behavior at small scales, but also on the constraining effects of the activity at large scales. Taken together, our findings provide a basis for better understanding dynamics in brain networks.

Hearing Impaired Participants Improve More Under Envelope-Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation When Signal to Noise Ratio Is High	NEUROSCIENCE INSIGHTS			English	Article						EEG; tACS; hearing impairment; hearing aid; speech processing; speech envelope; entrainment; aging	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; PHASE ENTRAINMENT; NEURAL RESPONSES; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; OLDER-ADULTS; SPEECH; COMPREHENSION; OSCILLATIONS; DISCRIMINATION	An issue commonly expressed by hearing aid users is a difficulty to understand speech in complex hearing scenarios. that is. when speech is presented together with background noise or in situations with multiple speakers. Conventional hearing aids are already designed with these issues in mind, using beamforming to only enhance sound from a specific direction, but these are limited in solving these issues as they can only modulate incoming sound at the cochlear level. However, evidence exists that age-related hearing loss might partially be caused later in the hearing processes due to brain processes slowing down and becoming less efficient. In this study, we tested whether it would be possible to improve the hearing process at the cortical level by improving neural tracking of speech. The speech envelopes of target sentences were transformed into an electrical signal and stimulated onto elderly participants' cortices using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). We compared 2 different signal to noise ratios (SNRs) with 5 different delays between sound presentation and stimulation ranging from 50ms to 150ms, and the differences in effects between elderly normal hearing and elderly hearing impaired participants. When the task was performed at a high SNR, hearing impaired participants appeared to gain more from envelope-tACS compared to when the task was performed at a lower SNR. This was not the case for normal hearing participants. Furthermore, a post-hoc analysis of the different time-lags suggest that elderly were significantly better at a stimulation time-lag of 150ms when the task was presented at a high SNR. In this paper. we outline why these effects are worth exploring further, and what they tell us about the optimal tACS time-lag.

Despite decades of research on central processing of pain, there are still several unanswered questions, in particular regarding the brain regions that may contribute to this alerting sensation. Since it is generally accepted that more than one cortical area is responsible for pain processing, there is an increasing focus on the interaction between areas known to be involved. Approach. In this study, we aimed to investigate the bidirectional information flow from the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in an animal model of neuropathic pain.19 rats (nine controls and ten intervention) had an intracortical electrode implanted with six pins in SI and six pins in ACC, and a cuff stimulation electrode around the sciatic nerve. The intervention rats were subjected to the spared nerve injury (SNI) after baseline recordings. Electrical stimulation at three intensities of both noxious and non-noxious stimulation was used to record electrically evoked cortical potentials. To investigate information flow, two connectivity measures were used: phase lag index (PLI) and granger prediction (GP). The rats were anesthetized during the entire study. Main results. Immediately after the intervention (<5 min after intervention), the high frequency (gamma and gamma+) PLI was significantly decreased compared to controls. In the last recording cycle (3-4 h after intervention), the GP increased consistently in the intervention group. Peripheral nerve injury, as a model of neuropathic pain, resulted in an immediate decrease in information flow between SI and ACC, possibly due to decreased sensory input from the injured nerve. Hours after injury, the connectivity between SI and ACC increased, likely indicating hypersensitivity of this pathway. Significance. We have shown that both a directed and non-directed connectivity between SI and ACC approach can be used to show the acute changes resulting from the SNI model.

However, effect of NFT of alpha activity on memory is controversial. The current study analyzed previous works in terms of randomized and blinded analyses, training paradigms, and participant characteristics to validate the efficacy of alpha NFT on memory in a healthy population. Objectives: A systematic meta-analysis of studies with randomized controlled trials was performed to explore the effect of alpha NFT on working memory (WM) and episodic memory (EM) in a healthy population. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library from January 1, 1999, to November 30, 2019. Previous studies were evaluated with the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB). A meta-analysis calculating absolute weighted standardized mean difference (SMD) using random-effects models was employed. Heterogeneity was estimated using I-2 statistics. Funnel plots and Egger's test were performed to evaluate the quality of evidence. Results: Sixteen studies with 217 healthy participants in the control group and 210 participants in the alpha group met the eligibility criteria. Alpha NFT studies with WM measures presented little publication bias (P = 0.116), and 5 of 7 domains in the Cochrane RoB exhibited a low risk of bias. The overall effect size from 14 WM studies was 0.56 (95% CI 0.31-0.81, P < 0.0001; I-2 = 28%). Six EM studies exhibited an effect size of 0.77 (95% CI 0.06-1.49, P = 0.03; I-2 = 77%). Conclusion: Meta-analysis results suggest that alpha NFT seems to have a positive effect on the WM and EM of healthy participants. Future efforts should focus on the neurophysiological mechanisms of alpha NFT in memory.

Noise-induced neurophysiological alterations in the rat medial geniculate body and thalamocortical desynchronization by deep brain stimulation	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						auditory thalamus; deep brain stimulation; electrophysiology; medial geniculate body; tinnitus		The thalamic medial geniculate body (MGB) is uniquely positioned within the neural tinnitus networks. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the MGB has been proposed as a possible novel treatment for tinnitus, yet mechanisms remain elusive. The aim of this study was to characterize neurophysiologic hallmarks in the MGB after noise exposure and to assess the neurophysiological effects of electrical stimulation of the MGB. Fourteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were included. Nine subjects were unilaterally exposed to a 16-kHz octave-band noise at 115 dB for 90 min, five received sham exposure. Single units were recorded from the contralateral MGB where spontaneous firing, coefficient of variation, response type, rate-level functions, and thresholds were determined. Local field potentials and electroencephalographical (EEG) recordings were performed before and after high-fre-quency DBS of the MGB. Thalamocortical synchronization and power were analyzed. In total, 214 single units were identified (n = 145 in noise-exposed group, n = 69 in control group). After noise exposure, fast-responding neurons become less respon-sive or nonresponsive without change to their spontaneous rate, whereas sustained-and suppressed-type neurons exhibit enhanced spontaneous activity without change to their stimulus-driven activity. MGB DBS suppressed thalamocortical synchroni-zation in the 13 and c bands, supporting suppression of thalamocortical synchronization as an underlying mechanism of tinnitus suppression by high frequency DBS. These findings contribute to our understanding of the neurophysiologic consequences of noise exposure and the mechanism of potential DBS therapy for tinnitus. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Separate functional classes of MGB neurons might have distinct roles in tinnitus pathophysiology. After noise exposure, fast-responding neurons become less responsive or nonresponsive without change to their spontaneous firing, whereas sustained and suppressed neurons exhibit enhanced spontaneous activity without change to their stimulus-driven activ-ity. Furthermore, results suggest desynchronization of thalamocortical 13 and c oscillations as a mechanism of tinnitus suppres-sion by MGB DBS.

Theta Band Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation Enhances Arithmetic Learning: A Systematic Comparison of Different Direct and Alternating Current Stimulations	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						transcranial electrical stimulation; non-invasive brain stimulation; arithmetic learning; EEG; event-related (de)synchronization	HYPERSENSITIVITY-TO-INTERFERENCE; LEFT ANGULAR GYRUS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; BRAIN-STIMULATION; COGNITIVE ENHANCEMENT; OSCILLATIONS REFLECT; MEMORY; TDCS; PERFORMANCE; ALPHA	Over the last decades, interest in transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) has grown, as it might allow for causal investigations of the associations between cortical activity and cognition as well as to directly influ-ence cognitive performance. The main objectives of the present work were to assess whether tES can enhance the acquisition and application of arithmetic abilities, and whether it enables a better assessment of underlying neurophysiological processes. To this end, the present, double-blind, sham-controlled study assessed the effects of six active stimulations (three tES protocols: anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), alpha band transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), and theta band tACS; targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or the left posterior parietal cortex) on the acquisition of an arithmetic procedure, arithmetic facts, and event-related synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) patterns. 137 healthy adults were randomly assigned to one of seven groups, each receiving one of the tES-protocols during learning. Results showed that frontal theta band tACS reduced the repetitions needed to learn novel facts and both, frontal and parietal theta band tACS accelerated the decrease in calculation times in fact learning problems. The beneficial effect of frontal theta band tACS may reflect enhanced executive functions, allowing for better control and inhibition processes and hence, a faster acquisition and integration of novel fact knowledge. However, there were no significant effects of the stimulations on procedural learning or ERS/ERD patterns. Overall, theta band tACS appears promising as a support for arithmetic fact training, but effects on procedural calculations and neurophysiological processes remain ambiguous. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Phonological Underspecification: An Explanation for How a Rake Can Become Awake	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						ERP; EEG; underspecification; MMN; ERSP; theta; gamma; phonology		Neural markers, such as the mismatch negativity (MMN), have been used to examine the phonological underspecification of English feature contrasts using the Featurally Underspecified Lexicon (FUL) model. However, neural indices have not been examined within the approximant phoneme class, even though there is evidence suggesting processing asymmetries between liquid (e.g., //) and glide (e.g., /w/) phonemes. The goal of this study was to determine whether glide phonemes elicit electrophysiological asymmetries related to [consonantal] underspecification when contrasted with liquid phonemes in adult English speakers. Specifically, /alpha/ is categorized as [+consonantal] while /walpha/ is not specified [i.e., (-consonantal)]. Following the FUL framework, if /w/ is less specified than //, the former phoneme should elicit a larger MMN response than the latter phoneme. Fifteen English-speaking adults were presented with two syllables, /alpha/ and /walpha/, in an event-related potential (ERP) oddball paradigm in which both syllables served as the standard and deviant stimulus in opposite stimulus sets. Three types of analyses were used: (1) traditional mean amplitude measurements; (2) cluster-based permutation analyses; and (3) event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analyses. The less specified /walpha/ elicited a large MMN, while a much smaller MMN was elicited by the more specified /alpha/. In the standard and deviant ERP waveforms, /walpha/ elicited a significantly larger negative response than did /alpha/. Theta activity elicited by /alpha/ was significantly greater than that elicited by /walpha/ in the 100-300 ms time window. Also, low gamma activation was significantly lower for /alpha/ vs. /walpha/ deviants over the left hemisphere, as compared to the right, in the 100-150 ms window. These outcomes suggest that the [consonantal] feature follows the underspecification predictions of FUL previously tested with the place of articulation and voicing features. Thus, this study provides new evidence for phonological underspecification. Moreover, as neural oscillation patterns have not previously been discussed in the underspecification literature, the ERSP analyses identified potential new indices of phonological underspecification.

Functional MRI studies have provided excellent spatial mapping of the involved regions. However, finer temporal resolution is needed to capture the underlying neural dynamics and the pattern of their functional contributions. Here, we used anatomically-constrained magnetoencephalography (aMEG) which combines MEG with structural MRI to examine how the spatial ( "where ") and temporal ( "when ") processing stages and interregional co-oscillations unfold in real time to contribute to inhibitory control. Healthy participants completed a modified Go/NoGo paradigm in which a subset of stimuli was modified to be visually salient (SAL). Compared to the non-modified condition, the SAL manipulation facilitated response withholding on NoGo trials and hindered responding to Go stimuli, reflecting attentional capture effectuated by an orienting response to SAL stimuli. aMEG source estimates indicate SAL stimuli elicited the attentional "circuit breaker " effect through early activity within a right-lateralized network centered around the lateral temporal cortex with additional activity in the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) and anterior insula (aINS/FO). Activity of the bilateral inferior frontal cortex responded specifically to inhibitory demands and was generally unaffected by the attentional manipulation. In contrast, early aINS/FO activity was sensitive to stimulus salience while subsequent activity was specific to inhibitory control. Activity estimated to the medial prefrontal cortex including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and preSMA reflected an integrative role that was sensitive to both inhibitory and attentional stimulus properties. At the level of neurofunctional networks, neural synchrony in the theta band (4-7 Hz) revealed interactions between principal cortical regions subserving attentional and inhibitory processes. Together, these results underscore the dynamic, integrative processing stages underlying inhibitory control.

Effects of obstructive sleep apnea on human spatial navigational memory processing in cognitively normal older individuals	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						elderly; learning; EEG; SWA; Alzheimer disease	SLOW-WAVE SLEEP; DEPENDENT MEMORY; CONSOLIDATION; HIPPOCAMPUS; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; SPINDLES; IMPACT	Study Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) prevalence increases with age, but whether OSA-related sleep disruption could interrupt the processing of previously encoded wake information thought to normally occur during sleep in cognitively normal older adults remains unknown. Methods: Fifty-two older (age = 66.9 +/- 7.7 years, 56% female), community-dwelling, cognitively normal adults explored a 3-D maze environment and then performed 3 timed trials before (evening) and after (morning) sleep recorded with polysomnography with a 20-minute morning psychomotor vigilance test. Results: Twenty-two (22) participants had untreated OSA [apnea-hypopnea index (AHI4%) >= 5 events/h] where severity was mild on average [median (interquartile range); AHI4% = 11.0 (20.7) events/h] and 30 participants had an AHI4% < 5 events/h. No significant differences were observed in overnight percent change in completion time or in the pattern of evening presleep maze performance. However, during the morning postsleep trials, there was a significant interaction between OSA group and morning trial number such that participants with OSA performed worse on average with each subsequent morning trial, whereas those without OSA showed improvements. There were no significant differences in morning psychomotor vigilance test performance, suggesting that vigilance is unlikely to account for this difference in morning maze performance. Increasing relative frontal slow wave activity was associated with better overnight maze performance improvement in participants with OSA (r = .51, P = .02) but not in those without OSA, and no differences in slow wave activity were observed between groups. Conclusions: OSA alters morning performance in spatial navigation independent of a deleterious effect on morning vigilance or evening navigation performance. Relative frontal slow wave activity is associated with overnight performance change in older participants with OSA, but not those without.

Comprehensive analysis of the 5-HTTLPR allelic polymorphism effect on behavioral and neurophysiological indicators of executive control in people from different ethnic groups in Siberia	VAVILOVSKII ZHURNAL GENETIKI I SELEKTSII			English	Article						serotonin transporter; 5-HTTLPR polymorphism; personal anxiety; stop-signal paradigm; premotor evoked potential	SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER GENE; ASSOCIATION; STRESS; EEG; DEPRESSION; ANXIETY; MODEL	The allelic polymorphism of the serotonin transporter's gene 5-HTTLPR is considered as one of the factors determining an individual genetic predisposition to the development of a wide range of affective disorders, including depression. Many studies have shown that the climatic and social conditions of people's life can have a significant impact on the connections of 5-HTTLPR with the risk of depression. The stop-signal paradigm (SSP) is an experimental method allowing evaluating an individual ability to the self-control of behavior in a changing environment. In the SSP experiment, a subject should either press one of several buttons quickly after the appearance of the target stimuli or suppress the already started movement if an inhibitory signal follows the target stimulus. The aim of this study is a research of associations between the allelic the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and the individual scores of the personal anxiety level, as well as the behavioral and neurophysiological indicators of the ability to self-control over motor reactions in the SSP. The study was conducted among people from three ethno-regional groups: healthy Caucasoids from Novosibirsk, the Mongoloid groups of the indigenous population of the Tuva Republic and Sakha Republic (Yakutia). Genetic, ethnographic, and psychological influences on an individual's ability to control motor responses were compared. The amplitude of the premotor peak of the evoked brain potential was used as a neurophysiological marker of the person's readiness to the execution of target-directed activity. It was revealed that the frequency of the S-allele polymorphism 5-HTTLPR was significantly higher for both mongoloid groups compared to the Caucasoids. The S/S genotype was associated with an increased level of personal anxiety and at the same time with a better ability to the self-control of behavior in the SSP experiment. Anxiety level, participants' sex, ethnicity, and allelic polymorphism 5-HTTLPR had a statistically significant effect on the amplitude of the premotor readiness potential recorded under the SSP conditions in the frontal and parietal-occipital cortical regions. Our data support the hypothesis that the S/S genotype of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism may be associated with more success in adapting to the climatic conditions connected with high life risk in comparison to L/L and L/S genotypes.

Consequently, the present study aimed to investigate cognitive impairment and the resting-state network topology of children with benign epilepsy with unilateral centrotemporal spikes (U-BECTS) and with bilateral centrotemporal spikes (B-BECTS). Methods: This study recruited 14 children with U-BECTS and 14 with B-BECTS. Thereafter, cognition was assessed in 28 children with BECTS and 14 healthy controls, using the fourth edition of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale (WISC-IV). Additionally, the functional network of the brain was constructed through magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record the resting-state brain magnetic signals of the brain and by computing virtual sensor waveforms at the source level. Moreover, graph theory (GT) analysis was used to assess the properties of the brain network. Results: Children in the B-BECTS group had an earlier onset of epilepsy compared to those in the U-BECTS category. In addition, both the B-BECTS and U-BECTS groups had lower Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ), Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), and Working Memory Index (WMI) scores, compared to the healthy controls although only children in the B-BECTS category had lower Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI) scores. The results also showed that both BECTS groups had increased frontal cortex connectivity in specific frequency bands. Notably, children with B-BECTS showed a more disorderly and randomized network in the 1-4-Hz and 80-250-Hz frequency bands. Moreover, GT analysis showed that children with B-BECTS had lower clustering coefficient and characteristic path length in the 80-250-Hz frequency bands and higher connection strength in the 4-8-Hz frequency bands. On the other hand, the U-BECTS group had a higher clustering coefficient in the 8-12-Hz frequency bands, compared to the healthy con-trols. Correlation analysis revealed that there were negative correlations between network parameters, clinical characteristics, and neuropsychological data in the U-BECTS category. Conclusion: The findings revealed that children with BECTS display a diffuse early cognitive deficit. In addition, resting-state suboptimal network topology may be the mechanism of cognitive impairment in children with BECTS. The study also showed that and children with B-BECTS may be at a higher risk of cognitive impairment. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

High-dose exposure with nerve agents (NA) is known to produce seizure activity and related brain damage, while less is known about the effects of acute sub-lethal dose exposure. The aim of this study was to characterize behavioral, brain activity and neuroinflammatory modifications at different time points after exposure to 4-nitrophenyl isopropyl methylphosphonate (NIMP), a sarin surrogate. In order to decipher the impacts of sub-lethal exposure, we chose 4 different doses of NIMP each corresponding to a fraction of the median lethal dose (LD50). First, we conducted a behavioral analysis of symptoms during the first hour following NIMP challenge and established a specific scoring scale for the intoxication severity. The intensity of intoxication signs was dose-dependent and proportional to the cholinesterase activity inhibition evaluated in mice brain. The lowest dose (0.3 LD50) did not induce significant behavioral, electrocorticographic (ECoG) nor cholinesterase activity changes. Animals exposed to one of the other doses (0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 LD50) exhibited substantial changes in behavior, significant cholinesterase activity inhibition, and a disruption of brainwave distribution that persisted in a dose-dependent manner. To evaluate long lasting changes, we conducted ECoG recording for 30 days on mice exposed to 0.5 or 0.9 LD50 of NIMP. Mice in both groups showed long-lasting impairment of theta rhythms, and a lack of restoration in hippocampal ChE activity after 1-month post-exposure. In addition, an increase in neuroinflammatory markers (IBA-1, TNF-alpha, NF-kappa B) and edema were transiently observed in mice hippocampus. Furthermore, a novel object recognition test showed an alteration of short-term memory in both groups, 1-month post-NIMP intoxication. Our findings identified both transient and long-term ECoG alterations and some long term cognitive impairments following exposure to sub-lethal doses of NIMP. These may further impact morphopathological alterations in the brain.

Ketamine and Attentional Bias Toward Emotional Faces: Dynamic Causal Modeling of Magnetoencephalographic Connectivity in Treatment-Resistant Depression	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						ketamine; major depressive disorder; magnetoencephalography; dynamic causal modeling; amygdala	NMDA RECEPTOR BLOCKADE; D-ASPARTATE ANTAGONIST; ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFICACY; OSCILLATIONS; DISRUPTIONS; MECHANISMS; TRIAL; EEG; TOP	The glutamatergic modulator ketamine rapidly reduces depressive symptoms in individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TRD) and bipolar disorder. While its underlying mechanism of antidepressant action is not fully understood, modulating glutamatergically-mediated connectivity appears to be a critical component moderating antidepressant response. This double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study analyzed data from 19 drug-free individuals with TRD and 15 healthy volunteers who received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) as well as an intravenous infusion of saline placebo. Magnetoencephalographic recordings were collected prior to the first infusion and 6-9 h after both drug and placebo infusions. During scanning, participants completed an attentional dot probe task that included emotional faces. Antidepressant response was measured across time points using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was used to measure changes in parameter estimates of connectivity via a biophysical model that included realistic local neuronal architecture and receptor channel signaling, modeling connectivity between the early visual cortex, fusiform cortex, amygdala, and inferior frontal gyrus. Clinically, ketamine administration significantly reduced depressive symptoms in TRD participants. Within the model, ketamine administration led to faster gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) transmission in the early visual cortex, faster NMDA transmission in the fusiform cortex, and slower NMDA transmission in the amygdala. Ketamine administration also led to direct and indirect changes in local inhibition in the early visual cortex and inferior frontal gyrus and to indirect increases in cortical excitability within the amygdala. Finally, reductions in depressive symptoms in TRD participants post-ketamine were associated with faster alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) transmission and increases in gain control of spiny stellate cells in the early visual cortex. These findings provide additional support for the GABA and NMDA inhibition and disinhibition hypotheses of depression and support the role of AMPA throughput in ketamine's antidepressant effects.

AD lacks an effective pharmacological intervention; thereby, non-pharmacological treatments (NPTs) play an important role, as they have been proven to ameliorate AD symptoms. Nevertheless, results associated with NPTs are patient-dependent, and new tools are needed to predict their outcome and to improve their effectiveness. In the present study, 19 patients with AD underwent an NPT for 83.1 +/- 38.9 days (mean +/- standard deviation). The NPT was a personalized intervention with physical, cognitive, and memory stimulation. The magnetoencephalographic activity was recorded at the beginning and at the end of the NPT to evaluate the neurophysiological state of each patient. Additionally, the cognitive (assessed by means of the Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE) and behavioral (assessed in terms of the Dementia Behavior Disturbance Scale, DBD-13) status were collected before and after the NPT. We analyzed the interactions between cognitive, behavioral, and neurophysiological data by generating diverse association networks, able to intuitively characterize the relationships between variables of a different nature. Our results suggest that the NPT remarkably changed the structure of the association network, reinforcing the interactions between the DBD-13 and the neurophysiological parameters. We also found that the changes in cognition and behavior are related to the changes in spectral-based neurophysiological parameters. Furthermore, our results support the idea that MEG-derived parameters can predict NPT outcome; specifically, a lesser degree of AD neurophysiological alterations (i.e., neural oscillatory slowing, decreased variety of spectral components, and increased neural signal regularity) predicts a better NPT prognosis. This study provides deeper insights into the relationships between neurophysiology and both, cognitive and behavioral status, proving the potential of network-based methodology as a tool to further understand the complex interactions elicited by NPTs.

Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated unique characterization and accurate identification of individuals as an accomplished task. However, FC fingerprinting in magnetoencephalography (MEG) data is still widely un-explored. Here, we study resting-state MEG data from the Human Connectome Project to assess the MEG FC fingerprinting and its relationship with several factors including amplitude-and phase-coupling functional con-nectivity measures, spatial leakage correction, frequency bands, and behavioral significance. To this end, we first employ two identification scoring methods, differential identifiability and success rate, to provide quantitative fingerprint scores for each FC measurement. Secondly, we explore the edgewise and nodal MEG fingerprinting patterns across the different frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). Finally, we investigate the cross-modality fingerprinting patterns obtained from MEG and fMRI recordings from the same subjects. We assess the behavioral significance of FC across connectivity measures and imaging modalities using partial least square correlation analyses. Our results suggest that fingerprinting performance is heavily dependent on the functional connectivity measure, frequency band, identification scoring method, and spatial leakage correction. We report higher MEG fingerprinting performances in phase-coupling methods, central frequency bands (alpha and beta), and in the visual, frontoparietal, dorsal-attention, and default-mode networks. Furthermore, cross-modality com-parisons reveal a certain degree of spatial concordance in fingerprinting patterns between the MEG and fMRI data, especially in the visual system. Finally, the multivariate correlation analyses show that MEG connectomes have strong behavioral significance, which however depends on the considered connectivity measure and temporal scale. This comprehensive, albeit preliminary investigation of MEG connectome test-retest identifiability offers a first characterization of MEG fingerprinting in relation to different methodological and electrophysiological factors and contributes to the understanding of fingerprinting cross-modal relationships. We hope that this first investigation will contribute to setting the grounds for MEG connectome identification.

J	Qi, JP; Zhu, Y; Pu, F; Zhang, P				Qi, Jinpeng; Zhu, Ying; Pu, Fang; Zhang, Ping			A novel RSW&TST framework of MCPs detection for abnormal pattern recognition on large-scale time series and pathological signals in epilepsy	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC CHANGES; OSCILLATIONS	To quickly and efficiently recognize abnormal patterns from large-scale time series and pathological signals in epilepsy, this paper presents here a preliminary RSW&TST framework for Multiple Change-Points (MCPs) detection based on the Random Slide Window (RSW) and Trigeminal Search Tree (TST) methods. To avoid the remaining local optima, the proposed framework applies a random strategy for selecting the size of each slide window from a predefined collection, in terms of data feature and experimental knowledge. For each data segment to be diagnosed in a current slide window, an optimal path towards a potential change point is detected by TST methods from the top root to leaf nodes with O (log3(N)). Then, the resulting MCPs vector is assembled by means of TST-based single CP detection on data segments within each of the slide windows. In our experiments, the RSW&TST framework was tested by using large-scale synthetic time series, and then its performance was evaluated by comparing it with existing binary search tree (BST), Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)-statistics, and T-test under the fixed slide window (FSW) approach, as well as the integrated method of wild binary segmentation and CUSUM test (WBS&CUSUM). The simulation results indicate that our RSW&TST is both more efficient and effective, with a higher hit rate, shorter computing time, and lower missed, error and redundancy rates. When the proposed RSW&TST framework is executed for MCPs detection on pathological ECG (electrocardiogram)/EEG (electroencephalogram) recordings of people in epileptic states, the abnormal patterns are roughly recognized in terms of the number and position of the resultant MCPs. Furthermore, the severity of epilepsy is roughly analyzed based on the strength and period of signal fluctuations among multiple change points in the stage of a sudden epileptic attack. The purpose of our RSW&TST framework is to provide an encouraging platform for abnormal pattern recognition through MCPs detection on largescale time series quickly and efficiently.

Age-related changes in event related potentials, steady state responses and temporal processing in the auditory cortex of mice with severe or mild hearing loss	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						Aging; Presbycusis; Auditory cortex; Temporal processing; Gap processing; Central gain; Neural oscillations	FREQUENCY-MODULATED SWEEPS; GAP DETECTION THRESHOLDS; MOUSE MODEL; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; YOUNG; BRAIN; NOISE; SELECTIVITY; INHIBITION; NEURONS	Age-related changes in auditory processing affect the quality of life of older adults with and without hearing loss. To distinguish between the effects of sensorineural hearing loss and aging on cortical processing, the main goal of the present study was to compare cortical responses using the same stimulus paradigms and recording conditions in two strains of mice (C57BL/6J and FVB) that differ in the degree of age-related hearing loss. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were obtained from freely moving young and old mice using epidural screw electrodes. We measured event related potentials (ERP) and 40 Hz auditory steady-state responses (ASSR). We used a novel stimulus, termed the gap-ASSR stimulus, which elicits an ASSR by rapidly presenting short gaps in continuous noise. By varying the gap widths and modulation depths, we probed the limits of temporal processing in young and old mice. Temporal fidelity of ASSR and gap-ASSR responses were measured as phase consistency across trials (inter-trial phase clustering; ITPC). The old C57 mice, which show severe hearing loss, produced larger ERP amplitudes compared to young mice. Despite robust ERPs, the old C57 mice showed significantly diminished ITPC in the ASSR and gap-ASSR responses, even with 100% modulation depth. The FVB mice, which show mild hearing loss with age, generated similar ERP amplitudes and ASSR ITPC across the age groups tested. However, the old FVB mice showed decreased gap-ASSR responses compared to young mice, particularly for modulation depths < 100%. The C57 mice data suggest that severe presbycusis leads to increased gain in the auditory cortex, but with reduced temporal fidelity. The FVB mice data suggest that with mild hearing loss, age-related changes in temporal processing become apparent only when tested with more challenging sounds (shorter gaps and shallower modulation).

Inhibitory control in children with tic disorder: aberrant fronto-parietal network activity and connectivity	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						electroencephalography; neural oscillations; effective connectivity; movement disorders; Tourette syndrome	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; TOURETTE-SYNDROME; COGNITIVE CONTROL; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN; ACTIVATION; PRECUNEUS; SEVERITY; PATTERNS; FMRI	Chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, are typically thought to have deficits in cognitive inhibition and top down cognitive control due to the frequent and repetitive occurrence of tics, yet studies reporting task performance results have been equivocal. Despite similar behavioural performance, individuals with chronic tic disorder have exhibited aberrant patterns of neural activation in multiple frontal and parietal regions relative to healthy controls during inhibitory control paradigms. In addition to these top down attentional control regions, widespread alterations in brain activity across multiple neural networks have been reported. There is a dearth, however, of studies examining event-related connectivity during cognitive inhibitory paradigms among affected individuals. The goal of this study was to characterize neural oscillatory activity and effective connectivity, using a case-control design, among children with and without chronic tic disorder during performance of a cognitive inhibition task. Electroencephalogram data were recorded in a cohort of children aged 8-12 years old (60 with chronic tic disorder, 35 typically developing controls) while they performed a flanker task. While task accuracy did not differ by diagnosis, children with chronic tic disorder displayed significant cortical source-level, event-related spectral power differences during incongruent flanker trials, which required inhibitory control. Specifically, attenuated broad band oscillatory power modulation within the anterior cingulate cortex was observed relative to controls. Whole brain effective connectivity analyses indicated that children with chronic tic disorder exhibit greater information flow between the anterior cingulate and other fronto-parietal network hubs (midcingulate cortex and precuneus) relative to controls, who instead showed stronger connectivity between central and posterior nodes. Spectral power within the anterior cingulate was not significantly correlated with any connectivity edges, suggesting lower power and higher connectivity are independent (versus resultant) neural mechanisms. Significant correlations between clinical features, task performance and anterior cingulate spectral power and connectivity suggest this region is associated with tic impairment (r = -0.31, P = 0.03) and flanker task incongruent trial accuracy (r's = 0.27 to 0.42, P's = 0.0008-0.04). Attenuated activation of the anterior cingulate along with dysregulated information flow between and among nodes within the Pronto-parietal attention network may be neural adaptations that result from frequent engagement of neural pathways needed for inhibitory control in chronic tic disorder.

The Brain Tracks Multiple Predictions About the Auditory Scene	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						auditory attention; task switching; pattern detection; mismatch negativity (MMN); event-related potentials (ERPs); neural entrainment	MISMATCH-NEGATIVITY; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; ENTRAINMENT; PATTERNS; TIME; REGULARITIES; MECHANISM; CORTEX; MMN	The predictable rhythmic structure is important to most ecologically relevant sounds for humans, such as is found in the rhythm of speech or music. This study addressed the question of how rhythmic predictions are maintained in the auditory system when there are multiple perceptual interpretations occurring simultaneously and emanating from the same sound source. We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) while presenting participants with a tone sequence that had two different tone feature patterns, one based on the sequential rhythmic variation in tone duration and the other on sequential rhythmic variation in tone intensity. Participants were presented with the same sound sequences and were instructed to listen for the intensity pattern (ignore fluctuations in duration) and press a response key to detected pattern deviants (attend intensity pattern task); to listen to the duration pattern (ignore fluctuations in intensity) and make a button press to duration pattern deviants (attend duration pattern task), and to watch a movie and ignore the sounds presented to their ears (attend visual task). Both intensity and duration patterns occurred predictably 85% of the time, thus the key question involved evaluating how the brain treated the irrelevant feature patterns (standards and deviants) while performing an auditory or visual task. We expected that task-based feature patterns would have a more robust brain response to attended standards and deviants than the unattended feature patterns. Instead, we found that the neural entrainment to the rhythm of the standard attended patterns had similar power to the standard of the unattended feature patterns. In addition, the infrequent pattern deviants elicited the event-related brain potential called the mismatch negativity component (MMN). The MMN elicited by task-based feature pattern deviants had a similar amplitude to MMNs elicited by unattended pattern deviants that were unattended because they were not the target pattern or because the participant ignored the sounds and watched a movie. Thus, these results demonstrate that the brain tracks multiple predictions about the complexities in sound streams and can automatically track and detect deviations with respect to these predictions. This capability would be useful for switching attention rapidly among multiple objects in a busy auditory scene.

Intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS), a form of electrical stimulation that mimics natural brain activity patterns, has proved to efficiently induce such effects in animal studies and rhythmic transcranial magnetic stimulation studies in humans. However, little is known about the potential neuroplasticity effects of iTBS applied through intracranial electrodes in humans. This study characterizes the physiological effects of intracranial iTBS in humans and compare them with alpha-frequency stimulation, another frequently used neuromodulatory pattern. We applied these two stimulation patterns to well-defined regions in the sensorimotor cortex, which elicited contralateral hand muscle contractions during clinical mapping, in patients with epilepsy implanted with intracranial electrodes. Treatment effects were evaluated using oscillatory coherence across areas connected to the treatment site, as defined with corticocortical-evoked potentials. Our results show that iTBS increases coherence in the beta-frequency band within the sensorimotor network indicating a potential neuroplasticity effect. The effect is specific to the sensorimotor system, the beta band, and the stimulation pattern and outlasted the stimulation period by similar to 3 min. The effect occurred in four out of seven subjects depending on the buildup of the effect during iTBS treatment and other patterns of oscillatory activity related to ceiling effects within the beta band and to preexistent coherence within the alpha band. By characterizing the neurophysiological effects of iTBS within well-defined cortical networks, we hope to provide an electrophysiological framework that allows clinicians/researchers to optimize brain stimulation protocols which may have translational value. NEW & NOTEWORTHY theta-Burst stimulation (TBS) protocols in transcranial magnetic stimulation studies have shown improved treatment efficacy in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. The optimal protocol to induce neuroplasticity in invasive direct electrical stimulation approaches is not known. We report that intracranial TBS applied in human sensorimotor cortex increases local coherence of preexistent beta rhythms. The effect is specific to the stimulation frequency and the stimulated network and outlasts the stimulation period by similar to 3 min.

Protocol of a Randomized Controlled Trial of Language Training vs. Musical Training and Social Interaction in Elderly With Subjective Cognitive Decline	FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						foreign language learning; bilingualism; cognitive flexibility; cognitive reserve; aging; late-life depression; subjective cognitive decline; functional neuroimaging	EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION; BILINGUAL ADVANTAGE; MEMORY COMPLAINTS; FLEXIBILITY; DEMENTIA; ADULTS; OSCILLATIONS; VALIDATION; IMPAIRMENT; EDUCATION	Introduction: With aging comes a reduction of cognitive flexibility, which has been related to the development of late-life depression and progression of general cognitive decline. Several factors have been linked to attenuating such decline in cognitive flexibility, such as education, physical exercise and stimulating leisure activities. Speaking two or more languages has recently received abundant attention as another factor that may build up cognitive reserve, thereby limiting the functional implications of compromised cognition that accompany old age. With the number of older adults reaching record levels, it is important to attenuate the development of old-age disorders. Learning to speak a foreign language might offer a powerful tool in promoting healthy aging, but up to date effect studies are sparse. Here, the protocol that forms the foundation of the current study is presented. The present study aims to: (1) examine the effects of a foreign language training on cognitive flexibility and its neural underpinnings, and on mental health; and (2) assess the unique role of foreign language training vs. other cognitive or social programs. Method: One-hundred and ninety-eight Dutch elderly participants reporting subjective cognitive decline are included and randomized to either a language intervention, a music intervention, or a social control intervention. During 3 to 6 months, the language group learns English, the music group learns to play the guitar and the social group participates in social meetings where art workshops are offered. At baseline, at a 3-month follow-up, and at 6 months after termination of the training program, clinical, cognitive and brain activity measurements (combined EEG and fNIRS methods) are taken to assess cognitive flexibility and mental health. Discussion: This is the first trial addressing combined effects of language learning in elderly on cognition, language proficiency, socio-affective measures, and brain activity in the context of a randomized controlled trial. If successful, this study can provide insights into how foreign language training can contribute to more cognitively and mentally healthy years in older adulthood.

The CNS-Penetrant Soluble Guanylate Cyclase Stimulator CY6463 Reveals its Therapeutic Potential in Neurodegenerative Diseases	FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						cGMP (cyclic GMP); nitric oxide; soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC); neurodegeneration; neuroprotection	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; DIET-INDUCED OBESITY; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; OBJECT RECOGNITION; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; NITRIC-OXIDE; PHOSPHODIESTERASE INHIBITORS; SYSTEM	Effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases remain elusive and are critically needed since the burden of these diseases increases across an aging global population. Nitric oxide (NO) is a gasotransmitter that binds to soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) to produce cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Impairment of this pathway has been demonstrated in neurodegenerative diseases. Normalizing deficient NO-cGMP signaling could address multiple pathophysiological features of neurodegenerative diseases. sGC stimulators are small molecules that synergize with NO, activate sGC, and increase cGMP production. Many systemic sGC stimulators have been characterized and advanced into clinical development for a variety of non-central nervous system (CNS) pathologies. Here, we disclose the discovery of CY6463, the first brain-penetrant sGC stimulator in clinical development for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, and demonstrate its ability to improve neuronal activity, mediate neuroprotection, and increase cognitive performance in preclinical models. In several cellular assays, CY6463 was demonstrated to be a potent stimulator of sGC. In agreement with the known effects of sGC stimulation in the vasculature, CY6463 elicits decreases in blood pressure in both rats and mice. Relative to a non-CNS penetrant sGC stimulator, rodents treated with CY6463 had higher cGMP levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging-blood-oxygen-level-dependent (fMRI-BOLD) signals, and cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) gamma-band oscillatory power. Additionally, CY6463 improved cognitive performance in a model of cognitive disruption induced by the administration of a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. In models of neurodegeneration, CY6463 treatment increased long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices from a Huntington's disease mouse model and decreased the loss of dendritic spines in aged and Alzheimer's disease mouse models. In a model of diet-induced obesity, CY6463 reduced markers of inflammation in the plasma. Furthermore, CY6463 elicited an additive increase in cortical gamma-band oscillatory power when co-administered with donepezil: the standard of care in Alzheimer's disease. Together, these data support the clinical development of CY6463 as a novel treatment for neurodegenerative disorders.

J	Liang, T; Wu, F; Sun, YX; Wang, BG				Liang, Tao; Wu, Fan; Sun, Yongxing; Wang, Baoguo			Electrophysiological Activity and Brain Network During Recovery of Propofol Anesthesia: A Stereoelectroencephalography-Based Analysis in Patients With Intractable Epilepsy-An Exploratory Research	FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY			English	Article						stereoelectroencephalogram; electrophysiological activity; network; propofol; epilepsy; recovery of consciousness	USER-FRIENDLY TOOLBOX; CONSCIOUSNESS; EEG; GRAPHVAR; FLASH	Background: The oscillations and interactions between different brain areas during recovery of consciousness (ROC) from anesthesia in humans are poorly understood. Reliable stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) signatures for transitions between unconsciousness and consciousness under anesthesia have not yet been fully identified.Objective: This study was designed to observe the change of electrophysiological activity during ROC and construct a ROC network based on SEEG data to describe the network property of cortical and deep areas during ROC from propofol-induced anesthetic epileptic patients.Methods: We analyzed SEEG data recorded from sixteen right-handed epileptic patients during ROC from propofol anesthesia from March 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019. Power spectrum density (PSD), correlation, and coherence were used to describe different brain areas' electrophysiological activity. The clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, modularity, network efficiency, degrees, and betweenness centrality were used to describe the network changes during ROC from propofol anesthesia. Statistical analysis was performed using MATLAB 2016b. The power spectral data from different contacts were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with Tukey's post-hoc correction. One sample t-test was used for the analysis of network property. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to judge data distribution. Non-normal distribution was analyzed using the signed rank-sum test.Result: From the data of these 16 patients, 10 cortical, and 22 deep positions were observed. In this network, we observed that bilateral occipital areas are essential parts that have strong links with many regions. The recovery process is different in the bilateral cerebral cortex. Stage B (propofol 3.0-2.5 mu g/ml) and E (propofol 1.5 mu g/ml-ROC) play important roles during ROC exhibiting significant changes. The clustering coefficient gradually decreases with the recovery from anesthesia, and the changes mainly come from the cortical region. The characteristic path length and network efficiency do not change significantly during the recovery from anesthesia, and the changes of network modularity and clustering coefficient are similar. Deep areas tend to form functional modules. The left occipital lobe, the left temporal lobe, bilateral amygdala are essential nodes in the network. Some specific cortical regions (i.e., left angular gyrus, right angular gyrus, right temporal lobe, left temporal lobe, and right angular gyrus) and deep regions (i.e., right amygdala, left cingulate gyrus, right insular lobe, right amygdala) have more significant constraints on other regions.Conclusion: We verified that the bilateral cortex's recovery process is the opposite, which is not found in the deep regions. Significant PSD changes were observed in many areas at the beginning of stop infusion and near recovery. Our study found that during the ROC process, the modularity and clustering coefficient of the deep area network is significantly improved. However, the changes of the bilateral cerebral cortex were different. Power spectrum analysis shows that low-frequency EEG in anesthesia recovery accounts for a large proportion. The changes of the bilateral brain in the process of anesthesia recovery are different. The clustering coefficient gradually decreased with the recovery from anesthesia, and the changes mainly came from the cortical region. The characteristic path length and network efficiency do not change significantly during the recovery from anesthesia, and the changes of network modularity and clustering coefficient were similar. During ROC, the left occipital lobe, the left temporal lobe, bilateral amygdala were essential nodes in the network. The findings of the current study suggest SEEG as an effective tool for providing direct evidence of the anesthesia recovery mechanism.

J	Metzner, C; Steuber, V				Metzner, Christoph; Steuber, Volker			The beta component of gamma-band auditory steady-state responses in patients with schizophrenia	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; GENE-EXPRESSION; PARVALBUMIN INTERNEURONS; INHIBITORY NEURONS; NMDA RECEPTORS; GABA NEURONS; STIMULATION; OSCILLATIONS; FREQUENCY; HYPOFUNCTION	The mechanisms underlying circuit dysfunctions in schizophrenia (SCZ) remain poorly understood. Auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs), especially in the gamma and beta band, have been suggested as a potential biomarker for SCZ. While the reduction of 40 Hz power for 40 Hz drive has been well established and replicated in SCZ patients, studies are inconclusive when it comes to an increase in 20 Hz power during 40 Hz drive. There might be several factors explaining the inconsistencies, including differences in the sensitivity of the recording modality (EEG vs MEG), differences in stimuli (click-trains vs amplitude-modulated tones) and large differences in the amplitude of the stimuli. Here, we used a computational model of ASSR deficits in SCZ and explored the effect of three SCZ-associated microcircuit alterations: reduced GABA activity, increased GABA decay times and NMDA receptor hypofunction. We investigated the effect of input strength on gamma (40 Hz) and beta (20 Hz) band power during gamma ASSR stimulation and saw that the pronounced increase in beta power during gamma stimulation seen experimentally could only be reproduced in the model when GABA decay times were increased and only for a specific range of input strengths. More specifically, when the input was in this specific range, the rhythmic drive at 40 Hz produced a strong 40 Hz rhythm in the control network; however, in the 'SCZ-like' network, the prolonged inhibition led to a so-called 'beat-skipping', where the network would only strongly respond to every other input. This mechanism was responsible for the emergence of the pronounced 20 Hz beta peak in the power spectrum. The other two microcircuit alterations were not able to produce a substantial 20 Hz component but they further narrowed the input strength range for which the network produced a beta component when combined with increased GABAergic decay times. Our finding that the beta component only existed for a specific range of input strengths might explain the seemingly inconsistent reporting in experimental studies and suggests that future ASSR studies should systematically explore different amplitudes of their stimuli. Furthermore, we provide a mechanistic link between a microcircuit alteration and an electrophysiological marker in schizophrenia and argue that more complex ASSR stimuli are needed to disentangle the nonlinear interactions of microcircuit alterations. The computational modelling approach put forward here is ideally suited to facilitate the development of such stimuli in a theory-based fashion.

Concerning neurophysiological correlates of emotional processing, the gamma band activity appears a useful tool adopted for emotion classification and related to the conscious elaboration of emotions. Starting from these considerations, the following items have been investigated: (i) whether emotional auditory stimuli processing differs between normal-hearing (NH) children and children using a cochlear implant (CI), given the non-physiological development of the auditory system in the latter group; (ii) whether the age at CI surgery influences emotion recognition capabilities; and (iii) in light of the right hemisphere hypothesis for emotional processing, whether the CI side influences the processing of emotional cues in unilateral CI (UCI) children. To answer these matters, 9 UCI (9.47 +/- 2.33 years old) and 10 NH (10.95 +/- 2.11 years old) children were asked to recognize nonverbal vocalizations belonging to three emotional states: positive (achievement, amusement, contentment, relief), negative (anger, disgust, fear, sadness), and neutral (neutral, surprise). Results showed better performances in NH than UCI children in emotional states recognition. The UCI group showed increased gamma activity lateralization index (LI) (relative higher right hemisphere activity) in comparison to the NH group in response to emotional auditory cues. Moreover, LI gamma values were negatively correlated with the percentage of correct responses in emotion recognition. Such observations could be explained by a deficit in UCI children in engaging the left hemisphere for more demanding emotional task, or alternatively by a higher conscious elaboration in UCI than NH children. Additionally, for the UCI group, there was no difference between the CI side and the contralateral side in gamma activity, but a higher gamma activity in the right in comparison to the left hemisphere was found. Therefore, the CI side did not appear to influence the physiologic hemispheric lateralization of emotional processing. Finally, a negative correlation was shown between the age at the CI surgery and the percentage of correct responses in emotion recognition and then suggesting the occurrence of a sensitive period for CI surgery for best emotion recognition skills development.

Authors also report that increased 1/f noise and aperiodic activity are not directly related to tics suggesting that these findings represent a novel facet of Tourette syndrome. Tourette syndrome is a common neurodevelopmental disorder defined by multiple motor and phonic tics. Tics in Tourette syndrome resemble spontaneously occurring movements in healthy controls and are therefore sometimes difficult to distinguish from these. Tics may in fact be mis-interpreted as a meaningful action, i.e. a signal with social content, whereas they lack such information and could be conceived a surplus of action or 'motor noise'. These and other considerations have led to a 'neural noise account' of Tourette syndrome suggesting that the processing of neural noise and adaptation of the signal-to-noise ratio during information processing is relevant for the understanding of Tourette syndrome. So far, there is no direct evidence for this. Here, we tested the 'neural noise account' examining 1/f noise, also called scale-free neural activity as well as aperiodic activity, in n = 74 children, adolescents and adults with Tourette syndrome and n = 74 healthy controls during task performance using EEG data recorded during a sensorimotor integration task. In keeping with results of a previous study in adults with Tourette syndrome, behavioural data confirmed that sensorimotor integration was also stronger in this larger Tourette syndrome cohort underscoring the relevance of perceptual-action processes in this disorder. More importantly, we show that 1/f noise and aperiodic activity during sensorimotor processing is increased in patients with Tourette syndrome supporting the 'neural noise account'. This implies that asynchronous/aperiodic neural activity during sensorimotor integration is stronger in patients with Tourette syndrome compared to healthy controls, which is probably related to abnormalities of GABAergic and dopaminergic transmission in these patients. Differences in 1/f noise and aperiodic activity between patients with Tourette syndrome and healthy controls were driven by high-frequency oscillations and not lower-frequency activity currently discussed to be important in the pathophysiology of tics. This and the fact that Bayesian statistics showed that there is evidence for the absence of a correlation between neural noise and clinical measures of tics, suggest that increased 1/f noise and aperiodic activity are not directly related to tics but rather represents a novel facet of Tourette syndrome.

Behavioural and neurophysiological responses to written naming treatment and high definition tDCS: a case study in advanced primary progressive aphasia	APHASIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						Primary progressive aphasia; nonfluent variant; written picture naming therapy; transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS); magnetoencephalography (MEG); resting-state	DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; WORKING-MEMORY; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; SUPRAMARGINAL GYRUS; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; BASAL FOREBRAIN; EEG-ALPHA; RETRIEVAL; WORDS; VARIANTS	Background: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is associated with progressive loss of language functions in the context of irreversible neurodegeneration, for which there is no cure. Speech-language therapy can help preserve language abilities, and most promisingly, interventions like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been shown to augment the effectiveness of therapy. However, the underlying mechanism for this enhancement is unknown. Objectives: We evaluated the behavioural and physiological (using resting-state magnetoencephalography [rsMEG]) effects of contemporary naming treatment provided with tDCS in a patient with an advanced case of nonfluent variant PPA (P01; 67 year old male). P01 was mute but had preserved written abilities, which we aimed to enhance with written naming therapy and excitatory or anodal-tDCS. We hypothesized greater improvement in written performance, particularly immediate gains, maintenance, and generalization, after anodal- than sham-tDCS. Additionally, reductions in oscillatory abnormal activity, as indicated by rsMEG, were expected after repeated sessions of anodal-tDCS with the naming treatment. Methods: A written picture naming therapy was paired with five sessions of anodal and five sessions of sham high-definition tDCS over two weeks. Anatomical and neurophysiological abnormalities were mapped with structural-MRI and rsMEG, respectively. TDCS was targeted towards an anatomically intact left supramarginal gyrus. The therapy-induced changes in written performance were evaluated on both trained and untrained pictures using Levenshtein Distances (LD). The neurophysiological changes were evaluated by comparing spectral relative power estimates in frequency bands ranging from delta to low-gamma (1-50 Hz), before and after therapy. All evaluations were completed immediately after therapy with sham- and anodal-tDCS, and at a 3-month follow-up. Results: Compared to sham-tDCS, anodal-tDCS augmented the immediate therapy-induced gains on trained items, as indicated by reductions in LD scores, reflecting improvement in written performance, particularly for more difficult target words. Neural activity at the stimulation spot and in surrounding and remote regions exhibited reduced oscillatory slowing, both immediately after one session (short-term) and after completion of five sessions (long-term) of anodal-tDCS compared to sham-tDCS. This is manifested as decreased theta (1-4 Hz) and increased beta and low-gamma (15-50 Hz) power. No additional gains with anodal-tDCS were found on untrained items (generalization) or at 3-month follow-up (maintenance). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that five sessions of anodal-tDCS can improve written performance by partially reversing abnormal neural activity and thus boosting the functional capacity of the structurally intact cortex. Longer duration of treatment may be needed for additional gains in maintenance and generalization with anodal-tDCS.

J	Liu, DY; Zhang, Y; Liu, Y; Bai, L; Zhang, PR; Gao, F				Liu Dongyuan; Zhang Yao; Liu Yang; Bai Lu; Zhang Pengrui; Gao Feng			LSTM-Based Recurrent Neural Network for Noise Suppression in fNIRS Neuroimaging: Network Design and Pilot Validation	CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG			Chinese	Article						medical optics; functional near-infrared spectroscopy; long-short-term-memory; recurrent neural network; brain-computer interface	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; INSTRUMENTATION	Objective Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has several advantages, such as noninvasiveness, free radiation, and reasonable temporal spatial resolution. This enables fNIRS-based technologies to be used as an alternative to conventional technologies, such as functional magnetic response imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG), and the technologies are increasingly used in clinical practice to complete neuroimaging. However, because of the reflection geometry used in fNIRS, light travels from a source, through the scalp-skull layer, into the brain, and back out through the scalp-skull layer to be measured by a detector, which decays significantly as depth increases. Therefore, the reconstructed activation using fNIRS is usually contaminated by superficial physiological signals (cardiac pulsation, respiration, and low-frequency oscillations, etc.). Besides, the random interferences induced by the photon-shot and instrumental noises, etc., also have blurring effects on the activation reconstruction because of faint activated hemodynamics in the brain. Thus, suppressing the irritating physiological interferences and random noises has been a critical task in fNIRS-based neuroimaging. In this work, we propose a long-short-term -memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural network (RNN), including a prediction and a classification layer, to suppress physiological interferences and random noises, respectively, to improve reconstruction performance with less repetitive or even individual stimulation. This has some advantages, including shorter measurement time, more subjects, and the ability to examine responses to single stimulation. Methods The proposed LSTM-based RNN, which is purely data-driven without an auxiliary measurement process, comprises two layers: First, the prediction layer is used to estimate the absorption perturbation induced by the physiological interferences during task stimulation. Then, the estimated time series is used as the reference to adaptively filter the reconstructed absorption perturbation for the removal of the interferences from the physiological signals. Second, the classification layer is applied to reduce the remaining artifacts induced by the random noises in measurements for acquiring a better space-localized solution, converting the filtering procedure to a binary classification problem. Notably, the combination of the space-time filtered results from the predication layer is used as the input to the classification layer, ensuring the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method. Results and Discussions The numerical simulations and in-vivo experiments are implemented based on fNIRS-DOT (diffuse optical tomography) to describe the network design, training, and filtering process in detail, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is compared with the reference filtering and cycle averaging method (RFCA). The results show that the proposed LSTM-based model improves reconstruction performance for the numerical simulations (Fig. 6) by effectively suppressing the physiological interferences and random noises rather than using more measurement cycles. Furthermore, we examine the effectiveness of the proposed method to deal with the potential time lags of superficial interferences compared with those in the cerebral cortex layers, and the results show that the proposed method performs better under the mentioned condition (Fig. 10). As for the in-vivo experiments, the results from the predication layer show comparable performance as the RFCA, whereas the results from the classification layer show a more concentrated activated region (Fig. 9). Because other modality imaging techniques have not been used to cross verify the activated region, determining whether the proposed model is over-optimized for the activated region is difficult. Thus, training the filtering model to avoid this problem will be an important direction for future work. Conclusions In this paper, we propose a two-layer LSTM-based RNN that utilizes the prediction and classification of the RNN model to reduce the image artifacts induced by the physiological interferences and random noises in fNIRS-based neuroimaging. The proposed method has a clear physical explanation and needs no additional hardware cost. To evaluate the proposed method, a series of preliminary numerical simulations and in-vivo experiments were implemented, and the results show that it has a promising future for achieving reasonable enhancements, providing a practical approach for the fNIRS-based brain-computer interface application.
