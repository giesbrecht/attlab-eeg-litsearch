Spatio-temporal bivariate features are very high-dimensional and cannot be analyzed with conventional statistical methods. Hence, we propose state-of-the-art machine learning methods that handle high-dimensional inputs. Methods: We computed bivariate features of EEG synchronization (cross-correlation, nonlinear interdependence, dynamical entrainment or wavelet synchrony) on the 21-patient Freiburg dataset. Features from all channel pairs and frequencies were aggregated over consecutive time points, to form patterns. Patient-specific machine learning-based classifiers (support vector machines, logistic regression or convolutional neural networks) were trained to discriminate interictal from preictal patterns of features. In this explorative study, we evaluated out-of-sample seizure prediction performance, and compared each combination of feature type and classifier. Results: Among the evaluated methods, convolutional networks combined with wavelet coherence successfully predicted all out-of-sample seizures, without false alarms, on 15 patients, yielding 71% sensitivity and 0 false positives. Conclusions: Our best machine learning technique applied to spatio-temporal patterns of EEG synchronization outperformed previous seizure prediction methods on the Freiburg dataset. Significance: By learning spatio-temporal dynamics of EEG synchronization, pattern recognition could capture patient-specific seizure precursors. Further investigation on additional datasets should include the seizure prediction horizon. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

I it the present-age pattern classification problems, the support vector machines (SVMs) have been extensively adopted as machine learning tools. SVM achieves higher generalization performance. its it utilizes an induction principle called structural risk minimization (SRM) principle. The SRM principle seeks to minimize the tipper bound of the generalization error consisting of the sum of the training error and a confidence interval. SVMs arc basically designed for binary classification problems and employs supervised learning to find the optimal separating hyperplane between the two classes of data. The main objective of this paper is to introduce a most promising pattern recognition technique called cross-correlation aided SVM based classifier. The idea of using cross-correlation for feature extraction is relatively new in the domain of pattern recognition. In this paper, the proposed technique has been utilized for binary classification of EEG signals. The binary classifiers employ suitable features extracted from crosscorrelograms of EEG signals. These cross-correlation aided SVM classifiers have been employed for some benchmark EEG signals and the proposed method could achieve classification accuracy as high as 95.96%, compared to a recently proposed method where the reported accuracy was 94.5%.

With the development of modern signal processing and statistics techniques, we have the ability to explore more information from EEG, much beyond classic trial-averaging approach. This paper discusses some characteristic methods for feature extraction and pattern classification on EEG data theoretically, and a combined spatial-temporal-frequency analysis strategy is proposed. After comparison of the linear function and support vector machine, reinforcement training is introduced to optimize a pre-designed linear classifier while at the same time restrain over-fitting of the classifier. Experiments performed on real EEG experimental data shows that it is effective in mining potential EEG patterns, and by which we achieved consistently results on all four submitted datasets of the BCI competition III.

In this paper, we proposed an automatic sleep stages classification system by analyzing rat's EEG signal. The rat's EEG signal is transferred by FFT and then extracted features. These extracted features are used as training patterns to further construct the proposed classification system. The proposed classification system contains two components, the principle component analysis (PCA) as the first component is used to projects the high dimensional features into lower dimensional subspace, and the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) method as the second component is applied to identify the physiological state for a period of EEG signal. By experimenting on 810 periods of EEG signal, the proposed classification system achieves satisfactory classification accuracy of sleep stages.

A significant way for identifying and analyzing epileptic seizure activity in human is by using electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. Manually reviewing and analyzing lengthy data of EEG recordings, for detection and classification of electro graphical patterns at present requires trained personnel and time consuming. Hence, there is a need for an efficient automated system based on pattern classification for analysis and classification of seizure-related EEG signals to assist the expert in the diagnosis. This paper presents the modeling of epileptic seizure prediction as binary classification problem and provides a suitable solution by implementing supervised classification algorithms, namely Decision table, Naive Baye's Tree, k-NN and support vector machine. The classification models are trained using the EEG data sets and the prediction accuracy of the classifier has been evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. It has been observed that the model produce about 86% of prediction accuracy in predicting the presence of epileptic seizure in human brain.	[Devi, Pavithra S.

We introduce a simple yet effective way to use Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence in the classification of raw EEG signals. We show that k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm with KL divergence as I he distance measure, when used using our feature vectors, gives competitive classification accuracy and consistently outperforms the more commonly used Euclidean k-NN. We also develop and demonstrate the use of a KL-based kernel to classify EEG data using support vector machines (SVMs). Our KL-distance based kernel compares favorably to other well established kernels such as linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernel. The EEG data, used in our experiments for classification, was recorded while the subject performed 5 different mental activities such as math problem solving, letter composing, 3-D block rotation, counting and resting (baseline). We present classification results for this data set that are obtained by using raw EEG data with no explicit artifact removal in the pre-processing steps.

Methods: Pre-treatment EEG data are collected in 23 + 14 schizophrenic adults. Treatment outcome, after at least one year follow-up, is determined using clinical ratings by a trained clinician blind to EEG results. First, a feature selection scheme is employed to select a reduced subset of features extracted from the subjects' EEG that is most statistically relevant to our treatment-response prediction. These features are then entered into a classifier, which is realized in the form of a kernel partial least squares regression method that performs response prediction. Various scales, including the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) are used as treatment-response indicators. Results: We determined that a set of discriminating EEG features do exist. A low-dimensional representation of the feature space showed significant clustering into clozapine responder and non-responder groups. The minimum level of performance of the proposed prediction methodology, tested over a range of conditions using the leave-one-out cross-validation method using the original 23 subjects, with further testing in an independent sample of 14 subjects, was 85%. Conclusions: These findings indicate that analysis of pre-treatment EEG data can predict the clinical response to clozapine in treatment resistant schizophrenia. Significance: If replicated in a larger population, this novel approach to EEG analysis may assist the clinician in determining treatment-efficacy.

Feature extraction has focused on automatic learning of spatial filters, with little or no attention being paid to optimization of parameters for temporal filters that still require time-consuming, ad hoc manual tuning. In this paper, we present a new algorithm termed iterative spatio-spectral patterns learning (ISSPL) that employs statistical learning theory to perform automatic learning of spatio-spectral filters. In ISSPL, spectral filters and the classifier are simultaneously parameterized for optimization to achieve good generalization performance. A detailed derivation and theoretical analysis of ISSPL are given. Experimental results on two datasets show that the proposed algorithm can correctly identify the discriminative frequency bands, demonstrating the algorithm's superiority over contemporary approaches in classification performance.

Methods: The oscillations were assessed by means of adaptive classification of short-term spectral patterns. Results: Lorazepam (a) decreased the percentage of EEG/MEG segments with fast-theta, delta-alpha, fast-theta-alpha and alpha activity and increased percentage of EEG/MEG segments with delta, delta-slow-theta, delta-beta, slow-theta and polyrhythmic activity; (b) decreased diversity of EEG/MEG signals (in terms of spectral patterns) and increased the general instability of the signal; (c) increased stabilization periods of the spectral patterns (reduced brain information processing); (d) maintained larger maximum periods of temporal stabilization for delta, slow-theta, delta-slow-theta, delta-beta and polyrhythmic activity (in terms of spectral patterns); (e) did not increase power in the independent beta rhythm. Conclusions: Lorazepam caused significant reorganization of the EEG/MEG microstructure. These results suggest also that adaptive classification analysis of single short-term spectral patterns may provide additional information to conventional spectral analyses.

The identification of potentially epileptiform alterations is important in the classification of the epilepsy and in determining the presence of an epileptic syndrome. The electroclinical correlation observed during long-term EEG monitoring may be used for diagnostic classification and surgical localization. Confirmation of a seizure disorder may be a priority before initiating antiepileptic drug therapy in selected patients. Finally, recognition of the ictal EEG pattern is necessary in evaluating for surgical treatment.

The authors demonstrate that both contra-and ipsilateral finger movements can be discriminated from ECoG signals recorded from a single brain hemisphere. The ECoG activation patterns over sensorimotor areas for contra-and ipsilateral movements were found to overlap to a large degree in the recorded hemisphere. Ipsilateral movements, however, produced less pronounced activity compared with contralateral movements. The authors also found that single-trial classification of movements could be improved by selecting patient-specific frequency components in high-frequency bands (>50 Hz). Their discovery that ipsilateral hand movements can be discriminated from ECoG signals from a single hemisphere has important implications for neurorehabilitation, suggesting in particular the possibility of regaining ipsilateral movement control using signals from an intact hemisphere after damage to the other hemisphere.

The method using support vectors machine (SVM) based on the structure risk minimization provides us an effective way of learning machine. But solving the quadratic programming problem for training SVM becomes a bottle-neck of using SVM because of the long time of SVM training. In this paper, a local-SVM method is proposed for modeling EEG signals. The local method is presented for improving the speed of the prediction of EEG signals. Furthermore, this proposed model is used to detect epilepsy from EEG signals in which dynamical characteristics are difference between normal and epilepsy EEG signals. The experimental results show that the training of the local-SVM obtains a good behavior. In addition, the local SVM method significantly improves the prediction and detection precision.

In the process of experiment, the subjects listen to multi-section songs. Every two songs have the same rhythm and only the lyrics are different, one in Chinese and the other in Japanese. The songs are sung by one singer and the Chinese subject don't know Japanese at all. At the same time we collect the EEG signals which are supposed to have very subtle difference corresponding to two kinds of songs. Then we use common spatial pattern algorithm to extract features and define an average energy function to represent them. After that we use support vector machine to learn and classify the EEG data. We find that the difference pattern mainly lay in low spectral band (0-0.5Hz), and concentrate on the left frontal area of the cortical.

The FBCSP algorithm is an autonomous and effective machine learning approach for classifying two classes of EEG measurements in motor imagery-based Brain Computer Interface (BCI). However, the problem of facial expression recognition typically involves more than just two classes of measurements. Hence, this paper proposes an extension of FBCSP to the multiclass paradigm using a decision threshold-based classifier for classifying facial expressions from EEG and EMG measurements. A study is conducted using the proposed Multiclass FBCSP on 4 subjects who performed 6 different facial expressions. The results show that the Multiclass FBCSP is effective in classifying multiple facial expressions from the EEG and EMG measurements.

Recently, the rhythmic component extraction (RCE) method has been proposed to extract features of multi-channel EEG. RCE can extract a signal component with a certain frequency from multi-sensor signals. In this paper, we applied RCE to extract a feature corresponding to hand movement imagery tasks from signals measured by EEG. This feature from a single trial EEG signal is classified between imaginary left/right hand movement EEG using machine learning. On two subjects, our experiment shows that the combination of RCE and fisher discriminant analysis outperforms common spatial patterns (CSP) in classification accuracy. It is also reported that other major classifiers together with RCE give better performance than CSP. Additionally, we consider the relationship between data length and classification accuracy. It is shown that the accuracy tends to decrease as the data length becomes small.

Due to the known asymmetries during motor imagery of righ- and left-hand movement, an HMM-based classifier allowing asymmetrical structures is introduced. The comparison between such a system and a symmetrical one is based on the error rate of classification. The results for EEG data collected during 20 sessions from five subjects demonstrate a significant improvement of 9% for the classification accuracy for the asymmetric classifiers. The selection of the HMM for classification is done using a variant of the genetic algorithms (GAs), namely, the adaptive reservoir genetic algorithm (ARGA).

We sought to identify the pattern of brain activity for actions with and without decision-making, while subjects engaged in an instrumental reward based learning task Event related potentials (ERPs) were analyzed for reference trials (no choice required) and decision trials. To detect brain activity during decision making, classification was applied to classify reference and decision trials. Support vector machine (SVM) with a nonlinear kernel function was used as a classifier. Classification performance was analyzed across subjects and channels to identify brain regions underlying decision-making. For most subjects, we found that reference and decision trials could be classified with greater than 85% accuracy. ERPs from frontocentral areas of the scalp provided, in general, best classification rates. Thus ERPs and SVM classifiers can be used to non-invasively detect decision making in humans.

In this paper, we extend the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm with the aim to alleviate these adverse effects. In particular, we suggest an extension of CSP to the state space, which utilizes the method of time delay embedding. As we will show, this allows for individually tuned frequency filters at each electrode position and, thus, yields an improved and more robust machine learning procedure. The advantages of the proposed method over the original CSP method are verified in terms of an improved information transfer rate (bits per trial) on a set of EEG-recordings from experiments of imagined limb movements.

Methods: In an experimental study (9 subjects), the probability-classification analysis of single-trial spectral EEG changes was utilized. Results were compared with auditory ERD/ERS. Results: It was shown that (1) variability of EEG spectral patterns was considerable, (2) EEG activity was different at various task stages, (3) probability measures were different from the results of conventional frequency analysis, (4) probability of trials with alpha- and theta-patterns was characteristically different in various task stages, (5) the occurrence of alpha- and theta-trials were most probable, but not frequent enough to characterize all the trials. The results suggest that the ERD/ERS responses are influenced by EEG characteristics in the pre-stimulus interval, which also have a strong influence on the EEG in the post-stimulus interval. Conclusions: Alpha- and theta-ERD/ERS responses during memory task performance are not typical for all trials. They reflect EEG changes only in similar to39% for alpha-activity and similar to43% for theta-oscillations of all trials, what reflects piecewise stationary EEG structure.

Valuable candidates for a multimodal approach are functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG). fNIRS is ail imaging technology that localizes hemodynamic changes within the cortex. However, hemodynamic activation is an intrinsically slow process. On the other hand, EEG has excellent time resolution by directly measuring the manifestation of the brain electrical activity at the scalp. Based oil their complementary strengths, the integration of fNIRS and EEC, may provide higher spatiotemporal resolution than either method alone. In this effort, we integrate fNIRS and EEG to evaluate the behavioral performance of six healthy adults in a working memory task. To this end, features extracted from fNIRS and EEG were used separately, as well as in combination, and their performances were compared against each other.

In order to pursue its application in the control of the multi -fingered robot hand or the prosthetic hand, the pattern recognition technology of the human hand activities based on EEG should be investigated as a very important and elementary research objective at first. After discussing our research strategy about EEG applied in the control of the robot hand, the recognition model named as Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN) is set up in this paper, and then its related algorithms, such as the fundamental knowledge produced, the learning samples set, the features extracted, and the patterns recognized with the artificial neural network (ANN), are deeply discussed for achieving the classification of some basic mental tasks. In addition, the experimental research has also been done using a two-channel system of measuring EEG signal, and the result shows the new recognition model using FNN can extract not only the effective spectral features of the hand movements and the other usual accompanying mental tasks, such as blinking eyes, watching red color and listening music, so as to achieve the fundamental knowledge production and the feature extraction, but also has the good capability of the pattern recognition about the human hand activities through the fuzzy setting of the learning samples and the training of its ANN.

The hypothesis is that an optimal wavelet can be approximated by deriving it from underlying components of the EEG. The SNAP was compared to standard wavelets by measuring Support Vector Machine-based EEG classification accuracy when using different wavelets/filters for EEG analysis. When classifying P300 evoked potentials, the error, as a function of the wavelet/filter used, ranged from 6.92% to 11.99%, almost twofold. Classification using the SNAP was more accurate than that with any of the six standard wavelets tested. Similarly, when differentiating between preparation for left- or right-hand movements, classification using the SNAP was more accurate (10.03% error) than for four out of five of the standard wavelets (9.54% to 12.00% error) and internationally competitive (7% error) on the 2001 NIPS competition test set. Phenomena shown only in maps of discriminatory EEG activity may explain why the SNAP appears to have promise for improving EEG wavelet analysis. It represents the initial exploration of a potential family of EEG-specific wavelets.

However, those systems involve tasks that indirectly map to simple binary commands such as "yes" or "no" or require many weeks of biofeedback training. We hypothesized that signal processing and machine learning methods can be used to discriminate EEG in a direct "yes"/"no" BCI from a single session. Blind source separation (BSS) and spectral transformations of the EEG produced a 180-dimensional feature space. We used a modified genetic algorithm (GA) wrapped around a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to search the space of feature subsets. The GA-based search found feature subsets that outperform full feature sets and random feature subsets. Also, BSS transformations of the EEG outperformed the original time series, particularly in conjunction with a subset search of both spaces. The results suggest that BSS and feature selection can be used to improve the performance of even a "direct," single-session BCl.

Design: Cross-sectional study comparing quantitative EEG data from patients with DAT with normative data from an elderly control group and from EEG norms derived from a large population. Participants: 35 subjects diagnosed with probable DAT and 30 elderly controls. Outcome measure: EEG recorded from 21 scalp sites of each patient and elderly control during vigilance-controlled. eyes-closed, resting conditions was spectrally analyzed to yield measures of absolute and relative power in delta, theta, alpha and beta bands and indices of mean alpha band and total band frequency. Results: Group comparisons of raw or age-regressed z-score population normative values yielded different profiles with respect to direction of frequency band changes, regional topography and clinical rating correlations, but both procedures evidenced overall patterns of EEG slowing in DAT. However, both methodologies yielded only modest (75%) classification rates. Conclusion: Quantitative EEG remains a valuable research tool but, as yet, an unproven diagnostic tool, for DAT.

In the researches of Brain Computer Interface (BC!), the pattern recognition of EEG which is associated with mental tasks is the most important part of the BCI system. In this paper, data of alpha wave and beta wave of C3, C4, P3 and P4 channels are certificated to be the proper sources for feature extraction, and the power spectral densities and the modules means of the data are selected to be the main components of the eigenvector. Then, an improved neural network model is established to complete the classification using eigenvectors above. In addition, some experiments have also been done using a four-channel EEG measurement system. The result shows that the recognition model proposed in this paper has a good characteristic of classification for mental tasks based on imagination and hand movement. And the method selected in this paper is valuable and effective.

On the other hand, in the motor imagery based BCI system, EEG signals are usually contaminated by the misleading trials caused by improper imagination of a movement. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to detect the abnormal EEG data using genetic algorithm (GA). After trial pruning, a subset of the EEG data are selected, on which common spatial pattern (CSP) and Gaussian classifier are trained. The performance of the proposed method is tested on Data set IIa of BCI Competition IV, and the simulation result demonstrates a significant improvement for six out of nine subjects.

Methods: The EEGs are decomposed into a series of frequency bands, and the instantaneous power is represented by the envelop of oscillatory activity, which forms the spatial patterns for a given electrode montage at a time-frequency gild. Time-frequency weights determined by training process are used to synthesize the contributions from the time-frequency domains. Results: The present method was tested in nine human subjects performing left or right hand movement imagery tasks. The overall classification accuracies for nine human subjects were about 80% in the 10-fold cross-validation, without rejecting any trials from the dataset. The loci of MI activity were shown in the spatial topography of differential-mode patterns over the sensorimotor area. Conclusions: The present method does not contain a priori subject-dependent parameters, and is computationally efficient. The testing results are promising considering the fact that no trials are excluded due to noise or artifact. Significance: The present method promises to provide a useful alternative as a general purpose classification procedure for MI classification.

The main contribution of the BBCI, which is a non-invasive EEG-based BCI system, is the use of advanced machine learning techniques that allow to adapt to the specific brain signatures of each user with literally no training. In BBCI a calibration session of about 20min is necessary to provide a data basis from which the individualized brain signatures are inferred. This is very much in contrast to conventional BCI approaches that rely on operand conditioning and need extensive subject training of the order 50-100 hours. Our machine learning concept thus allows to achieve high quality feedback already after the very first session. This work reviews a broad range of investigations and experiments that have been performed within the BBCI project. In addition to these general paradigmatic BCI results, this work provides a condensed outline of the underlying machine learning and signal processing techniques that make the BBCI succeed. In the first experimental paradigm we analyze the predictability of limb movement long before the actual movement takes place using only the movement intention measured from the pre-movement (readiness) EEG potentials. The experiments include both off-line studies and an online feedback paradigm. The limits with respect to the spatial resolution of the somatotopy are explored by contrasting brain patterns of movements of left vs. right hand rsp. foot. In a second complementary paradigm voluntary modulations of sensorimotor rhythms caused by motor imagery (left hand vs. right hand vs. foot) are translated into a continuous feedback signal. Here we report results of a recent feedback study with 6 healthy subjects with no or very little experience with BCI control: half of the subjects achieved an information transfer rate above 35 bits per minute (bpm). Furthermore one subject used the BBCI to operate a mental typewriter in free spelling mode. The overall spelling speed was 4.5-8 letters per minute including the time needed for the correction errors.

Impressive single-trial classification results have been reported in studies that used fMRI. Here, we investigate the possibility to identify conceptual representations from event-related EEG based on the presentation of an object in different modalities: its spoken name, its visual representation and its written name. We used Bayesian logistic regression with a multivariate Laplace prior for classification. Marked differences in classification performance were observed for the tested modalities. Highest accuracies (89% correctly classified trials) were attained when classifying object drawings. In auditory and orthographical modalities, results were lower though still significant for some subjects. The employed classification method allowed for a precise temporal localization of the features that contributed to the performance of the classifier for three modalities. These findings could help to further understand the mechanisms underlying conceptual representations. The study also provides a first step towards the use of concept decoding in the context of real-time brain-computer interface applications.

We explored the dependence of system performance on EEG control. Users moved the cursor to reach a target at one of four possible locations. EEG control was measured as the correlation (r(2)) between rhythm amplitude and target location. Performance was measured as accuracy (% of targets hit) and as information transfer rate (bits/trial). The relationship between EEG control and accuracy can be approximated by a linear function that is constant for all users. The results facilitate offline predictions of the effects on performance of using different EEG features or combinations of features to control cursor movement. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

The algorithm is designed to improve the classification accuracy of Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) based classifiers. The algorithm is based on a simple statistical criterion, and allows the user to incorporate any prior information one has about the spectrum of the signal. We show that with a different preprocessing, how a prior knowledge can drastically improve the classification or only be misleading. We also show a generalization of the CSP algorithm so that the CSP spatial projection can be recalculated after the optimization of the spectral filter. This leads to an iterative procedure of spectral and spatial filter update that further improves the classification accuracy, not only by imposing a spectral filter but also by choosing a better spatial projection.

Our aim was to assess the clinical usefulness of this algorithm and to compare the localization of the epileptiform electroencephalography discharges with the regions of altered cerebral blood flow in 10 patients with complex partial seizures undergoing preoperative investigation. We performed multiple signal classification analysis of ictal and interictal discharges, and registered single-photon emission computed tomography. Localization of the ictal, but not the interictal discharges, as determined by multiple signal classification analysis was consistent with the regions showing perfusion changes on the single-photon emission computed tomography. Multiple signal classification analysis is a promising tool in localizing foci in patients with complex partial seizures and may contribute to the preoperative evaluation.

While typical EEG artifacts are usually removed by trial rejection or by filtering, noise induced in the data by the Subject's failure to produce the required mental state is very harmful. Such "noise" effects are rather common. especially for naive Subjects in their training phase and, thus, standard artifact removal methods would inevitably fail. In this paper, we present a novel method which aims to detect such defected trials taking into account the intended task by use of Relevant Dimensionality Estimation (RDE). a new machine learning method for denoising in feature space In this manner. out method effectively "cleans" the training data and thus allows better BCI classification. Preliminary results conducted oil a data set of 43 naive subjects show a significant improvement for 74% of the subjects (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

In some cases, the dynamic characteristic would be the only basis for achieving a possible classification. A novel neural network, which is named "a recurrent log-linearized Gaussian mixture network (R-LLGMN)," is proposed in this paper for classification of time series. The structure of this network is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM), which has been well developed in the area of speech recognition. R-LLGMN can as well be interpreted as an extension of a probabilistic neural network using a log-linearized Gaussian mixture model, in which recurrent connections have been incorporated to make temporal information in use. Some simulation experiments are, carried out to compare R-LLGMN with the traditional estimator of HMM as classifiers, and finally, pattern classification experiments for EEG signals are conducted. It is indicated from these experiments that R-LLGMN can successfully classify not only artificial data but real biological data such as EEG signals.

Predicting variations of perceptual performance across individuals from neural activity using pattern classifiers	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neural correlates of human behavior; ERP analysis; Pattern classifiers	HUMAN FACE PERCEPTION; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; HUMAN BRAIN; DECISION-MAKING; OCCIPITOTEMPORAL CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; VISUAL-CORTEX; POTENTIALS; REPRESENTATION	Within the past decade computational approaches adopted from the field of machine learning have provided neuroscientists with powerful new tools for analyzing neural data. For instance, previous studies have applied pattern classification algorithms to electroencephalography data to predict the category of presented visual stimuli, human observer decision choices and task difficulty. Here, we quantitatively compare the ability of pattern classifiers and three ERP metrics (peak amplitude, mean amplitude, and onset latency of the face-selective N170) to predict variations across individuals' behavioral performance in a difficult perceptual task identifying images of faces and cars embedded in noise. We investigate three different pattern classifiers (Classwise Principal Component Analysis, CPCA: Linear Discriminant Analysis, LDA: and Support Vector Machine, SVM), five training methods differing in the selection of training data sets and three analyses procedures for the ERP measures. We show that all three pattern classifier algorithms surpass traditional ERP measurements in their ability to predict individual differences in performance. Although the differences across pattern classifiers were not large, the CPCA method with training data sets restricted to EEG activity for trials in which observers expressed high confidence about their decisions performed the highest at predicting perceptual performance of observers. We also show that the neural activity predicting the performance across individuals was distributed through time starting at 120 ms, and unlike the face-selective ERP response, sustained for more than 400 ms after stimulus presentation, indicating that both early and late components contain information correlated with observers' behavioral performance. Together, our results further demonstrate the potential of pattern classifiers compared to more traditional ERP techniques as an analysis tool for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics of the human brain and relating neural activity to behavior.

Background state detection in EEG is used to help estimate the brain growth progress in infants. Currently, background detection is mostly done manually, which is highly subjective. This paper proposes a way to automatically detect background states for preterm infants. The distribution of the amplitude vector in a 10-minute window of 2-channel preterm neonatal EEG signal is analysed, and the mean and standard deviations of the amplitudes in log-space are used as features in a linear discriminant analysis based classifier. The results are compared with existing methods of background detection. The algorithm performs well compared with the visual classification. It also shows less sensitivity to local variations the existing algorithm are suffering from.	[Wong, L.; Abdulla, W.

Decoding Three-Dimensional Hand Kinematics from Electroencephalographic Signals	2009 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	SEP 03-06, 2009	Minneapolis, MN	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; MOVEMENT TRAJECTORIES; CORTICAL CONTROL; HUMANS; PREDICTION; ENSEMBLES; DEVICES; MEG; EEG; ARM	The capacity to decode kinematics of intended movement from neural activity is necessary for the development of neuromotor prostheses such as smart artificial arms. Thus far, most of the progress in the development of neuromotor prostheses has been achieved by decoding kinematics of the hand from intracranial neural activity. The comparatively low signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution of neural data acquired non-invasively from the scalp via electroencephalography (EEG) have been presumed to prohibit the extraction of detailed information about hand kinematics. Here, we challenge this presumption by attempting to continuously decoding hand position, velocity, and acceleration from 55-channel EEG signals acquired during three-dimensional center-out reaching from five subjects. To preserve ecological validity, reaches were self-initiated, and targets were self-selected. After cross-validation, the overall mean correlation coefficients between measured and reconstructed position, velocity, and acceleration were 0.2, 0.3, and 0.3 respectively. These modest results support the continued development of non-invasive neuromotor prostheses for movement-impaired individuals.

Hidden Markov model (HMM) might be a useful tool in EEG pattern classification since EEG data is a multivariate time series data which contains noise and artifacts. In this paper we present methods for EEG pattern classification which jointly employ principal component analysis (PCA) and HMM. Along this line, two methods are introduced: (1) PCA+HMM; (2) PCA+HMM+SVM. Usefulness of principal component features and our hybrid method is confirmed through the classification of EEG that is recorded during the imagination of a left or right hand movement.				leehk@postech.ac.kr; seungjin@postech.ac.kr							9	47	49	0	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			0-7803-7946-2				2003							541	544						4	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology; Telecommunications	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology; Telecommunications	BY44C					2022-08-02	WOS:000189237900134

EEG signals are decomposed into frequency sub-bands using DWT, and then these sub-bands are passed to an ELM classifier. A comparative study on system performance is conducted between ELM and back-propagation neural networks (BPNN). Results show that the ELM classifier not only achieves better classification accuracy, but also needs much less learning time compared to the BPNN classifier. It is also found that the length of the EEG segment used. affects the prediction performance of classifiers.

In the context of Brain-Computer Interfaces, the Common Spatial Patterns method is widely used for classification of motor imagery events, however it is not very often used for classification of event related potentials such as P300. In this paper we show that Common Spatial Patterns is an effective approach to improve P300 classification rates. It is proposed a Bayesian methodology for feature combination that overcomes the limitations of the feature method used in motor imagery. Also, a method for channel selection based on inter-channel coherence is proposed, reducing the number of channels and improving the classification results.

Removal of BCG Artifacts Using a Non-Kirchhoffian Overcomplete Representation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography; magnetic resonance imaging; matrix decomposition; nonlinear estimation; pattern classification	EEG	We present a nonlinear unmixing approach for extracting the ballistocardiogram (BCG) from EEG recorded in an MR scanner during simultaneous acquisition of functional MRI (fMRI). First, an overcomplete basis is identified in the EEG based on a custom multipath EEG electrode cap. Next, the overcomplete basis is used to infer non-Kirchhoffian latent variables that are not consistent with a conservative electric field. Neural activity is strictly Kirchhoffian while the BCG artifact is not, and the representation can hence be used to remove the artifacts from the data in a way that does not attenuate the neural signals needed for optimal single-trial classification performance. We compare our method to more standard methods for BCG removal, namely independent component analysis and optimal basis sets, by looking at single-trial classification performance for an auditory oddball experiment. We show that our overcomplete representation method for removing BCG artifacts results in better single-trial classification performance compared to the conventional approaches, indicating that the derived neural activity in this representation retains the complex information in the trial-to-trial variability.

The very low signal-to-noise ratio and low spatial resolution still limits severely BCIs communication bandwidth. This paper presents the ongoing work toward the development of a BCI system for wheelchair steering. A full system based on a visual P300 oddball paradigm is proposed. The signal processing algorithms are computationally efficient and require a short phase training. Temporal features and EEG channels are selected through a Fisher criteria. For enhancement of signal-to-noise ratio and data dimensionality reduction, a spatial filter named Common Spatial Patterns is applied. This method is widely used for classification of motor imagery events, however it is not very often used for classification of event related potentials such as P300. In this paper we show that Common Spatial Patterns is an effective approach to improve P300 classification rates. In our approach, the input features for classification are the projections of the filtered data instead of the variance of the projections as typically used in motor imagery. Offline classification results, obtained with a Bayesian classifier, are presented showing the effectiveness of the overall methodology.

Reconstructing Three-Dimensional Hand Movements from Noninvasive Electroencephalographic Signals	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							BRAIN-MACHINE INTERFACES; COMPUTER INTERFACE; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; MOTOR CORTEX; HUMANS; REPRESENTATION; MEG; TRAJECTORIES; ENSEMBLES; EEG	It is generally thought that the signal-to-noise ratio, the bandwidth, and the information content of neural data acquired via noninvasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) are insufficient to extract detailed information about natural, multijoint movements of the upper limb. Here, we challenge this assumption by continuously decoding three-dimensional (3D) hand velocity from neural data acquired from the scalp with 55-channel EEG during a 3D center-out reaching task. To preserve ecological validity, five subjects self-initiated reaches and self-selected targets. Eye movements were controlled so they would not confound the interpretation of the results. With only 34 sensors, the correlation between measured and reconstructed velocity profiles compared reasonably well to that reported by studies that decoded hand kinematics from neural activity acquired intracranially. We subsequently examined the individual contributions of EEG sensors to decoding to find substantial involvement of scalp areas over the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the reaching hand. Using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA), we identified distributed current density sources related to hand velocity in the contralateral precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and inferior parietal lobule. Furthermore, we discovered that movement variability negatively correlated with decoding accuracy, a finding to consider during the development of brain-computer interface systems. Overall, the ability to continuously decode 3D hand velocity from EEG during natural, center-out reaching holds promise for the furtherance of noninvasive neuromotor prostheses for movement-impaired individuals.

The first step of this method is to investigate the impact of long term mental arithmetic task on psychology and physiology of subjects by subjective self-reporting measures, action performance test, power spectral indices of HRV and wavelet packet parameters of EEG. The second step is to calculate the wavelet packet features of all EEG data segments, including relative wavelet packet energy parameters in four frequency bands, wavelet packet entropy and three ratio indices. Finally, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and support vector machine (SVM) are jointly applied to differentiate two mental fatigue states. The investigation suggests that the joint KPCA-SVM method is able to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors, speed up the convergence in the training of SVM and achieve higher classification accuracy (88%) of the mental fatigue state. Hence KPCA-SVM could be a promising model for the estimation of mental fatigue.

Among the non-invasive techniques for probing human brain dynamics, electroencephalography (EEG) provides a direct measure of cortical activity with millisecond temporal resolution. Early attempts to analyse EEG data relied on visual inspection of EEG records. Since the introduction of EEG recordings, the volume of data generated from a study involving a single patient has increased exponentially. Therefore, automation based on pattern classification techniques have been applied with considerable success. In this study, a multi-step approach for the classification of EEG signal has been adopted. We have analysed sets of EEG time series recording from healthy volunteers with open eyes and intracranial EEG recordings from patients with epilepsy during ictal (seizure) periods. In the present work, we have employed a discrete wavelet transform to the EEG data in order to extract temporal information in the form of changes in the frequency domain over time - that is they are able to extract non-stationary signals embedded in the noisy background of the human brain. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Rough Sets have been used to reduce the data dimensionality. A multi-classifier scheme consists of LVQ2.1 neural networks have been developed for the classification task. The experimental results validated the proposed methodology.

Here, we review recent findings from our laboratory at the University of Maryland showing that noninvasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) can be used to continuously decode the kinematics of 2D 'center-out' drawing, unconstrained 3D 'center-out' reaching and 3D finger gesturing. These findings suggest that these 'far-field', extra-cranial neural signals contain rich information about the neural representation of movement at the macroscale, and thus these neural representations provide alternative methods for developing noninvasive brain-machine interfaces with wide-ranging clinical relevance and for understanding functional and pathological brain states at various stages of development and aging.

As reported earlier, our experiments demonstrate that very high information transfer rates can be achieved using the readiness potential (RP) when predicting the laterality of upcoming left-versus right-hand movements in healthy subjects. A more recent study showed that the RP similarily accompanies phantom movements in arm amputees, but the signal strength decreases with longer loss of the limb. In a complementary approach, oscillatory features are used to discriminate imagined movements (left hand versus right hand versus foot). In a recent feedback study with six healthy subjects with no or very little experience with BCI control, three subjects achieved an information transfer rate above 35 bits per minute (bpm), and further two subjects above 24 and 15 bpm, while one subject could not achieve any BCI control. These results are encouraging for an EEG-based BCI system in untrained subjects that is independent of peripheral nervous system activity and does not rely on evoked potentials even when compared to results with very well-trained subjects operating other BCI systems.

This paper focusses on the person identification problem based on features extracted from the ElectroEncepholoGram (EEG). A bilinear rather than a purely linear model is fitted on the EEG signal, prompted by the existence of non-linear components in the EEG signal - a conjecture already investigated in previous research works. The novelty of the present work lies in the comparison between the linear and the bilinear results, obtained from real field EEG data, aiming towards identification of healthy subjects rather than classification of pathological cases for diagnosis. Methods. The EEG signal of a, in principle, healthy individual is processed via (non)linear (AR, bilinear) methods and classified by an artificial neural network classifier. Results: Experiments performed on real field data show that utilization of the bilinear model parameters as features improves correct classification scores at the cost of increased complexity and computations. Results are seen to be statistically significant at the 99.5% level of significance, via the chi(2) test for contingency. Conclusions. The results obtained in the present study further corroborate existing research, which shows evidence that the EEG carries individual-specific information, and that it can be successfully exploited for purposes of person identification and authentication.

Two monkeys were trained to execute center-out movement in 8 directions. During the task the LFP activity was recorded with two 64 channel grids from the pre- and primary motor areas. The LFP signals were decomposed into 4 sub-band components in the 0-4 Hz, 4-10 Hz, 14-30 Hz and 48-200 Hz frequency ranges. The sub-band activity was post processed with regularized common spatial patterns algorithm and fed to linear discriminant analysis for final classification. Directions of movement were estimated using a redundant hierarchical classification strategy that tested groups of directions against diametrically opposite groups. The grouping of directions was based on the spatial correlation that we observed between LFP signals corresponding to neighboring movement directions which is similar to the cosine tuning profile of single neurons. We found that the decoding power for 8 directions was 80% and 92% for the two subjects, respectively, in 0-4Hz frequency band. Our best result of 92% nearly doubles the accuracy of the best results reported in the literature with similar set-ups. These results indicate that spatial patterns in LFP can be used to construct high accuracy brain computer interfaces.

Second, CSP has been initially proposed for two-class paradigms. Extensions to multiclass paradigms have been suggested, but are based on heuristics. We address these shortcomings in the framework of information theoretic feature extraction (ITFE). We show that for two-class paradigms, CSP maximizes an approximation of mutual information of extracted EEG/MEG components and class labels. This establishes a link between CSP and the minimal classification error. For multiclass paradigms, we point out that CSP by joint approximate diagonalization (JAD) is equivalent to independent component analysis (ICA), and provide a method to choose those independent components (ICs) that approximately maximize mutual information of ICs and class labels. This eliminates the need for heuristics in multiclass CSP, and allows incorporating prior class probabilities. The proposed method is applied to the dataset IIIa of the third BCI competition, and is shown to increase the mean classification accuracy by 23.4% in comparison to multiclass CSP.

Methods: EEG feedback training was performed in the patient's home (clinic), supervised from a distant laboratory with the help of a 'telemonitoring system'. Online feedback computation was based on single-trial analysis and classification of specific band power features of the spontaneous EEG. Task-related changes in brain oscillations over the course of training steps was investigated by quantifying time-frequency maps of event-related (de-)synchronization (ERD/ERS). Results: The patient learned to 'produce' two distinct EEG patterns, beta band ERD during movement imagery vs. no ERD during relaxing, and to use this for BCI-controlled spelling. Significant learning progress was found as a function of training session, resulting in an average accuracy level of 70% (correct responses) for letter selection. 'Copy spelling' was performed with a rate of approximately one letter per min. Conclusions: The proposed BCI training procedure, based on electroencephalogram (EEG) biofeedback and concomitant adaptation of feature extraction and classification, may improve actual levels of communication ability in locked-in patients. 'Telemonitoring-assisted' BCI training facilitates clinical application in a larger number of patients. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

One main goal of research is to help patients with severe neuromuscular disabilities by substituting normal motor outputs. Various cortical processes were identified which are suitable for implementing such a system on basis of scalp recorded electroencephalogram (EEG), e.g., slow cortical potentials (SCP) and event-related desynchronisation (ERD) of 10-20 Hz brain rhythms. Until quite recently BCI systems used only few EEG channels but by use of advanced machine learning techniques it became possible to exploit the spatial information provided by multi-channel EEG. While the use of such high density spatial sampling increases the accuracy of the system it may-depending on the computational effort of the signal processing-pose a problem for the implementation of the feedback in real-time. Here we propose a method that offers a substantial speed-up for classification of SCP features as used in the Berlin Brain computer interface (BBCI) [1]. Instead of applying the time consuming low-pass filtering to all, say 120, EEG channels a suitable spatial projection extracts only 2 or 4 new channels which can be used without any loss of classification accuracy in our experiments. Our approach is based on the technique of common spatial patterns (CSP) which were suggested in [2] to extract ERD features from EEG. While in its original form CSP is only applicable to oscillatory features we present a new variant which allows to use CSP for SCP features without regularisation even in case of large channel numbers or few training samples.

This is nowhere more apparent than in the volume of imagery and video that we can access on a daily basis-for the general public, availability of YouTube video and Google Images, or for the image analysis professional tasked with searching security video or satellite reconnaissance. Which images to look at and how to ensure we see the images that are of most interest to us, begs the question of whether there are smart ways to triage this volume of imagery. Over the past decade, computer vision research has focused on the issue of ranking and indexing imagery. However, computer vision is limited in its ability to identify interesting imagery, particularly as "interesting" might be defined by an individual. In this paper we describe our efforts in developing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) which synergistically integrate computer vision and human vision so as to construct a system for image triage. Our approach exploits machine learning for real-time decoding of brain signals which are recorded non-invasively via electroencephalography (EEG). The signals we decode are specific for events related to imagery attracting a user's attention. We describe two architectures we have developed for this type of cortically coupled computer vision and discuss potential applications and challenges for the future.

Classification of movement intention by spatially filtered electromagnetic inverse solutions	PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article							BCI COMPETITION 2003; BRAIN-COMPUTER COMMUNICATION; EEG SOURCE LOCALIZATION; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; RESOLUTION; MEG; INTERFACE; PATTERNS	We Couple standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography, an inverse solution for electroencephalography (EEG) and the common spatial pattern, which is here conceived as a data-driven beamformer, to classify the benchmark BCI (brain-computer interface) competition 2003, data set IV. The data set is from an experiment where a subject performed a self-paced left and right finger tapping task. Available for analysis are 314 training trials whereas 100 unlabelled test trials have to be classified. The EEG data from 28 electrodes comprise the recording of the 500 ms before the actual finger movements, hence represent uniquely the left and right finger movement intention. Despite our use of an untrained classifier, and our extraction of only one attribute per class, our method yields accuracy similar to the winners of the competition for this data set. The distinct advantages of the approach presented here are the use of an untrained classifier and the processing speed, which make the method suitable for actual BCI applications. The proposed method is favourable over existing classification methods based on an EEG inverse solution, which rely either on iterative algorithms for single-trial independent component analysis or on trained classifiers.

Beyond mind-reading: multi-voxel pattern analysis of fMRI data	TRENDS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCES			English	Review							ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; BRAIN ACTIVATION; FACES; REPRESENTATIONS; INFORMATION; RETRIEVAL; IMAGERY; OBJECTS; EEG; CLASSIFICATION	A key challenge for cognitive neuroscience is determining how mental representations map onto patterns of neural activity. Recently, researchers have started to address this question by applying sophisticated pattern-classification algorithms to distributed (multi-voxel) patterns of functional MRI data, with the goal of decoding the information that is represented in the subject's brain at a particular point in time. This multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) approach has led to several impressive feats of mind reading. More importantly, MVPA methods constitute a useful new tool for advancing our understanding of neural information processing. We review how researchers are using MVPA methods to characterize neural coding and information processing in domains ranging from visual perception to memory search.

To explore such dynamics, we used a robotic setup to produce well-controlled stimuli consisting of two different textures (gratings of spatial period combinations 520+1920 mu m and 400+1920 mu m) which were moved across a subject's finger pad during electro-encephalograpy (EEG) acquisition. After decomposing the EEG signals with independent component analysis (ICA), a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was applied to each of the nonartifactual components to identify those where the temporal patterns encoded texture differences. In five of six subjects one such significant component was identified. Inverse source modeling revealed that in four of these subjects the components were located to the contralateral somatosensory cortex, consistent with previous research on tactile processing. In addition, components located to the ipsilateral somatosensory cortices not containing differentiating activity were identified. Thus, using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms we demonstrated that it is possible to decode and localize subtle differences in temporal brain processing patterns related to textures perceived through the finger pad.

The model is constructed from a bulb model and a three-layered cortical model, mimicking the main features of the olfactory system. The olfactory bulb and cortex models are connected by feedforward and feedback fibers with distributed delays. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset consisting of data from 683 patients divided into benign and malignant classes is used to demonstrate the capacity of the model to learn and recognize patterns, even when these are deformed versions of the originally learned patterns. The performance of the novel model was compared with three artificial neural networks (ANNs), a back-propagation network, a support vector machine classifier, and a radial basis function classifier. All the ANNs and the olfactory bionic model were tested in a benchmark study of a standard dataset. Experimental results show that the bionic olfactory system model can learn and classify patterns based on a small training set and a few learning trials to reflect biological intelligence to some extent.

To this end, we recorded whole-head EEG with a delayed saccade-or-reach task and found direction-related modulation of event-related potentials (ERPs) in the PPC. Using parietal EEG components extracted by independent component analysis (ICA), we obtained in average accuracy of 80.25% on four subjects in binary single-trial EEG classification (left versus right).

We recorded myoclonic jerks in 55 patients (50.4%), and we classified them as periodic myoclonus in 28, rhythmic in 13, and irregular in 20 (6 patients showed two types of myoclonus). Myoclonus occurred as a prominently negative event (interrupting the EMG discharge) in 10. Periodic sharp-wave complexes (PSWCs) were present in all but one patient with myoclonic jerks but were time-locked with EMG-bursts only in case of periodic myoclonus. Jerk-locked back averaging revealed a variable EEG-EMG transfer-time commonly exceeding that characterizing cortical myoclonus. Myoclonus was frequently associated with Met/Met polymorphism at codon 129 of the prion protein gene, but it was also observed in association with Met/Val or Val/Val polymorphisms provided that the EEG showed the presence of the PSWC pattern. The presence of enlarged somatosensory evoked potentials significantly correlated with the myoclonic presentation, as did MR signal hyperintensity involving the cortical mantle. Our observations on the basis of standard polygraphic criteria suggest that CJD associates with a remarkable variety of myoclonic jerks, and therefore different brain structures are probably involved as generators. The significant association between the presence of all myoclonus types with PSWCs suggests that hyperexcitable corticosubcortical loops are always required to generate (or allow) both myoclonus and the EEG complexes, either they are time locked or not.

EEG signals were recorded at University of California, Irvine (UCI) from 7 volunteer subjects imagining two syllables, Ma/ and /ku/, without speaking or performing any overt actions. Our goal is to classify these imagined syllables and based on the resulting accuracy assess the feasibility of this task. In this research, the EEG data are preprocessed to reduce the effects of artifacts and noise, and autoregressive (AR) coefficients are extracted as features for imagined syllable classification using a k -Nearest Neighbor classifier. Initial results suggest that it is possible to identify imagined speech.	[Brigham, Katharine; Kumar, B. V. K.

BCI can help users send messages and commands to the external world without using their brain's normal output channels or muscles. The central element in each BCI system is to rind a reliable method to detect the specific feature patterns extracted from the raw brain signals, and then translate it into usable control signals. In this paper, we introduce our approach to detect N170 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) based on its spatiotemporal patterns in single-trial EEG signals. Common spatial pattern (CSP) method and machine-learning technique support vector machine (SVM) are adopted for N170 feature extraction and translation, i.e. they convert electrophysiological input from the user into on-off signal to control external devices. Our results indicate that the CSP can effectively extract discriminatory information, and SVM has an efficient performance for N170 classification. Comparing to several other methods, high performances of our framework show that the temporal and spatial features of N170 are very stable and it is promising for new type BCI applications.

The present study was aimed at identifying the source of this alpha activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) simultaneously on eight TM practitioners before, during, and after TM. The magnetic field potentials corresponding to TM-induced alpha activities on EEG recordings were extracted, and we attempted to localize the dipole sources using the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, equivalent current dipole source analysis, and the multiple spatio-temporal dipole model. Since the dipoles were mapped to both the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), it is suggested that the mPFC and ACC play an important role in brain activity induced by TM.

BCI research at the Wadsworth Center focuses primarily on noninvasive, electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI methods. We have shown that people, including those with severe motor disabilities, can learn to use sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) to move a cursor rapidly and accurately in one or two dimensions. We have also improved P300-based BCI operation. We are now translating this laboratory-proven BCI technology into a system that can be used by severely disabled people in their homes with minimal ongoing technical oversight. To accomplish this, we have: improved our general-purpose BCI software (BCI2000); improved online adaptation and feature translation for SMR-based BCI operation; improved the accuracy and bandwidth of P300-based BCI operation; reduced the complexity of system hardware and software and begun to evaluate home system use in appropriate users. These developments have resulted in prototype systems for every day use in people's homes.

Performance of ELM is compared in terms of training time and classification accuracy with a Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) classifier and also Support Vector Machines (SVMs). For SVMs, the comparisons have been made for both 1-against-1 and I-against-all methods. Results show that ELM needs an order of magnitude less training time compared with SVMs and two orders of magnitude less compared with BPNN. The classification accuracy of ELM is similar to that of SVMs and BPNN. The study showed that smoothing of the classifiers' outputs can significantly improve their classification accuracies.

Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) exploit the ability of human communication and control bypassing the classical neuromuscular communication channels. In general, BCIs offer a possibility of communication for people with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or spinal cord injury. Beyond medical applications, a BCI conjunction with exciting multimedia applications, e. g., a dexterity game, could define a new level of control possibilities also for healthy customers decoding information directly from the user's brain, as reflected in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals which are recorded non-invasively from user's scalp. This contribution introduces the Berlin Brain-Computer Interface (BBCI) and presents setups where the user is provided with intuitive control strategies in plausible gaming applications that use biofeedback. Yet at its beginning, BBCI thus adds a new dimension in multimedia research by offering the user an additional and independent communication channel based on brain activity only. First successful experiments already yielded inspiring proofs-of-concept. A diversity of multimedia application models, say computer games, and their specific intuitive control strategies, as well as various Virtual Reality (VR) scenarios are now open for BCI research aiming at a further speed up of user adaptation and increase of learning success and transfer bit rates.

A major concern was directed towards designing a generalized and multi-purpose framework that supports rapid prototyping of various experimental strategies and operating modes. Preliminary results of brain-state estimation using EEG signals recorded during a self-paced left/right hand movement task are also presented.

Although it has been subjected to intensive clinical research, few investigators have published the ictal scalp EEG findings and looked for specific features that might predict postoperative outcome. This study was designed to examine ictal scalp EEG characteristics in detail, in a group of patients with pathologically confirmed hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Patients who underwent long-term video-EEG monitoring at our center during a 3-year period and were diagnosed to have MTLE and pathologically proven HS were included in this retrospective study. All ictal scalp EEGs were investigated in a common reference montage, paying attention to the localization, morphology and frequency of ictal discharges that were accepted to represent a specific phase if the findings were sustained for at least 3 seconds. Any significant change in localization, morphology or frequency of discharges was said to represent a different phase. The ictal EEG patterns in different phases were later compared among seizures of different patients. In addition, the ictal EEG characteristics of the patients in Group I (Engel's classification) were compared with the ictal EEG findings in patients who were included in another group. All the patients have been followed for more than 5 years. Seventy-one ictal EEGs were investigated in 25 adult patients (11 M, 14 F). Onset patterns were lateralized in 81.7% and localized in 76% of the seizures. Thirteen different patterns of onset were detected, the most common of which was the cessation of interictal discharges (35.2%). The most common ictal pattern following the initial changes was ipsilateral temporal rhythmic theta-delta activity (85.2%) that occurred on the average 13.4 seconds after onset. Nonlocalized/ lateralized seizure onset of all the seizures or bilateral independent onset was present in 75% of the patients in Groups II-III, whereas this ratio was 14.3% in the patients in Group I (p=0.031). In conclusion, ictal scalp EEG in MTLE allows correct lateralization and localization in most of the seizures. Onset patterns may vary considerably; however, a later significant pattern consisting of rhythmic ipsilateral temporal build-up develops in the majority of seizures. Some ictal EEG characteristics may be related to post-operative outcome.

However, popular classification algorithms, e.g., common spatial patterns (CSP), usually highly depend on the prior neurophysiologic knowledge for noise removing, although this knowledge is not always known in practical applications. In this paper, a novel tensor-based scheme is proposed for single trial EEG classification, which performs well without the prior neurophysiologic knowledge. In this scheme, EEG signals are represented in the spatial-spectral-temporal domain by the wavelet transform, the multilinear discriminative subspace is reserved by the general tensor discriminant analysis (GTDA), redundant indiscriminative patterns are removed by Fisher score, and the classification is conducted by the support vector machine (SVM). Applications to three datasets confirm the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed tensor scheme in analyzing EEG signals, especially in the case of lacking prior neurophysiologic knowledge.

Specifically, the proposed method transforms the original EEG signal into a spatial pattern and applies the RBF feature selection method to generate robust feature.

We adopt a patient-specific approach to exploit the consistency of an individual patient's seizure and non-seizure electroencephalograms. Our method uses a wavelet decomposition to construct a feature vector that captures the morphology and spatial distribution of an electroencephalographic epoch, and then determines whether that vector is representative of a patient's seizure or nonseizure electroencephalogram using the support vector machine classification algorithm. Our completely automated method was tested on noninvasive electroencephalograms from 36 pediatric subjects suffering from a variety of seizure types. It detected 131 of 139 seizure events within 8.0 +/- 3.2 seconds of electrographic onset, and declared 15 false detections in 60 hours of clinical electroencephalography. Our patient-specific method can be used to initiate delay-sensitive clinical procedures following seizure onset, for example, the injection of a functional imaging radiotracer. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This paper classified the EEG of two kinds of motor imagery. The feature extraction method combines wavelet packet decomposition and common spatial pattern. The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) is applied as classification method. The raw multi-channel EEG data is pre-processed by wavelet packet decomposition, with CSP method to extract the feature, and the best classification accuracy can reach 95.3%. If the EEG data is not decomposed by wavelet packet, the classification accuracy is only 83.3%. The result shows that if wavelet packet function and level is selected properly, the classification accuracy can improve effectively.

Different from classical common spatial patterns (CSP) that uses only global spatial covariances to compute the optimal filter, LTCSP considers temporally local information in the variance modelling. The underlying manifold variances of EEG signals contain more discriminative information. LTCSP is an extension to CSP in the sense that CSP can be derived from LTCSP under a special case. By constructing an adjacency matrix, LTCSP is formulated as an eigenvalue problem. So, LTCSP is computationally as straightforward as CSP. However, LTCSP has better discrimination ability than CSP and is much more robust. Simulated experiment and real EEG classification demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LTCSP method.

Similar maximum decoding power (DP) was found for EEG (54%) and MEG (57%) similar to 450ms after movement onset, using EEG+MEG the DP remained at 57%. No significant (p > 0.05) difference for the maximum DP between the three signals was found. EEG and MEG provided significant (p < 0.05) DP similar to 0ms and similar to-100ms relative to movement onset. In conclusion, EEG and MEG yield approximately the same maximal DP in this paradigm with the MEG allowing for a slightly and significantly (p < 0.05) earlier decoding than the EEG.

A total of 79 participants with MCI were classified into 4 subgroups based on the beginning of memory complaints up to the time of first visit. All participants underwent electroencephalography recording, magnetic resonance imaging, apolipoprotein E characterization, and volumetric morphometry estimation of hippocampal region. Electroencephalography markers show 2 distinct patterns: (1) increase of theta/delta power ratio and highest value of alpha2 band power in the group with shorter duration of disease, the greater right-left hippocampal volume difference and worst memory performance; (2) the highest value of alpha3 band power and the highest alpha3/alpha2 power ratio in the group with the lesser total hippocampal volume but preserved memory performance. Apolipoprotein E4 is linked to a major risk of early beginning of disease. Electroencephalography markers allow a mean correct percentage of correct classification up to 89%.	[Moretti, D.

J	Ubeyli, ED				Ubeyli, Elif Derya			Measuring saliency of features representing EEG signals using signal-to-noise ratios	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature saliency; Signal-to-noise ratio; Eigenvector methods; EEG signals classification		Various methodologies of automated diagnosis have been adopted, however the entire process can generally be subdivided into a number of disjoint processing modules: pre-processing, feature extraction/selection, and classification. Features are used to represent patterns with minimal loss of important information. The feature vector, which is comprised of the set of all features used to describe a pattern, is a reduced-dimensional representation of that pattern. Medical diagnostic accuracies can be improved when the pattern is simplified through representation by important features. By identifying a set of salient features, the noise in a classification model can be reduced, resulting in more accurate classification. In this study, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) saliency measure was employed to determine saliency of input features of probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) used in classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In order to extract features representing the EEG signals, eigenvector methods were used. The PNNs used in the EEG signals classification were trained for the SNR screening method. The application results of the SNR screening method to the EEG signals demonstrated that classification accuracies of the PNNs with salient input features are higher than that of the PNNs with salient and non-salient input features.

This paper presents a novel approach to spatial filtering of EEG signal by modelling time-variant spatial patterns. This is in contrast to conventional Common Spatial Pattern which assumes static spatial patterns in a motor imagery trial. We define the model such that it accounts for relatively higher order dynamics in EEG. Furthermore, we formulate the training of the model as a dual optimization problem, and we derive an iterative optimization algorithm using quadratically constrained quadratic programming. Our experimental results on healthy subjects indicates that the proposed method is able to produce higher classification accuracy.

J	Li, Y; Guan, C				Li, Yuanqing; Guan, Cuntai			Joint feature re-extraction and classification using an iterative semi-supervised support vector machine algorithm	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						supporter vector machine (SVM); semi-supervised learning; Rayleigh coefficient; feature extraction; model selection		The focus of this paper is on joint feature re-extraction and classification in cases when the training data set is small. An iterative semi-supervised support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is proposed, where each iteration consists both feature re-extraction and classification, and the feature re-extraction is based on the classification results from the previous iteration. Feature extraction is first discussed in the framework of Rayleigh coefficient maximization. The effectiveness of common spatial pattern (CSP) feature, which is commonly used in Electroencephalogram (EEG) data analysis and EEG-based brain computer interfaces (BCIs), can be explained by Rayleigh coefficient maximization. Two other features are also defined using the Rayleigh coefficient. These features are effective for discriminating two classes with different means or different variances. If we extract features based on Rayleigh coefficient maximization, a large training data set with labels is required in general; otherwise, the extracted features are. not reliable. Thus we present an iterative semi-supervised SVM algorithm embedded with feature re-extraction. This iterative algorithm can be used to extract these three features reliably and perform classification simultaneously in cases where the training data set is small. Each iteration is composed of two main steps: (i) the training data set is updated/augmented using unlabeled test data with their predicted labels; features are re-extracted based on the augmented training data set. (ii) The re-extracted features are classified by a standard SVM. Regarding parameter setting and model selection of our algorithm, we also propose a semi-supervised learning-based method using the Rayleigh coefficient, in which both training data and test data are used. This method is suitable when cross-validation model selection may not work for small training data set. Finally, the results of data analysis are presented to demonstrate the validity of our approach.

The design of EEG interpretation and classifiers for BCI are open research questions whose difficulty stems from the need to extract complex spatial and temporal patterns from noisy multidimensional time series obtained from EEG measurements. In this paper we attempt to classify EEG data used in the BCI competition by the combination of pattern classification methods. We use Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) to extract features. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) was applied first to evolve an artificial neural network (ANN) to find the optimum structure of ANN. A Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was also attempted to determine the optimal number of hidden neurons complementary to the GA approach. Then the GA was used to evolve the connection weights of the ANN.	[Liyanage, S. R.; Lee, T. H.] Natl Univ Singapore, Grad Sch Integrat Sci & Engn, Singapore, Singapore; [Xu, J. -X.; Lee, T.

Although the proof-of-concept was given decades ago, the reliable translation of user intent into device control commands is still a major challenge. Success requires the effective interaction of two adaptive controllers: the user's brain, which produces brain activity that encodes intent, and the BCI system, which translates that activity into device control commands. In order to facilitate this interaction, many laboratories are exploring a variety of signal analysis techniques to improve the adaptation of the BCI system to the user. In the literature, many machine learning and pattern classification algorithms have been reported to give impressive results when applied to BCI data in offline analyses. However, it is more difficult to evaluate their relative value for actual online use. BCI data competitions have been organized to provide objective formal evaluations of alternative methods. Prompted by the great interest in the first two BCI Competitions, we organized the third BCI Competition to address several of the most difficult and important analysis problems in BCI research. The paper describes the data sets that were provided to the competitors and gives an overview of the results.

The aim of this study is to assess the potential of this parallel and nonlinear EEG analysis technique in distinguishing between subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with a high degree of accuracy in comparison with standard and advanced nonlinear techniques. The principal aim of the study was testing the hypothesis that automatic classification of MCI and AD subjects can be reasonably correct when the spatial content of the EEG voltage is property extracted by ANNs. Methods and material: Resting eyes-closed EEG data were recorded in 180 AD patients and in 115 MCI subjects. The spatial content of the EEG voltage was extracted by IFAST step-Wise procedure using ANNs. The data input for the classification operated by ANNs were not the EEG data, but the connections weights of a nonlinear auto-associative ANN trained to reproduce the recorded EEG tracks. These weights represented a good model of the peculiar spatial features of the EEG patterns at scalp surface. The classification based on these parameters was binary (MCI versus AD) and was performed by a supervised ANN. Half of the EEG database was used for the ANN training and the remaining half was utilised for the automatic classification phase (testing). Results: The best results distinguishing between AD and MCI reached to 92.33%. The comparative results obtained with the best method so far described in the literature, based on blind source separation and Wavelet pre-processing, were 80.43% (P < 0.001). Conclusion: The results confirmed the working hypothesis that a correct automatic classification of MCI and AD subjects can be obtained extracting spatial information content of the resting EEG voltage by ANNs and represent the basis for research aimed at integrating spatial and temporal information content of the EEG.

High-level representations such as time-frequency maps convey a wealth of useful information, but they involve a large number of parameters that make statistical investigations of many signals difficult at present. In this paper, we describe a method that performs drastic reduction in the complexity of time-frequency representations through a modelling of the maps by elementary functions. The method is validated on artificial signals and subsequently applied to electrophysiological brain signals (local field potential) recorded from the olfactory bulb of rats while they are trained to recognize odours. From hundreds of experimental recordings, reproducible time-frequency events are detected, and relevant features are extracted, which allow further information processing, such as automatic classification.

First, it introduces two pattern rejection strategies not used yet for self-paced BCI design: 1) the rejection class (RC) strategy and 2) thresholds on reliability functions (TRF) based on the automatic multiple-threshold learning algorithim. Second, it compares several rejection strategies using several classifiers, on motor imagery data, in order to identify their most desirable properties. Results showed that nonlinear classifiers led to the most efficient self-paced BCI Concerning the reject option, RC outperformed a specialized reject classifier which outperformed TRF Overall, the best results were obtained using the RC reject option and non-linear classifiers such as a Gaussian support vector machine, a fuzzy inference system or a radial basis function network.

It is not only physiologically rational but also empirically effective. This paper proposes extreme energy ratio (EER), a discriminative objective function to guide the process of spatially filtering EEG signals. The energy of the filtered EEG signals has the optimal discriminative capability under the EER, criterion, and hence EER can as well be regarded as a feature extractor for distilling energy. The paper derives the solutions which optimize the EER criterion, shows the theoretical equivalence of EER to the existing method of common spatial patterns (CSP), and gives the computational savings EER makes in comparison with CSP. Two paradigms extending EER from binary classification to multi-class classification are also provided.

J	Logar, V; Belic, A				Logar, Vito; Belic, Ales			A phase-demodulation method for decoding the brain information	ELEKTROTEHNISKI VESTNIK-ELECTROCHEMICAL REVIEW			Slovene	Article						Brain information; EEG; Phase coding; Phase demodulation; Prediction		The paper presents possible approaches to brain-wave analysis from the information-coding point of view and its possible use in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The field of BCIs has become increasingly popular in the last years for presenting one of the more interesting areas in neurophysiological research. The basic idea of such interfaces is to allow for certain actions by means of an interface using only the measurements of brain activity, for instance electroencephalography (EEG). In this paper we investigate some methods which are suitable for extracting and decoding important pieces of information from EEG signals and which could also be used in the above interfaces. The idea of decoding the brain information is based on the lately proposed theory of phase coding in the brain oscillatory activity. According to suggestions in the field of information coding, the authors decided to base their methodology on the phase demodulation principle. The phase demodulation method in combination with some other signal processing methods can decode some important parts of the information, transferred between the brain areas during a certain task. The proposed methodology was validated on three different cognitive tasks, i.e. working memory (WM) tasks, classic (VM) and dynamic visuo-motor tasks (dVM). The information to be decoded were answers in the YES/NO form in case of WM tasks and gripping force and wrist movements in case of VM and dVM tasks, respectively. The presented methodology can, with some modifications, also be used for the development of a brain-computer interface.

Signals were acquired from nine healthy subjects during four imaginary isometric plantar-flexions of the right foot involving two RTDs (ballistic and moderate) and two TTs (30 and 60% of the maximal voluntary contraction torque), each repeated 60 times in random order. The single-trial EEG traces were classified with a pattern recognition approach based on wavelet coefficients as features and support vector machine (SVM) as classifier. Average misclassification rates were (mean +/- A SD) 16 +/- A 9% and 26 +/- A 13% for discrimination of the two TTs under ballistic and moderate RTDs, respectively. RTDs could be discriminated with misclassification rates of 16 +/- A 11% and 19 +/- A 10% under high and low TT, respectively. These results indicate that differences in both TT and RTD can be detected from single-trial EEG traces during imaginary tasks.

We apply the same experimental and analytical methods to 11 nonparalysed subjects (eight EEG, three ECoG), and to five paralyzed subjects (four EEG, one ECoG) who had been unable to communicate for some time. While it was relatively easy to obtain classifiable signals quickly from most of the nonparalyzed subjects, it proved impossible to classify the signals obtained from the paralyzed patients by the same methods. This highlights the fact that though certain BCI paradigms may work well with healthy subjects, this does not necessarily indicate success with the target user group. We outline possible reasons for this failure to transfer.

Eleven patients with drug-resistant PCE were studied with high-resolution EEG (HR-EEG) and stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG). Sixty-four scalp channels, a realistic head model, and different algorithms [multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and equivalent current dipoles] were used. Results were compared to intracerebral SEEG recordings. For SEEG, a semiautomatic detection of intracerebral IIS was used, allowing a classification of intracerebral IIS into one of three groups: Medial, lateral, and mediolateral. In the medial group (two patients), scalp-EEG IIS were usually absent for one patient whereas for the other, scalp-EEG was misleading. Indeed, scalp-EEG IIS had a posterior projection, predominantly contralateral to the source. In the lateral group (two patients), scalp-EEG IIS were subcontinuous and accurately localized. In the mediolateral group (seven patients), intracerebral interictal distribution was complex and bilateral for four of seven patients. Source localizations were able to determine only a part, whether lateral or medial, of the intracerebral interictal distribution. The accuracy of scalp-EEG IIS source localization is dependant on the type of intracerebral interictal distribution. In the most frequent type of PCE, patients proved to have a complex interictal distribution between both medial and lateral cortices, and source localizations always underestimated intracerebral IIS. In cases where intracranial sources were quite focal, surface EEG sources were localized with accuracy, even in medial occipital lobe structures.

For Electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI, motor imagery is considered as one of the most effective ways. Different imagery activities can be classified based on the changes in mu and/or beta rhythms and their spatial distributions. However, the change in these rhythmic patterns varies from one subject to another. This causes an unavoidable time-consuming fine-tuning process in building a BCI for every subject. To address this issue, we propose a new method called Sub-band Common Spatial Pattern (SBCSP) to solve the problem. First, we decompose the EEG signals into sub-bands using a filter bank. Subsequently, we apply a discriminative analysis to extract SBCSP features. The SBCSP features are then fed into Linear Discriminant Analyzers (LDA) to obtain scores which reflect the classification capability of each frequency band. Finally, the scores are fused to make decision. We evaluate two fusion methods: Recursive Band Elimination (RBE) and Meta-Classifier (MC). We assess our approaches on a standard database from BCI Competition III. We also compare our method with two other approaches that address the same issue. The results show that our method outperforms the other two approaches and achieves similar result as compared to the best one in the literature which was obtained by a time-consuming fine-tuning process.

The authors hypothesize that social inclusion will be a natural outcome if technology can restore or assist the ability of basic self-expression and self-growth. One of the most promising methods of expression for children with learning disabilities is through play, both individual and collaborative. The "Unified neuro-physio platform" explained in this paper focuses on the current development for a low cost signal acquisition and processing architecture aimed at making it easier for children to express themselves in play, both alone and collaboratively, using biosignals like surface electromyography(SEMG) and electroencephalography(EEG). It is part of a larger study to develop an "active" play device to help children with learning disabilities. The significance of the collaborative play approach is that it not only makes a child more self-sufficient but also opens up the possibility of this child helping and training another child through play, thus giving the child an opportunity for social inclusion from a position of strength. The setup of such a neuro-physio platform, system description, methods used and results obtained are described in this paper.

A group of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was evaluated using the same methodology. Additionally, the effects of scopolamine on this separation are studied. Methods: Statistical pattern recognition (SPR) is used in conjunction with information extracted from EEGs before and after administration of scopolamine. Results: There was complete separation of the AD group and controls before administration of scopolamine. The separation increased after scopolamine had been given. Of the 10 MCI individuals, five seemed to belong to the AD group. Three of those progressed to AD within 1 year and one after 3 years. Conclusions: Using SPR on EEG recordings it is possible to separate AD from controls. This separation can be increased by the use of scopolamine but the medication is not a prerequisite for classification. The results indicate that SPR is useful for predicting progress of MCI to AD. Significance: EEG registration is a simple and noninvasive method. If these results are confirmed in other studies, this method could be more widely applied than the highly specialized methods used today in detection of early AD.

In this paper, we address this problem from the aspect of updating feature extractors and propose an adaptive feature extractor, namely adaptive common spatial patterns (ACSP). Through the weighed update of signal covariances, the most discriminative features related to the current brain states are extracted by the method of multi-class common spatial patterns (CSP). Pseudo-online simulations of EEG signal classification with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for multi-class mental imagery tasks show the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive feature extractor.

However, this conflicts with the highly sensitive recording techniques used for BCIs, such as electroencephalography (EEG). Advanced machine learning and signal processing techniques are required to decorrelate desired brain signals from the rest. This paper proposes a signal processing pipeline and two classification methods suitable for multiclass EEG analysis. The methods were tested in an experiment on separating left/right hand imagery in presence/absence of speech. The analyses showed that the presence of speech during motor imagery did not affect the classification accuracy significantly and regardless of the presence of speech, the proposed methods were able to separate left and right hand imagery with an accuracy of 60%. The best overall accuracy achieved for the 5-class separation of all the tasks was 47% and both proposed methods performed equally well. In addition, the analysis of event-related spectral power changes revealed characteristics related to motor imagery and speech.

High density EEG data were recorded for seven subjects while they produced in imagination one of two syllables in one of three different rhythms. We used a modified second-order blind identification (SOBI) algorithm to remove artefact signals and reduce data dimensionality. The algorithm uses the consistent temporal structure along multi-trial EEG data to blindly decompose the original recordings. For the four primary SOBI components, joint temporal and spectral features were extracted from the Hilbert spectra (HS) obtained by a Hilbert-Huang transformation (HHT). The HS provide more accurate time-spectral representations of non-stationary data than do conventional techniques like short-time Fourier spectrograms and wavelet scalograms. Classification of the three rhythms yields promising results for inter-trial transfer, with performance for all subjects significantly greater than chance. For comparison, we tested classification performance of three averaging-based methods, using features in the temporal, spectral and time-frequency domains, respectively, and the results are inferior to those of the SOBI-HHT-based method. The results suggest that the rhythmic structure of imagined syllable production can be detected in non-invasive brain recordings and provide a step towards the development of an EEG-based system for communicating imagined speech.

Therefore spatial filters are extremely useful in single-trial analysis in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. There are powerful methods from machine learning and signal processing that permit the optimization of spatio-temporal filters for each subject in a data dependent fashion beyond the fixed filters based on the sensor geometry, e.g., Laplacians. Here we elucidate the theoretical background of the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm, a popular method in brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Apart from reviewing several variants of the basic algorithm, we reveal tricks of the trade for achieving a powerful CSP performance, briefly elaborate on theoretical aspects of CSP, and demonstrate the application of CSP-type preprocessing in our studies of the Berlin BCI (BBCI) project.

EEG signals from three participants were recorded while they performed four mental tasks designed to elicit hemispheric responses. Autoregressive (AR) models and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) methods were used to form feature vectors with which mental tasks can be discriminated. XCS achieved a maximum classification accuracy of 99.3% and a best average of 88.9%. The relative classification performance of XCS was then compared against four non-evolutionary classifier systems originating from different learning techniques. The experimental results will be used as part of our larger research effort investigating the feasibility of using EEG signals as an interface to allow paralysed persons to control a powered wheelchair or other devices.

Sleep EEG is used as a baseline since the sleep stages can be mapped to recurrent patterns in the background EEG. Our results indicate that the spectral features provide a better classification of the sleep EEG and assist in a better formation of homogenous clusters compared to the results obtained with the previously used features. The average overall agreement compared against manual scoring of seven sleep EEG records is 68.5%. It is an improvement compared to 62.7% obtained with the previously used features. Although our results for computer classification use only the EEG information from one frontal and one occipital channel, they are similar to the manual classification of sleep EEG, which is based on additional information.

However, it has two apparent demerits mainly about the estimation of covariance matrices which sacrifice its performance. First, the estimator of sample covariance is non-robust; Second, the possible high dimension of the covariance matrices makes exact parameter estimation difficult. In this paper, we propose the approach of mixtures of CSP (MCSP) to conquer this problem. MCSP constructs multiple CSP feature extractors by the bootstrap sampling method, and has the potential to improve the performance of one single feature extractor. The classification result of a new EEG sample is obtained by combining several classifier outputs corresponding to the multiple feature extractors. Experimental comparisons with the state-of-the-art method for classifying real EEG signals of motor imagery tasks show the effectiveness of the proposed MCSP method.

In previous research, many researchers have solved these problems in two separate phases firstly use techniques such as singular value decomposition and common spatial pattern to extract features; then design classification such as linear discriminant analysis or support vector machine. In this paper, we show a framework that combines common spatial patterns (CSP) and support vector machine (SVM) to analyze single-trial EEG/ECoG dataset.

While a setup with few channels is more convenient and requires less preparation time, a dense placement of electrodes provides more detailed information and henceforth could lead to a better classification performance. Here, we investigate this question for a specific setting: a BCI that uses the popular CSP algorithm in order to classify voluntary modulations of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR). In a first approach 13 different fixed channel configurations are compared to the full one consisting of 119 channels. The configuration with 48 channels results to be the best one, while configurations with less channels, from 32 to 8, performed not significantly worse than the best configuration in cases where only few training trials are available. In a second approach an optimal channel configuration is obtained by an iterative procedure in the spirit of stepwise variable selection with nonparametric multiple comparisons. As a surprising result, in the second approach a setting with 22 channels centered over the motor areas was selected. Thanks to the acquisition of a large data set recorded from 80 novice participants using 119 EEG channels, the results of this study can be expected to have a high degree of generalizability.

The goal of this research is to develop an interaction technique that will allow the BCI to be effective in real-world scenarios for hand grasp control. One of the major challenges in the BCI research is the subject training. Currently, in most online BCI systems, the classifier was trained offline using the data obtained during the experiments without feedback, and used in the next sessions in which the subjects receive feedback. We investigated whether the subject could achieve satisfactory online performance without offline training while the subjects receive feedback from the beginning of the experiments during hand movement imagination. Another important issue in designing an online BCI system is the machine learning to classify the brain signal which is characterized by significant day-to-day and subject-to-subject variations and time-varying probability distributions. Due to these variabilities, we introduce the use of an adaptive probabilistic neural network (APNN) working in a time-varying environment for classification of EEG signals. The experimental evaluation on ten naive subjects demonstrated that an average classification accuracy of 75.4% was obtained during the first experiment session (day) after about 3 min of online training without offline training, and 81.4% during the second session (day). The average rates during third and eighth sessions are 79.0% and 84.0%, respectively, using previously calculated classifier during the first sessions, without online training and without the need to calibrate. The results obtained from more than 5000 trials on ten subjects showed that the method could provide a robust performance over different experiment sessions and different subjects. (C) 2010 IPEM.

The design of EEG representations and classifiers for BCI are open research questions whose difficulty stems from the need to extract complex spatial and temporal patterns from noisy multidimensional time series obtained from EEG measurements. The high-dimensional and noisy nature of EEG may limit the advantage of nonlinear classification methods over linear ones. This paper reports the results of a linear (linear discriminant analysis) and two nonlinear classifiers (neural networks and support vector machines) applied to the classification of spontaneous EEG during five mental tasks, showing that nonlinear classifiers produce only slightly better classification results. An approach to feature selection based on genetic algorithms is also presented with preliminary results of application to EEG during finger movement.

Multimodal imaging techniques rely on the assumption of a common neuronal source for the different recorded signals. In order to maximally exploit the combination of these techniques, one needs to understand the coupling (i.e., the relation) between electroencephalographic (EEG) and fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals. Recently, simultaneous EEG-fMRI measurements have been used to investigate the relation between the two signals. Previous attempts at the analysis of simultaneous EEG-fMRI data reported significant correlations between regional BOLD activations and modulation of both event-related potential (ERP) and oscillatory EEG power, mostly in the alpha but also in other frequency bands. Beyond the correlation of the two measured brain signals, the relevant issue we address here is the ability of predicting the signal in one modality using information from the other modality. Using multivariate machine learning-based regression, we show how it is possible to predict EEG power oscillations from simultaneously acquired fMRI data during an eyes-open/eyes-closed task using either the original channels or the underlying cortically distributed sources as the relevant EEG signal for the analysis of multimodal data.

Feature Selection for Brain-Computer Interface	4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (ECIFMBE)	NOV 23-27, 2008	Antwerp, BELGIUM			BCI; EEG; feature selection; PCA	EEG; CLASSIFICATION	The implementation of a realistic Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for non-trained subjects requires a classifier able to detect subject-specific electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns. The classifier should be simple enough (i.e. few EEG features, few EEG channels) to enable the mutual adaptation between the BCI and the user. However the classifier should still capture subject-specific EEG patterns. Hence, a feature selection algorithm is introduced as a new method to detect subject-dependent feature and channel relevance for mental task discrimination. This algorithm employs a new formulation of principal component analysis that accommodates the group structure in the dataset. Five subjects were submitted to an EEG experiment that instructed them to perform movement imagery tasks. A linear discriminant classifier used the selected features to discriminate EEG responses to left vs. right hand movement imagery performance with 18% cross-validation error. The discrimination of EEG responses to tongue vs. feet movement imagery performance achieved 26% cross-validation error. Besides the low classification error attained, the selected features often included the frequency-space EEG patterns generally suggested for movement imagery task discrimination. Moreover, each subject's characteristic EEG patterns were also detected and enhanced classifier performance and customization.	[Dias, N. S.; Mendes, P. M.; Correia, J.

Scalp EEG or intracerebral EEG signals recorded in patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy convey important information about epileptogenic networks that must be localized and understood prior to subsequent therapeutic procedures. However, this information, often subtle, is 'hidden' in the signals. It is precisely the role of signal processing to extract this information and to put it into a 'coherent and interpretable picture' that can participate in the therapeutic strategy. Nowadays, the panel of available methods is very wide depending on the objectives such as, for instance, the detection of transient epileptiform events, the detection and/or prediction of seizures, the recognition and/or the classification of EEG patterns, the localization of epileptic neuronal sources, the characterization of neural synchrony, the determination of functional connectivity, among others. The intent of this paper is to focus on a specific category of methods providing relevant information about epileptogenic networks from the analysis of spatial properties of EEG signals in the time and frequency domain. These methods apply to either interictal or ictal recordings and share the common objective of localizing the subsets of brain structures involved in both types of paroxysmal activity. Most of these methods were developed by our group and are routinely used during pre-surgical evaluation. Examples are detailed. Results, as well as limitations of the methods, are also discussed.

Employing pattern recognition algorithm "Kora-n", a list of 37 combined EEG patterns was compiled. This list characterized with a minimal error the EEG of healthy adolescents in such a way that none of these characters featured the EEG of adolescents with schizophrenia. Analysis of this list of EEG characteristics suggests that the contrast between EEG of healthy and ill adolescents is the sharpest in the F4, Cz, T3 and 01 derivations. Compared to EEG samples of schizophrenic subjects, EEGs of healthy subjects exhibit lower levels of delta and theta activity mainly in the frontal and temporal regions of the cortex and higher level of alpha activity predominantly in the occipital region. Applicability of the list of EEG patterns for diagnostics of schizophrenia-type disorders of adolescents is discussed.

This study applied machine-learning algorithms to categorize EEG dynamics according to subject self-reported emotional states during music listening. A framework was proposed to optimize EEG-based emotion recognition by systematically 1) seeking emotion-specific EEG features and 2) exploring the efficacy of the classifiers. Support vector machine was employed to classify four emotional states (joy, anger, sadness, and pleasure) and obtained an averaged classification accuracy of 82.29% +/- 3.06% across 26 subjects. Further, this study identified 30 subject-independent features that were most relevant to emotional processing across subjects and explored the feasibility of using fewer electrodes to characterize the EEG dynamics during music listening. The identified features were primarily derived from electrodes placed near the frontal and the parietal lobes, consistent with many of the findings in the literature. This study might lead to a practical system for noninvasive assessment of the emotional states in practical or clinical applications.

Until now brain-actuated control has mainly relied on implanted electrodes, since EEG-based systems have been considered too slow for controlling rapid and complex sequences of movements. We show that two human subjects successfully moved a robot between several rooms by mental control only, using an EEG-based brain-machine interface that recognized three mental states. Mental control was comparable to manual control on the same task with a performance ratio of 0.74.

Brisk extensions and flexions of the index finger, and movements of the proximal arm (shoulder) and distal arm (finger) were classified using scalp EEG signals. The aim of our study was to develop a system for the classification of movements which show EEG changes at identical scalp electrodes of one hemisphere. The classification of EEG patterns related to movements of one hand is difficult because the disentanglement of movements can only rely on the temporal evolution of EEG changes at one recording site. A large variability of EEG waveforms requires the use of the context information. The classification procedure was optimized in all parts to increase the recognition score and it was extensively tested on a set of EEG data. The average classification score was 80%, std. deviation 9% for the classification of distal and proximal movements. The classification of extension/flexion reached even better results (due to more accurate localization of the signal source on the scalp). The classification of movement-related EEG data based on HMM yielded higher recognition scores than previously reported classification scores based on artificial neural networks (NaN).

For the special case of classifying electroencephalogram (EEG) signals we propose the usage of the state of the art feature selection algorithms Recursive Feature Elimination [3] and Zero-Norm Optimization [13] which are based on the training of support vector machines (SVM) [11]. These algorithms can provide more accurate solutions than standard filter methods for feature selection [14]. We adapt the methods for the purpose of selecting EEG channels. For a motor imagery paradigm we show that the number of used channels can be reduced significantly without increasing the classification error. The resulting best channels agree well with the expected underlying cortical activity patterns during the mental tasks. Furthermore we show how time dependent task specific information can be visualized.

To increase the discriminability of features or feature vectors used for classification, it is necessary to select a suitable number of task-related data recording channels. In this article, a machine-learning algorithm is proposed for optimizing feature extraction in an electrocorticogram-based brain-computer interface. Common spatial pattern was used for feature extraction, and channel selection was performed by genetic algorithm for optimizing the feature extraction. Fisher discriminant analysis was used as classifier, and the channel subset chosen at each generation was evaluated by classification accuracy. The algorithm was applied to three electrocorticogram datasets that were recorded during two kinds of motor imagery tasks. The results suggest that the channel number used for building a brain-computer interface system could be significantly decreased without losing classification accuracy, and the accuracy rate could be noticeably improved by using the optimal channel subsets chosen by genetic algorithm.

One-sided hand movement imagination results in EEG changes located at contra- and ipsilateral central areas, We demonstrate that spatial filters for multichannel EEG effectively extract discriminatory information from two populations of single-trial EEG, recorded during left- and right-hand movement imagery. The best classification results for three subjects are 90.8%, 92.7%, and 99.7%. The spatial filters are estimated from a set of data by the method of common spatial patterns and reflect the specific activation of cortical areas, The method performs a weighting of the electrodes according to their importance for the classification task. The high recognition rates and computational simplicity make it a promising method for an EEG-based brain-computer interface.

Predicting reaching targets from human EEG	IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING MAGAZINE			English	Article								Extracting reach information from brain signals is of great interest to the fields of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and human motor control. To date, most work in this area has focused on invasive intracranial recordings; however, successful decoding of reach targets from noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG) signals would be of great interest. In this article, we show that EEG signals contain sufficient information to decode target location during a reach (Experiment 1) and during the planning period before a reach (Experiment 2). We discuss the application of independent component analysis and dipole fitting for removing movement artifacts. With this technique we get similar classification accuracy for classifying EEG signals during a reach (Experiment 1) and during the planning period before a reach (Experiment 2). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of decoding (planned) reach targets from EEG. These results lay the foundation for future EEG-based BCIs based on decoding of planned reaches.

The goal of this system is to Produce it picture best resembling subject's 'imagined' image. This system evolves images using Compositional SUN Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs) via the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) genetic algorithm. Fitness values for NEAT-based evolution are derived from a real-time EEG classifier its images are presented using rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). Here, we report the design and performance, for a pilot training session, of a BCI system for real-time single-trial binary classification of viewed images based oil participant-specific brain response signatures present in 128-channel EEG data. Selected training-session image clips created by the image evolution algorithm were presented in 2-s bursts at 8/s. The subject indicated by Subsequent button press whether or not each burst included all image resembling two eyes. Approximately half the bursts included Such an image. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to extract a set of maximally independent EEG Source time-courses and their 100 minimally-redundant low-dimensional informative features ill the time and time-frequency amplitude domains front the (94%) bursts followed by correct manual responses. To estimate the likelihood that the post-image EEG contained EEG 'flickers' of target recognition, we applied two Fisher discriminant classifiers to the time and/or time-frequency features. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve by tenfold cross-validation was 0.96 using time-domain features, 0.97 using time-frequency domain features, and 0.98 using both domain features.

It resolves the ill-posed many-to-one mapping, from voxel values or data features to a target variable, using a parametric empirical or hierarchical Bayesian model. This model is inverted using standard variational techniques, in this case expectation maximisation, to furnish the model evidence and the conditional density of the model's parameters. This allows one to compare different models or hypotheses about the mapping from functional or structural anatomy to perceptual and behavioural consequences (or their deficits). We frame this approach in terms of decoding measured brain states to predict or classify outcomes using the rhetoric established in pattern classification of neuroimaging data. However, the aim of MVB is not to predict (because the outcomes are known) but to enable inference on different models of structure-function mappings; such as distributed and sparse representations. This allows one to optimise the model itself and produce predictions that outperform standard pattern classification approaches, like support vector machines. Technically, the model inversion and inference uses the same empirical Bayesian procedures developed for ill-posed inverse problems (e.g., source reconstruction in EEG). However, the MVB scheme used here extends this approach to include a greedy search for sparse solutions. It reduces the problem to the same form used in Gaussian process modelling, which affords a generic and efficient scheme for model optimisation and evaluating model evidence. We illustrate MVB using simulated and real data, with a special focus on model comparison; where models can differ in the form of the mapping (i.e., neuronal representation) within one region, or in the (combination of) regions per se.

In this paper, an algorithm for the automatic detection of these EEG changes is presented which could enable safer induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane by informing the clinicians about the epileptiform EEG. EEG was recorded from 60 healthy female patients during sevoflurane anesthesia. A neurophysiologist classified the EEG waveforms. Each anesthesia period lasted 6 minutes. 48 signal features were extracted from the raw EEG. 5-sec segments of EEG were classified based on the extracted features using a decision tree with a logistic regression based decisions and the classification results were compared to the neurophysiologist's classifications. Awake EEG was recognized with 69% / 96% (sensitivity / specificity), Burst suppression with 56% / 98%, Epileptiform EEG with 83% / 87 %, normal slow anesthesia EEG with 86% 64 %, slow anesthesia EEG with monophasic pattern with 65% 80 %, and slow anesthesia EEG with monophasic pattern and spikes with 54% / 84%.

Firstly, EEG signals are represented as third order tensors in the spatial-spectral-temporal domain by wavelet transform. Then, a regularized tensor discriminant analysis (RTDA) algorithm is proposed for a multi-way discriminative subspace extraction from tensor-represented EEG data. Unlike the conventional wavelet transform method, the proposed scheme includes the structural information in multi-channel time-varying EEG spectrums endorsed by tensor representation, and improves the performance for EEG classification. Compared with the common spatial pattern (CSP, the most successful algorithm in BCI) in the applications to two classes of datasets, the proposed scheme has the following advantages: (1) an optimal multi-way discriminative subspace can be extracted, obtaining significant spatial-spectral-temporal patterns for EEG classification; (2) the proposed scheme can identify discriminative characteristics robustly, and works well without prior neurophysiologic knowledge. This is a valuable property for developing new paradigms in BCI whose discriminative neural correlates are not known and (3) the proposed scheme is able to find the most significant channels for classification, and can be applied to channel selection in BCI. Computer simulations show that the number of used channels can be reduced to 2 in two datasets with very little loss in performance. Therefore, it has great potential for the practical application of BCI. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

So far, most of these studies have been based on invasive approaches. Nevertheless, a few researchers have decoded kinematic parameters of single hand in non-invasive ways such as magnetoencephalogram (MEG) and electroencephalogram (EEG). Regarding these EEG studies, center-out reaching tasks have been employed. Yet whether hand velocity can be decoded using EEG recorded during a self-routed drawing task is unclear. Methods: Here we collected whole-scalp EEG data of five subjects during a sequential 4-directional drawing task, and employed spatial filtering algorithms to extract the amplitude and power features of EEG in multiple frequency bands. From these features, we reconstructed hand movement velocity by Kalman filtering and a smoothing algorithm. Results: The average Pearson correlation coefficients between the measured and the decoded velocities are 0.37 for the horizontal dimension and 0.24 for the vertical dimension. The channels on motor, posterior parietal and occipital areas are most involved for the decoding of hand velocity. By comparing the decoding performance of the features from different frequency bands, we found that not only slow potentials in 0.1-4 Hz band but also oscillatory rhythms in 24-28 Hz band may carry the information of hand velocity. Conclusions: These results provide another support to neural control of motor prosthesis based on EEG signals and proper decoding methods.

It is a linear feature extractor which aims at maximizing or minimizing the disparity of energy features between two classes of EEG signals. The final transform for feature extraction in EED is very concise, which is resolved by an eigenvalue decomposition problem. In the context of EEG signal classification for brain-computer interfaces, the performance of EED is evaluated with real EEG signals from different subjects. Experimental results on nine subjects show that the EED feature extractor is comparable to the state-of-the-art feature extraction method common spatial patterns (CSP). Furthermore on another benchmark data set, by combining features obtained by EED and CSP, we train a linear support vector machine classifier whose classification accuracy outperforms the best result reported. This shows EED can be a beneficial complement to CSP. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

According to the relationship between emotional factors and the characters of image, we incorporate the fuzzy concept to extract emotional features using L*C*H* color and orientation information. On the other hand, after various pre-processing of emotional electroencephalography (EEG), we treat emotional relevant EEG features using the fuzzy logic based on possibility theory rather than widely used conventional probability theory to generate the semantic feature of the human emotions. Fuzzy-GIST consists of both semantic visual information and linguistic EEG feature, it is used to represent emotional gist of a natural scene in a semantic level. We use a neuro-fuzzy inference model to infer the emotion evoked by an image, and the feedback from the subject is used for supervising the learning as well as evaluating the performance of the proposed scheme. The experiment results show the possibility to recognize four different emotions for a given dataset. Moreover, the analysis of human emotional status and visual information also can serve for the study of interaction between human subject and machine, and possibly the development of new brain machine interface.

Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is an idiopathic generalized epilepsy (ICE) that typically presents generalized tonic-clonic, myoclonic, or absence seizures, or a combination of these. In typical cases of JME, the seizures are usually bilateral and symmetric, and EEG shows generalized interictal epileptiform discharges and a generalized seizure pattern that also is bilaterally synchronous. Despite of the generalized pattern of this type of epilepsy, there are some electroencephalographic and clinical features that suggest a frontal origin for the discharges. In this work, EEG recordings were analyzed in order to find evidences for this frontal origin in JME. The analysis of the signals was based on independent component analysis (ICA) for separating epileptiform discharges from artifacts and other brain sources; then the discharge components were used to spatially localize its source. In the six patients the dipole sources were localized mainly in the frontal region, what suggests an important participation of the frontal lobe for this kind of epilepsy.

The effectiveness of such an EEG-based BCI system relies on two indispensable components: distinguishable patterns of brain signals and accurate classifiers. This work aims to extract two reliable neural features, termed contralateral and ipsilateral rebound maps, by removing artifacts from motor imagery EEG based on independent component analysis (ICA), and to employ four classifiers to investigate the efficacy of rebound maps. Results demonstrate that, with the use of ICA, recognition rates for four classifiers (fisher linear discriminant (FLD), back-propagation neural network (BP-NN), radial-basis function neural network (RBF-NN), and support vector machine (SVM)) improved significantly, from 54%, 54%, 57% and 55% to 70.5%, 75.5%, 76.5% and 77.3%, respectively. In addition, the areas under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, which assess the quality of classification over a wide range of misclassification costs, also improved from .65, .60, .62, and .64 to .74, .76, .80 and .81, respectively.

The features of these changes appear as subject-specific temporal traces of EEG rhythmic components at specific channels located over the scalp. Accurate classification of MI tasks based upon EEG may lead to a noninvasive brain-computer interface (BCI) to decode and convey intention of human subjects. We have previously proposed two novel methods on time-frequency feature extraction, expression and classification for high-density EEG recordings (Wang and He 2004; Wang, Deng, and He, 2004). In the present study, we refined the above time-frequency-spatial approach and applied it to a one-dimensional "cursor control" BCI experiment with online feedback. Through offline analysis of the collected data, we evaluated the capability of the present refined method in comparison with the original time-frequency-spatial methods. The enhanced performance in terms of classification accuracy was found for the proposed approach, with a mean accuracy rate of 91.1% for two subjects studied.

Local temporal Common Spatial Patterns (LTCSP) is a technique to capture the local temporal information of EEG signal, and has two free parameters including the number of nearest neighbors and the kernel variance, which have to be specified manually. In this paper we propose a novel method for selecting the optimal parameter for LTCSP automatically. Comparing computational time and classification rate on BCI Competition 2003 data set, it shows that our proposed method is more efficient than CSP and LTCSP.

Modeling and prediction of EEG signals is important for many applications. The method using support vectors machine (SVM) based on the structure risk minimization provides us an effective way of learning machine. The performance of SVM is much better than the traditional learning machine. Now the SVM is used in classification and regression. But solving the quadratic programming problem for training SVM becomes a bottle-neck of using SVM because of the long time of SVM training. In this paper, a local-SVM method is proposed for predicting the signals. The local method is presented for improving the speed of the prediction of EEG signals. The simulation results show that the training of the local-SVM obtains a good behavior. In addition, the local SVM method significantly improves the prediction precision.

EEG in Children: Periodometric Analysis, Typology, and Age Peculiarities	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; periodometric analysis; classification of EEG patterns; age dynamics of EEG in children		We carried out a computer analysis of the EEG of 169 healthy schoolchildren (6 to 17 years old) with the use of a periodometric approach allowing us to obtain a number of quantitative indices that characterize the temporal structure of the analyzed EEG segment (histogram of distribution of the frequencies of EEG oscillations within the analyzed time period, indices of the different rhythms, and matrix of the probabilities of conversion from waves of one frequency range to waves of other ranges). We demonstrated that data of the periodometric analysis can be used for objective classification of EEG patterns. In children of different age groups, five types of background EEG activity were classified and described; we also demonstrated that the intragroup frequencies of these EEG types vary in healthy children with age. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the periodometric analysis of EEG, as well as the prospects and expediency of use of this analysis in physiological studies and in clinics.

These systems use brain signals recorded from the scalp, the surface of the cortex, or from inside the brain to enable users to control a variety of applications. BCI systems that bypass conventional motor output pathways of nerves and muscles can provide novel control options for paralyzed patients. One classical approach to establish EEG-based control is to set up a system that is controlled by a specific EEG feature which is known to be susceptible to conditioning and to let the subjects learn the voluntary control of that feature. In contrast, the Berlin Brain-Computer Interface (BBCI) uses well established motor competencies of its users and a machine learning approach to extract subject-specific patterns from high-dimensional features optimized for detecting the user's intent. Thus the long subject training is replaced by a short calibration measurement (20 min) and machine learning (I min). We report results from a study in which 10 subjects, who had no or little experience with BCI feedback, controlled computer applications by voluntary imagination of limb movements: these intentions led to modulations of spontaneous brain activity specifically, somatotopically matched sensorimotor 7-30 Hz rhythms were diminished over pericentral cortices. The peak information transfer rate was above 35 bits per minute (bpm) for 3 subjects, above 23 bpm for two, and above 12 bpm for 3 subjects, while one subject could achieve no BCI control. Compared to other BCI systems which need longer subject training to achieve comparable results, we propose that the key to quick efficiency in the BBCI system is its flexibility due to complex but physiologically meaningful features and its adaptivity which respects the enormous inter-subject variability.

Currently, parameters (e.g. channels and frequency band) are often manually selected. It is time-consuming and not easy to obtain an optimal combination of parameters for a BCI. In this paper, motor imagery-based BCIs are considered, in which channels and frequency band are key parameters. First, a semi-supervised support vector machine algorithm is proposed for automatically selecting a set of channels with given frequency band. Next, this algorithm is extended for joint channel-frequency selection. In this approach, both training data with labels and test data without labels are used for training a classifier. Hence it can be used in small training data case. Finally, our algorithms are applied to a BCI competition data set. Our data analysis results show that these algorithms are effective for selection of frequency band and channels when the training data set is small.

For adaptive filtering methodologies used in neuroprosthetics, extraction of spatio-control parameters remains a difficulty. Since amplitude modulation in extracellular recordings plays a key role in both neuronal activation and rate coding, seeking spatial pattern classification and temporally intermittent population synchronization in terms of increased voltage may provide viable control signals. This study seeks to explore preprocessing modalities that emphasize amplitude modulation in the ECoG above the level of noise and background fluctuations in order to derive the commands for complex control tasks. The decoding performance of the amplitude modulation across the recording spectra was found to be spatially specific in the cortex.

However, the performance of this spatial filter depends on the operational frequency band of the EEG. Thus, setting a broad frequency range, or manually selecting a subject-specific frequency range, are commonly used with the CSP algorithm. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) to perform autonomous selection of key temporal-spatial discriminative EEG characteristics. After the EEG measurements have been bandpass-filtered into multiple frequency bands, CSP features are extracted from each of these bands. A feature selection algorithm is then used to automatically select discriminative pairs of frequency bands and corresponding CSP features. A classification algorithm is subsequently used to classify the CSP features. A study is conducted to assess the performance of a selection of feature selection and classification algorithms for use with the FBCSP. Extensive experimental results are presented on a publicly available dataset as well as data collected from healthy subjects and unilaterally paralyzed stroke patients. The results show that FBCSP, using a particular combination feature selection and classification algorithm, yields relatively higher cross-validation accuracies compared to prevailing approaches.

To motor-imagery-based BCI, feature extraction and classification are two critical stages. This paper explores a dynamic ICA base on sliding window Infomax algorithm to analyze motor imagery EEG. The method can get a dynamic mixing matrix with the new data inputting, which is unlike the static mixing matrix in traditional ICA algorithm. And by using the feature patterns based on total energy of dynamic mixing matrix coefficients in a certain time window, the classification accuracy without training can be achieved beyond 85% for BCI competition 2003 data set.. The results demonstrate that the method can be used for the extraction and classification of motor imagery EEG. In the present study, it suggests that the proposed algorithm may provide a valuable alternative to study motor imagery EEG for BCI applications.

This algorithm is based on the spatiotemporal pulse patterns generated from the autocorrelation values in the ongoing EEG data. A back propagation feed forward neural network was used for classification. The structure of the network preserves the spatio-temporal characteristics of the signal. Simulation results show that the classification accuracy can reach a 100% on each subject and a 91% over all subjects when the correct pair of electrodes is selected.

J	Melissant, C; Ypma, A; Frietman, EEE; Stam, CJ				Melissant, C; Ypma, A; Frietman, EEE; Stam, CJ			A method for detection of Alzheimer's disease using ICA-enhanced EEG measurements	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; ICA; EEG measurements	BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; DISCRIMINATION; INFORMATION; STATISTICS; ARTIFACTS	Objective: Many researchers have studied automatic EEG classification and recently a tot of work has been done on artefact-removal from EEG data using independent component analyses (ICA). However, demonstrating that a ICA-processed multichannel EEG measurement becomes more interpretable compared to the raw data (as is usually done in work on ICA-processing of EEG data) does not yet prove that detection of (incipient) anomalies is also better possible after ICA-processing. The objective of this study is to show that ICA-preprocessing is useful when constructing a detection system for Alzheimer's disease. Methods and material: The paper describes a method for detection of EEG patterns indicative of Alzheimer's disease using automatic pattern recognition techniques. Our method incorporates an artefact removal stage based on ICA prior to automatic classification. The method is evaluated on measurements of a Length of 8 s from two groups of patients, where one group is in an initial stage of the disease (28 patients), whereas the other group is in a more progressed stage (15 patients). Both setups include a control group that should be classified as normal (10 and 21, respectively). Results: Our final classification results for the group with severe Alzheimer's disease are comparable to the best results from literature. We show that ICA-based reduction of artefacts improves classification results for patients in an initial stage. Conclusion: We conclude that a more robust detection of Alzheimer's disease related EEG patterns may be obtained by employing ICA as ICA based pre-processing of EEG data can improve classification results for patients in an initial stage of Alzheimer's disease.

The method is used for the evaluation of EEG signals measured by spatially distributed electrodes over sensory cortices of rabbits. Our analysis reveals two types of patterns in neocortex. One type occurs with short latency after stimulus arrival. This early pattern represents the direct impact of a discriminated stimulus on the receiving cortex. The other type is endogenous and occurs with variable latency in the subsequent similar to 1200 ms. It represents the destabilization of the spatio-temporal dynamics of the cortices and consequent phase transitions. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

This means that the onset of mental activity (thought) is externally-paced and the EEG has to be analyzed in predefined time windows. In the near future, BCI systems that allow the user to intend a specific mental pattern 'whenever she/he wishes to produce such patterns will also become important. An asynchronous BCI is characterized by continuous analyzing and classification of EEG data. Therefore, it is important to maximize the hits (true positive rate) during an intended mental task and to minimize the false positive detections in the resting or idling state. EEG data recorded during right/left motor imagery is used to simulate an asynchronous BCI. To optimize the classification results,a. refractory period and a dwell time are introduced.

Limited channel leads are applied to the patient and data are displayed in a semilogarithmic, time-compressed scale. Several classifications are currently in use to describe patient tracings, incorporating voltage criteria, pattern recognition, cyclicity, and the presence or absence of seizures. In term neonates, aEEG has been used to determine the prognosis and treatment for those affected by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, seizures, meningitis and even congenital heart disease. Its application as inclusion criteria for therapeutic hypothermia remains controversial. In preterm infants, normative values and patterns corresponding to gestational age are being established. As these standards emerge, the predictive value of aEEG increases, especially in the setting of preterm brain injury and intraventricular hemorrhage. The sensitivity and specificity of aEEG are enhanced by the display of a simultaneous raw EEG, which aids interpretation. Caution must be taken when using and interpreting this tool in conjunction with certain medications and in the setting of less experienced staff. Continuing efforts at developing software that can aid seizure detection and background classification will enhance the bedside utility of this tool.

Three subjects participated in a series of on-line sessions to test if it is possible to use common spatial patterns to analyze EEG in real time in order to give feedback to the subjects. Furthermore, the classification accuracy that can be achieved after only three days of training was investigated. The patterns are estimated from a set of multichannel EEG data by the method of common spatial patterns and reflect the specific activation of cortical areas. By construction, common spatial patterns weight each electrode according to its importance to the discrimination task and suppress noise in individual channels by using correlations between neighboring electrodes. Experiments with three subjects resulted in an error rate of 2, 6 and 14% during on-line discrimination of left- and right-hand motor imagery after three days of training and make common spatial patterns a promising method for an EEG-based brain-computer interface.

Methods: Electrodes are placed in scalp centro-parietal zones (C3 P3, C4 and P4 positions of the international 10-20 system). A Mahalanobis distance classifier based on the use of full covariance matrix was used. Results: The quadratic classifier was able to detect EEG activity related to imagination of movement with an affordable accuracy (97% correct classification, on average) by using only C3 and C4 electrodes. Conclusions: Such a result is interesting for the use of Mahalanobis based classifiers in the brain computer interface area.

By quantifying the frustration as the human manipulates the machines from the biomedical signal and making it to be teaching signals of machine leaning (ML), we aim at the development of the system in which the machine adapts to the human. In this paper, we extract the characteristic vector whether the examinee is discomfort or not-discomfort from electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG). The artificial neural network (ANN) is employed to extract the vector. For the machine learning, reinforcement learning will be used and their rewards are extracted signal from physiological signals. As a basic experiment for extracting discomfort and not-discomfort from the physiological signals, the EEG measurement experiment was carried out under unpleasant sound environment for 20 examinees. The input signals to ANN for the characteristic vector extraction was examined By affixing the piezoelectric films on the eyebrow, the movement of the eyebrow was measured Finally, the results of measuring EEG and EMG simultaneously under the situation in which the frustration accumulated for the examinee is shown We will be used for the rewards of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to control the behavior of the Khepera robot.

In practical applications of pattern recognition, there are often diverse features extracted from raw data which needs recognizing. Because of the importance of making the right decision, the present work is carried out for searching better classification procedures for the EEG signals. Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction by eigenvector methods and classification using the classifiers trained on the extracted features. The aim of the study is classification of the EEG signals by the combination of eigenvector methods and the RNN. The present research demonstrated that the power levels of the power spectral density (PSD) estimates obtained by the eigenvector methods are the features which well represent the EEG signals and the RNN trained on these features achieved high classification accuracies.

In this paper, a sphere-shaped SVM for multiclass problems is presented. Compared with the classical plane-shaped SVMs, the number of convex quadratic programming problems and the number of variables in each programming are smaller. Such SVM classifier is applied to the electroencephalogram (EEG) source localization problem, and the multiplicity of source models is determined according to the potentials recorded on the scalp. Experimental results indicate that the sphere-shaped SVM based classifier is an effective and promising approach for this task.

They have so far shown efficacies in many practical classification problems. However, for electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification with application to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), there are almost no studies investigating their feasibilities. The present study systematically evaluates the performance of the three ensemble methods for EEG signal classification of mental imagery tasks. With the base classifiers of k-nearest-neighbor, decision tree and support vector machine, classification experiments are carried out upon real EEG recordings. Experimental results suggest the feasibilities of ensemble classification methods, and we also derive some valuable conclusions on the performance of ensemble methods for EEG signal classification.

In recent years, the event-related desynchronization (ERD) and movement-related potentials (MRPs) are utilized as important features in motor related BCI system, and the common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm has shown to be very useful for ERD-based classification. However, as MRPs are slow nonoscillatory EEG potential shifts, CSP is not an appropriate approach for MRPs-based classification. Here, another spatial filtering algorithm, discriminative spatial patterns (DSP), is newly introduced for better extraction of the difference in the amplitudes of MRPs, and it is integrated with CSP to extract the features from the EEG signals recorded during voluntary left versus right finger movement tasks. A support vector machines (SVM) based framework is designed as the classifier for the features. The results show that, for MRPs and ERD features, the combined spatial filters can realize the single-trial EEG classification better than anyone of DSP and CSP alone does. Thus, we propose an EEG-based BCI system with the two feature sets, one based on CSP (ERD) and the other based on DSP (MRPs), classified by SVM.

The procedure of EEG signal pattern recognition consisted of information acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction and selection, classification estimation and recognition. By studying the association between EEG signal and prosthetic movement, it was concluded that EEG signal controlling prosthesis was feasible. Therefore, a prosthetic controlled system was designed based on EEG signal pattern recognition and acquisition. The system initiated from scalp electrode (or prosthetic electrode), passed through differential amplifier circuit (or prosthetic drive circuit), pre-amplifier circuit, notch circuit, med-amplifier circuit, and filter circuit, and finally reached analog-to-digital converter. The practice proves that this prosthetic controlled system can satisfy various requirements of EEG signal-controlled prosthesis pretty well.

The EEG signals were recorded during imagination of left or right hand movement. The kurtosis of EEG and its dynamic properties with respect to time are analyzed. The experiment results show that the kurtosis can reflect the EEG pattern changes of different motor imageries. According to the analysis and experiment results, a kurtosis based classifier for the classification of left and right movement imagination is designed. This classifier can achieves near 90% correct rate. As the kurtosis is computationally less demanding and can also be estimated in on-line way, so the new method proposed in this paper has the practicability in the application of brain-computer interface.

Most of existing CSP-based methods exploit covariance matrices on a subject-by-subject basis so that inter-subject information is neglected. In this paper we present modifications of CSP for subject-to-subject transfer, where we exploit a linear combination of covariance matrices of subjects in consideration. We develop two methods to determine a composite covariance matrix that is a weighted sum of covariance matrices involving subjects, leading to composite CSP. Numerical experiments on dataset IVa in BCI competition III confirm that our composite CSP methods improve classification performance over the standard CSP (on a subject-by-subject basis), especially in the case of subjects with fewer number of training samples.

These emotions are evoked by showing subjects pictures of smile and cry facial expressions. We propose a frequency band searching method to choose an optimal band into which the recorded EEG signal is filtered. We use common spatial patterns (CSP) and linear-SVM to classify these two emotions. To investigate the time resolution of classification, we explore two kinds of trials with lengths of 3s and is. Classification accuracies of 93.5% +/- 6.7% and 93.0% +/- 6.2% are achieved on 10 subjects for 3s-trials and 1s-trials, respectively. Our experimental results indicate that the gamma band (roughly 30-100 Hz) is suitable for EEG-based emotion classification.

Composition of brain oscillations in interictal EEG	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						epilepsy; interictal electroencephalogram (EEG); multiple brain oscillations; short-term spectral patterns; probability-classification analysis	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; SEIZURES; STATIONARITY; VARIABILITY	Objective: In the present experimental study, we examined the compositions of brain oscillations and their temporal behavior in broad frequency band (0.5-30 Hz) in interictal EEG without epileptiform abnormalities during generalized epilepsy in resting conditions. Methods: The exact compositions of brain oscillations and their percent ratio were assessed by a probability-classification analysis of short-term EEG spectral patterns (SPs), which reveals temporal dynamics of these SPs and results in the probability-classification profile. Results: It has been demonstrated that the interictal EEG was characterized by (a) a shift towards higher frequencies in all observed brain oscillations, (b) an increased amount of polyrhythmic activity, (c) a decrease in SP types diversity, (d) a decreased relative incidence of the SP type change in the transition between neighboring EEG epochs of the same EEG, and (e) an increased temporal stabilization periods of polyrhythmic activity. All these were observed in distributed brain areas. Conclusions: It was suggested that these findings reflect a disorganization of neurodynamics in the epileptic brain. At the same time, the fact that all these indices were significantly different from surrogate EEG reflects a non-occasional and thus, most likely, an adaptive nature of the microstructural reorganization of interictal EEG. Significance: Parameters of interictal EEG without the signs of epileptiform activity can be considered as additional information in premorbid diagnostics of epistatus.

The SoC corresponds to one EEG channel, and, depending on the patient, up to 18 channels may be worn to detect seizures as part of a chronic treatment system. The SoC integrates an instrumentation amplifier, ADC, and digital processor that streams features-vectors to a central device where seizure detection is performed via a machine-learning classifier. The instrumentation-amplifier uses chopper-stabilization in a topology that achieves high input-impedance and rejects large electrode-offsets while operating at 1 V; the ADC employs power-gating for low energy-per-conversion while using static-biasing for comparator precision; the EEG feature extraction processor employs low-power hardware whose parameters are determined through validation via patient data. The integration of sensing and local processing lowers system power by 14x by reducing the rate of wireless EEG data transmission. Feature vectors are derived at a rate of 0.5 Hz, and the complete one-channel SoC operates from a 1 V supply, consuming 9 mu J per feature vector.

Discreet Discrete Commands for Assistive and Neuroprosthetic Devices	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); classification; electroencephalography (EEG); electromyography (EMG); functional electrical stimulation (FES)	COMPUTER-INTERFACE; EEG; ARTIFACTS	Many new assistive devices are available for individuals paralyzed below the neck due to spinal cord injury. Severely paralyzed individuals must be able to command their complex assistive devices using remaining activity from the neck up. Electromyographic (EMG) sensors enable people to use contractions of head and neck muscles to generate multiple proportional command signals. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals can also be used to generate commands for assistive device control by conveying information about imagined or attempted movements. Fully-implanted wireless biopotential detection systems are now being developed to reliably detect EMGs, EEGs, or a mixture of the two from recording electrodes implanted just under the skin or scalp thus eliminating the need for externally worn hardware on the head or face. This present study shows how novel patterns of jaw muscle contractions, detected via biopotential sensors on the scalp surface or implanted just under the scalp, can be used to generate reliable discrete EMG commands, which can be differentiated from patterns generated during normal activities, such as chewing. These jaw contractions can be detected with sensors already in place to detect other muscle-or brain-based command signals thus adding to the functionality of current device control systems.

Methods. In 36 neonates with a gestational age greater than or equal to36 weeks, CFM and simultaneously recorded EEG traces were analyzed off-line and independently classified. CFM background activity: continuous normal voltage; continuous normal voltage, slightly discontinuous (DNV); burst-suppression (BS); continuous extremely low voltage; flat tracing. CFM epileptiform activity: suspected epileptic activity, single seizure (SS), repetitive seizures (RS), status epilepticus (SE). EEG background activity: normal, depressed, low voltage undifferentiated, excessive discontinuity, BS, no activity. Epileptiform activity: interictal unifocal, interictal multifocal, ictal unifocal, ictal multifocal, SE. Results. A total of 33 traces were suitable for analysis. Interobserver agreement on background activity was reached in 31 cases (kappa=0.92) for CFM and in 27 cases (kappa=0.74) for EEG. There was full agreement on CFM ictal activity (RS, SS, or SE) and EEG ictal activity. A normal CFM (continuous normal voltage) corresponded with a normal or a depressed EEG in 90% of the cases. The positive predictive value for a severely abnormal CFM (BS, continuous extremely low voltage, flat tracing) to correspond with a severely abnormal EEG (excessive discontinuity, BS, low voltage undifferentiated, no activity) was 100% (negative predictive value, 80%; sensitivity, 76%; specificity, 100%). DNV (10) on CFM corresponded either with depressed (6) or excessive discontinuity (4) on EEG. Ictal activity on EEG corresponded with SS, RS, or SE on CFM in 8 cases (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 100%; positive predictive value, 100%; negative predictive value, 92%). Conclusion. CFM is a reliable tool for monitoring both background patterns (especially normal and severely abnormal) and ictal activity. Certain focal, low amplitude, and very short periods of seizure discharges can be missed. We recommend using CFM as a monitoring device and performing intermittent standard EEG whenever there is any doubt about the classification of the CFM (ie, DNV pattern or suspected epileptiform activity).

This study demonstrates the feasibility of, after suitable pre-processing steps, applying identical state-of-the-art pattern recognition method to single-trial classification of brain state data acquired with the fundamentally different techniques EEG and fMRI. We investigated linear and non-linear support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), and it was found that the SVM is highly suitable for the classification of both fMRI and EEG single patterns. However, the non-linear classifiers performed better than the linear ones on the EEG data (linear ANN: 66.2%, SVM: 78.9% vs. non-linear ANN: 71.8%, SVM: 83.2%), whereas the opposite was true for the fMRI dataset (linear ANN: 74.4%, SVM: 77.2% vs. non-linear ANN: 70.5%, SVM: 74.2%). The exciting possibility of concurrent EEG and fMRI registration warrants a need for a unified analysis method for both modalities, and we propose pattern recognition for this purpose. The ability to identify cortical patterns on a single-trial basis allows for brain computer interfaces, lie detection, bio-feedback, the tracking of mental states over time, and in the design of interactive, dynamic fMRI and EEG studies.

Support vector machines (SVM) represents it superior signal classification tool based on pattern recognition. The usefulness of SVM in identifying and differentiating electroencephalographic (EEG) changes that occur between alert and drowsy states wits tested. Twenty human subjects underwent driving simulations with EEG monitoring. Alert EEG was marked by dominant beta activity, while drowsy EEG was marked by alpha dropouts. The duration of eye blinks corresponded well with alertness levels associated with fast and slow eye blinks. Samples of EEG data from both states were used to train the SVM program by using it distinguishing criterion of 4 frequency features across 4 principal frequency bands. The trained SVM program was tested oil unclassified EEG data and subsequently checked for concordance with manual classification. The classification accuracy reached 99.3%. The SVM program was also able to predict the transition from alertness to drowsiness reliably in over 90% of data samples. This study shows that automatic analysis and detection of EEG changes is possible by SVM and SVM is it good candidate for developing pre-emptive automatic drowsiness detection systems for driving safety.

When monitoring a baby, a range of different types of background activity needs to be considered. In this work, we have developed a scheme for automatic classification of background EEG activity in newborn babies. EEG from six full-term babies who were displaying a burst suppression pattern while suffering from the after-effects of asphyxia during birth was included along with EEG from 20 full-term healthy newborn babies. The signals from the healthy babies were divided into four behavioural states: active awake, quiet awake, active sleep and quiet sleep. By using a number of features extracted from the EEG together with Fisher's linear discriminant classifier we have managed to achieve 100% correct classification when separating burst suppression EEG from all four healthy EEG types and 93% true positive classification when separating quiet sleep from the other types. The other three sleep stages could not be classified. When the pathological burst suppression pattern was detected, the analysis was taken one step further and the signal was segmented into burst and suppression, allowing clinically relevant parameters such as suppression length and burst suppression ratio to be calculated. The segmentation of the burst suppression EEG works well, with a probability of error around 4%.

Analysis of EEG data from an experiment in which two syllables are spoken in imagination in one of three rhythms shows that information is present in EEG alpha, beta and theta bands. Envelopes are used to compute filters matched to a particular experimental condition; the filters' action on data from a particular trial lets one determine the experimental condition used for that trial with appreciably greater-than-chance performance.

In this paper, subspace ensembles for classification are explored which constitute an ensemble classifier system by manipulating different feature subspaces. Starting with the nature of ensemble efficacy, we probe into the microcosmic meaning of ensemble diversity, and propose to use region partitioning and region weighting to implement effective subspace ensembles. An improved random subspace method that integrates this mechanism is presented. Individual classifiers possessing eminent performance on a partitioned region reflected by high neighborhood accuracies, are deemed to contribute largely to this region, and are assigned large weights in determining the labels of instances in this area. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method is shown empirically with the base classifier of linear support vector machines on the classification problem of EEG signals.

At the Netherlands Aeromedical Institute, pilot applicants are rejected with a diagnosis of epilepsy or with severe EEG abnormalities (including epileptiform patterns where epilepsy is highly suspected). Although several studies have shown a low incidence of epileptiform EEG abnormalities in candidate pilots, subjects with an epileptiform EEG have a substantially increased risk of sudden incapacitation during their flying careers. In this review, we calculate the probability that a candidate with epileptiform EEG, but no history of epileptic seizures, will develop seizures during his flying career. This probability is about 25%, more than 12 times higher than for subjects with normal EEG and no history of epileptic seizures (2%). Subjects with epileptiform EEGs not only have increased risk of future epileptic seizures, but additionally it is recognized that epileptiform EEG discharges may be associated with episodic functional impairment, which can be a danger when a subject is flying. Taking this into account, one should consider rejecting all candidates with epileptiform EEGs in the future. This is at the expense of a small group of subjects with false-positive EEGs, but we believe that concern for public safety must override other considerations in these rare cases. To improve the understanding of the usefulness of the EEG in pilot screening procedures, an international classification and coding system should be developed, so that data from different countries can be compared.

In practical applications of pattern recognition, there are often diverse features extracted from raw data which needs recognizing. Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction by eigenvector methods and classification using the classifiers trained on the extracted features. The aim of the study is classification of the EEG signals by the combination of eigenvector methods and multiclass SVM. The purpose is to determine an optimum classification scheme for this problem and also to infer clues about the extracted features. The present research demonstrated that the eigenvector methods are the features which well represent the EEG signals and the multiclass SVM trained on these features achieved high classification accuracies.

The present work provides a design for a virtual reality (VR) based BCI system that allows human participants to control a virtual hand to make gestures by P300 signals, with a positive peak of potential about 300 ms posterior to the onset of target stimulus. In this virtual environment, the participants can obtain a more immersed experience with the BCI system, such as controlling a virtual hand or walking around in the virtual world. Methods of modeling the virtual hand and analyzing the P300 signals are also described in detail. Template matching and support vector machine were used as the P300 classifier and the experiment results showed that both algorithms perform well in the system. After a short time of practice, most participants could learn to control the virtual hand during the online experiment with greater than 70% accuracy.

J	Gramfort, A; Keriven, R; Clerc, M				Gramfort, Alexandre; Keriven, Renaud; Clerc, Maureen			Graph-Based Variability Estimation in Single-Trial Event-Related Neural Responses	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalography (EEG); evoked potentials; graph cuts optimization; graph Laplacian; latency estimation; magnetoencephalography (MEG); manifold learning; single-trial analysis	VARIABLE COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EEG; POTENTIALS; LATENCIES; ERPS	Extracting information from multitrial magnetoencephalography or electroencephalography (EEG) recordings is challenging because of the very low SNR, and because of the inherent variability of brain responses. The problem of low SNR is commonly tackled by averaging multiple repetitions of the recordings, also called trials, but the variability of response across trials leads to biased results and limits interpretability. This paper proposes to decode the variability of neural responses by making use of graph representations. Our approach has several advantages compared to other existing methods that process single-trial data: first, it avoids the a priori definition of a model for the waveform of the neural response; second, it does not make use of the average data for parameter estimation; third, it does not suffer from initialization problems by providing solutions that are global optimum of cost functions; and last, it is fast. We proceed in two steps. First, a manifold learning algorithm, based on a graph Laplacian, offers an efficient way of ordering trials with respect to the response variability, under the condition that this variability itself depends on a single parameter. Second, the estimation of the variability is formulated as a combinatorial optimization that can be solved very efficiently using graph cuts. Details and validation of this second step are provided for latency estimation. Performance and robustness experiments are conducted on synthetic data, and results are presented on EEG data from a P300 oddball experiment.

Algorithmic reconstruction of brain activity from MEG and EEG data is referred to as electromagnetic brain imaging (EBI). Reconstructing the actual brain response to external events and distinguishing unrelated brain activity has been a challenge for many existing algorithms in this field. Furthermore, even under conditions where there is very little interference, accurately determining the spatial locations and timing of brain sources from MEG and EEG data is challenging problem because it involves solving for unknown brain activity across thousands of voxels from just a few sensors (similar to 300). In recent years, my research group has developed a suite of novel and powerful algorithms for EBI that we have shown to be considerably superior to existing benchmark algorithms. Specifically, these algorithms can solve for many brain sources, including sources located far from the sensors, in the presence of large interference from unrelated brain sources. Our algorithms efficiently model interference contributions to sensors, accurately estimate sparse brain source activity using fast and robust probabilistic inference techniques. Here, we review some of these algorithms and illustrate their performance in simulations and real MEG/EEG data.

To identify intentional control (IC) commands in the noisy background EEG signal, the proposed SBI uses features extracted from three neurological phenomena-- movement-related potentials as well as changes in the power of Mu and Beta rhythms. To identify the IC commands, for each neurological phenomenon, a multiple classifier system (MCS) is designed. Then a 2(nd) -stage MCS combines the outputs of the individual MCSs and generates the final decision. The HGA selects the optimal subset of features, the optimal parameter values of the classifiers, as well as the best configuration for combining the MCSs. Analysis of the data of four subjects shows an average TP = 56.18%,and an average FP = 0.14%, a significant improvement over our previous SBI design.

Each target is composed of two flickers placed on right-and-left visual fields. The user is expected to concentrate his or her sight on the fixation point which is located in the middle of the two flickers modulated at specific frequencies respectively. Considering the role of optic chiasm, the two frequency components could be extracted from contralateral occipital regions. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was applied to distinguish the electroencephalography (EEG) frequency components from right-and-left visual cortex. The attractive feature of this method is that it would substantially increase the number of targets by a combination of frequencies.

In practical applications of pattern recognition, there are often diverse features extracted from raw data which needs recognizing. Methods of combining multiple classifiers with diverse features are viewed as a general problem in various application areas of pattern recognition. Because of the importance of making the right decision, we are looking for better classification procedures for EEG signals. The mixture of experts (ME) and modified mixture of experts (MME) were tested and benchmarked for their performance on the classification of the studied EEG signals. Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction by eigenvector methods and classification using the classifiers trained on the extracted features. The inputs of these expert systems composed of diverse or composite features were chosen according to the network structures. The present study was conducted with the purpose of answering the question of whether the expert system with diverse features (MME) or composite feature (ME) improve the capability of classification of the EEG signals. Our research demonstrated that the MME trained on diverse features achieved accuracy rates which were higher than that of the ME. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Brain-computer interface for single-trial EEG classification for wrist movement imagery using spatial filtering in the gamma band	IET SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							PATTERNS; REAL	The aim of this study is to discriminate between the left and right wrist movements imagery in four different directions. To achieve this goal, the authors have applied spatial filtering on the EEG signal in the gamma frequency band to extract key features to perform classification. Specifically, the original EEG signal is transformed in to a spatial pattern and applied to the radial basis function (RBF) classifier. The authors demonstrate that spatial filtering method in multichannel EEG effectively extracts discriminant information from single-trial EEG for left and right wrist movement imagery. An average recognition rate of approximately 89% was achieved in all the four type of movements (extension, flexion, pronation and supination) between left and right wrist in five healthy subjects. The results are comparable to the highest rates reported in the literature.	[Khan, Y.

Methods: We selected 13 patients and 7 subjects at risk. Thirteen normal subjects, sex- and age-matched, were also evaluated. Artifact-free epochs were selected and analyzed through Fast-Fourier Transform. EEG background activity was tested using both linear analysis and artificial neural network (ANN) classifier in order to evaluate whether EEG abnormalities were linked to functional changes preceding the onset of the disease. Results: The most important EEG classification pattern was the absolute a power not correlated with cognitive decline. The ANN correctly classified 11/13 patients and 12/13 normals. Moreover, the neural scores for subjects at risk seemed to be correlated to the expected time before the onset of the disease. Conclusions: ANN is a very powerful method to discriminate between normals and patients. It could be used as an automatic diagnostic tool. EEG changes in positive gene-carriers for HD confirm an early functional impairment which should be taken into account in the genetic counseling and in the management of the early stages of the disease.

The proposed approach requires no prior knowledge of reactive frequency bands, their temporal behavior or cortical locations. For a given electrode array, it finds all these parameters by constructing electrode adaptive time-frequency segmentations that are optimized for discrimination. This is accomplished first by segmenting the EEG along the time axis with Local Cosine Packets. Next the most discriminant frequency subbands are selected in each time segment with a frequency axis clustering algorithm to achieve time and frequency band adaptation individually. Finally the subject adapted features are sorted according to their discrimination power to reduce dimensionality and the top subset is used for final classification. We provide experimental results for 5 subjects of the BCI competition 2005 dataset IVa to show the superior performance of the proposed method. In particular, we demonstrate that by using a linear support vector machine as a classifier, the classification accuracy of the proposed algorithm varied between 90.5% and 99.7% and the average classification accuracy was 96%.

First the EEG is segmented in time axis with a merge/divide strategy. This is followed by a clustering procedure in the frequency domain in each selected time segment to choose the most discriminant frequency features. The resulting adaptively selected time-frequency features are processed by principal component analysis - PCA for dimension reduction and fed to a linear discriminant classifier. The algorithm was applied to all nine subjects of the 2002 BCI Competition. The classification performance of our proposed algorithm varied between 70% and 92.6% for each subject, which gives an average classification accuracy of 80.6%. The algorithm outperformed the reference standard Adaptive Autoregressive model based classification procedure for all subjects. This latter approach had an average error rate of %76.3 on the same subjects. We observed that the time-frequency tiling selected by the algorithm for EEG signal classification differs from subject to subject. Furthermore, the two hemispheres of the same subject are represented by distinct time-frequency segmentations and features. We argue that the method can adapt automatically to physio-anatomical differences and subject specific motor imagery patterns.

B.; Wessberg, Johan			Evolutionary optimization of classifiers and features for single-trial EEG Discrimination	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; HAND MOVEMENTS; CLASSIFICATION; POTENTIALS; COMMUNICATION; IMAGINATION	Background: State-of-the-art signal processing methods are known to detect information in single-trial event-related EEG data, a crucial aspect in development of real-time applications such as brain computer interfaces. This paper investigates one such novel approach, evaluating how individual classifier and feature subset tailoring affects classification of single-trial EEG finger movements. The discrete wavelet transform was used to extract signal features that were classified using linear regression and non-linear neural network models, which were trained and architecturally optimized with evolutionary algorithms. The input feature subsets were also allowed to evolve, thus performing feature selection in a wrapper fashion. Filter approaches were implemented as well by limiting the degree of optimization. Results: Using only 10 features and 100 patterns, the non-linear wrapper approach achieved the highest validation classification accuracy (subject mean 75%), closely followed by the linear wrapper method (73.5%). The optimal features differed much between subjects, yet some physiologically plausible patterns were observed. Conclusion: High degrees of classifier parameter, structure and feature subset tailoring on individual levels substantially increase single-trial EEG classification rates, an important consideration in areas where highly accurate detection rates are essential. Also, the presented method provides insight into the spatial characteristics of finger movement EEG patterns.

The P300 models are first learned using a pool of existing subjects and Fisher linear discriminant, and then autonomously adapted to the unlabeled data of a new subject using an unsupervised machine learning technique. In data analysis, we apply this technique to a set of EEG data of 10 subjects performing word spelling in an oddball paradigm. The results are very positive: the adapted models with unlabeled data yield virtually the same classification accuracy as the conventional methods with labeled data. Therefore, it proves the feasibility of P300-based BCIs which can be applied directly to a new subject without training sessions.

In this paper, we report on results of developing a method to classify wrist movements using EEG signals recorded from a subject whilst controlling a joystick and moving it in different directions. Such method could be potentially useful in building brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) where a paralysed person could communicate with a wheelchair and steer it to the desired direction using only EEG signals. Our method is based on extracting salient spatio-temporal features from the EEG signals using continuous wavelet transform. We perform principal component analysis on these features as means to assess their usefulness for classification and to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. We use the results from the PCA as means to represent the different directions. We use a simple technique based on euclidean distance to classify, the data. The classification results show that we are able to discriminate between different directions using the selected features.

Lapalacian electroencephalogram (EEG) has been shown to improve classification in EEG recognition. In this work, the effectiveness of signals from tripolar concentric electrodes and disc electrodes were compared for use as a BCI. Two sets of left/right hand motor imagery EEG signals were acquired. An autoregressive (AR) model was developed for feature extraction with a Mahalanobis distance based linear classifier for classification. An exhaust selection algorithm was employed to analyze three factors before feature extraction. The factors analyzed were 1) length of data in each trial to be used, 2) start position of data, and 3) the order of the AR model. The results showed that tripolar concentric electrodes generated significantly higher classification accuracy than disc electrodes.

A new approach for the pattern recognition of four complicated hand activities based on EEG is presented in this paper, in which each piece of raw data sequence for EEG signal is decomposed by wavelet transform (WT) to form a matrix, and the singular value of the matrix is extracted by singular value decomposition (SVD). And then the singular value, as the feature vector, is input to the artificial neural network (ANN) to discriminate the four hand activities including grasping a football, a small bar, a cylinder and a hard paper. Finally the research results show the correct classification rate of 89% was achieved by the approach mentioned above.

An important task in an EEG-based BCI system is to analyze EEG patterns. EEG data is a multivariate time series, so hidden Markov model (HMM) might be a good choice for classification. However EEG is very noisy data and contains artifacts, thus the extraction of features that are robust to noise and artifacts is important. In this paper we present a method which employ both independent component analysis (ICA) and oriented principal component analysis (OPCA) for artifact-robust feature extraction. The high performance of our method is confirmed by experimental study on classifying EEG into 4 categories which consist of left/right/up/down movements during imagination.

The main reason for their relative poor performance resides in their assumption of stationarity of the EEG. To remedy this problem, we use time-frequency distributions (TFD) to analyse and characterise the newborn EEG seizure patterns as a first step toward a time-frequency (TF) based seizure detection and classification scheme. This paper presents the results of the analysis of these time-frequency patterns for two abnormal newborn EEGs. We demonstrate that the newborn EEG seizures are well described by a class of mono- and multi-component linear FM signals. This result is novel and contradicts the simplistic assumptions routinely made in the field.

People were tested using CT, MRI and also EEG. The above-mentioned tests were used for a priori patients' diagnosis information. People, having epilepsy, also had some visual perception abnormalities. Epileptic persons were tested using special computerized size form discrimination test. Special machine learning (ML) techniques were used for testing data processing and creation of regularities. In parallel, special auto-regressive (AR) methods were used as well. It could be stated that special ML techniques worked better than AR methods 70 percent of tested persons were classified correctly by Using ML in comparison with AR methods (where only 30 persons were classified correctly). ML analysis could be used in preliminary epilepsy diagnosis for the patients having unknown brain damage. Our machine learning subsystem was capable of extracting interesting dependencies that related VP test results to person's diagnosis. Even if induced rules show near perfect accuracy on the learning set examples additional data and experiences are required for being able to conclude that machine generated rule sets ate appropriate for computer aided diagnosing based on VP test. We have realized, that it is useful to combine both visual perception testing data and EEG processing methods. CHARADE and LPC gave the best classification results. The sensitivity for the classified data was about 89 percent. Only 11 percent of given samples were misclassified. The results show, that visual perception factor (size and discrimination) could be used for early epilepsy detection stage.

Characteristic EEG spatial patterns make MI tasks substantially discriminable. Multi-channel EEGs are usually necessary for spatial pattern identification and therefore MI-based BCI is still in the stage of laboratory demonstration, to some extent, due to the need for constantly troublesome recording preparation. This paper presents a method for channel reduction in NH-based BCI. Common spatial pattern (CSP) method was employed to analyze spatial patterns of imagined hand and foot movements. Significant channels were selected by searching the maximums of spatial pattern vectors in scalp mappings. A classification algorithm was developed by means of combining linear discriminant analysis towards event-related desynchronization (ERD) and readiness potential (R-P). The classification accuracies with four optimal channels were 93.45% and 91.88% for two subjects.

Using both statistical analysis and Gaussian discriminative modelling approaches, this paper presents a pilot study of assessing the cross-correlation between EEG frequency bands and heart rate variability (HRV) in normal and sleep apnoea clinical patients. For the study we used EEG (delta, theta, alpha, sigma and beta) and HRV (LFnu, HFnu and LF/HF) features from the spectral analysis. The statistical analysis in different sleep stages highlighted that in sleep apnoea patients, the EEG delta, sigma and beta bands exhibited a strong correlation with HRV features. Then the correlation between EEG frequency bands and HRV features were examined for sleep apnoea classification using univariate and multivariate Gaussian models (UGs and MGs). The MG outperformed the UG in the classification. When EEG and HRV features were combined and modelled with MG, we achieved 64% correct classification accuracy, which is 2 or 8% improvement with respect to using only EEG or ECG features. When delta and acceleration coefficients of the EEG features were incorporated, then the overall accuracy improved to 71%.

It was based on wavelet packet decomposition (WPD). The energy of special sub-bands and corresponding coefficients of wavelet packet decomposition were selected as features which have maximal separability according to the Fisher distance criterion. The eigenvector was obtained for classification by combining the effective features from different channels; its performance was evaluated by separability and pattern recognition accuracy using the datasets of BCI 2003 Competition. The classification results have proved the effectiveness of the proposed method. This technology provides another useful way to EEG feature extraction in BCIs. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Performance of ELM was analyzed in terms of training time and classification accuracy. The results showed that some processes such as class code prefix, redundancy code suffix and smoothing effect of the classifiers' outputs could improve the accuracy of classification of robot control commands for a brain-machine interface system.

The artifacts may contain eye-blinking, muscle noise, heart signal, line noise, and environmental effect. Such noises often make the raw EEG signals not very useful for extraction/identification of physiological phenomena from EEG. The independent component analysis (ICA) is a popular technique for artifact removal in brain research and some reports demonstrate that ICA can remove the artifacts with lower (acceptable) loss of information. But, these reports select useful independent components manually, primarily by looking at the scalp-plots. This is of great inconvenience and is a barrier for BCI or real-time applications of EEG. In this paper, we demonstrate that machine learning methods could be quite effective to discriminate useful independent components from artifacts and our findings suggests the possibility of developing a 'universal" machine for artifact removal in EEG.

In this paper, we propose a scheme for feature selection using linear independent component analysis and mutual information maximization method. The method is theoretically motivated by the fact that the classification error rate is related to the mutual information between the feature vectors and the class labels. The feasibility of the principle is illustrated on a synthetic dataset and its performance is demonstrated using EEG signal classification. Experimental results show that this method works well for feature selection.

The selected nonlinear features are generalized synchronizations known as synchronization likelihoods (SL), both among all electrodes and among electrode pairs. The methodology consists of three parts: first detecting the more synchronized loci (group 1) and loci with more discriminative deficit connections (group 2). Using SLs among all electrodes, discriminative SLs in certain sub-bands are extracted. In part two, SLs are computed, not among all electrodes, but between loci of group 1 and loci of group 2 in all sub-bands and the band-limited EEG. This part leads to more accurate detection of deficit connections, and not just deficit areas, but more discriminative SLs in sub-bands with finer resolutions. In part three, a classification technique, radial basis function neural network, is used to distinguish ADHD from normal subjects. The methodology was applied to EEG data obtained from 47 ADHD and 7 control individuals with eyes closed. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network classifier yielded a high accuracy of 95.6% for diagnosis of the ADHD in the feature space discovered in this research with a variance of 0.7%.

Though such a multi-modal acquisition is attractive given that it can exploit the temporal resolution of EEG and spatial resolution of fMRI, it comes with unique signal processing and pattern classification challenges. In this paper I will review some our work at developing signal processing and pattern recognition for analysis of simultaneous EEG and fMRI, with a focus on those algorithms enabling a single-trial analysis of the neural signal. In general, these algorithms exploit the multivariate nature of the EEG, removing MR induced artifacts and classifying event-related signals that then can be correlated with the BOLD signal to yield specific fMRI activations.

Noisy EEG can be received on some abnormal state of brain activities. These signals can be logged in data sheets and the samples are taken to identify the rare events. The sampling technique here we used is SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of "normal" patterns with only a small percentage of "abnormal" or "interesting" patterns. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) pattern as a normal pattern is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class.	[Deepa, V.

Most research to date using hybrid systems (Fuzzy-Neuro) focused on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Here we focus on MLP network as an optimizer for classification of epilepsy risk levels obtained from the fuzzy techniques using the EEG signal parameters. The obtained risk level patterns from fuzzy techniques are found to have low values of Performance Index (PI) and Quality Value (QV). The neural networks are trained and tested with 480 patterns extracted from three epochs of sixteen channel EEG signals of ten known epilepsy patients. Different architectures of MLP network was compared based on the minimum Mean Square Error (MSE), the better MLP network (2-4-2) were selected. The MLP network out performs the fuzzy techniques with high Quality Value (QV) of 25 when compared to low QV of 6.25.

This article presents an integrated hardware and software solution for acquisition and real-time analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) to monitor indexes of alertness, cognition, and memory. Three experimental paradigms were evaluated in a total of 45 participants to identify EEG indexes associated with changes in cognitive workload: the Warship Commander Task (WCT), a simulated navy command and control environment that allowed workload levels to be systematically manipulated; a cognitive task with three levels of difficulty and consistent sensory inputs and motor outputs; and a multisession. image learning and reccognition memory test. Across tasks and participants, specific changes in the EEG were identified that were reliably associated with levels of cognitive workload. The EEG indexes were also shown to change as a function of training on the WCT and the learning and memory task. Future applications of the system to augment cognition in military and industrial environments are discussed.

In this study, four mental states have been identified and decoded from the electrocorticograms (ECoGs) of six epileptic patients, engaged in a memory reach task. A novel signal analysis technique has been applied to high-dimensional, statistically sparse ECoGs recorded by a large number of electrodes. The strength of the proposed technique lies in its ability to jointly extract spatial and temporal patterns, responsible for encoding mental state differences. As such, the technique offers a systematic way of analyzing the spatiotemporal aspects of brain information processing and may be applicable to a wide range of spatiotemporal neurophysiological signals.

Neurophysiologic studies help confirm clinical diagnosis and classification, and understand underlying physiological mechanisms. The neurophysiologic classification of myoclonus is mainly based on surface EMG (individual EMG patterns, muscle spatial distribution and time sequence of muscle activation), EEG, EEG/EMG relationships (jerk-locked back-averaging, corticomuscular coherence), somatosensory evoked potentials, and long-loop reflexes. Paired stimulation evoked response/long loop reflex and jerk-locked evoked responses evaluate the excitability changes of the primary somatosensory cortex. Transcranial magnetic stimulation can evaluate the excitability state of the primary motor cortex. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Automatic Identification and Removal of Artifacts in EEG Using a Probabilistic Multi-class SVM Approach With Error Correction	2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN AND CYBERNETICS (SMC), VOLS 1-6	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on System, Man, and Cybernetic	OCT 12-15, 2008	Singapore, SINGAPORE	IEEE		Artifact removal; electroencephalogram; support vector machine; error correction	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION	A novel electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact removal method is presented in this paper. The proposed method combines a probabilistic multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) and an error correction algorithm for component classification, where i) the probabilistic multi-class SVM is modified to properly handle the unbalanced nature of component classification and ii) the error correction algorithm is used to accommodate the structural information of the learning problem. The proposed component classifier was tested on real-life EEG data and it significantly outperformed the standard SVM used in the literature. A qualitative evaluation on the reconstructed EEG shows that the proposed artifact removal method greatly reduced the amount of artifacts while well preserving brain activities in almost all EEG epochs.

Methods: EEGs were recorded from 8 X 8 high-density arrays fixed on primary sensory cortices of rabbits trained to discriminate CS with reinforcement (CS +) from those without (CS -). EEG frames were located with a pragmatic information index, H,. The spatial patterns of the first 3 frames on each of 37-40 trials were measured by the square of 64 analytic amplitudes from the Hilbert transform to give points in 64-space. The questions were asked: Did the frames from CS + trials and CS - trials differ within each sequential group? Did the 3 frames differ from each other (form 3 clusters of points)? Results: EEG frames that were identified by high H, had AM patterns that could be classified with respect to CS + and CS - well above chance levels. Two stages of correct frame classification occurred on each trial: 40-130 ms after CS onset with a gamma carrier frequency, and 450-550 ms with a beta carrier frequency. Peak power in the beta frames was double that in gamma frames, and mean pattern surface area of beta frames was nearly 4-fold greater. Conclusions: Under the impact of a CS on a sensory neocortex, the background EEG activity reorganized in sequential frames of coordinated activity, first local and modality-specific, thereafter global. Significance: The size, texture and duration of these AM patterns indicate that spatial patterns of human beta frames may be accessible with high-density scalp arrays for correlation with phenomenological reports by human subjects.

Regularized Common Spatial Pattern With Aggregation for EEG Classification in Small-Sample Setting	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Aggregation; brain-computer interface (BCI); common spatial pattern (CSP); electroencephalogram (EEG); generic learning; regularization; small sample	DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; MOTOR IMAGERY	Common spatial pattern (CSP) is a popular algorithm for classifying electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in the context of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). This paper presents a regularization and aggregation technique for CSP in a small-sample setting (SSS). Conventional CSP is based on a sample-based covariance-matrix estimation. Hence, its performance in EEG classification deteriorates if the number of training samples is small. To address this concern, a regularized CSP (R-CSP) algorithm is proposed, where the covariance-matrix estimation is regularized by two parameters to lower the estimation variance while reducing the estimation bias. To tackle the problem of regularization parameter determination, R-CSP with aggregation (R-CSP-A) is further proposed, where a number of R-CSPs are aggregated to give an ensemble-based solution. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on data set IVa of BCI Competition III against four other competing algorithms. Experiments show that R-CSP-A significantly outperforms the other methods in average classification performance in three sets of experiments across various testing scenarios, with particular superiority in SSS.

We adopt a patient-specific approach to exploit the consistency of an individual patient's seizure and non-seizure EEG. Our method uses a wavelet decomposition to construct a feature vector that captures the morphology and spatial distribution of an EEG epoch, and then determines whether that vector is representative of a patient's seizure or non-seizure EEG using the support-vector machine classification algorithm. Our completely automated method was tested on non-invasive EEG from thirty-six pediatric subjects suffering from a variety of seizure types. It detected 131 of 139 seizure events within 8.0 +/- 3.2 seconds following electrographic onset, and declared 15 false-detections in 60 hours of clinical EEG. Our patient-specific method can be used to initiate delay-sensitive clinical procedures following seizure onset; for example, the injection of an imaging radiopharmaceutical or stimulation of the vagus nerve.

Three subjects performed four motor-imagery (left hand, right hand, foot, and tongue.) and one mental-calculation task. Classification of the electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns is based on band power estimates and hidden Markov models (HMMs). We propose a method that combines the EEG patterns based on separability into subsets A two, three, four, and live mental tasks. The information transfer rates of the BCI systems comprised of these subsets are reported. The achieved information transfer rates vary from 0.42 to 0.81 bits per trial and reveal that the upper limit of different mental tasks for a BCI system is three. In each subject, different combinations of three tasks resulted in the best performance.

Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction using the wavelet transform (V T) and the ANFIS trained with the backpropagation gradient descent method in combination with the least squares method. Five types of EEG signals were used as input patterns of the five ANFIS classifiers. To improve diagnostic accuracy, the sixth ANFIS classifier (combining ANFIS) was trained using the outputs of the five ANFIS classifiers as input data. The proposed ANFIS model combined the neural network adaptive capabilities and the fuzzy logic qualitative approach. Some conclusions concerning the saliency of features on classification of the EEG signals were obtained through analysis of the ANFIS. The performance of the ANFIS model was evaluated in terms of training performance and classification accuracies and the results confirmed that the proposed ANFIS model has potential in classifying the EEG signals.

Methods: Temporal and spatial development of EEG patterns in 4 patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and 2 patients with iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease due to implantation of contaminated brain depth electrodes were investigated. A total of 56 EEGs were analyzed, over time spans ranging from 1272 to 3 days prior to death. Results: Frontal intermittent rhythmical delta activity (FIRDA) was seen at early timepoints in 4/6 patients and might represent an early EEG pattern that is associated, with human prion diseases. EEG patterns associated with CJD are sensitive to midazolam. Initial EEG changes were seen at the site of prion exposure in iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease patients, before they could be observed at distant sites, suggesting that prion disease was initiated at the site of prion exposure. Conclusions: Serial EEG recordings are a valuable tool not only in the early diagnosis of sporadic CID, but also in the determination of prion exposure in iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Significance: FIRDA occur at an early stage of CID and are progressively replaced by the classical PSWC. The EEG patterns of CJD are sensitive to midazolam. The initial EEG changes in iatrogenic CID are seen at the site of prion exposure. (C) 2004 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Four feature types were extracted for each channel following optimized filtering of the signals. The potential performance of each feature and channel for use in the classification of the EEG signals was analyzed by estimating the relative class overlap using a first order histogram approach. The best feature/channel configurations contained channels both that were close and far from motor areas. While the scope and depth of the study was very limited, the results do suggest more attention should be paid to non-motor areas when investigating movement related EEG.

The discrimination between thinking modalities of concept activation and pattern comparison for single tasks of elementary comparison procedures is investigated. A neural network classifier with backpropagation learning algorithm is used. The input vector is constructed by parameters of instantaneous coherence (13-20 Hz) between several channel pairs of the EEG and / or of the MEG. Thereby, the strength of synchronization and the time location of synchronization phenomena are taken into consideration.

Generally, results reached by neural network classifier show a better generalization than linear discriminant analysis.

Methods: Twelve naive subjects performed self-paced movements consisting of three key strokes with either hand. EEG was recorded from 128 channels. The exploration was performed offline on single trial EEG data. We proposed that a successful computational procedure for classification would consist of spatial filtering, temporal filtering, feature selection, and pattern classification. A systematic investigation was performed with combinations of spatial filtering using principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), common spatial patterns analysis (CSP), and surface Laplacian derivation (SLD); temporal filtering using power spectral density estimation (PSD) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT); pattern classification using linear Mahalanobis distance classifier (LMD), quadratic Mahalanobis distance classifier (QMD), Bayesian classifier (BSC), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and support vector machine (SVM). A robust multivariate feature selection strategy using a genetic algorithm was employed. Results: The combinations of spatial filtering using ICA and SLD, temporal filtering using PSD and DWT, and classification methods using LMD, QMD, BSC and SVM provided higher performance than those of other combinations. Utilizing one of the better combinations of ICA, PSD and SVM, the discrimination accuracy was as high as 75%. Further feature analysis showed that beta band EEG activity of the channels over right sensorimotor cortex was most appropriate for discrimination of right and left hand movement intention. Conclusions: Effective combinations of computational methods provide possible classification of human movement intention from single trial EEG. Such a method could be the basis for a potential brain-computer interface based on human natural movement, which might reduce the requirement of long-term training. Significance: Effective combinations of computational methods can classify human movement intention from single trial EEG with reasonable accuracy. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We propose a new framework of feature extractions using common spatial frequency patterns (CSFP) for classification of motor imagery EEG. The aim of our BCI system is to provide an on-line "hit rat" game control with short response time and subject-specific adaptation of system parameters. Our BCI system is able to detect three different motor imagery-related brain patterns (imagination of limb movements: left hand, right hand and both feet) from the ongoing brain activity by using only five EEG channels. The best hit accuracy of the game with fast response time attained by subject 2 is about 73%, which demonstrates that our BCI system has the ability of providing much fast BCI of even 1 s per command.

Most studies have divided recordings into benign and malignant; however, some patterns within these groups may have greater prognostic significance than such broad classifications. We sought to explore reactivity, with broad classifications and subclassifications for their prognostic significance. Methods: All consecutive adults in coma who had an EEG recording performed at least 1 day after CA or during normothermia after a 24-hour mild hypothermia protocol. Outcomes were dichotomous: recovery of awareness or no recovery of awareness during hospitalization. Results: Twenty-nine patients met the inclusion criteria. Of the 18 patients with no reactivity, only I recovered awareness; of the 11 patients who demonstrated reactivity, 10 recovered awareness (sensitivity of 90% [95% confidence interval, or CI, 0.57-1] and specificity of 94% [95% CI, 0.7-1]). Of those with benign patterns, 7 recovered awareness and 1 did not; however, those patients demonstrating malignant patterns, 4 recovered and 17 did not (sensitivity of 94% [95% CI, 0.7-1] and a specificity of 63% [95% CI, 0.32-0.88]). None of the 15 patients with suppression or generalized spikes recovered consciousness, and none of these patients demonstrated reactivity. Conclusions: Electroencephalogram reactivity after CA is a relatively favorable EEG feature; generalized suppression or generalized epileptiform activity, without reactivity, is associated with lack of recovery of awareness.

Techniques of this type are an important component of a number of emerging technologies. These include the use of dense sensor arrays for condition monitoring, brain-computer interfaces for communications and control, the detection of moving pedestrians from sequences of images and the study of cognitive function using high-resolution electroencephalography (EEG). We propose a novel approach to problems of this type using the parameters of an underlying functional auto-regression model. We compare the performance of this approach using two contrasting data sets. The first is based on simulated series with different characteristics and sampling schemes and a second based on high-dimensional times series generated by multi-channel EEG. Both experiments show that our approach outperforms conventional time series methods by exploiting low-intrinsic dimensionality (smoothness). In addition, our simulation experiments show that good performance can be maintained for data generated by non-stationary sampling schemes, the latter causing large reductions in the performance of conventional procedures. These experiments suggest that meaningful information can be extracted from high-resolution EEG. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Not only it leads to brain defects but also associated cognitive, emotional, and behavioral impairments. It can be detected by analyzing EEG signals. In this research, the power spectrum of the Haar mother wavelet is extracted as features. Then the principle component analysis is applied for dimension reduction of the feature vectors. Finally support vectors machine and neural networks are used for classification. The simulation results show that our proposed method achieves better classification accuracy than the other methods.

The methods are: (1) discriminant stepwise, and (2) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) joint method. Both methods use Fisher's LDA approach, but differ in the data dimensionality reduction procedure. Data were recorded from 3 male subjects 20-30 years old. Three runs per subject took place. The classification methods were tested in 240 trials per subject after merging all runs for the same subject. The mental tasks performed were feet, tongue, left hand and right hand movement imagery. In order to avoid previous assumptions on preferable channel locations and frequency ranges, 105 (21 electrodesx5 frequency ranges) electroencephalogram (EEG) features were extracted from the data. The best performance for each classification method was taken into account. The discriminant stepwise method showed better performance than the PCA based method. The classification error by the stepwise method varied between 31.73% and 38.5% for all subjects whereas the error range using the PCA based method was 39.42% to 54%.	[Dias, N.

To simplify the work of a physician, that must visually evaluate long recordings, we present a method for automatic processing of EEG based on learning classifier. This method supports the automatic search of long-term EEG recording and detection of graphoelements - signal parts with characteristic shape and defined diagnostic value. Traditional methods of detection show great percent of error caused by the great variety of non-stationary EEG. The idea of this method is to break down the signal into stationary sections called segments using adaptive segmentation and create a set of normalized discriminative features representing segments. The groups of similar patterns of graphoelements form classes used for the learning of a classifier. Weighted features are used for classification performed by modified learning classifier fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbours. Results of classification describe classes of unknown segments. The implementation of this method was experimentally verified on a real EEG with the diagnosis of epilepsy.

A linear feature space for simultaneous learning of spatio-spectral filters in BCI	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Brain computer interfaces; Kernel methods; Spatial filtering; Spectral filtering; Event-related-desynchronisation	EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION	It is shown how two of the most common types of feature mapping used for classification of single trial Electroencephalography (EEG). i.e. spatial and frequency filtering. can be equivalently performed as linear operations in the space of frequency-specific detector covariance tensors Thus by first mapping the data to this space, a simple linear classifier can directly learn optimal spatial + frequency filters. Significantly. if the classifier's loss function is convex, learning these filters is a convex minimisation problem. It is also shown how to pie-process the data such that the resulting decision function is robust to the biases inherent in EEG data. Further, based upon ideas from Max Margin Matrix Factorisation, it is shown how the trace norm can be used to select Solutions which have low rank.

The results are fed to a time delay neural network (TDNN) for classification of each mental task. Based on the results of the test sets, we analyzed the effectiveness of ICA and MP methods for use in EEG preprocessing and TDNN classification. It is shown that ICA is more effective than MP in lowering the neural network classification error; however this advantage is not significant.

The EEGs are decomposed into a series of frequency bands, and the instantaneous power is represented by the envelop of oscillatory activity, which formed the spatial patterns for a given electrode montage at a time-frequency grid. Time-frequency weights determined by training process were used to synthesize the contributions at the time-frequency domains. The overall classification accuracies for three selected human subjects performing left or right hand movement imagery tasks, were about 87 percent in the ten-fold cross validation without rejecting trials. The loci of motor imagery activity were shown in the spatial topography of differential mode patterns over the sensorimotor area. The present method promises to provide a useful alternative as a general purpose classification procedure for motor imagery classification.

The area is innovative and under active research as a subset of Human Computer Interaction. Brain Computer Interfacing typically utilize Electroencephalogram (EEG) data to apply machine learning and or computational intelligence techniques to trigger actions. Electroencephalogram data is a multivariate time series data whose visualization suffers from problems like cluster overlapping and high dimensionality. In this paper we present a natural alternative to visualization i.e. sonification. Thus combining the two novel area of research to explore and get better results over the conventional approaches. Sonification is the use of non-speech audio to convey information. We have presented a technique to sonify alpha, beta and gamma bands present in the Electroncephalogram data.

SVM are based on the Vapnik's Statistical Learning Theory, and successively extended by a number of researchers. On the order hand, the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal captures the electrical activity of the brain and is an important source of information for studying neurological disorders. In order to extract relevant information of EEG signal, a variety of computerized-analysis methods have been developed. Recent studies indicate that methods based on the nonlinear dynamics theory can extract valuable information from neuronal dynamics. However, many these of methods need large amount of data and are computationally expensive. From chaos theory, a global value that is relatively simple to compute is the fractal dimension (FD), it can be used to measure the geometrical complexity of a time series. The FD of a waveform represents a powerful tool for transient detection. In analysis of EEG this feature can been used to identify and distinguish specific states of physiologic function. A variety of algorithms are available for the computation of FD. In this work, we employ SVM to classify the EEG signals from healthy subjects and epileptic subjects using as the features vector the FD. From the experimental results, we can see that classification based on SVM with FD perform well in EEG signals classification, which indicates this classification method is valid and has promising application.

For the data selection we use temporal lobe seizures for evaluation recorded from patients during 84 hours at hospital. In feature extraction stage we use best basis mother wavelet functions and wavelet thresholding technique. In classification stage we implement multi layer perceptron neural networks according to standard backpropogation algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency of our wavelet based feature extraction method on data to improve the ANN classification performance.

It was shown that approximately 50% of spectral pattern (SP) types occur not more than 2-3 times per 149 analysis epochs in a 1-min EEG. The remaining 50% of SP types were the same for the different EEG channels, in all subjects and various brain functional states. Additionally, a high incidence of the neighboring SP types in strongly overlapping (by 80%) 2-s analysis epochs of the EEG was shown. The SP identified in a given epoch has only a limited predictive value on the SPs identified in the subsequent epochs. The incidence effect was restricted by the limited SP set and by a 50% reduction in the functionally active SPs, which resulted in a temporary stabilization of SPs in sequential combinations. The parameters of temporary stabilization of SPs were significantly different from 'random' EEG which provides evidence of the non-occasional character of stabilization of the main dynamic parameters of neuronal activity. Thus, the findings suggest that the multi-variability of neuronal nets is discrete in time, and limited by the dynamics of the short quasi-stable brain states. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Pupil responses are proposed as a complementary modality that can support improved accuracy of single-trial signal analysis. We develop a pupillary response feature-extraction and -selection procedure that helps to improve the classification performance of a system based only on EEG signal analysis. We apply a two-level linear classifier to obtain cognitive-task-related analysis of EEG and pupil responses. The classification results based on the two modalities are then fused at the decision level. Here, the goal is to support increased classification confidence through the inherent modality complementarities. The fusion results show significant improvement over classification performance based on a single modality.

Methods currently used to detect EEG seizures in adults show high false detection rates in neonates because they lack information about specific age-dependent features of normal and pathological EEG and artifacts. This paper describes a novel multistage knowledge-based seizure detection system for newborn infants to identify and classify normal and pathological newborn EEGs as well as seizures with a reduced false detection rate. Methods: We developed the system in a way to make comprehensive use of spatial and temporal contextual information obtained from multichannel EEGs. The system development consists of six major stages: (i) EEG data collection and bandpass filtering; (ii) automatic artifact detection; (iii) feature extraction from segments of non-seizure and seizure activities; (iv) feature selection via the relevance and redundancy analysis; (v) EEG classification and pattern recognition using a trained multilayer back-propagation neural network; and (v) knowledge-based decision-making to examine each of possible EEG patterns from a multi-channel perspective. The system was developed and tested with the EEG recordings of 10 newborns aged between 39 and 42 weeks. Results: The overall sensitivity, selectivity, and average detection rate of the system were 74%, 70.1%, and 79.7%, respectively. The average false detection of 1.55/h was also achieved by the system with a feature reduction up to 80%. Conclusions: The expert rule-based decision-making subsystem accompanying the classifier helped to reduce the false detection rate, reject a wide variety of artifacts, and discriminate various patterns of EEG. Significance: This paper may serve as a guide for the selection of discriminative features to improve the accuracy of conventional seizure detection systems for routine clinical EEG interpretation and brain activity monitoring in newborns especially those hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care units.

The current trend on sleep analysis focuses on its dynamic organization described in the Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) paradigm. This paradigm looks to the EEG microstructure, gives attention to the short duration EEG phenomena instead of the traditional global view of fixed epochs of 20 or 30 seconds, heralded by the Rechtschaffen and Kales (R&K) classification. The CAP paradigm not only cares about the short duration events but also models its periodic activity, providing thus, important information on EEG synchrony modulation in the sleep process. These periodic activities are characterized by repeated spontaneous and or evoked EEG Activations or transient responses (A phases), at intervals up to one minute emerged from the Background activity (B phases). In a previous work we proposed an automatic detector and classifier of A phases in sleep EEG, where wavelet transforms is used to analyze the sleep EEG signal in the time-frequency domain, in order to separate the signal power in different and physiologically relevant frequency bands. The CAP A phases characteristics described in the classification Atlas is used in the design of the structure and the starting set of parameters of the detector and classifier. The objective of this work is to use genetic algorithm to tune the parameters of the detector and classifier. Excerpts of all night sleep recordings of a group of volunteers are used in the tuning and testing. Results are compared with visual and other automatic classification.

Activation in patients with malformations of cortical development (MCD) has been variable, likely due to the heterogeneity of the disorder. We examined clinical, electroencephalography (EEG), neuropsychological, and functional MRI findings in a patient with intractable epilepsy secondary to MCD in the left temporal cortex. Invasive EEG monitoring revealed that the dysplastic tissue was not involved in ictal onset of seizures. Functional MRI tests of motion and object processing, memory encoding, and language demonstrated no activation within dysplastic tissue. Hemispheric asymmetries in activation for motion and object processing were evident, favoring the right hemisphere-a pattern not evident in controls. These weaker activations in the patient were present in tissue proximal to the seizure focus. Thus, nonepileptogenic dysplastic tissue may not support cognitive functions, with abnormal processing evident in epileptogenic tissue. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Inc.

The methodology is based on the segmentation of the time-frequency plane in regions with relatively homogeneous synchronization patterns, which is performed by means of a seeded region-growing algorithm, and a Bayesian regularization procedure. We have implemented these methods in an interactive application for the study of cognitive experiments, although some of the techniques discussed in this work can also be applied to other multidimensional data sets.

Previous animal and human EEG measurements indicated the presence of jumps in the spatio-temporal EEG patterns, which are relevant to cognitive processing. The present work introduces the KIV model to simulate phase transitions in EEG signals. Phase transitions have nonstationary and intermittent characteristics, which make automated detection a very difficult task. We analyze the simulated EEG signals using various statistical methods. We describe various classification methods to identify simulated phase transitions, which will be used to automate the detection process in actual EEG signals.

We consider the pattern recognition as equivalent to EEG visual analysis and advance the template matching approach to the identification of the complexes in the signal. New type of epileptiform oscillation's complexes' template consists of generic complex and parameters of its deformations. The methodology of constructing these templates is proposed. Direct applicabilty of the proposed template creating methodology to adaptive classification of EEG complexes is highlighted. The performance of the template is evaluated with simulated and real EEG data. Experimental application of the template resulted in correct identification of 62 of 81 epileptiform oscillation's complexes from the sample signals with moderated number of false positive identifications.

To increase information transfer speed, it is necessary to put emphasis on the research of multi-task BCIs. This paper proposes a new algorithm for classifying single-trial motor imagery EEG data in a three-task BCI. Wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and common spatial pattern (CSP) are respectively applied to lowpass (0-64Hz) and bandpass (8-30Hz) filtered data to extract discriminative features. The two feature vectors are reduced to two dimensions by Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) that is followed by a support vector machine (SVM) for classification. The algorithm was applied to three datasets recorded during BCI experiments of three-class motor imagery tasks. The classification accuracies for these three datasets range from 95.6% to 88.1% and their mean is 90.6%. The results verify the feasibility and validity of the algorithm.

Such classifiers used the diagonal and full covariance matrix of EEG spectral features extracted from EEG data. Such data were recorded from a group of 8 healthy subjects with 4 electrodes, placed in C3, P3, C4, P4 position of the international 10-20 system. Mahalanobis distance classifiers based on the use of full covariance matrix are able to detect EEG activity related to imagination of movement with affordable accuracy (average score 98%). Reported average recognition data were obtained by using the cross-validation of the EEG recordings for each subject. Such results open the avenue for the use of Mahalanobis-based classifiers in a brain computer interface context, in which the use of a reduced set of recording electrodes is an important issue.

In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate classification method for cursor movement imagery EEG data. A two-dimensional feature vector is obtained from coefficients of the second order polynomial applied to signals of only one channel. Then, the features are classified by using the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm. We obtained significant improvement for the speed and accuracy of the classification for data set la, which is a typical representative of one kind of BCI competition 2003 data. Compared with the Multiple Layer Perceptron (MLP) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms, the k-NN algorithm not only provides better classification accuracy but also needs less training and testing times.

Here the hypothesis was tested that similar patterns could be found in the scalp EEG human subjects trained to discriminate simultaneous visual-auditory CS. Signals were continuously recorded from 64 equispaced scalp electrodes and band-pass filtered. The Hilbert transform gave the analytic phase, which segmented the EEG into temporal frames, and the analytic amplitude, which expressed the pattern in each frame as a feature vector. Methods applied to the ECoG were adapted to the EEG for systematic search of the beta-gamma spectrum, the time period after CS onset, and the scalp surface to locate patterns that could be classified with respect to type of CS. Spatial patterns of EEG amplitude modulation were found from all subjects that could be classified with respect to stimulus combination type significantly above chance levels. The patterns were found in the beta range (15-22 Hz) but not in the gamma range. They occurred in three short bursts following CS onset. They were non-local, occupying the entire array. Our results suggest that the scalp EEG can yield information about the timing of episodically synchronized brain activity in higher cognitive function, so that future studies in brain-computer interfacing can be better focused. Our methods may be most valuable for analyzing data from dense arrays with very high spatial and temporal sampling rates. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The advantages of this measure such as its fast calculation and robustness with respect to additive noise make it suitable for biomedical signal analysis. In this paper the ability of PE for characterizing the normal and epileptic EEG signals is investigated. Classification is performed using discriminant analysis. The effect of additive Gaussian noise on the discrimination performance is also studied and some parameters derived from PE are suggested to improve the classification accuracy when the signal is contaminated with noise. The results indicate that the proposed measures can distinguish normal and epileptic EEG signals with an accuracy of more than 97% for clean EEG and more than 85% for highly noised EEG signals.

The relevance of QEEG to the evaluation of behavioral disorders and pharmacological interventions	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG oscillations; EEG regulation; event-related potentials; homeostatic system; pharmaco-EEG; psychiatric disorders; QEEG	RESOLUTION ELECTROMAGNETIC TOMOGRAPHY; QUANTITATIVE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; SYMPTOM PROVOCATION; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS; INPUTS; OCD	It has become apparent that the electrical signals recorded from the scalp of healthy individuals under standardized conditions are predictable, and that patients with a wide variety of brain disorders display activity with unusual features. It also early became apparent that centrally active medications produced striking changes in this activity. The application of computerized signal analysis to EEG recordings collected using standardized procedures has made it possible to obtain quantitative descriptions of brain electrical activity (QEEG) in normal individuals and patients with disorders of brain function or structure, as well as quantitative description of the ways in which centrally active medications alter this activity (Pharmaco-EEG or "PEEG"). With the emergence of three-dimensional EEG source localization techniques, it has recently become possible to visualize the mathematically most probable generators of QEEG abnormalities within the brain as well as the neuroanatomical regions where abnormal activity is most altered by efficacious medication. As QEEG and PEEG have evolved, a vast body of facts has been accumulated, describing changes in the EEG or event-related potentials (ERPs) observed. in a variety of brain disorders or after administration of a variety of medications. With some notable exceptions, these studies,have, tended to be phenomenological rather than analytic. There has not been a systematic attempt to integrate these phenomena in order to build better understanding of how the abnormal behaviors of a particular psychiatric patient might be related to the specific pattern of the deviant electrical activity, nor just how pharmacological reduction of that deviant activity may have resulted in more normal behavior. This article is an endeavor to provide a more specific theoretical framework for understanding the relationships between the neuroanatomy and neurochemistry of the homeostatic system underlying the regulation of the QEEG, and the mechanisms revealed by Pharmaco-EEG that aid in correcting these illnesses.

In contrast, current studies of actual hand movement tend to simply apply techniques for imagined movement directly onto actual movement without adjusting for the possibility of difference in EEG signals between actual and imagined action. This study aims to find a set of parameters, algorithms and acquisition techniques to maximize the classification accuracy for mapping EEG signals onto actual hand actions. Data is directly collected from subjects measuring their hand actions (using a set of VR gloves) and neuro-physical signals (using EEG and EMC sensors) for four different hand actions. This data is then preprocessed and features selected using the method of Common Spatial Patterns (CSP). These features are then processed using a number of classification algorithms. Accuracies up to 74.2% have been achieved, showing that there is an optimal set of parameters.

In this paper, the use of Self-Organizing Map (SOM) as an adaptive classifier for mental tasks classification was proposed. As for SOM, there are two cases about the labeling of map units, which correspond to semi-supervised and unsupervised algorithm respectively. In one case, the map units are labeled according to the labels of training patterns. In the other case, the map structure information, e.g., the U-matrix, is used to cluster map units. The ability of SOM to recognize mental task was analyzed for both cases. The organized SOM is tested on testing patterns. The averaged classification accuracy of 96.2% and 90.8% across 10 task pairs was obtained for both cases respectively. This result indicates the feasibility of online training of SOM for mental tasks classification.

The parametric values such as energy, variance, and duration, covariance, positive and negative peaks, sharp and spike waves and events are derived in each epoch of two second duration in the EEG signal channels. Fuzzy techniques are used to classify the risk level in each epoch for all the channels, the risk level patterns obtained are found to have low values of sensitivity, specificity, performance index and quality value. In order to increase the classification rate, an optimization technique based on aggregation operators is used and a quality value of 23.78 is achieved when compared to the value 6.25 achieved in the previous case. A comparison of fuzzy techniques without and with optimization is studied. The focal epilepsy problem in normal fuzzy classification is solved using this new approach. A group of ten patients with known epilepsy findings are used in this study. Further research work can be carried out in the classification of epilepsy risk level of a long-term EEG signals about 3 minute's durations. The number of samples may be increased to improve the classification rate.

J	Kozma, R; Freeman, WJ				Kozma, R; Freeman, WJ			Chaotic resonance - Methods and applications for robust classification of noisy and variable patterns	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIFURCATION AND CHAOS			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORKS; STOCHASTIC RESONANCE; DYNAMICS; ATTRACTORS; MODEL; RECOGNITION; ELEMENTS; MEMORY; PHASE; EEGS	A fundamental tenet of the theory of deterministic chaos holds that infinitesimal variation in the initial conditions of a network that is operating in the basin of a low-dimensional chaotic attractor causes the various trajectories to diverge from each other quickly. This "sensitivity to initial conditions" might seem to hold promise for signal detection, owing to an implied capacity for distinguishing small differences in patterns. However, this sensitivity is incompatible with pattern classification, because it amplifies irrelevant differences in incomplete patterns belonging to the same class, and it renders the network easily corrupted by noise. Here a theory of stochastic chaos is developed, in which aperiodic outputs with 1/f(2) spectra are formed by the interaction of globally connected nodes that are individually governed by point attractors under perturbation by continuous white noise. The interaction leads to a high-dimensional global chaotic attractor that governs the entire array of nodes. An example is our spatially distributed KIII network that is derived from studies of the olfactory system, and that is stabilized by additive noise modeled on biological noise sources. Systematic parameterization of the interaction strengths corresponding to synaptic gains among nodes representing excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations enables the formation of a robust high-dimensional global chaotic attractor. Reinforcement learning from examples of patterns to be classified using habituation and association creates lower dimensional local basins, which form a global attractor landscape with one basin for each class. Thereafter, presentation of incomplete examples of a test pattern leads to confinement of the KIII network in the basin corresponding to that pattern, which constitutes many-to-one generalization. The capture after learning is expressed by a stereotypical spatial pattern of amplitude modulation of a chaotic carrier wave. Sensitivity to initial conditions is no longer an issue. Scaling of the additive noise as a parameter optimizes the classification of data sets in a manner that is comparable to stochastic resonance. The local basins constitute dynamical memories that solve difficult problems in classifying data sets that are not linearly separable. New local basins can be added quickly from very few examples without loss of existing basins. The attractor landscape enables the KIII set to provide an interface between noisy, unconstrained environments and conventional pattern classifiers. Examples given here of its robust performance include fault detection in small machine parts and the classification of spatioternporal EEG patterns from rabbits trained to discriminate visual stimuli.

Also the availability of quantitative biological markers that are correlated with qualitative :psychiatric phenotypes helps us to utilize automated methods to diagnose and classify these phenotypes. One such a psychiatric phenotype is alcoholism. In this study a method to select an optimal subset of EEG channels for the purpose of practical classification of alcohol abusers from normal subjects is proposed, which is based on combination of model-based spectral analysis and correlation matrices. The EEG signals were recorded when the subjects were represented with single trial visual stimuli. The proposed method proved successful in selecting an optimum number of channels which achieved acceptable average classification accuracy.	[Shooshtari, M.

This is a time-consuming task requiring significant training and experience. Automatic detection of these EEG patterns would greatly assist in quantitative analysis and interpretation. We present a method, which allows automatic detection of epileptiform events and discrimination of them from eye blinks, and is based on features derived using a novel application of independent component analysis. The algorithm was trained and cross validated using seven EEGs with epileptiform activity. For epileptiform events with compensation for eyeblinks, the sensitivity was 65 +/- 22% at a specificity of 86 +/- 7% (mean +/- SD). With feature extraction by PCA or classification of raw data, specificity reduced to 76 and 74%, respectively, for the same sensitivity. On exactly the same data, the commercially available software Reveal had a maximum sensitivity of 30% and concurrent specificity of 77%. Our algorithm performed well at detecting epileptiform events in this preliminary test and offers a flexible tool that is intended to be generalized to the simultaneous classification of many waveforms in the EEG.

The translation of these EEG signals to control signals of a device is based on a good classification of various kinds of imagination. We have developed a wavelet-based time-frequency analysis approach for classifying motor imagery tasks. Time-frequency distributions (TFDs) were constructed based on wavelet decomposition and event-related (de) synchronization patterns were extracted from symmetric electrode pairs. The weighted energy difference of the electrode pairs was then compared to classify the imaginary movement. The present method has been tested in nine human subjects and reached an averaged classification rate of 78%. The simplicity of the present technique suggests that it may provide an alternative method for EEG-based BCI applications.

The exact compositions of brain oscillations and their temporal behavior were assessed by the probability-classification analysis of short-term EEG spectral patterns. It was demonstrated that EEG of patients with opioid dependence was characterized by (a) significant reorganization of brain oscillations with increase in the percentage of beta and mostly fast-alpha-rhythmic segments, (b) longer periods of temporal stabilization for alpha and beta brain oscillations and by shorter periods of temporal stabilization for theta and polyrhythmic activity when compared with control subjects, and (c) right-sided dominance (significantly larger relative presence of particular spectral patterns in EEG channels of the right hemisphere). These effects were widely distributed across the cortex with the maximum magnitude in the occipital, right parietal, temporal, and frontal areas. Taken together the present study suggested (a) an allostatic state with neuronal activation, and (b) high sensitivity of the right hemisphere to adverse opioid effects. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We propose a new classification algorithm that extracts relevant oscillatory activities from ongoing electroencephalographic (EEG) signals without prior knowledge of the discriminant frequency hands. In this approach, a spatial filtering matrix transforms EEG signals into several components. In order to minimize the generalization error of a Bayesian classifier, the spatial filter is tuned using Spectral Density Matrices. The algorithmic implementation of this method uses explicitly the cross-spectral properties of EEG data. Results on both realistic simulations of EEG data and real asynchronous BCI experiments show the interest of the method and its superiority over the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm.

Since classification is more accurate when the pattern is simplified through representation by important features, feature extraction and selection play an important role in classifying systems such as neural networks. Multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) architectures were formulated and used as basis for detection of electroencephalographic changes. Three types of EEG signals (EEG signals recorded from healthy volunteers with eyes open, epilepsy patients in the epileptogenic zone during a seizure-free interval, and epilepsy patients during epileptic seizures) were classified. The selected Lyapunov exponents, wavelet coefficients and the power levels of power spectral density (PSD) values obtained by eigenvector methods of the EEG signals were used as inputs of the MLPNN trained with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The classification results confirmed that the proposed MLPNN has potential in detecting the electroencephalographic changes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The proposed detector consists of a segmentation, feature extraction and classification stage. For the feature extraction stage, coefficients of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), real and imaginary parts of the Fast Fourier Transform and raw EEG data were all found to be well-suited to EEG classification. Principal Component Analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of the features. For the classification stage, Multi-Layer Perceptron neural networks were implemented according to Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Learning formulations. The latter was found to make better use of training data and consequently produced better trained neural networks. Rejection thresholds of 0.9 were applied to the network output as a doubt level in order to ensure that only reliable classification decisions are made. A maximum classifier accuracy of 95,10% was achieved with 24,97% of patterns not being classified. Bayesian moderated outputs could not improve on these classification predictions significantly enough to warrant their added computational overhead.

The FBCSP algorithm classifies EEG measurements from features constructed using subject-specific temporal-spatial filters. However, the FBCSP algorithm is limited to binary-class motor imagery. Hence, this paper proposes 3 approaches of multi-class extension to the FBCSP algorithm: One-versus-Rest, Pair-Wise and Divide-and-Conquer. These approaches decompose the multi-class problem into several binary-class problems. The study is conducted on the BC! Competition IV dataset IIa, which comprises single-trial EEG data from 9 subjects performing 4-class motor imagery of left-hand, right-hand, foot and tongue actions. The results showed that the multi-class FBCSP algorithm could extract features that matched neurophysiological knowledge, and yielded the best performance on the evaluation data compared to other international submissions.

A simple yet effective ensemble approach for electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification named the random electrode selection ensemble (RESE) is developed, which aims to surmount the instability demerit of the Fisher discriminant feature extraction for BCI applications. Through the random selection of recording electrodes answering for the physiological background of user-intended mental activities, multiple individual classifiers are constructed. In a feature subspace determined by a couple of randomly selected electrodes, principal component analysis (PCA) is first used to carry out dimensionality reduction. Successively Fisher discriminant is adopted for feature extraction, and a Bayesian classifier with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) approximating the feature distribution is trained. For a test sample the outputs from all the Bayesian classifiers are combined to give the final prediction for its label. Theoretical analysis and classification experiments with real EEG signals indicate that the RESE approach is both effective and efficient. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Model Comparison for the Detection of EEG Arousals in Sleep Apnea Patients	BIO-INSPIRED SYSTEMS: COMPUTATIONAL AND AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE, PT 1	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (IWANN 2009)	JUN 10-12, 2009	Salamanca, SPAIN			Sleep Apnea/Hypopnea Syndrome; Arousal; Intelligent algorithms		Sleep Apnea/Hypopnea Syndrome (SAHS) is a very common sleep disorder characterized by the repeated occurrence of involuntary breathing pauses during sleep. Cessation in breathing often causes Electroencephalographic (EEG) arousals as a response, and therefore detection of arousals is important since they provide important evidence for localization of apneic events and their number is directly related with SAHS severity. Arousals result in fragmented sleep and so they are one of the most important causes of daytime sleepiness. In this paper we present an approach to detect these arousals over polysomnographic recordings based on the machine learning paradigm. First a signal processing technique is proposed for the construction of learning patterns. Subsequently classifiers based on Fisher's linear and quadratic discriminates, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are compared for the learning process. The more suitable model was chosen finally showing an accuracy of 0.92.

The EEC analysis calculates the power spectra of the frequency of the EEC signal, divides into the frequency bands based on theta, alpha, and beta rhythms, and evaluates whether the music matches mood of the user or not through EEC pattern classification. A k-nearest neighbor classifier is used to classify the EEC patterns. The egogram is used for detecting nature of the human. Finally, we discuss the relationship the result of EEC pattern classification and the human's nature. An interesting finding was that the recognition accuracy of the EEC pattern meaning the response of them on negative stimuli became high when the subject was classified into the egogram pattern with introverted nature.

Objective. To establish the incidence of type of clinical neonatal seizures and the correspondence of these to the EEG trace background and the EEG epileptic activity, the underlying etiology, the response to antiepileptic treatment, and their prognosis. Patients and methods. Retrospective study of admitted newborns with the diagnosis of neonatal seizures in our hospital, during the period included between January 1993 and October 2001. Some of variables collected were: birth and gestational age, Apgar, clinical pattern, duration of the convulsions, critical and intercritical EEG traced, EEG background, etiological diagnosis, treatment used and response of the same, evolution and neurological state at hospital discharge and at one year of age (corrected age in preterm infants). Results. 74 children were admitted with neonatal convulsion diagnosis, of these only 56 EEG convulsions were confirmed (42% presented subtle seizures, 33.9% tonic, 64.3% clonic multifocal, 10.7% clonic focal, and 16.1% myoclonic multifocal). 55.4% of the infants had 2 or more types of clinical convulsions, 25% of all had an epileptic state, and 42.9% had at some time of the EEG record, electroclinical dissociation. The more frequent critical EEGs abnormalities was multifocal discharges (64.3%), and together with the focal discharges of low frequency had significant (p < 0.07) worse pharmacological control, and also unfavourable outcome. The infants having had EEGs background moderately and markedly abnormal showed unfavourable outcome in 72.2% and 100% respectively, while it was only in 15.4% of the infants who had EEGs background normal or lightly abnormal. With the antiepileptic treatment the clinical control of the convulsions was obtained in more than 80% of the cases, while control of the electrical convulsions was only in 62.5%. There was a higher significant association between favourable response to treatment and normal neurological examination at hospital discharge and at I year of age. Conclusions. The necessity to confirm by means of EEG record the neonatal clinical convulsions, before and after having established the anticonvulsivant treatment, due to the control of electrical convulsions improves their neurological outcome.

The fitness of the method in biomedical data analysis was further demonstrated on real multi-color flow cytometry and multi-channel electroencephalography data. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) exploit the ability of human communication and control bypassing the classical neuromuscular communication channels. In general, BCIs offer a possibility of communication for people with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or complete paralysis of all extremities due to high spinal cord injury. Beyond medical applications, a BCI conjunction with exciting multimedia applications, e.g., a dexterity discovery, could define a new level of control possibilities also for healthy customers decoding information directly from the user's brain, as reflected in EEG signals which are recorded non-invasively from the scalp. This contribution introduces the Berlin Brain-Computer Interface (BBCI) and presents set-ups where the user is provided with intuitive control strategies in plausible interactive bio-feedback applications. Yet at its beginning, BBCI thus adds a new dimension in HCI research by offering the user an additional and independent communication channel based on brain activity only. Successful experiments already yielded inspiring proofs-of-concept. A diversity of interactive application models, say computer games, and their specific intuitive control strategies are now open for BCI research aiming at a further speed up of user adaptation and increase of learning success and transfer bit rates. BBCI is a complex distributed software system that can be run on several communicating computers responsible for (i) the signal acquisition, (ii) the data processing and (iii) the feedback application. Developing a BCI system, special attention must be paid to the design of the feedback application that serves as the HCI unit. This should provide the user with the information about her/his brain activity in a way that is intuitively intelligible. Exciting discovery applications qualify perfectly for this role. However, most of these applications incorporate control strategies that are developed especially for the control with haptic devices, e.g., joystick, keyboard or mouse. Therefore, novel control strategies should be developed for this purpose that (i) allow the user to incorporate additional information for the control of animated objects and (ii) do not frustrate the user in the case of a misclassification of the decoded brain signal. BCIs are able to decode different information types from the user's brain activity, such as sensory perception or motor intentions and imaginations, movement preparations, levels of stress, workload or task-related idling. All of these diverse brain signals can be incorporated in an exciting discovery scenario. Modern HCI research and development technologies can provide BCI researchers with the know-how about interactive feedback applications and corresponding control strategies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Developing a reliable machine learning method plays a very crucial role in this issue. For a typical problem in BCI, ERP detection task, the major method is to classify the input EEG time series into two classes; with a desired ERP/Cognitive Component and without that desired ERP/Cognitive Component. Any powerful feature extraction or classifier block that can do this task accurately, can be of a great help. In this study, a new classifier based on modular learning strategy and a new wavelet for feature extraction, will be introduced and compared with some other classifiers in two states; with GA and without GA, which shows a an improvement in classification accuracy.

The EEG signals are analyzed through the wavelets and both scale-dependent and scale-independent features are computed to characterize the patterns. The classification is carried out by a supervised neural network. The efficiency of the method is evaluated through the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) test. Although a high discrimination is observed with one single neural output, a complete separation among MwA patients and healthy subjects is obtained when a scatter plot is drawn in the plane of two suitable neural outputs.

A single parameter cannot fully describe it. In this paper, the effects of long time sustained low-workload visual display terminal (VDT) task on psychology are investigated by subjective self-reporting measures. Then power spectral indices of HRV, the P300 components based on visual oddball and wavelet packet parameters of EEG are combined to analyze the impacts of prolonged visual display terminal (VDT) activity on autonomic nervous system and central nervous system. Finally, wavelet packet parameters of EEG are extracted as the features of brain activity in different mental fatigue states. Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and support vector machine (SVM) are jointly applied to differentiate two states. The statistic results show that the level of both subjective sleepiness and fatigue increase significantly from pre-task to post-task, which indicate that the long time VDT task induces the mental fatigue to the subjects. The predominant activity of autonomic nervous system of subjects turns to the sympathetic activity from parasympathetic activity after the task. The P300 components and wavelet packet parameters of EEG are strongly related with mental fatigue. Moreover, the joint KPCA-SVM method is able to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors, speed up the convergence in the training of SVM and achieve a high recognition accuracy (87%) of mental fatigue state. Multipsychophysiological measures and KPCA-SVM method could be a promising tool for the evaluation of mental fatigue.

Methods: The automatic method was based on the computation of 5 descriptors, which were derived from the EEG signal and were able to provide a meaningful data reduction. Each of them corresponded to a different frequency hand. Results: The computation of these descriptors, followed by the introduction of two suitable thresholds and of simple criteria for logical discrimination, provided results which were in good agreement with those obtained with visual analysis. The method was versatile and could be applied to the study of other important microstructure phenomena by means of very small adaptations. Conclusions: The simplicity of the method leads to a better understanding and a more precise definition of the visual criteria for the recognition and classification of the microstructure phenomena.

If several mental states can be reliably distinguished by recognizing patterns in EEG then a paralyzed person could communicate to a device lice a wheelchair by composing sequences of these mental states. In this research, EEG from one subject who performed three mental tasks have been classified using Radial Basis Function (RBF) Support Vector Machines (SVM) to control overfitting. A method for EEG preprocessing based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was proposed and three different feature extraction techniques were compared: Parametric Autoregressive (AR) modeling, AR spectral analysis and power differences between four frequency bands. The best classification accuracy was approximately 70% using the parametric AR model representation with almost 5 % improvement of accuracy over unprocessed data.

The reasons why the human brain far exceeds any existing recognition scheme to date in the ability to generalize and to extract invariant characteristics relevant to category matching are not clear. However, it has been postulated that the dynamic distribution of brain activity (spatiotemporal activation patterns) is the mechanism by which stimuli are encoded and matched to categories. This research focuses on supervised learning using a trajectory based distance metric for category discrimination in an oscillatory neural network model. Classification is accomplished using a trajectory based distance metric. Since the distance metric is differentiable, a supervised learning algorithm based on gradient descent is demonstrated. Classification of spatiotemporal frequency transitions and their relation to a priori assessed categories is shown along with the improved classification results after supervised training. The results indicate that this spatiotemporal representation of stimuli and the associated distance metric is useful for simple pattern recognition tasks and that supervised learning improves classification results.

The subjects were trained to discriminate 2 visual and then 2 auditory conditioned stimuli, one reinforced (CS+), the other not (CS-). A moving window was applied to the 6-s records from 20 trials of each CS including a 3-s prestimulus control (CS0). The root mean square amplitude was calculated for each signal in the gamma range, so each window gave a point in 64-space. EEG patterns from the CS+, CS- and CS0 conditions gave 3 clusters of points in 64-space. The Euclidean distance of each point to the nearest center of gravity of a cluster served for classification and estimation of the probability of correct classification. The results showed that the gamma activity (35-60 Hz in cats, 20-80 Hz in rabbits) in all five areas formed global patterns of amplitude modulation (AM) in time windows lasting similar to100-200 ms and recurring at 2-4 Hz, which were correctly classified above chance levels (p < 0.01). All areas contributed information to the AM patterns that served to classify the EEG epochs in the windows with respect to the conditioned stimuli. In conclusion, multisensory integration took place over the greater part of the hemisphere, despite lack of phase coherence among the gamma waves. The integration occurred rapidly enough that, within 300 ms of CS onset, activity in every sensory area was modified by what took place in every other sensory area.

Three specific areas of the valence-arousal emotional space are defined, corresponding to negatively excited, positively excited, and calm-neutral states. An acquisition protocol based on the recall of past emotional life episodes has been designed to acquire data from both peripheral and EEG signals. Pattern classification is used to distinguish between the three areas of the valence-arousal space. The performance of several classifiers has been evaluated on 10 participants and different feature sets: peripheral features, EEG time-frequency features, EEG pairwise mutual information (MI) features. Comparison of results obtained using either peripheral or EEG signals confirms the interest of using EEGs to assess valence and arousal in emotion recall conditions. The obtained accuracy for the three emotional classes is 63% using EEG time-frequency features, which is better than the results obtained from previous studies using EEG and similar classes. Fusion of the different feature sets at the decision level using a summation rule also showed to improve accuracy to 70%. Furthermore, the rejection of non-confident samples finally led to a classification accuracy of 80% for the three classes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It was evaluated by simulating the patterns of action potentials and EEG waveforms observed in electrophysiological experiments. It differs from conventional artificial neural networks in relying on a landscape of chaotic attractors for its memory system and on a high-dimensional trajectory in state space for virtually instantaneous access to any low-dimensional attractor. Here we adapted this novel neural network as a diagnostic tool to classify normal and hypoxic EEGs.

Digitized 8-channel EEG data were recorded with standard electrodes placement and amplifier settings from five confirmed syncopic and five normal subjects. The preprocessed EEG signals were fragmented in two-second artifact free epochs for calculation and analysis of changes due to syncope. The results revealed significant increase in percentage delta and alpha (p < 0.5 or better) with significant reduction in percentage theta activity (p < 0.05). The backpropagation ANN used for classification contains 60 nodes in input layer, weighted from power spectrum data from 0 to 30 Hz, 18 nodes in hidden layer and an output node. The ANN was found effective in differentiating the EEG power spectra from syncopic EEG power spectra and the normal EEG power spectra with an accuracy of 88.87% (85.75% for syncopic and 92% for normal).

To relax the presumption of strictly linear patterns in the CSP, nonlinear variants of the approach are proposed using the kernel method. However, they typically suffer from two main drawbacks: the problem of complexity and low generalization ability dealing with different subjects. To overcome these drawbacks, in this paper, two effective solutions are proposed. First, data bunching in the low-dimensional space is used to solve the complexity problem. The second problem is tackled by choosing appropriate kernel functions, which take into account very small amounts of nonlinearity in a generally linear context of the brain spatial patterns, and also are able to be adapted to fit each certain case.

Ideal observer analysis for task normalization of pattern classifier performance applied to EEG and fMRI data	JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA A-OPTICS IMAGE SCIENCE AND VISION			English	Article							HUMAN BRAIN; PERCEPTUAL DECISIONS; VISUAL-MOTION; EFFICIENCY; CORTEX; IDENTIFICATION; OBJECTS; FACES	The application of multivariate techniques to neuroimaging and electrophysiological data has greatly enhanced the ability to detect where, when, and how functional neural information is processed during a variety of behavioral tasks. With the extension to single-trial analysis, neuroscientists are able to relate brain states to perceptual, cognitive, and motor processes. Using pattern classification methods, the neuroscientist can extract neural performance measures in a manner analogous to human behavioral performance, allowing for a consistent information content metric across measurement modalities. However, as with behavioral psychophysical performance, pattern classifier performances are a product of both the task-relevant information inherent in the brain and in the task/stimuli. Here, we argue for the use of an ideal observer framework with which the researcher can effectively normalize the observed neural performance given the task's inherent objective difficulty. We use data from a face versus car discrimination task and compare classifier performance applied to electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data with corresponding human behavior through the absolute and relative efficiency metrics. We show that confounding variables that can lead to erroneous interpretations of information content can be accounted for through comparisons to an ideal observer, allowing for more confident interpretation of the neural mechanisms involved in the task of interest. Finally, we discuss limitations of interpretation due to the transduction of indirect measures of neural activity, underlying assumptions in the optimality of the pattern classifiers, and dependence of efficiency results on signal contrast.

The new method shows a significant improvement in P300 detection which is a common approach in BCI systems. The proposed model uses more than one scalp electrodes and combines the outputs with a fuzzy technique, to detect P300 cognitive component.	[Khorshidi, G. R. Salimi; Golpayegani, M. R.

We investigated whether individual differences in resting, task-independent frontal EEG alpha asymmetries predicted performance on the "Mind in the Eyes" (MIE) task, which is an established measure of mental state decoding skills. Group analyses showed that mental state decoding skills were stronger among those with right-lateralized frontal activation. Individual differences analyses showed that the degree of relative right mid-frontal activation predicted performance on the task. These findings establish a neural correlate of individual differences in one aspect of ToM, and hypotheses about the precise mechanism involved are discussed.

A desired concept is represented as a neuronal computational model consisting of the input, hidden, and output neurons. In this model the hidden neurons learn independently to classify the EEG segments presented by spectral and statistical features. This technique has been applied to the EEG data recorded from 65 sleeping healthy newborns in order to learn a brain maturation concept of newborns aged between 35 and 51 weeks. The 39,399 and 19,670 segments from these data have been used for learning and testing the concept, respectively. As a result, the concept has correctly classified 80.1% of the testing segments or 87.7% of the 65 records. (C) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

In particular, this work proposes a novel method which first formulates the selection of features as maximizing mutual information between class labels and features. It then uses a robust estimate of mutual information, within a filter-bank and common spatial pattern feature extraction framework, to select an effective feature set. We have assessed the proposed method on both BC! Competition IV Set I and a separate data set collected in our lab from 7 healthy subjects. The results indicate the method is effective in selecting optimal spatial-spectral features for classification.

Nonlinear methods are based on the concept of attractors in phase space. This concept on the one hand incorporates the idea of an autonomous (stationary) system, on the other hand implicates the investigation of a long time evolution. It is an unresolved problem in nonlinear EEG research that nonlinear methods per se give no feedback about the stationarity aspect. Hence, we introduce a combined strategy utilizing both stochastic and nonlinear deterministic methods. We propose, in a first step to segment the EEG time series into piecewise quasi-stationary epochs by means of nonparametric change point analysis. Subsequently, nonlinear measures can be estimated with higher confidence for the segmented epochs fullfilling the stationarity condition.

Diagnosis and Classification of Epilepsy Risk Levels from EEG Signals Using Fuzzy Aggregation Techniques	ENGINEERING LETTERS			English	Article						EEG Signals; Epilepsy; Fuzzy Logic; Aggregation operators; Risk Levels		This paper is intended to compare the performance of four different types of fuzzy aggregation methods in classification of epilepsy risk levels from EEG Signal parameters. The fuzzy technique is the first level classifier which works on the EEG Signal extracted features (patterns) such as energy, variance, peaks, events, duration and covariance. These features are obtained from an epoch of 2 seconds in all sixteen channels. Each epoch is sampled at 200Hz and digitized. The risk level patterns obtained by fuzzy techniques have low value of quality value and performance index. The aggregation operator based optimizations such as Ordered Weighted Average (OWA), Maxmin method; Max product method and Sum-product method are applied on the fuzzy outputs. Comparison of these optimizations is studied and analyzed for a group of ten known epilepsy patients. Training and testing are performed using 480 EEG signal feature sets of 2 seconds epoch obtained from routine clinical trials. To evaluate the optimization performance, we also employed free response receiver operating characteristics method with mean number of false positive. High quality value as 23.78 is achieved in OWA method and Max-Product method.

Owing to its low blood/gas partition coefficient, xenons effects on the central nervous system show a fast onset and offset and, even after long xenon anaesthetics, the wake-up times are very short. The aim of this study was to examine which electroencephalogram (EEG) stages are reached during xenon application and whether these stages can be identified by an automatic EEG classification. Therefore, EEG recordings were performed during xenon anaesthetics (EEG monitor: Narcotrend (R)). A total of 300 EEG epochs were assessed visually with regard to the EEG stages. These epochs were also classified automatically by the EEG monitor Narcotrend (R) using multivariate algorithms. There was a high correlation between visual and automatic classification (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r=0.957, prediction probability Pk=0.949). Furthermore, it was observed that very deep stages of hypnosis were reached which are characterised by EEG activity in the low frequency range (delta waves). The burst suppression pattern was not seen. In deep hypnosis, in contrast to the xenon EEG, the propofol EEG was characterised by a marked superimposed higher frequency activity. To ensure an optimised dosage for the single patient, anaesthetic machines for xenon should be combined with EEG monitoring. To date, only a few anaesthetic machines for xenon are available. Because of the high price of xenon, new and further developments of machines focus on optimizing xenon consumption.

The authors report on indications for, techniques of, and results of stereoelectroencephalography (stereo-EEG) monitoring in the presurgical evaluation of childhood drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Methods. Thirty-five children (24 boys and 11 girls; mean age 8.8 +/- 3.9 years, mean age at seizure onset 2.1 +/- 2.2 years) underwent 37 tailored stereotactic placements of intracerebral, multilead electrodes for intensive monitoring of seizures (stereo-EEG). Two children underwent exploration twice. Investigations prior to stereo-EEG monitoring, including magnetic resonance imaging and video-EEG of the scalp, revealed variable patterns of localizing incoherence among clinical, electrophysiological, and anatomical findings in all cases. A total of 426 electrodes were implanted (mean 11.5 +/- 2.6 per procedure) according to individualized arrangements. The stereo-EEG monitoring enabled recording of 826 seizures (mean 22 +/- 45 per procedure) and mapping of critically functional areas. One untoward event consisted of intracranial breakage of an electrode. Resections of the epileptogenic zone were performed according to results of stereo-EEG recordings. They consisted of cortical removal in seven cases, removal of the lesion and epileptogenic cortex in 26 cases, and lesion removal in two cases. Transient postoperative neurological deficits were observed in 13 patients, and permanent anticipated visual field defects occurred in seven patients. According to the Engel postoperative classification of seizure outcome, 60% of cases were in Class I, 74% had significant improvement (Classes I-III), and 26% were unchanged (mean follow up 31.9 +/- 20.6 months). Conclusions. Stereoelectroencephalography monitoring is a helpful and well-tolerated technique for the definition of the epileptogenic zone in complex cases of childhood drug-resistant epilepsy. It provides essential information for safe resections that should result in excellent outcomes in a considerable number of patients.

The obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnoea syndrome (OSAH) means "cessation of breath" during the sleep hours and the sufferers often experience related changes in the electrical activity of the brain and heart. Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction by computation of autoregressive (AR) coefficients and classification by the LS-SVMs. The EEG signals (pre and during hypopnoea) from three electrodes (C3, C4 and O2) were used as input patterns of the LS-SVMs. The performance of the LS-SVMs was evaluated in terms of training performance and classification accuracies and the results confirmed that the proposed LS-SVM has potential in detecting changes in the human EEG activity due to hypopnoea episodes.

Until today EEG is the simplest, safest and most inexpensive diagnostic tool to directly register the basic pathophysiological cerebral mechanisms of epileptic disorders. Specificity and sensitivity of the interictal epileptiform potentials (IED) like spikes, sharp waves and spike-wave complexes is about 90%, so that interictal occurrence of IED in surface EEG is strongly supportive of the diagnosis of epilepsy, and recording an ictal pattern proves the epileptic nature of an attack almost with certainty. Special procedures like hyperventilation, intermittent photic stimulation, prolonged or repeated recordings and sleep recordings can be performed to increase sensitivity and specificity. Also, certain patterns resembling epileptiform potentials - the so-called benign variants - should be familiar to the EEG reader. With these restraints, occurrence, shape, localization, and evolution of epileptiform activity in surface EEG is irreplaceable in the diagnosis of epilepsy and in the classification of the epileptic syndrome. In the preoperative diagnostic workup EEG defines the irritative region and ictal onset zone, both of which are indispensable to assess the epileptogenic region.

This paper proposes a Multiclass Common Spatial Pattern (MCSP) based on Joint Approximate Diagonalization (JAD) for multiclass BCIs. The proposed method based on fast Frobenius diagonalization (FFDIAG) is compared with another method based on Jacobi angles on the BCI competition IV dataset 2a. The classification accuracies obtained from 10x10-fold cross-validations on the training dataset are compared using K-Nearest Neighbor, Classification Trees and Support Vector Machine classifiers. The proposed MCSP based on FFDIAG yields an averaged accuracy of 53.6% compared to 32.8% given by the method based on Jacobi angles and 27.8% of the one versus rest CSP methods.	[Liyanage, S.

The IFAST Model Allows the Prediction of Conversion to Alzheimer Disease in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment with High Degree of Accuracy	CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH			English	Article						Artificial neural networks; EEG processing; implicit function as squashing time; mild cognitive impairment; Alzheimer disease; auto contractive map	EEG; BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; PARAMETERS; DEMENTIA	This paper presents the results obtained with the innovative use of special types of artificial neural networks (ANNs) assembled in a novel methodology named IFAST (implicit function as squashing time) capable of compressing the temporal sequence of electroencephalographic (EEG) data into spatial invariants. The aim of this study is to test the potential of this parallel and nonlinear EEG analysis technique in providing an automatic classification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects who will convert to Alzheimer's disease (AD) with a high degree of accuracy. Eyes-closed resting EEG data (10-20 electrode montage) were recorded in 143 amnesic MCI subjects. Based on 1-year follow up, the subjects were retrospectively classified to MCI converted to AD and MCI stable. The EEG tracks were successively filtered according to four different frequency ranges, in order to evaluate the hypotheses that a specific range, corresponding to specific brain wave type, could provide a better classification (0.12 Hz, 12.2-29.8 Hz; 30.2-40 Hz, and finally Notch Filter 48 - 50 Hz). The spatial content of the EEG voltage was extracted by IFAST step-wise procedure using ANNs. The data input for the classification operated by ANNs were not the EEG data, but the connections weights of a nonlinear auto-associative ANN trained to reproduce the recorded EEG tracks. These weights represented a good model of the peculiar spatial features of the EEG patterns at scalp surface. The classification based on these parameters was binary and performed by a supervised ANN. The best results distinguishing between MCI stable and MCI/AD reached to 85.98%.(012 Hz band). And confirmed the working hypothesis that a correct automatic classification can be obtained extracting spatial information content of the resting EEG voltage by ANNs and represent the basis for research aimed at integrating spatial and temporal information content of the EEG. These results suggest that this low-cost procedure can reliably distinguish eyes-closed resting EEG data in individual MCI subjects who will have different prognosis at 1-year follow up, and is promising for a large-scale periodic screening of large populations at amnesic MCI subjects at risk of AD.

We investigated the usefulness of massively distributed source reconstruction, comparing scalp and cortical scales. This approach provides a more detailed picture of the functional brain networks underlying the changes related to the mental state of interest. Local and distant synchrony measurements (coherence, phase locking value) were used for both scalp measurements and cortical current density sources, and were fed into a SVM-based classifier. We designed two simulations where classification scores increased when our 60-electrode scalp measurements were reconstructed on 60 sources and on a 500-source cortex. Source reconstruction appeared to be most useful in these simulations, in particular, when distant synchronies were involved and local synchronies did not prevail. Despite the simplicity of the model used, certain flaws in accuracy were observed in the localization of informative activities, due to the relationship between amplitude and phase for mixed signals. Our results with real EEG data suggested that the phenomenon of interest was characterized merely by modulations in local amplitudes, but also in strength of distant couplings. After source reconstruction, classification rates also increased for real EEG data when seeking distant phase-related couplings. When reconstructing a large number of sources, the regularization coefficient should be carefully selected on a subject-by-subject basis. We showed that training classifiers using such high-dimension data is useful for localizing discriminating patterns of activity.

In an attempt to examine the role of gender and widen the scope of the measurement probes used in these investigations, the traditional power and inter-hemispheric power ratio indices were supplemented with intra-hemispheric power ratios, mean frequency and both inter and intra-hemispheric coherence indices. in the comparison of depressed male patients and healthy controls. Resting (eyes closed), vigilance controlled EEG recordings from 21 scalp sites were collected from 70 male, unmedicated, unipolar major depressive disorder outpatients and 23 normal control male subjects. Absolute and relative power, frequency, asymmetry and coherence measures derived from spectrally analyzed EEGs were subjected to univariate analyses for group comparisons as well as to discriminant function analysis to examine their utility as classification indices. Compared with controls, patients evidenced greater overall relative beta power and, at bilateral anterior regions, greater absolute beta power and faster mean total spectrum frequency. Inter-hemispheric alpha power asymmetry index differences were noted, with controls exhibiting relatively reduced left hemisphere activation, and widespread reduced delta, theta, alpha and beta coherence indices. Whereas intra-hemispheric theta power asymmetry reduction was exhibited in patients bilaterally at all regions, group differences with intra-hemispheric beta power asymmetry were unilateral, being restricted to the right hemisphere. Discriminant analysis correctly classified 91.3% of the patients and controls. Quantitative EEG measurements in male depression appear to describe a pattern of aberrant inter-hemispheric synchrony/asymmetry and a profile of frontal activation.

The main aim was to evaluate which two of several candidate tasks lead to patterns of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity that could be differentiated most reliably and, therefore, produce the highest communication rate. An optimal signal processing method was also sought to enhance differentiation of EEG profiles across tasks. In ten normal subjects (five male), aged 29-54 years, EEG activity was recorded from four channels during cognitive tasks grouped in pairs, and performed alternately. Four imagery tasks were: spatial navigation around a familiar environment; auditory imagery of a familiar tune; and right and left motor imagery of opening and closing the hand. Signal processing methodology included autoregressive (AR) modeling and classification based on logistic regression and a nonlinear generative classifier. The highest communication rate was found using the navigation and auditory imagery tasks. In terms of classification performance and, hence, possible communication rate, these results were significantly better (p < 0.05) than those obtained with the classical pairing of motor tasks involving imaginary movements of the left and right hands. In terms of EEG data analysis, a nonlinear classification model provided more robust results than a linear model (p much less than 0.01), and a lower AR model order than those used in previous work was found to be effective. These findings have implications for establishing appropriate methods to operate BCI systems, particularly for disabled people who may experience difficulty with motor tasks, even motor imagery.

Careful analyses of the electroencephalograph (EEG) records can provide valuable insight and improved understanding of the mechanisms causing epileptic disorders. The detection of epileptiform discharges in the EEG is an important component in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Wavelet transform is particularly effective for representing various aspects of non-stationary signals such as trends, discontinuities, and repeated patterns where other signal processing approaches fail or are not as effective. Through wavelet decomposition of the EEG records, transient features are accurately captured and localized in both time and frequency context. This paper deals with a novel method of analysis of EEG signals using discrete wavelet transform, and classification using ANN. EEG signals were decomposed into the frequency sub-bands using wavelet transform. Then these sub-band frequencies were used as an input to an ANN with two discrete outputs: normal and epileptic. In this study, FEBANN and DWN based classifiers were developed and compared in relation to their accuracy in classification of EEG signals. The comparisons between the developed classifiers were primarily based on analysis of the ROC curves as well as a number of scalar performance measures pertaining to the classification. The DWN-based classifier outperformed the FEBANN based counterpart. Within the same group, the DWN-based classifier was more accurate than the FEBANN-based classifier. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The feature extraction approach consists of three stages. First, we employ EMD to decompose nonstationary single-trial time series into narrowband components called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with time scales dependent on the data. Second, we adopt unsupervised K-means clustering to group the IMFs and residues into several clusters across all trials and channels. Third, we use the supervised common spatial patterns (CSP) approach to design spatial filters for the clustered spatiotemporal signals. We exploit the support vector machine (SVM) classifier on the extracted features to decode the reported perception on a single-trial basis. We demonstrate that the CSP feature of the cluster in the gamma frequency band outperforms the features in other frequency bands and leads to the best decoding performance. We also show that the EMD- based feature extraction can be useful for evoked potential estimation. Our proposed feature extraction approach may have potential for many applications involving nonstationary multivariable time series such as brain-computer interfaces (BCI).

The new method shows a significant improvement in P300 detection which is a common approach in BCI systems.

The cloud model can transform numerical data to qualitative concept described by a group of characteristics. It provides a new way for concept induction in machine learning. Classification of single trial EEG recorded in a 'self-paced key typing' experiment is made through feature extraction based on cloud model and linear regression method for the classification of feature vectors. Results of up to 90% classification accuracy on test data set were obtained. The results show that compared with other methods, the feature extraction and translation method for EEG classification in this paper is simple and effective.

For this purpose, some experiments have been conducted over publicly available data, contrasting the performance levels exhibited by RVM models with those achieved with Support Vector Machines (SVMs), both in terms of predictive accuracy and sensitivity to the choice of the kernel function. Four settings of both types of kernel machine were considered in this Study, which vary in accord with the type of input data they receive, either raw EEG signal or some statistical features extracted from the wavelet-transformed data. The empirical results indicate that: (1) in terms of accuracy, the best-calibrated RVM models have shown very satisfactory performance levels, which are rather comparable to those of SVMs; (2) an increase of accuracy is sometimes accompanied by loss of sparseness in the resulting RVM models: (3) both types of machines present similar sensitivity profiles to the kernel functions considered, having some kernel parameter values clearly associated with better accuracy rate: (4) when riot making use of a feature extraction technique, the choice of the kernel function seems to be very relevant for significantly leveraging the performance of RVMs; and (5) when making use of derived features, the choice of the feature extraction technique seems to be an important factor to one take into account.

All electroencephalograms performed in comatose children aged 2 months to 18 years during the period 1996-2003 were retrospectively analyzed and classified according to modified Young's classification. Reactivity to painful/auditory stimuli and passive eye closure (at least two modalities) was checked in all electroencephalograms. The clinical outcome at 1 year or during the last clinic/inpatient follow-up was scored according to the Pediatric Cerebral and Overall Performance Category Scale. Outcomes were then compared using Fisher exact test and the Mann-Whitney test. Thirty-three patients had electroencephalography within 72 hours after the onset of coma. Fourteen of 33 electroencephalograms revealed reactive patterns. Outcome was unfavorable in 4 (28.6%) of these patients. Three children had no residual neurologic impairment. Among the 19 children with nonreactive electroencephalogram, 13 (65%) had unfavorable outcome, which included 10 deaths. All the survivors had residual neurologic impairment. Outcome was better in children with reactive electroencephalographic patterns (Fisher exact test; P = 0.023). Comatose children with reactive electroencephalographic patterns have better clinical outcome in terms of morbidity and mortality. A careful assessment of electroencephalographic reactive patterns in all comatose children is required for better understanding of the clinical outcome. (c) 2005 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To classify planning of movement of right and left index finger, three different approaches were compared: classification using a physiologically motivated set of four electrodes, a set determined by principal component analysis and electrodes determined by spatial pattern analysis. Spatial pattern analysis enhanced the classification rate significantly from 61.3 +/- 1.8% (with four electrodes) to 71.8 +/- 1.4% whereas the classification rate using the principal component analysis is significantly lower (65.2 +/- 1.4%).

In order to implement this system, we propose the interactive learning method For the application, we chose the robot control system and artificial neural networks (ANN) are adopted to extract the characteristic vector to distinguish comfort and discomfort from electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG). Machine Learning (ML), whose training signal is obtained from the physiological signals, is also adapted. As a fundamental study we make two kinds of experiments. One is to measure EEG for 20 examinees under the situation of comfort and discomfort about sounds. Another is to measure EMG whose amplitude is obtained with piezoelectric films on their eyebrows. At first we confirm the characteristic of EEG per examinee with frequency analysis. Then we show the results of the recognition from comfort to discomfort by adapting ANN. Finally we extract the characteristic vector from the physiological signals which will be used for the rewards of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to control the behavior of the Khepera robot.

In Motor Imagery-based (MI) BCI system, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) is frequently used for extracting discriminative patterns from the electroencephalogram (EEG). There are many studies have proven that the performance of CSP has a very important relation with the choice of operational frequency band. As the fact that the CSP features at different frequency bands contain discriminative and complementary information for classification, this paper proposes a new frequency band selection method to nd the best frequency band set on which subject-speci cs CSP are complementary for MI classi cation. Compared to the performance offered by the existing method based on frequency band partition, the proposed algorithm can yield error rate reductions of 49.70% for the same BCI competition dataset.

Public concerns about autism have grown in recent years due to the prevalence of its diagnosis in I out of 150 young children. Though many researches have been carried out to analyse autistic patients' EEG behaviour, an effective physiological diagnosis for autism does not exist and researchers haven't found a distinguishing pattern to classify autistic and non-autistic subjects. This preliminary study analyses the EEG data to compare patterns of speech and non-speech sound discrimination between 8 non-autistic and 4 autistic teenagers. An Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) based classifier has been implemented to determine whether EEG data reflects differences from the two types of responses.

Presently, electrophysiological studies of anxiety focus primarily on etiological aspects of brain dysfunction. The review highlights many functional similarities across studies, but also identifies patterns that clearly differentiate disorder classifications. Such measures offer clinical utility as reliable and objective indicators of brain dysfunction in individuals and indicate potential as biomarkers for the improvement of diagnostic specificity and for informing treatment decisions and prognostic assessments. Common to most of the anxiety disorders is basal instability in cortical arousal, as reflected in measures of quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG). Resting electroencephalographic (EEG) measures tend to correlate with symptom sub-patterns and be exacerbated by condition-specific stimulation. Also common to most of the anxiety disorders are condition-specific difficulties with sensory gating and the allocation and deployment of attention. These are clearly evident from evoked potential (EP) and event-related potential (ERP) electrical measures of information processing in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and the phobias. Other ERP measures clearly differentiate the disorders. However, there is considerable variation across studies, with inclusion and exclusion criteria, medication status and control group selection not standardized within condition or across studies. Study numbers generally preclude analysis for confound removal or for the derivation of diagnostic biomarker patterns at this time. The current trend towards development of databases of brain and cognitive function is likely to obviate these difficulties. In particular, electrophysiological measures of function are likely to play a significant role in the development and subsequent adaptations of DSM-V and assist critically in securing improvements in nosological and treatment specificity.

Event Related Potentials (ERPs) are measures that reflect the responses of the brain to events in the external or internal environment of the organism. P300 is the most important and the most studied component of the ERP. In this paper, a new method for P300 wave detection is introduced. It consists of two components: feature extraction and classification. For feature extraction, Mexican hat wavelet coefficients provide robust features when averaged over different scales. Classification has been carried out using rough set based methods. The overall results show that P300 wave detection can be performed using only five EEG channels. This in turn reduces the computational time compared to the averaging method that uses more channels.

The parametric values such as energy, positive and negative peaks, sharp spikes and events are derived in each epoch of the EEG signal channels. Fuzzy techniques are used to classify the risk level in each epoch for all the channels, the risk level patterns obtained are found to have low percentage of performance and quality value. In order to increase the classification rate, an optimization technique is used and a quality value of 11.9 is achieved when compared to the value 6.25 achieved in the previous case. A comparison of fuzzy techniques without and with optimization is studied. The focal epilepsy problem in normal fuzzy classification is solved using this new approach. A group of six patients with known epilepsy findings are used in this study. Further research work can be carried out in the classification of epilepsy risk level of a diabetic neuropathy patient. An analytic study is to be undertaken for classification based on fuzzy aggregation operators and fuzzy discriminators. The number of samples may be increased to improve the classification rate.

Combining KIII model with the transductive confidence machine, a novel method to recognize hypoxia electroencephalogram (EEG) with a preset confidence level is proposed in this paper. This method can make prediction with confidence measure rather than bare prediction. The experimental results of classifying normal and hypoxia EEGs show that the method can set confidence level in advance for every prediction to control the risk of error effectively.

This problem is of paramount importance for the realization of monitoring/control units to be implanted on drug-resistant epileptic patients. The proposed solution relies in a novel way on autoregressive modeling of the EEG time series and combines a least-squares parameter estimator for EEG feature extraction along with a support vector machine (SVM) for binary classification between preictal/ictal and interictal states. This choice is characterized by low computational requirements compatible with a real-time implementation of the overall system. Moreover, experimental results on the Freiburg dataset exhibited correct prediction of all seizures (100% sensitivity) and, due to a novel regularization of the SVM classifier based on the Kalman filter, also a low false alarm rate.

This BCI application is of particular interest for disabled patients who have lost all means of verbal and motor communication. We report on the implementation of a feature extraction procedure on a new ultra low-power 8-channel wireless EEG device. The feature extraction procedure is based on downsampled EEG signal epochs, the Student's t-statistic of the Continuous Wavelet Transform, and the Common Spatial Pattern technique. For classification, we use a linear Least-Squares Support Vector Machine. The results show that subjects are potentially able to communicate a character in less than ten seconds with an accuracy of 94.5%, which is more than twice as fast as the state of the art. In addition since our EEG device is wireless it offers an increased comfort to the subject.

J	Subasi, A; Ercelebi, E				Subasi, A; Ercelebi, E			Classification of EEG signals using neural network and logistic regression	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; epileptic seizure; lifting-based discrete wavelet transform (LBDWT); logistic regression (LR); muttitayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN)	WAVELET ANALYSIS; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; OSCILLATIONS; TRANSFORM; DESIGN	Epileptic seizures are manifestations of epilepsy. Careful analyses of the electroencephalograph (EEG) records can provide valuable insight and improved understanding of the mechanisms causing epileptic disorders. The detection of epileptiform discharges in the EEG is an important component in the diagnosis of epilepsy. As EEG signals are non-stationary, the conventional method of frequency analysis is not highly successful in diagnostic classification. This paper deals with a novel method of analysis of EEG signals using wavelet transform and classification using artificial neural network (ANN) and logistic regression (LR). Wavelet transform is particularly effective for representing various aspects of non-stationary signals such as trends, discontinuities and repeated patterns where other signal processing approaches fail or are not as effective. Through wavelet decomposition of the EEG records, transient features are accurately captured and localized in both time and frequency context. In epileptic seizure classification we used lifting-based discrete wavelet transform (LBDWT) as a preprocessing method to increase the computational speed. The proposed algorithm reduces the computational toad of those algorithms that were based on classical wavelet transform (CWT). In this study, we introduce two fundamentally different approaches for designing classification models (classifiers) the traditional statistical method based on Logistic regression and the emerging computationally powerful techniques based on ANN. Logistic regression as well as multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) based classifiers were developed and compared in relation to their accuracy in classification of EEG signals. In these methods we used LBDWT coefficients of EEG signals as an input to classification system with two discrete outputs: epileptic seizure or non-epileptic seizure. By identifying features in the signal we want to provide an automatic system that will support a physician in the diagnosing process. By applying LBDWT in connection with MLPNN, we obtained novel and reliable classifier architecture. The comparisons between the developed classifiers were primarily based on analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves as well as a number of scalar performance measures pertaining to the classification. The MLPNN based classifier outperformed the LR based counterpart. Within the same group, the MLPNN based classifier was more accurate than the LR based classifier. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In many cases the classifiers that were painstakingly developed in the controlled laboratory environment become unreliable with increased mobility of the user. In addition to increased mobility, many real world scenarios impose constraints on data collection that cannot be accommodated by the lab-created classifier. Addressing these issues throughout the development process of EEG-based classifiers by building hardware, software, and algorithms intended for use in the real world should result in more dependable classifiers. With this approach we were able to collect and classify data on a research vessel at sea, in the desert by night, on dismounted soldiers in the training field, and everywhere between.

We performed 18-channel COEEG in 84 children and adolescents with diagnosed (group 1, n = 49) or suspected (group 2, n = 35) epilepsy. Mean recording time was 1.4 days. Overall, COEEG was useful in 87% of patients. In group i, events were recorded in 73% of patients and were electrographic seizures in 45%. In group 2, events were detected in 86% of patients and were electrographic seizures in 17%. Nocturnal and partial seizures predominated. Seizure diagnosis and classification by COEEG was concordant with interictal EEG findings in 19% and discordant in 63% of patients. COEEG is a useful technique for the diagnosis of epileptic and nonepileptic events among selected children and adolescents. When compared to routine interictal EEG, COEEG could offer additional accuracy in the classification of seizures in pediatric patients.

Here we investigated whether noninvasive field potentials estimated from the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) using the ELECTRA source localization algorithm could provide real-time decoding of mental states in healthy humans. By means of pattern recognition techniques on 500-ms EEG epochs, we were able to discriminate accurately from single trials which of four categories of visual stimuli the subjects were viewing. Our results show that it is possible to reproduce the decoding accuracy previously obtained in animals with invasive recordings. A comparison between the decoding results and the subjects' behavioral performance indicates that oscillatory activity (OA), elicited in specific brain regions) codes better for the visual stimulus category presented than the subjects' actual response, i.e., is insensitive to voluntary or involuntary errors. The identification of brain regions participating in the decoding process allowed us to construct 3D-functional images of the task-related OA. These images revealed the activation of brain regions known for their involvement in the processing of this type of visual stimuli. Electrical neuroimaging therefore appears to have the potential to establish what the brain is processing while the stimuli are being seen or categorized, i.e., concurrently with sensory-perceptual processes.

A nonparametric statistical approach for EEG segmentation was chosen, because it minimizes the need for a priori information about a signal. The method provides the detection of change-points i.e. boundaries between quasi-stationary EEG segments based on the EEG characteristics within four fundamental frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha and beta). Polysomnographic data of 18 healthy subjects were analyzed. Our findings show that nonparametric change-point segmentation in combination with cluster analysis enables us to obtain a clear picture of the hierarchical macrostructural organization of sleep, which is impossible to deduce from the unsegmented EEG data. Analysis of correlations between classically defined sleep stages and piecewise stationary power step functions reveals that three basic patterns can be distinguished: SWS (stage III/stage IV). stage II and stage I/REM. In accordance with correlation analyses, cluster detection shows that the cyclic sleep patterns during the course of the night become clearly observable by implementation of only three classes. Since the described methodology is based on a minimum of a priori assumptions. it may be useful fur the development of a new sleep classification standard, which goes beyond the established Rechtschaffen and Kales scheme.

It was designed to simulate the patterns of action potentials and EEG waveforms observed in electrophysiological experiments, and has proved its utility as a model for biological intelligence in pattern classification.

Thus, the quality of mental rehearsal, the degree of imagined effort, and mind controllability should have a major effect on the performance of electro-encephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI). It is now well established that mental practice using motor imagery improves motor skills. The effects of mental practice on motor skill learning are the result of practice on central motor programming. According to this view, it seems logical that mental practice should modify the neuronal activity in the primary sensorimotor areas and consequently change the performance of EEG-based BCI. For developing a practical BCI system, recognizing the resting state with eyes opened and the imagined voluntary movement is important. For this purpose, the mind should be able to focus on a single goal for a period of time. without deviation to another context. In this work, we are going to examine the role of mental practice and concentration skills on the EEG control during imaginative hand movements. The results show that the mental practice and concentration can generally improve the classification accuracy of the EEG patterns. It is found that mental training has a significant effect on the classification accuracy over the primary motor cortex and frontal area.

A hidden Markov source model is applied to the evolution of the source signals and is used to estimate the type (left or right) of motor imagery performed by a subject. As a whole, the resulting asynchronous classifier offers significant improvement upon the current prevailing techniques in classification.

In this paper, some limitations of the standard CSP implementation when considering data where phase relationships play a significant role are highlighted. Furthermore, a variant of the CSP method based on the analytic representation of signals is proposed to make up for these drawbacks. The advantages of the proposed method over the standard CSP implementation are demonstrated using simulated data and tests with real EEG data. Specifically, it is shown that the complex-valued spatial filters and the derived spatial patterns can improve the discrimination process and give a more adequate representation of the tasks being considered, respectively.

The mean accuracy was about 75 percent, but we were not able to select universal features for classification of all subjects, because of inter-individual differences in the signal. We also identified correlation between the classification error and the extroversion-introversion personality trait measured by EPQ-R test. Introverts have lower excitation threshold so we are able to detect the differences in their EEG activity with better accuracy. Furthermore, the use of Kohonen's self-organizing map for visualization is suggested and demonstrated on one subject.

Three specific areas of the valence-arousal emotional space are defined, corresponding to negatively excited, positively excited, and calm-neutral states. An acquisition protocol based on the recall of past emotional events has been designed to acquire data from both peripheral and EEG signals. Pattern classification is used to distinguish between the three areas of the valence-arousal space. The performance of two classifiers has been evaluated on different features sets: peripheral data, EEG data, and EEG data with prior feature selection. Comparison of results obtained using either peripheral or EEG signals confirms the interest of using EEG's to assess valence and arousal in emotion recall conditions.

Reorganization of the composition of brain oscillations and their temporal characteristics during opioid withdrawal	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						electroencephalogram (EEG); multiple brain oscillations; probability-classification analysis; opioid dependence; opioid withdrawal; short-term spectral patterns	HEROIN-ADDICTS; HUMAN EEG; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; EARLY ABSTINENCE; DRUG CUES; POWER; METHADONE; NORADRENALINE; VARIABILITY; FREQUENCIES	Majority of the opioid-dependence and withdrawal studies are dominated with many inconsistencies and contradictions. One of the reasons for such inconsistencies may be methodological while performing EEG analysis. To overcome methodological limitations, in the present study we examined the composition of electroencephalographic (EEG) brain oscillations in broad frequency band (0.5-30 Hz) in 13 withdrawal opioid-dependent patients and 14 healthy subjects during resting condition (closed eyes). The exact compositions of brain oscillations and their temporal behaviour were assessed by the probability-classification analysis of short-term EEG spectral patterns (SPs). It was reported that early withdrawal had a generalized effect: the activity in all EEG channels was affected nearly equally. EEG of withdrawal patients was characterized by (a) different dominant SP types (had unique SP types which describe beta-frequency band), (b) increased number of SP types observed in each EEG channel, (c) a larger percentage of alpha(2)-, beta- and poly-rhythmic activity, and by a smaller percentage of delta-, theta- and alpha(1)-rhythmic activity, (d) predominantly right-sided asymmetry and (e) longer periods of temporal stabilization for alpha- and beta- brain oscillations and by shorter periods of temporal stabilization for theta-activity when compared with control subjects. When taken together, these findings suggest a considerable reorganization of composition of brain oscillations, which reflects a disorganization process and an allostatic state with neuronal activation in EEG of opioid withdrawal patients.

The method combines an adaptive genetic algorithm (GA) with the support vector machine (SVM). It integrates the following three key techniques: (1) the feature selection and model parameters of the SVM are optimized synchronously, which constitutes a hybrid optimization; (2) the aim of the hybrid optimization is to improve the classification performance of the SVM; and (3) the hybrid optimization is solved by using the adaptive GA. The method is used to classify three types of EEG signals produced during motor imaginations. It yields 72% classification accuracy, which is higher 8% than the one obtained with the individual optimization of the feature selection and SVM parameters.

We examine a 0.5 s epoch of EEG data using machine learning techniques that, unlike most previous studies, analyze the data in a holistic manner and extracts discriminative spatio-temporal filters. The analysis of the filters suggest sparse feature representation spatially as well as temporally. The filters reveal that the neural activity that discriminates individuals is spatially localized to occipital electrodes located on the scalp above the visual cortex and temporally localized in the interval of 120-200 ms after presentation of the visual stimulus. The results demonstrate the feasibility of EEG-based person identification based on difficult perceptual tasks.

A parametric bispectral estimation for the analysis of EEG signals has been presented as an usful tool for detecting the nonlinearity of EEG signals. The bicoherence patterns is proposed in the paper to extract more, information beyond first and second-order statistics or spectral structur. Several EEG signals with normal subjects in different brain functional states are investigated by employing the non-Gaussian parametric model. The experimental results demonstrate that practical EEG signals provide obvious quadratic nonlinear coupling phenomena. The bicoherence structures of EEG signals is also different from that corresponding to the brain functional states. It is suggest that the bispectral analysis can be used as an effective way for nonlinear analysis and automatic classification of EEG signals and other biomedical measurements.

This system to provide an alternative communication or control channel for patients with severe motor disabilities. Such patients might become able to select target on a computer monitor by moving a cursor through mental activity. The user could move the cursor just through imaging his/her hand operation on mouse without any actual action while the movement direction that he/she wanted to choose was lighted in the cue line of four-direction choice circulation. This system used an adaptive algorithm to recognize cursor control patterns in multichannel EEG frequency spectra. The algorithm included preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. A Fisher ratio was defined to determine the characteristic frequency band. The spectral powering this band was calculated as feature parameter to distinguish the task state of imagination of hand movements (IHM) from free state of non-IHM. Mahalanobis distance classifier was employed to recognize the effective task pattern and produce the trigger signal as cursor controller. Relevant experiment results showed that this system achieved 80% accuracy for IHM task/free pattern classification. This EEG-based mouse system is feasible to drive the cursor's four-direction movement and may provide a new communication and control option for patients with severe motor disabilities.

The diagnosis is clinical and a variable degree of mental retardation is always present. Epilepsy is frequently reported, but a typical electroclinical pattern has not been described. We describe the electroclinical features of eight KS non-Japanese patients with epilepsy. Methods: We analysed seizure characteristics and pattern EEG and clinical outcomes in eight KS patients. Results: All patients presented with focal seizures. A frontal epileptic status was present in two cases. We highlighted the fact that, during evolution, seven patients shared the same interictal EEG pattern, which was characterized by isolated or repetitive biphasic spikes or sharp waves, followed by a slow wave of medium and high voltage, predominantly localised in the fronto-central regions. The natural course of seizures is favourable. Conclusions: Our results showed a peculiar homogeneous electroclinical pattern in KS, characterized by focal seizures more frequently origin in fronto-central area which demonstrated that seizures are mostly focal in type and that a fronto-central origin is more frequently evident.

However, the CSP is difficult to capture the nonlinearly clustered structure from the non-stationary EEG signals. To relax the presumption of strictly linear patterns in the CSP, in this paper, a generalized CSP (GCSP) based on generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) and kernel method is proposed. Our method is able to find the nonlinear spatial filters which are formulated in the feature space defined by a nonlinear mapping through kernel functions. Furthermore, in order to overcome the overfitting problem, the regularized GCSP is developed by adding the regularized parameters. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is an effective nonlinear spatial filtering method.

The EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals of twenty patients are collected from Sri Ramakrishna Hospitals at Coimbatore. The raw EEG signals are sampled and various parameters like energy, energy, variance, peaks, sharp and spike waves, duration, events and covariance. The fuzzy techniques are applied as a first level classifier to classify the risk levels of epilepsy by converting the EEG signal parameters in to code patterns by fuzzy systems. Elman-Chaotic optimization is identified as post classifiers on the classified data to obtain the optimized risk level that characterizes the patient's epilepsy risk level. This classification provides a better way of treating the epileptic patients. This project aims to safeguard a patient's life when critical situation occurs. Future scope is to design an embedded system which collects the raw EEG signals from the brain and directly gives the level of epilepsy. It will make the neural surgeons to give appropriate remedial measures.

Although the analysis is done within defined time windows (cue-based 130), our goal is to work toward an approach which classifies on-going electroencephalogram (EEG) signals without the use of such windows (un-cued 130). To that end, we provide some elements of that analysis related to timing issues that will become important as we pursue this goal in the future. A new set of features called complex band power (CBP) features which make explicit use of phase are introduced and are shown to produce good results. As reference methods we used traditional band power features and the method of common spatial patterns. We consider also for the first time in the context of a four-class problem the issue of variability of the features over time and how much data is required to give good classification results. We do this in a practical way where training data precedes testing data in time.

Classification of burst and suppression in the neonatal electroencephalogram	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							PROGNOSTIC VALUE; EEG; PATTERNS	Fisher's linear discriminant (FLD), a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector machine (SVM) were compared with respect to their ability to distinguish bursts from suppressions in electroencephalograms (EEG) displaying a burst-suppression pattern. Five features extracted from the EEG were used as inputs. The study was based on EEG signals from six full-term infants who had suffered from perinatal asphyxia, and the methods have been trained with reference data classified by an experienced electroencephalographer. The results are summarized as the area under the curve (AUC), derived from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) Curves for the three methods. Based on this, the SVM performs slightly better than the others. Testing the three methods with combinations of increasing numbers of the five features shows that the SVM handles the increasing amount of information better than the other methods.

Subjects performed motor tasks by either physical movement or motor imagery. Spatial filtering, temporal filtering, feature selection and classification methods were explored to support accurate computer pattern recognition. The performance was evaluated by both offline classification and online two-dimensional cursor control. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) and post-movement event-related synchronization (ERS) were observed on the contralateral hemisphere to the moving hand for both physical movement and motor imagery. The offline classification of four motor tasks provided 10-fold cross-validation accuracy as high as 88% for physical movement and 73% for motor imagery. Subjects participating in experiments with physical movement were able to complete the online game with the average accuracy of 85.5 +/- 4.65%; Subjects participating in motor imagery study also completed the game successfully. The proposed brain-computer interface (BCI) provided a new practical multi-dimensional method by noninvasive EEG signal associated with human natural behavior, which does not need long-term training.

Analysis of Fuzzy Techniques and Neural Networks (RBF&MLP) in Classification of Epilepsy Risk Levels from EEG Signals	IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG signals; Epilepsy; Fuzzy logic; Radial basis function; Multilayer perceptron neural networks; Risk levels	RECOGNITION	Most research to date using hybrid systems (Fuzzy-Neuro) focused on the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP). Alternative neural network approaches such as the Radial Basis Function (RBF) network, and their representations appear to have received relatively little attention. Here we focus on RBF network as an optimizer for classification of epilepsy risk level obtained from the fuzzy techniques using the EEG signals parameters. The obtained risk level patterns from fuzzy techniques are found to have low values of Performance Index (PI) and Quality Value (QV). These neural networks are trained and tested with 480 patterns extracted from three epochs of sixteen channel EEG signals of ten known epilepsy patients. Different architectures of MLP and RBF networks are compared based on the minimum Mean Square Error (MSE), the better networks In MLP (16-16-1) and RBF (1-16-1)are selected. RBF out performs the MLP network and fuzzy techniques with the high Quality Value of 23.98 when compared to the Quality Values of 16.92 and 6.25.

A longitudinal study of how voluntary training of specific electro cortical activity produces any stable changes in the electroencephalogram is also presented. Correlations of these changes with short term memory are also hypothesized. In this work the human brain was seen as an electrochemical machine capable of receiving stimuli and adapt accordingly. So, only relevant EEG activity was fed back to the trainee by a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) in an intelligible way, allowing the identification of phasic changes in the EEG and what cognitive state caused it. The results from this study showed that it is possible to learn to change some rhythmical activity in the EEG, in this case the alpha activity, after a few feedback sessions. A positive relation between this frequency band and cognitive processes was also observed. These results also indicate that the proposed EEG biofeedback protocol can be shaped as a tool for those who rely on BCI to communicate with the external world as it allows the tracking and training of individual frequency bands.

The exact compositions of brain oscillations and their percent ratio were assessed by the probability-classification analysis of short-term EEG spectral patients, which results in the probability-classification profile (PCP). Within sessions the PCPs are found to be stable, as reflected by a relatively low coefficient of variability, and between sessions the PCPs are highly reproducible. Finally, test-retest reliability of subject's PCPs shows a dependency on task, being higher for the memory task, and in particular for the encoding stage. It was Suggested that these findings support and strengthen the superposition principle where integrative brain functions are manifested in the superposition of distributed multiple oscillations.

Developmental studies inform debates about the specificity of social functions in the adult cortex. This review highlights recent work, mainly based on electroencephalography/event-related potential methods, examining the precursors of the human social brain network during infancy in several domains such as face and eye gaze processing, the perception of emotions, decoding biological motion, perceiving human actions and joint attention. The findings illustrate that the human brain is fundamentally adapted to develop within a social context, and that this context contributes to many of the specializations seen in the adult cortex.

Five patterns were searched for. slow-delta and theta wave predominance in the background electro-encephalogram (EEG) activity, presence of sleep spindles in the EEG, presence of rapid eye movements in an electro-oculogram; and presence of muscle tone in an electromyogram. The performance of the automated system was measured indirectly by evaluating sleep staging, based on the experts' accepted methodology, to relate the detected patterns in infants over four months of post-term age. The set of sleep-waking classes included wakefulness, REM sleep and non-REM sleep stages I, II, and III-IV. Several noise and artifact rejection methods were implemented, including filters, fuzzy quality indices, windows of variable sizes and detectors of limb movements and wakefulness. Eleven polysomnographic recordings of healthy infants were studied. The ages of the subjects ranged from 6 to 13 months old. Six recordings counting 2665 epochs were included in the training set. Results on a test set (2369 epochs from five recordings) show an overall agreement of 87.7% (kappa 0.840) between the automated system and the human expert. These results show significant improvements compared with previous work.

The approach is exemplified in the frame of the brain-computer interface, which crucially depends on the classification of different brain states. To classify two brain states, e.g. planning of movement of right and left index fingers, three different approaches are compared: classification using a physiologically motivated set of four electrodes, a set determined by principal component analysis and electrodes determined by spatial pattern analysis. Spatial pattern analysis enhances the classification rate significantly from 61.3 +/- 1.8% (with four electrodes) to 71.8 +/- 1.4%, whereas the classification rate using principal component analysis is significantly lower (65.2 +/- 1.4%). Most of the 61 electrodes used have no influence on the classification rate, so that, in future experiments, the setup can be simplified drastically to six to eight electrodes without loss of information.

In the human EEG they are reflected by multiple ictal patterns, where epileptic seizures typically become apparent as characteristic, usually rhythmic signals, often coinciding with or even preceding the earliest observable changes in behavior. Their detection at the earliest observable onset of ictal patterns in the EEG can, thus, be used to start more-detailed diagnostic procedures during seizures and to differentiate epileptic seizures from other conditions with seizure-like symptoms. Recently, warning and intervention systems triggered by the detection of ictal EEG patterns have attracted increasing interest. Since the workload involved in the detection of seizures by human experts is quite formidable, several attempts have been made to develop automatic seizure detection systems. So far, however, none of these found widespread application. Here, we present a novel procedure for generic, online, and real-time automatic detection of multimorphologic ictal-patterns in the human long-term EEG and its validation in continuous, routine clinical EEG recordings from 57 patients with a duration of approximately 43 hours and additional 1,360 hours of seizure-free EEG data for the estimation of the false alarm rates. We analyzed 91 seizures (37 focal, 54 secondarily generalized) representing the six most common ictal morphologies (alpha, beta, theta, and delta- rhythmic activity, amplitude depression, and polyspikes). We found that taking the seizure morphology into account plays a crucial role in increasing the detection performance of the system. Moreover, besides enabling a reliable (mean false alarm rate <0.5/h, for specific ictal morphologies <0.25/h), early and accurate detection (average correct detection rate >96%) within the first few seconds of ictal patterns in the EEG, this procedure facilitates the automatic categorization of the prevalent seizure morphologies without the necessity to adapt the proposed system to specific patients.

The first approach applies detection criteria on the sigma-band filtered EEG signal, including fuzzy thresholds. The second approach mimics an expert's procedure. A sleep spindle detection is validated if both approaches agree. The method was applied on a testing set, consisting of continuous sleep recordings of two patients, totaling 1132 epochs (pages).

In this paper we show how characteristic local patterns (motifs) can improve the classification accuracy. We introduce a new motif class, generalized semi-continuous motifs. To allow flexibility and noise robustness, these motifs may include gaps of various lengths, generic and more specific wildcards. We propose an efficient algorithm for mining generalized sequential motifs. In experiments on real medical data, we show how generalized semi-continuous motifs improve the accuracy of SVMs and Bayesian Networks for time series classification.

In this framework, it was suggested that EEG patterns can be better detected with EEG data transformed with Surface Laplacian computation (SL) than with the unprocessed raw potentials. However, accurate SL estimates require the use of many EEG electrodes, when local estimation methods are used. Since BCI devices have to use a limited number of electrodes for practical reasons, we investigated the performances of spline methods for SL estimates using a limited number of electrodes (low resolution SQ. Recognition of mental activity was attempted on both raw and SL-transformed EEG data from five healthy people performing two mental tasks, namely imagined right and left hand movements. Linear classifiers were used including Signal Space Projection (SSP) and Fisher's linear discriminant. Results showed an acceptable average correlation between the waveforms obtained with the low resolution SL and these obtained with the SL computed from 26 electrodes (full resolution SL). More importantly, satisfactorily recognition scores for mental EEG-patterns were obtained with the low-resolution surface Laplacian transformation of the recorded potentials when compared with those obtained by using full resolution SL (82%). These results demonstrated also the utility of linear classifiers for the detection of mental patterns in the BCI field. (C) 2001 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. Ali rights reserved.

The major hurdle in the EEG based BCI is that the EEG signals are unique to each individual. This complicates a universal BCI design. On the contrary, this disadvantage is the advantage when it comes to using EEG signals from imagined activities for biometric applications. Therefore, in this paper, EEG signals from imagined activities are proposed as a biometric to identify the individuality of persons. The approach is based on the classification of EEG signals recorded when a user performs either one or several mental activities (up to five). As different individuals have different thought processes, this idea would be appropriate for individual identification. To increase the inter-subject differences, EEG data from six electrodes are used instead of one. A total of 108 features (autoregressive coefficients, channel spectral powers, interhemispheric channel spectral power differences and inter-hemispheric channel linear complexity values) are computed from each EEG segment for each mental activity and classified by a linear discriminant classifier using a modified 10 fold cross validation procedure, which gave perfect classification when tested on 500 EEG patterns from five subjects. This initial study has shown the huge potential of the method over existing biometric identification systems as it is impossible to be faked.

The classifier systems indicate results comparable to human classification, or human intervention, with substantial reduction of time and resources. This study presents a methodology for evaluation of an ANN performance using the ROC curve. The statistical performance indexes and the ROC curve are obtained during the supervised training of the ANN FF classifier. The methodology presented was used in the performance evaluation of an ANN classifier of epileptiform events in raw EEG data.

Up to now, various methods based on electroencephalogram (EEG) are proposed to solve this problem. However, most of them are static methods and are based on supervised learning strategy. The main deficiencies of the existing methods are that the label information is hard to get and the time dependency of vigilance changes are ignored. In this paper, we introduce the dynamic characteristics of vigilance changes into vigilance estimation and propose a novel model based on linear dynamical system and manifold learning techniques to implement off-line and on-line vigilance estimation. In this model, both spatial information of EEG and temporal information of vigilance changes are used. The label information what we need is merely to know which EEG indices are important for vigilance estimation. Experimental results show that the mean off-line and on-line correlation coefficients between estimated vigilance level and local error rate in second-scale without being averaged are 0.89 and 0.83, respectively.

Distinguishing childhood absence epilepsy patients from controls by the analysis of their background brain electrical activity. J. Neurosci. Methods 2009:177:461-68], we extend the analysis of background electroencephalography (EEG), recorded with scalp electrodes in a clinical setting, in children with childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) and control individuals. The same set of individuals was considered-five CAE patients. all right-handed females and aged 6-8 years. The EEG was obtained using bipolar connections from a standard 10-20 electrode placement. The functional activity between electrodes was evaluated using a wavelet decomposition in conjunction with the Wootters distance. In the previous study, a Kruskal-Wallis statistical test was used to select the pairs of electrodes with differentiated behavior between CAE and control samples (classes). In this contribution, we present the results for a combinatorial optimization approach to select the pairs of electrodes. The new method produces a better separation between the classes, and at the same time uses a smaller number of features (pairs of electrodes). It managed to almost halve the number of features and also improves the separation between the CAE and control samples. The new results strengthen the hypothesis that mostly fronto-central electrodes carry useful information and patterns that can help to discriminate CAE cases from controls. Finally, we provide a comprehensive set of tests and in-depth explanation of the method and results. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This is very important because links to the fact of the improvement of the noninvasive technologies in the last decade respect to the invasive one [1]. Those things together could be the beginning of a new way to understand the use of Bel's (Brain Computer Interface). There are a lot of studies that show us good results in the EEG movement decoding using invasive technologies [2] but a lot of people in the scientist community have been demonstrated very good accuracy in noninvasive technology. In this paper we show a BCI system which translates the record EEG signal into a robotic arm and hand movement. The EEG information has been recorded during a cognitive test task. This support us the optimal situation to connect a hardware anthropomorphic ann/hand to the decoding information system, with the aim to this hardware ann/hand does the same original recorded movement.

The exact compositions of EEG oscillations and their temporal behaviour were assessed using the probabilityclassification analysis of short-term EEG spectral pattems. The study reveals the dynamics of particular EEG oscillations throughout the conditions of opioid dependency, withdrawal and methadone-based treatment. It was shown that methadone maintenance treatment normalized considerably the composition of EEG oscillations and their percentage ratio and restored the temporal structure of patients' EEG comparable with healthy subjects. The importance of the methadone's ability to restore a normal temporal structure of the brain's activity is discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, during the performance of a particular mental task, different factors such as concentration, attention, level of consciousness and the difficulty of the task, may be affecting the changes in the EEG activity. Accordingly, training the subject to consistently and reliably produce and control the changes in the EEG signals is a critical issue in developing a BCI system. In this work, we used meditation practice to enhance the mind controllability during the performance of a mental task in a BCI system. The mental states to be discriminated are the imaginative hand movement and the idle state. The experiments were conducted on two groups of subject, meditation group and control group. The time-frequency analysis of EEG signals for meditation practitioners showed an event-related desynchronization (ERD) of beta rhythm before imagination during resting state. In addition, a strong event-related synchronization (ERS) of beta rhythm was induced in frequency around 25 Hz during hand motor imagery. The results demonstrated that the meditation practice can improve the classification accuracy of EEG patterns. The average classification accuracy was 88.73% in the meditation group, while it was 70.28% in the control group. An accuracy as high as 98.0% was achieved in the meditation group.

It is natural in the sense of that the desired movement is what the subject intends to do. The motor tasks to be intended are the imagination of hand grasping and opening. For prosthetic hand grasp control, the discrimination of the resting state and the imagined voluntary movement is important that has been disregarded in the research area of BCI. This work provides a design for discriminating the resting state and the motor task imagery. To date most researchers have designed and test BCI system on normal subjects. In this work, the experiments were conducted on people with severe physical disabilities. One of the major problem in developing real-time BCI is the eye blink suppression. In this work, the eye blink artifact is suppressed by a neural adaptive noise canceller. This is a concern in real time application. We employ the multilayer perceptron with back-propagation learning rule for EEG classification. Preliminary results indicate that the classification accuracy of the EEG patterns at primary motor cortex and occipito-temporal recording sites is higher than that at other sites. An average correct classification rate of 83% is achieved using samples of the single-channel EEG signal.

Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Human Intention Understanding in Temporo-Parietal Cortex: A Combined EEG/fMRI Repetition Suppression Paradigm	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Inferring the intentions of other people from their actions recruits an inferior fronto-parietal action observation network as well as a putative social network that includes the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS). However, the functional dynamics within and among these networks remains unclear. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and high-density electroencephalogram (EEG), with a repetition suppression design, to assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of decoding intentions. Suppression of fMRI activity to the repetition of the same intention was observed in inferior frontal lobe, anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), and right STS. EEG global field power was reduced with repeated intentions at an early (starting at 60 ms) and a later (similar to 330 ms) period after the onset of a hand-on-object encounter. Source localization during these two intervals involved right STS and aIPS regions highly consistent with RS effects observed with fMRI. These results reveal the dynamic involvement of temporal and parietal networks at multiple stages during the intention decoding and without a strict segregation of intention decoding between these networks.

Utilizing Secondary Input from Passive Brain-Computer Interfaces for Enhancing Human-Machine Interaction	FOUNDATIONS OF AUGMENTED COGNITION, PROCEEDINGS: NEUROERGONOMICS AND OPERATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Foundation of Augmented Cognition	JUL 19-24, 2009	San Diego, CA				SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; CLASSIFICATION	A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) directly translates patterns of brain activity to input for controlling a machine. The introduction of methods from statistical machine learning [1] to the field of brain-computer interfacing (BCI) had a deep impact on classification accuracy. It also minimized the effort needed to build up the skill of controlling a BCI system [2]. This enabled other fields of research to adapt methods from BCI research for their own purposes [3, 4]. Team PhyPA, the research group for physiological parameters of the chair for Human-Machine Systems (HMS) of the Technical University of Berlin, focuses on enabling new communication channels for HMS. Especially the use of passive BCIs (pBCI) [3, 4], not dependent on any intended action of the user, show a high potential for enhancing the interaction in HMS (5]. Additionally, as actual classification rates are still below the threshold for efficient primary control [6, 7] in HMS, we focus oil establishing a secondary, BCI-based communication channel. This kind of interaction does not necessarily disturb the primary mode of interaction, providing a low usage cost and hence an efficient way of enhancement. We have designed several applications following this approach. Here we are going to present briefly the results from two studies, which show the capabilities arising from the use of passive and secondary BCI interaction. First, we show that a pBCI call be utilized to gain valuable information about HMSs, which are hard to detect by exogeneous factors. By mimicking a typical BCI interaction, we have been able to identify and isolate a factor inducing non-stationarities with a deep impact on the feature dynamics. The retained information can be utilized for automatically triggered classifier adaptation. And second, we show that pBCIs are indeed capable to enhance common HMS interaction outside the laboratory. With this, we would like to feed back our experiences made with the use of BCIs for HMS. We hope to povide new and useful information about brain dynamics which might be helpful for ongoing research in augmented cognition.	[Zander, T.

This work also aims to optimize the EEG signal analysis through the improvement of classifiers and, eventually, of the BCI performance. In this paper a novel exploratory approach for data mining on EEG signal based on continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) and wavelet coherence (WC) statistical analysis is introduced and applied. The CWT allows the signal underlying information content illustration by representing time-frequency patterns on Wavelet Coherence qualitative analysis. Results suggest that the proposed methodology is capable of identifying regions on time-frequency spectrum during the specified task on BCI. Furthermore, an example of a region is identified, and the patterns were classified using a radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN). This innovative characteristic of the process justify the feasibility of the proposed approach on another data mining applications. It can open new physiologic researches on this field and researches on different non-stationary time series analysis.				tbassani@ppgia.pucpr.br; nievola@ppgia.pucpr.br	Nievola, Julio C/C-2244-2008; Nievola, Julio Cesar/R-2535-2019	Nievola, Julio Cesar/0000-0002-2212-4499					18	0	0	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-4244-1778-0				2008							6	12						7	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Medical Informatics	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science; Engineering; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Medical Informatics	BIY61					2022-08-02	WOS:000263713400002

Therefore they could provide a new communication and control option for paralyzed patients. Modern BCI technology is essentially based on techniques for the classification of single-trial brain signals. Here we present a novel technique that allows the simultaneous optimization of a spatial and a spectral filter enhancing discriminability rates of multichannel EEG single-trials. The evaluation of 60 experiments involving 22 different subjects demonstrates the significant superiority of the proposed algorithm over to its classical counterpart: the median classification error rate was decreased by 11%. Apart from the enhanced classification, the spatial and/or the spectral filter that are determined by the algorithm can also be used for further analysis of the data, e.g., for source localization of the respective brain rhythms.

Starting with the 1989 international classification, and the diagnostic scheme proposed by Engel in 2001, we tried to assess the respective relevance of clinical and EEG data. Our experience is mostly about the early assessment of infants, children and adolescents, and less about epileptic disorders in adults. in << generalized >> epilepsies and syndromes, EEG and clinical assessment appear to have equal value. However, in focal epilepsies, early EEG findings may have a higher value in diagnosis and especially in prognosis. There are also specific etiologies, e. g. in focal cortical dysplasias, where the EEG may suggest the diagnosis even before MRI In some chromosomal disorders (ring chromosome 20 being the example of choice, but other entities are also concerned), specific EEG aspects may lead to diagnosis on their own.

This consideration was tested successfully using the nonlinear dynamics tools, like the computation of Lyapunov exponents. This paper presented the usage of statistics over the set of the Lyapunov exponents in order to reduce the dimensionality of the extracted feature vectors. Since classification is more accurate when the pattern is simplified through representation by important features, feature extraction and selection play an important role in classifying systems such as neural networks. Multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) architectures were formulated and used as basis for detection of electroencephalographic changes. Three types of EEG signals (EEG signals recorded from healthy volunteers with eyes open, epilepsy patients in the epileptogenic zone during a seizure-free interval, and epilepsy patients during epileptic seizures) were classified. The selected Lyapunov exponents of the EEG signals were used as inputs of the MLPNN trained with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The classification results confirmed that the proposed MLPNN has potential in detecting the electroencephalographic changes.

However, the extraction of key features from massive EEG data for mental fatigue identification remains a challenge. The objective of this study is to identify the key EEG features in relationship to mental fatigue, from a broad pool of EEG features generated by quantitative EEG (qEEG) techniques, using Random Forests (RF), which is a recently developed machine learning algorithm. The method is applied to key EEG feature extraction for 5-level mental fatigue identification using the five subjects' EEG data recorded in 25-hour fatigue experiments. RF produces significant feature reduction with little compromise of the classification performance. The identified key EEG features also indicate that electrode locations in frontal and occipital regions of the brain are most important for adequate representation of the deactivation of functional lobes of the brain, which is consistent with the anatomical areas known to be involved in mental fatigue. It is also interesting to discover that the four frequency bands are all important for the mental fatigue identification.

J	Ince, NF; Tewfik, AH; Arica, S				Ince, Nuri F.; Tewfik, Ahmed H.; Arica, Sami			Extraction subject-specific motor imagery time-frequency patterns for single trial EEG classification	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						brain-computer interface; cosine packets; local discriminant bases; time-frequency analysis; motor imagery		We introduce a new adaptive time-frequency plane feature extraction strategy for the segmentation and classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) corresponding to left and right hand motor imagery of a brain-computer interface task. The proposed algorithm adaptively segments the time axis by dividing the EEG data into non-uniform time segments over a dyadic tree. This is followed by grouping the expansion coefficients in the frequency axis in each segment. The most discriminative features are selected from the segmented time-frequency plane and fed to a linear discriminant for classification. The proposed algorithm achieved an average classification accuracy of 84.3% on six subjects by selecting the most discriminant subspaces for each one. For comparison, classification results based on an autoregressive model are also presented where the mean accuracy of the same subjects turned out to be 79.5%. Interestingly the subjects and two hemispheres of each subject are represented by distinct segmentations and features. This indicates that the proposed method can handle inter-subject variability when constructing brain-computer interfaces. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, frequency optimization combined with CSP has only been investigated by a few groups In this paper, a frequency-weighted method (FWM) is proposed to optimize the frequency spectrum of surface electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for a two-class mental task classification This straightforward method computes a weight value for each frequency component according to its importance for the discrimination task and reforms the spectrum with the computed weights. The off-line analysis shows that the proposed method achieves an improvement of about 4% (averaged over 24 datasets) in terms of cross-validation accuracy over the basic CSP.

Recordings were obtained using 43 EEG and 3 guard electrodes then visually edited and spatially filtered to remove extracerebral artifacts. Twenty 1-sec artifact-free epochs were obtained and analyzed from 42 and 60 subjects during WF and DL respectively. Of these subjects, 20 were placed in a training set and the remainder into a test set. The baseline for the comparison of the two tasks was established by factoring the average cross-spectral matrices of the training-set EEGs, computed in the theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands into spatial patterns common to the two tasks. Only those spatial patterns that contributed to the correct classification of subjects in the test set were included in the source analysis. The source-current density distributions were obtained using the LORETA-KEY(C) algorithm. The results show that the source-current density distribution is related to the putative functional activity in the brain in all three frequency bands. The electrical effects of the tasks are both most highly localized and lateralized in the theta band. The effects in the alpha and beta bands are much more generalized and are strongly lateralized only during one and the other of the tasks respectively. The conclusion is that WF is mainly a left central and bilateral frontal cerebral process while DL is mainly a right central and bilateral posterior cerebral process. Hum.

To overcome this problem, automatic EEG analysis using Fourier Transform methods are popular since most EEG signals consist of spectral power in the range of delta, theta, alpha and beta i.e from 0 to 30 Hz. But this method suffers from high noise sensitivity and is not suitable for short and variable length of signal segments. In this paper, we analyse EEG signals with time series analysis using autoregression techniques. We classify these extracted features for different mental tasks using a Fuzzy ARTMAP classifier. We study the effects of different EEG segment or window lengths and different overlapping lengths on the overall performance of the classifier. Our results show that the segment length affects the performance and that overlapping the segments improves the performance greatly.

Using a 32 channel recording device, mental command data was collected from 10 participants. This data was used to classify three different mental commands, to supplement the five commands already available using head movement control. Of the 32 channels that were recorded only 4 were used in the classification, achieving an average classification rate of 82%. This paper also demonstrates that there is an advantage to be gained by doing adaptive training of the classifier. That is, customizing the classifier to a person previously unseen by the classifier caused their average recognition rates to improve from 52.5% up to 77.5%.	[Craig, D. A.; Nguyen, H.

Regularized Common Spatial Patterns with Generic Learning for EEG Signal Classification	2009 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	SEP 03-06, 2009	Minneapolis, MN	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; SAMPLE	The common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm is commonly used to extract discriminative spatial filters for the classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in the context of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, CSP is based on a sample-based covariance matrix estimation. Therefore, its performance is limited when the number of available training samples is small. In this paper, the CSP method is considered in such a small-sample setting. We propose a regularized common spatial patterns (R-CSP) algorithm by incorporating the principle of generic learning. The covariance matrix estimation in R-CSP is regularized through two regularization parameters to increase the estimation stability while reducing the estimation bias due to limited number of training samples. The proposed method is tested on data set IVa of the third BCI competition and the results show that R-CSP can outperform the classical CSP algorithm by 8.5% on average. Moreover, the regularization introduced is particularly effective in the small-sample setting.

Initial structure identification has been recognized as a crucial stage in the design of an interval T2FL (IT2FL) classifier utilized in the framework of electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain - computer interface (BCI). In conjunction with an efficient gradient-based learning algorithm it has allowed for robust exploitation of T2FL's capabilities to effectively handle uncertainties inherently associated with changing dynamics of electrical brain activity. This paper builds on the previous experiences in tackling the problem of inter-session classification of motor imagery (NH)related EEG patterns. The major contribution of this work is an empirical investigation of the concept of support vector (SV) learning applied to structure identification of the IT2FL classifier. The SV-enhanced initialization scheme is found to compare favorably to both an arbitrary initialization and the clustering approach utilized in the preceding work in terms of the inter-session BCI classification performance of the fully trained IT2FLS evaluated on three subjects.

Here we use Granger causation analyzes of high spatiotemporal resolution neural activation data derived from the integration of magnetic resonance imaging, magneto-encephalography and electroencephalography, to examine the role of lexical and articulatory mediation in listeners' ability to use phonetic context to compensate for place assimilation. Listeners heard two-word phrases such as pen pad and then saw two pictures, from which they had to select the one that depicted the phrase. Assimilation, lexical competitor environment and the phonological validity of assimilation context were all manipulated. Behavioral data showed an effect of context on the interpretation of assimilated segments. Analysis of 40 Hz gamma phase locking patterns identified a large distributed neural network including 16 distinct regions of interest (ROIs) spanning portions of both hemispheres in the first 200 ms of post-assimilation context. Granger analyzes of individual conditions showed differing patterns of causal interaction between ROIs during this interval, with hypothesized lexical and articulatory structures and pathways driving phonetic activation in the posterior superior temporal gyrus in assimilation conditions, but not in phonetically unambiguous conditions. These results lend strong support for the motor theory of speech perception, and clarify the role of lexical mediation in the phonetic processing of assimilated speech. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

For recording epileptic activity, however, EEG has not lost its clinical relevance because it is able to capture the characteristic pathological synchronization phenomena underlying epileptic activity. Digital methods of registration and evaluation have improved the precision of EEG interpretations and led to improved sensitivity and specificity in the identification of epileptiform activity. EEG remains indispensable for diagnosis, syndromatic classification, monitoring of therapy and localization of foci. In order to interpret EEG properly, however, a good knowledge regarding the limits of EEG interpretation is of critical importance; this refers especially to the sensitivity and specificity of epileptiform patterns, the spatial resolution of surface EEG, syndromatic specificity, and individual prognostic value depending on the epilepsy syndrome and the treatment setting. This review describes these aspects while aiming at a targeted and valid clinical use of EEG diagnostics.

J	Maganti, R; Gerber, P; Drees, C; Chung, S				Maganti, Rama; Gerber, Paula; Drees, Cornelia; Chung, Steve			Nonconvulsive status epilepticus	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Review						status epilepticus; nonconvulsive status; nonconvulsive status epilepticus	REFRACTORY STATUS EPILEPTICUS; GENERALIZED STATUS EPILEPTICUS; CONVULSIVE STATUS EPILEPTICUS; PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE-CARE; NEURON-SPECIFIC ENOLASE; PERIODIC EEG PATTERNS; CRITICALLY-ILL; CLINICAL-FEATURES; INTRAVENOUS VALPROATE; TRIPHASIC WAVES	Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is a heterogeneous disorder with multiple subtypes. Although attempts have been made to define and classify this disorder, there is yet no universally accepted definition or classification that encompasses all subtypes or electroclinical scenarios. Developing such a classification scheme is becoming increasingly important, because NCSE is more common than previously thought, with a bimodal peak, in children and the elderly. Recent studies have also shown a high incidence of NCSE in the critically ill. Although strong epidemiological data are lacking, NCSE constitutes about 25-50% of all cases of status epilepticus. For the purposes of this review, we propose an etiological classification for NCSE including NCSE in metabolic disorders, NCSE in coma, NCSE in acute cerebral lesions, and NCSE in those with preexisting epilepsy with or without epileptic encephalopathy. NCSE is still underrecognized, yet potentially fatal if untreated. Diagnosis can be established using an electroencephalogram (EEG) in most cases, sometimes requiring continuous monitoring. However, in comatose patients, diagnosis can be difficult, and the EEG can show a variety of rhythmic or periodic patterns, some of which are of unclear significance. Although some subtypes of NCSE are easily treatable, such as absence status epilepticus, others do not respond well to treatment, and debate exists over how aggressively clinicians should treat NCSE. In particular, the appropriate treatment of NCSE in patients who are critically ill and/or comatose is not well established, and large-scale trials are needed. Overall, further work is needed to better define NCSE, to determine which EEG patterns represent NCSE, and to establish treatment paradigms for different subtypes of NCSE. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

J	Herman, P; Prasad, G; McGinnity, TM; Coyle, D				Herman, Pawel; Prasad, Girijesh; McGinnity, Thomas Martin; Coyle, Damien			Comparative analysis of spectral approaches to feature extraction for EEG-based motor imagery classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						alternative communication; brain-computer interface (BCI); electroencephalogram (EEG); spectral analysis; time-frequency (t-f) analysis; wavelet transforms	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; FEATURE-SELECTION	The quantification of the spectral content of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings has a substantial role in clinical and scientific applications. It is of particular relevance in the analysis of event-related brain oscillatory responses. This work is focused on the identification and quantification of relevant frequency patterns in motor imagery (MI) related EEGs utilized for brain-computer interface (BCI) purposes. The main objective of the paper is to perform comparative analysis of different approaches to spectral signal representation such as power spectral density (PSD) techniques, atomic decompositions, time-frequency (t-f) energy distributions, continuous and discrete wavelet approaches, from which band power features can be extracted and used in the framework of MI classification. The emphasis is on identifying discriminative properties of the feature sets representing EEG trials recorded during imagination of either left- or right-hand movement. Feature separability is quantified in the offline study using the classification accuracy (CA) rate obtained with linear and nonlinear classifiers. PSD approaches demonstrate the most consistent robustness and effectiveness in extracting the distinctive spectral patterns for accurately discriminating between left and right MI induced EEGs. This observation is based on an analysis of data recorded from eleven subjects over two sessions of BCI experiments. In addition, generalization capabilities of the classifiers reflected in their intersession performance are discussed in the paper.

Psychophysiological research on mental workload uses measures such as electroencephalogram (EEG), cardiac, eye-blink, and respiration measures to identify mental workload levels. This paper reports a research effort whose primary objective was to determine if one parsimonious set of salient psychophysiological features can be identified to accurately classify mental workload levels across multiple test subjects performing a multiple task battery. To accomplish this objective, a stepwise multivariate discriminant analysis heuristic and artificial neural network feature selection with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are used. In general, EEG power in the 31-40-Hz frequency range and ocular input features appeared highly salient. The second objective was to assess the feasibility of a single model to classify mental workload across different subjects. A classification accuracy of 87% was obtained for seven independent validation subjects using neural network models trained with data from other subjects. This result provides initial evidence for the potential use of generalized classification models in multitask workload assessment.

We conducted an electroencephalogram (EEG) in which volunteers identified the success or failure of a task. We confirmed that there were differences in the EEG depending on whether the task was successful or not and suggested that ERP might be used as a reward of reinforcement leaning. We used a support vector machine (SVM) for recognizing the P300. We selected the feature vector in SVM that was composed of averages of each 50 ms for each of the six channels (C3,Cz,C4,P3,Pz,P4) for a total of 700 ms. We can suggest that reinforcement learning using P300 can be performed accurately.

J	Polat, K; Guenes, S				Polat, Kemal; Guenes, Salih			A novel data reduction method: Distance based data reduction and its application to classification of epileptiform EEG signals	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						EEG signals; distance based data reduction; AR spectral analysis; discrete Fourier transform; discrete wavelet transform (DWT); C4.5 decision tree classifier; epileptic seizure	SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; SPIKE DETECTION; WAVELET; SELECTION; ORDER; FUZZY	Objective: Data reduction methods are a crucial step affecting both performance and computation time of classification systems in pattern recognition applications such as medical decision making systems, intelligent control, and data clustering. The aim of this study is both to increase the classification accuracy and decrease the computation time of classifier system on the classification of epileptiform EEG signals. Methods: In this study, we have proposed a novel data reduction method based on distances between groups data double in all dataset and applied this method to the classification of epileptiform EEG signals. The feature extraction methods including autoregressive (AR), discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and discrete wavelet transform (DWT), distance based data reduction, and C4.5 decision tree classifier have been combined to classify the epileptiform EEG signals. As feature extraction part AR, DFT, and DWT methods have been used to determine the features about EEG signals including epileptic seizure patients and eyes open volunteers. As data pre-processing part, distance based data reduction that is proposed firstly by us has been used to reduce data determined by spectral analysis methods (AR, DFT, and DWT). As final part called classification, C4.5 decision tree classifier has been used to classify reduced epileptiform EEG signals. Results: To validate and test the proposed data reduction, the classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specifity analysis, computation time, 10-fold cross-validation, and 95% confidence intervals have been used in this study. Six different combined methods have been used to classify the epileptiform EEG signal. These methods are (i) combining DFT and C4.5 decision tree classifier (DCT), (ii) combining DFT, distance based data reduction, and C4.5 DCT, (iii) combining AR and C4.5 DCT, (iv) combining AR, distance based data reduction, and C4.5 DCT, ( v) combining DWT and C4.5 DCT, and ( vi) combining DWT, distance based data reduction, and C4.5 DCT. The classification accuracies and computation times obtained by these methods are 99.02%-79 s, 99.12%-47 s, 99.32%-65 s, 98.94%-45 s, 92.00%-52.06 s, and 89.50%-29.9 s. Conclusions: These results have shown that the proposed distance based data reduction method has produced very promising results with respect to both classification accuracy and computation time for classifying the epileptiform EEG signals. Also, proposed hybrid systems can be used to detect the epileptic seizure. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Extraction of various features from the electroencephalogram (EEG), the electro-oculogram (EOG) and the electromyogram (EMG) processed in the frequency and time domains was achieved using a database of 47 night sleep recordings obtained from healthy adults in laboratory settings. Multiple iterative feature selection and supervised classification methods were applied together with a systematic statistical assessment of the classification performances. Our results show that using a simple set of features such as relative EEG powers in five frequency bands yields an agreement of 71% with the whole database classification of two human experts. These performances are within the range of existing classification systems. The addition of features extracted from the EOG and EMG signals makes it possible to reach about 80% of agreement with the expert classification. The most significant improvement on classification accuracy is obtained on NREM sleep stage 1, a stage of transition between sleep and wakefulness. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Studies on the event-related EEG data indicate that a two-channel version of Omega, Sigma and Phi could reflect the antagonistic ERD/ERS patterns over contralateral and ipsilateral areas and also characterize different phases of the changing brain states in the event-related paradigm. Based on the selective two-channel linear descriptors, the left and right hand motor imagery tasks are classified to obtain satisfactory results, which testify the validity of the three linear descriptors Omega, Sigma and Phi for characterizing event-related EEG. The preliminary results show that Omega, Sigma together with Phi have good separability for left and right hand motor imagery tasks, which could be considered for classification of two classes of EEG patterns in the application of brain computer interfaces.

However, FBCSP is sensitive to outliers because it involves multiple estimations of covariance matrices from EEG measurements. This paper proposes a Robust FBCSP (RFBCSP) algorithm whereby the estimates of the covariance matrices are replaced with the robust Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) estimator. The performance of RFBCSP is investigated on a publicly available dataset and compared against FBCSP using 10x10-fold cross-validation accuracies on training data, and session-to-session transfer kappa values on independent test data. The results showed that RFBCSP yielded improvements in certain subjects and slight improvement in overall performance across subjects. Analysis on one subject who improved suggested that outliers were excluded from the robust covariance matrices estimation. These results revealed a promising direction of RFBCSP for robust classifications of EEG measurements in MI-BCI.

The data obtained were digitally represented as sets of standard parameters of EEG patterns in 0,5-32 Hz diapason (alpha-, beta(1)-, beta(2)-, theta-, delta-rythms). These parameters were compared under different functional tests particularly connected with the control of sensomotor brain activity.

A cinematographic hypothesis of cortical dynamics in perception	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						beta-gamma EEG oscillations; cinematographic brain dynamics; chaotic itinerancy; field theory; phase transitions; pragmatic information; spatial EEG patterns	BACKGROUND EEG ACTIVITY; NEUROBIOLOGICAL THEORY; MULTICORTICAL PATTERNS; STATE TRANSITIONS; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; OLFACTORY EEG; GAMMA EEGS; SCALP EEG; PHASE; SYNCHRONIZATION	The aim of this study was to measure and classify spatial patterns in sensory cortical EEGs relating to conditioned stimuli (CSs) in order to test the hypothesis, based on clinical reports, that cortical dynamics is not continuous but operates in steps that resemble frames in a cinema. Recent advances in the application of the Hilbert Transform to intracranial recordings of the EEG in animals have revealed markers for repetitive phase transitions in neocortex at frame rates in the theta band. The frames were sought in multichannel EEGs that had been recorded from 8 x 8 high-density arrays that were fixed on primary sensory cortices of rabbits trained to discriminate visual, auditory or somatic conditioned stimuli with reinforcement (CS+) or without (CS-). Localization of frames in EEGs was by use of a new index, H-e(t), called "pragmatic information". Each spatial pattern was represented by a feature vector from the 64 analytic amplitudes at a maximal value of HQ) from the Hilbert transform and expressed as a 64 x 1 feature vector specifying a point in 64-space. Classification with respect to CS+/- was by calculation of Euclidean distances of points from centers of gravity of clusters after preprocessing by nonlinear mapping. Stable spatial patterns were found in the form of amplitude modulation (AM) of aperiodic waveforms that included all channels. The impact of a CS on a sensory neocortex reorganized background EEG into two types of sequential patterns of coordinated activity, initially local and modality-specific, later global. The initial stage of phase transitions required 3-7 ms. Large-scale cortical activity then reorganized itself repeatedly and reliably over relatively immense cortical distances within the cycle duration of the center frequency of oscillation. The size, texture, timing, and duration of the AM patterns support the hypothesis that these frames may provide the basis for multisensory percepts (Gestalts). (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Infantile massive spasms (IMS) is an age-dependent epileptic syndrome that appears before the first year, and is characterised by delayed psychomotor development, massive spasms and hypsarrhythmia. There are classifications that only take the electroencephalogram (EEG) into account, without linking it with the IMS-associated crisis pattern which can establish a treatment to improve the recurrence of the crises in this population, according to EEG discoveries and patterns of epileptic fits. Patients and methods. We include 100 EEGs of patients diagnosed with IMS, between 2 and 12 months old, selected by using the classification of Hrachovy to identify classic and modified hypsarrhythmia, and to correlate it with the pattern of epileptic seizures associated with IMS. Results. The hypsarrhythmia found was mainly of the modified variety, and classic hypsarrhythmia only accounted for 9% of cases. The first case presented flexion IMS with generalised tonic seizures, and in the second, generalised tonic seizures and mixed IMS. Start age was between 2 and 4 months old. Conclusions. In comparison with results in other publications, in the EEG it was found that modified hypsarrhythmia with IMS-associated partial and generalised tonic seizures with was the most common, while in the classic variety mixed IMS predominated. It must be taken into account that the absence of this variety does not rule out a diagnosis of IMS, but its presence makes the prognosis worse.

Methods: EEG data was recorded with 64 electrodes from two subjects executing a visuo-spatial attention task indicating two target locations. Continuous Morlet wavelet coefficients were estimated on 18 frequency components and 16 preselected electrodes in trials of 600 ms. The spatial patterns of the 16 frequency components frames were simultaneously detected and classified (between the two targets). The classification accuracy was assessed using 20-fold cross-validation. Results: The maximum frames average classification accuracies are 80.64% and 87.31% for subject 1 and 2 respectively, both utilizing frequency components located in gamma band.

The technical challenge is to automatically modulate neurostimulation parameters, as a function of the observed EEG signal, so as to minimize the frequency and duration of seizures. The methodology leverages recent techniques from the machine learning literature, in particular the reinforcement learning paradigm, to formalize this optimization problem. We present an algorithm which is able to automatically learn an adaptive neurostimulation strategy directly from labeled training data acquired from animal brain tissues. Our results suggest that this methodology can be used to automatically find a stimulation strategy which effectively reduces the incidence of seizures, while also minimizing the amount of stimulation applied. This work highlights the crucial role that modern machine learning techniques can play in the optimization of treatment strategies for patients with chronic disorders such as epilepsy.

The spatial patterns for a specific frequency range are generated using the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm, of which is highly successful for discriminating two classes of EEG measurements in MI-BCI. The spatial patterns illustrate how the presumed sources project on the scalp and are effective in verifying the neurophysiological plausibility of the computed solution. The spatial patterns show focused activity in ipsilateral as well as contralateral hemisphere with respect to the hand by tapping or motor imagery in 2 BCI-artful healthy subjects and 12 BCI-naive hemiparetic stroke patients. The results also show that neurophysiologically interpretable spatial patterns is more common in performing motor imagery compared to finger tapping by hemiparetic stroke patients. Hence, this shows that hemiparetic stroke patients are capable of operating MI-BCI.

Incremental learning has been widely investigated to deal with large datasets. To solve the problem of data growing over time in cross session studies, we apply an incremental learning support vector machines (SVM) method on single-trial ERP detection for identifying targets in satellite images. We implement the incremental learning SVM by keeping only the support vectors, instead of all the data, from the previous sessions and incorporating them with the data of the current session. Thus the incremental learning dramatically reduces the computational load. The results demonstrate that the incremental learning ERP detection system performs as well as the naive method, which uses only the current training session, and the batch mode, which uses all training data. Furthermore, it is more computationally efficient, which allows it to better cope with a continuous stream of EEG data.

However, such analysis is subject to the inherent equipment imprecision, patient movement, electrical records, and physician interpretation of the visual analysis variation. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) could be a helpful tool, appropriate to address problems such as prediction and pattern recognition. In this work, it has use a new class of ANN, the Paraconsistent Artificial Neural Network (PANN), which is capable of handling uncertain, inconsistent, and paracomplete information, for recognizing predetermined patterns of EEG and to assess its value as a possible auxiliary method for AD diagnosis. Thirty three patients with Alzheimer's disease and 34 controls patients of EEG records were obtained during relaxed wakefulness. It was considered as normal patient pattern, the background EEG activity between 8.0 and 12.0 Hz (with an average frequency of 10 Hz), allowing a range of 0.5 Hz. The PANN was able to recognize waves that belonging to their respective bands of clinical use (theta, delta, alpha, and beta), leading to an agreement with the clinical diagnosis at 82% of sensitivity and at 61% of specificity. Supported with these results, the PANN could be a promising tool to manipulate EEG analysis, bearing in mind the following considerations: the growing interest of specialists in EEG analysis visual and the ability of the PANN to deal directly imprecise, inconsistent and paracomplete data, providing an interesting quantitative and qualitative analysis.

The feature space was built from the coefficients of a discrete dyadic wavelet transformation. Mother wavelet parameterization allowed the tuning of basis functions to project the signals. The mother wavelet was optimized to minimize the classification error estimated from the training set. Classification was performed with a support vector machine (SVM) approach with optimization of the width of a Gaussian kernel and of the regularization parameter. The efficacy of the optimization procedures was representatively shown on electroencephalographic recordings from two subjects who performed unilateral isometric plantar flexions at two target torques and two rates of torque development. The proposed classification method was tested on four pairs of classes corresponding to the change in only one of the two parameters of the task. Misclassification rate (test set) in the classification of 1-s EEG activity immediately before the onset of the tasks was reduced from 50.8 +/- 2.9% with worst wavelet and nearest representative classifier, to 40.2 +/- 7.3% with optimal wavelet and nearest representative classifier, and to 15.8 +/- 3.4% with optimal wavelet and SVM with optimization of the kernel and regularization parameter. The proposed pattern recognition method is promising for classification of MRCPs modulated by variations of force-related parameters. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

From a clinical point of view, the child presents a flexor-extensor movement involving the trunk and limbs and lasting about 1 s. Although asymmetry can be present, the seizure involves both sides of the body. The ictal discharge most frequently associated with spasms in West syndrome (WS) is a diffuse triphasic slow high-amplitude wave and less frequently a low-amplitude brief rapid rhythm. The origin of the spasm in WS and classification as either partial or generalized seizure are the subject of much discussion. Factors supporting partial origin include: interictal electroencephalography (EEG) characterized by multifocal anomalies; high incidence of focal cortical lesions and remission of spasms following surgical removal of focal lesions. Factors supporting generalized origin are: clinical involvement of the entire body; mostly generalized ictal EEG pattern; existence of idiopathic cases and possibility of spasms immediately following a partial seizure like a particular form of secondary generalization. In our opinion, the categories of 'partial' and 'generalized' seizures are not applicable to spasms in WS. Sometimes the spasms in WS can be observed together with other types of partial or generalized seizures. Polygraphic recordings have demonstrated that despite being clinically similar, each spasm is different from the other because of a variable sequence in muscular contraction. These data support the peculiar nature of the spasms in WS that could be a subcortical phenomenon that requires a cortical trigger. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: Spatio-temporal variability of brain oscillations (indexed by short-term EEG spectral patterns (SPs)) was assessed by the probability-classification analysis of SPs. As a result, multi-dimensional SP-vector for each analysis EEG epoch was obtained. Results: It was demonstrated that interictal EEG was characterized (a) by a significant decrease of spatio-temporal variability of brain oscillations, (b) by longer periods of temporal stabilization for operational modules which comprise larger number of cortical areas, and (c) by significantly more intermittent recurrence when compared with EEG of control subjects. Generally it was shown that EEG channels display different states of coordination independently on their correlation and coherence using brain oscillations at multiple frequencies. Conclusions: Results of this study suggested that EEG correlate of chronic epileptogenesis in the brain is a particular metastable state of biopotential field, which can be estimated by SP-vector. The fact that all results were significantly different from surrogate EEGs reflects a nonoccasional and thus, most likely, an adaptive nature of spatio-temporal reorganization in interictal EEG. Significance: Parameters of spatio-temporal organization of interictal EEG without the signs of epileptiform activity can be considered as additional information in premorbid diagnostics of status epilepticus, and may also provide insights into basic laws that govern brain oscillations in general.

The efficacy of such a BCI depends mainly on the transmitted information rate. Shannon's communication theory was used to quantify the information rate of BCI data. For this purpose, experimental EEG data from four BCI experiments was analyzed off-line. Subjects imaginated left and right hand movements during EEG recording from the sensorimotor area. Adaptive autoregressive (AAR) parameters were used as features of single trial EEG and classified with linear discriminant analysis. The intra-trial variation as well as the inter-trial variability, the signal-to-noise ratio, the entropy of information, and the information rate were estimated. The entropy difference was used as a measure of the separability of two classes of EEG patterns.

The classifiers based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), kernel fisher discriminant (KFD), support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and decision tree (DT), are compared in terms of classification accuracy. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a fair and extensive comparison of some commonly employed classification methods under the same conditions so that the assessment of different classifiers will be more convictive.

Support vector machine (SVM) was adopted in the single-trail classification on the features. To improve the accuracy of pattern recognition, thus to boost up the bit rate of whole system, a 300ms window was used to estimate the accurate time of target stimuli present from EEG signals. As the spontaneous EEG could be regarded as a stationary random process in a short period, a whiten filter was constructed by the AR parameters which calculated from those non-target induced signals. In succession, real-world signals were input to the filter where the spontaneous EEGs were whitened. Finally, a wavelet method was applied to have the white signals filtered. The results boosted up the classification accuracy by enhancing the target signals.

This work also aims to optimize the EEG signal analysis through the improvement of classifiers and, eventually, of the BCI performance. In this paper a novel exploratory approach for data mining of EEG signal based on continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) and wavelet coherence (WC) statistical analysis is introduced and applied. The CWT allows the representation of time-frequency patterns of the signal's information content by WC qualiatative analysis. Results suggest that the proposed methodology is capable of identifying regions in time-frequency spectrum during the specified task of BCI. Furthermore, an example of a region is identified, and the patterns are classified using a Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC). This innovative characteristic of the process justifies the feasibility of the proposed approach to other data mining applications. It can open new physiologic researches in this field and on non stationary time series analysis.

As MI tasks are subject-specific, selection of subject-specific discriminative frequency components play a vital role in distinguishing these patterns. This paper proposes a new discriminative filter bank (FB) common spatial pattern algorithm to extract subject-specific FB for MI classification. The proposed method enhances the classification accuracy in BCI competition III dataset IVa and competition IV dataset IIb. Compared to the performance offered by the existing FB-based method, the proposed algorithm offers error rate reductions of 17.42% and 8.9% for BCI competition datasets; III and IV, respectively.

Recently the overfitting effect of CSP has been gradually noticed, but what influence the overfitting is still unclear. In this work, the generalization of CSP is investigated by a simple linear mixing model. Several factors in this model are discussed, and the simulation results indicate that channel numbers and the correlation between signals influence the generalization of CSP significantly. A larger number of training trials and a longer time length of the trial would prevent overfitting. The experiments on real data also verify our conclusion.

The main application for this research is the improvement of brain computer interface (BCI) systems. For this purpose, Bayesian graphical network, neural network, Bayesian quadratic, Fisher linear and hidden Markov model classifiers are applied to two known EEG datasets in the BCI field. The Bayesian network classifier is used for the first time in this work for classification of EEG signals. The Bayesian network appeared to have a significant accuracy and more consistent classification compared to the other four methods. In addition to classical correct classification accuracy criteria, the mutual information is also used to compare the classification results with other BCI groups.

Traditional methods have many difficulties in resolving this problem. Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on Statistical Learning Theory (SLT) is a new kind of learning method including Support Vector Classification (SVC) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). A new method using SVR is proposed to solve the problem in multi-input and multi-output system named Multi-SVM (MSVM). Tissue conductivity for each layer in 2-D head model is estimated effectively by MSVM. Compared with wavelet neural network method, MSVM not only obtains higher accuracy of learning, it also has greater generalization ability and faster computing speed as our experiment demonstrates.

Even for simple applications, BCIs require an extremely effective data processing to work properly because of the low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of EEG signals. Spatial filtering is one successful preprocessing method, which extracts EEG components carrying the most relevant information. Unlike spatial filtering with Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), Adaptive Spatial Filtering (ASF) can be adapted to freely selectable regions of interest (ROI) and with this, artifacts can be actively suppressed. In this context, we compare the performance of ASF with ROIs selected using anatomical a-priori information and ASF with numerically optimized ROIs. Therefore, we introduce a method for data driven spatial filter adaptation and apply the achieved filters for classification of EEG data recorded during imaginary movements of the left and right hand of four subjects. The results show, that in the case of artifact-free datasets, ASFs with numerically optimized ROIs achieve classification rates of up to 97.7 % while ASFs with ROIs defined by anatomical heuristic stay at 93.7 % for the same data. Otherwise, with noisy datasets, the former brake down (66.7 %) while the latter meet 95.7 %.

BCIs allow control of computers or external devices with the regulation of brain activity only. Two different research traditions produced two different types of BCIs: invasive BCIs, realized with implanted electrodes in brain tissue and noninvasive BCIs using electrophysiological recordings in humans such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) and metabolic changes such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Clinical applications were reserved with few exceptions for the noninvasive approach: communication with the completely paralyzed and locked-in syndrome with slow cortical potentials (SCPs), sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs), and P300 and restoration of movement and cortical reorganization in high spinal cord lesions and chronic stroke. It was demonstrated that noninvasive EEG-based BCIs allow brain-derived Communication in paralyzed and locked-in patients. Movement restoration was achieved with noninvasive BCIs based on SMRs control in single cases with spinal cord lesions and chronic stroke. At present no firm conclusion about the clinical utility of BCI for the control of voluntary movement can be made. Invasive multielectrode BCIs in otherwise healthy animals allowed execution of reaching, grasping, and force variations from spike patterns and extracellular field potentials. Whether invasive approaches allow superior brain control of motor responses compared to noninvasive BCI with intelligent peripheral devices and electrical muscle stimulation and EMG feedback remains to be demonstrated. The newly developed fMRI-BCIs and NIRS-BCIs offer promise for the learned regulation of emotional disorders and also disorders of small children (in the case of NIRS).

This means a BCI allows a user to act on his environment only by using his thoughts, without using peripheral nerves and muscles. Nearly all BCIs contain as a core part a machine learning algorithm, which learns from training data a function, that can be used to discriminate different brain activities. In the present work we use a bayesian framework for machine learning, the evidence framework [1], [2], to develop a variant of linear discriminant analysis for the use in a BCI based on electroencephalographic measurements (EEG). Properties of the resulting algorithm are: a) a continuous probabilistic output is given, b) fast estimation of regularization constants, and c) the possibility to select among different feature sets, the one which is most promising for classification. The algorithm has been tested on one dataset from the BCI competition 2002 and two datasets from the BCI competition 2003 and provides a classification accuracy of 95%, 81%, and 79% respectively.

In this paper, we present our efforts in developing a new approach to quantify movement of patients during epileptic seizures. We present a new method to extract the course of the quantified movement of different parts of the body of epileptic patients during seizures. This information constitutes a quantified movement pattern for each seizure that can be compared with clinical "standard" movement patterns and may help clinicians in the seizure classification.

Aiming at the recognition problem of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in the system, we present a novel pattern recognition method. The method combines the genetic algorithm (GA) with the support vector machine (SVM). It includes two techniques. One is that the feature selection and model parameters of the SVM are optimized synchronously, which constitutes a hybrid optimization. The other is that the hybrid optimization is realized by using the GA. The method is used to classify three types of EEG signals in the system. The experiment results show that this method can yield significantly higher classification accuracy than ones obtained with individual optimizations.

However, robust detection of human vigilance from EEG is very difficult due to the low SNR nature of EEG signals. Recently, compressive sensing and sparse representation become successful tools in the fields of signal reconstruction and machine learning. In this paper, we propose to use the sparse representation of EEG to the vigilance detection problem. We first use continuous wavelet transform to extract the rhythm features of EEG data, and then employ the sparse representation method to the wavelet transform coefficients. We collect five subjects' EEG recordings in a simulation driving environment and apply the proposed method to detect the vigilance of the subjects. The experimental results show that the algorithm framework proposed in this paper can successfully estimate driver's vigilance with the average accuracy about 94.22 %. We also compare our algorithm framework with other vigilance estimation methods using different feature extraction and classifier selection approaches, the result shows that the proposed method has obvious advantages in the classification accuracy.

The analysis of the electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings provides valuable insight and improved understanding of the mechanisms causing epileptic disorders. An epileptic seizure is usually identified by polyspike activity; rhythmic waves for a wide variety of frequencies and amplitudes as well as spike-and-wave complexes. The detection of all these waveforms in the EEG is a crucial component in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Time-frequency analysis is particularly effective for representing various aspects of nonstationary signals such as trends, discontinuities, and repeated patterns where other signal processing approaches fail or are not as effective. In this paper a novel method of analysis of EEG signals using time-frequency analysis, and classification using artificial neural network, is introduced. EEG segments are analyzed using a time-frequency distribution and then, several features are extracted for each segment representing the energy distribution over the time-frequency plane. The features are used for the training of a,neural network. Short-time Fourier transform and several time-frequency distributions are compared. The proposed approach is tested using a publicly available database and satisfactory results are obtained (89-100% accuracy).

Seizure prediction is a major field of neurological research, enabled by statistical analysis methods applied to features derived from intracranial Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of brain activity. However, no reliable seizure prediction method is ready for clinical applications. In this study, we use modern machine learning techniques to predict seizures from a number of features proposed in the literature. We concentrate on aggregated features that encode the relationship between pairs of EEG channels, such as cross-correlation, nonlinear interdependence, difference of Lyapunov exponents and wavelet analysis-based synchrony such as phase locking. We compare L1-regularized logistic regression, convolutional networks, and support vector machines. Results are reported on the standard Freiburg EEG dataset which contains data from 21 patients suffering from medically intractable focal epilepsy. For each patient, at least one method predicts 100% of the seizures on average 60 minutes before the onset, with no false alarm. Possible future applications include implantable devices capable of warning the patient of an upcoming seizure as well as implanted drug-delivery devices.

Lopes			Mu rhythm (de)synchronization and EEG single-trial classification of different motor imagery tasks	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED SYNCHRONIZATION; HAND MOVEMENT; BRAIN; COMMUNICATION; ATTENTION; POTENTIALS; SELECTION; HUMANS; CORTEX; ALPHA	We studied the reactivity of EEG rhythms (mu rhythms) in association with the imagination of right hand, left hand, foot, and tongue movement with 60 EEG electrodes in nine able-bodied subjects. During hand motor imagery, the hand mu rhythm blocked or desynchronized in all subjects, whereas an enhancement of the hand area mu rhythm was observed during foot or tongue motor imagery in the majority of the subjects. The frequency of the most reactive components was 11.7 Hz +/- 0.4 (mean +/- SD). While the desynchronized components were broad banded and centered at 10.9 Hz +/- 0.9, the synchronized components were narrow banded and displayed higher frequencies at 12.0 Hz +/- 1.0. The discrimination between the four motor imagery tasks based on classification of single EEG trials improved when, in addition to event-related desynchronization (ERD), event-related synchronization (ERS) patterns were induced in at least one or two tasks. This implies that such EEG phenomena may be utilized in a multi-class brain-computer interface (BCI) operated simply by motor imagery. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Real-time fMRI using brain-state classification	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						real-time fMRI; support vector machine; brain state; biofeedback	FUNCTIONAL NEUROIMAGING EXPERIMENTS; RESONANCE-IMAGING FMRI; QUANTITATIVE-EVALUATION; PREPROCESSING CHOICES; ACTIVATION; MRI; PREDICTION; PATTERNS; OBJECTS; REPRESENTATIONS	We have implemented a real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging system based on multivariate classification. This approach is distinctly different from spatially localized real-time implementations, since it does not require prior assumptions about functional localization and individual performance strategies, and has the ability to provide feedback based on intuitive translations of brain state rather than localized fluctuations. Thus this approach provides the capability for a new class of experimental designs in which real-time feedback control of the stimulus is possible-rather than using a fixed paradigm, experiments can adaptively evolve as subjects receive brain-state feedback. In this report, we describe our implementation and characterize its performance capabilities. We observed similar to 80% classification accuracy using whole brain, block-design, motor data. Within both left and right motor task conditions, important differences exist between the initial transient period produced by task switching (changing between rapid left or right index finger button presses) and the subsequent stable period during sustained activity. Further analysis revealed that very high accuracy is achievable during stable task periods, and that the responsiveness of the classifier to changes in task condition can be much faster than signal time-to-peak rates. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of this implementation with respect to behavioral task, suggesting that our results are applicable across a spectrum of cognitive domains. Beyond basic research, this technology can complement electroencephalography-based brain computer interface research, and has potential applications in the areas of biofeedback rehabilitation, lie detection, learning studies, virtual reality-based training, and enhanced conscious awareness.

As reference methods, common spatial patterns (CSP) (a supervised method, whereas all ICA algorithms are unsupervised), bipolar derivations and the original raw monopolar data were used. In addition to only performing ICA, the number of components was reduced with PCA before calculating a spatial filter for Infomax and FastICA. The multichannel data (22 channels) of eight subjects, consisting of two sessions recorded on different days, was analyzed. The task was to perform motor imagery of the left hand, right hand, foot or tongue, respectively, during predefined time slices (cued paradigm). For a measure of fitness, classification accuracies for both cross-validated results using data from just one session as well as simulated online results (representing the session-to-session transfer) were calculated. In the latter case, the spatial filters and classifiers were computed for one session and applied to the completely unseen second session. For the data analyzed in this study, Infomax outperformed the other two ICA variants by far, both in the cross-validated as well as in the simulated online case. CSP, on the other hand, yielded significantly lower classification accuracies than Infomax for the cross-validated results, whereas there is no statistically significant difference when it comes to simulated online data. Performing PCA before ICA improved the results in the case of FastICA, whereas the classification accuracies dropped significantly for Infomax. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The electrocorticogram (ECoG)-based BCIs are a BCI modality that has the potential to achieve high classification accuracy. This paper proposes a new algorithm for classifying single-trial ECoG during motor imagery. The optimal channel subsets are first selected by genetic algorithms from multi-channel ECoG recordings, then the power features are extracted by common spatial pattern (CSP), and finally Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) is used for classification. The algorithm is applied to Data set I of BCI Competition III and the classification accuracy of 90% is achieved on test set by using only seven channels.

Multimodal device based on human sensory systems have obtained a lot of attention in the fields of human interface. Among the human sensory systems, especially, the sense of touch is important form of social interaction and it can have powerful emotional consequences. Therefore, it is important to improve tactile sensation device technique and evaluate the device objectively. By analyzing the EEG, we attempt to make the evaluation method clear how users feel when he/she touches objects. We measure the EEG while subjects touch objects by using portable electroencephalograph. The proposed method consists of feature extraction and EEG pattern classification by using fast fourier transform(FFT) and artificial neural network(ANN). Moreover, we apply particle swarm optimization(PSO) for deciding the weight and bias of the ANN fastly.

Based on the observation that the "wake-sleep" algorithm for training a Helmholtz machine is similar to the problem of finding the potential for a multi-channel Schrodinger equation, we propose that the construction of a Schrodinger potential using inverse scattering methods can serve as a model for how the mammalian brain learns to extract essential information from sensory data. In particular, inverse scattering theory provides a conceptual framework for imagining how one might use EEG and MEG observations of brain-waves together with sensory feedback to improve human learning and pattern recognition. Longer term, implementation of inverse scattering algorithms on a digital or optical computer could be a step towards mimicking the seamless information fusion of the mammalian brain.

Extreme energy ratio (EER) is a recently proposed method to learn spatial filters for EEG classification. It selects several eigenvectors from top and end of the eigenvalue spectrum resulting from a spectral decomposition to construct a group of spatial filters as a filter bank. However, that strategy has some limitations and the spatial filters in the group are often selected improperly. Therefore the energy features filtered by the filter bank do not contain enough discriminative information or severely overfit on small training samples. This paper utilize one of the penalized feature selection strategies called LASSO to aid us to construct the spatial filter bank termed LASSO spatial filter bank. It can learn a better selection of the spatial filters. Then two different classification methods are presented to evaluate our LASSO spatial filter bank. Their excellent performances demonstrate the stronger generalization ability of the LASSO spatial filter bank, as shown by the experimental results.

The classification algorithm of the EEG signals has attracted much attention. In this paper, an experiment is designed on imaginary left or right hand movements and a new algorithm is proposed to identify different EEG patterns. Butterworth filter has been applied to retrieve the useful signals. Interference noise has been eliminated using a digital filter. The wavelet entropy is treated as one feature in our approach. The adaptive autoregressive model combined with the event-related desynchronization is used in our research to obtain the other feature. Two obtained features reflect time domain and frequency domain features of EEG signal, and will be used by a BP neural network for training. Simulation has been carried out and the results of the simulation show that this approach can restrain noise disturbance and can effectively express mental states. When used in the classification of special events in brain-computer interface, this approach has some advantage. Moreover, it can be used for the online analysis.

An important aspect of this analysis is the work on transformations of high dimensional EEG data to low dimensional spaces in which we can classify the data according to mental tasks being performed. In this research we investigate how a Neural Network (NN) in an auto-encoder with bottleneck configuration can find such a transformation. We implemented two approximate second-order methods to optimize the weights of these networks, because the more common first-order methods are very slow to converge for networks like these with more than three layers of computational units. The resulting non-linear projections of time embedded EEG signals show interesting separations that are related to tasks. The bottleneck networks do indeed discover nonlinear transformations to low-dimensional spaces that capture much of the information present in EEG signals. However, the resulting low-dimensional representations do not improve classification rates beyond what is possible using Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) on the original time-lagged EEG.

In terms of mutual information, the optimal feature extraction is creating a new feature set from the data which jointly have largest dependency on the target class. However, it is not always easy to get an accurate estimation for high-dimensional MI. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for feature extraction using two-dimensional MI estimates. A new feature is created such that the MI between the new feature and the target class is maximized and the redundancy is minimized. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by using the classification of EEG signals. The tasks to be discriminated are the imaginative hand movement and the resting state. The results demonstrate that the proposed mutual information-based feature extraction (MIFX) algorithm performed well in several experiments on different subjects and can improve the classification accuracy of the EEG patterns. The results show that the classification accuracy obtained by MIFX is higher than that achieved by full feature set.

Temporal distribution of clinical seizures over the 24-h day: A retrospective observational study in a tertiary epilepsy clinic	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy; Seizures; Circadian rhythm	RAT MODEL; SLEEP; PATTERNS	P>Purpose: Very few studies have evaluated seizure occurrence in humans over the 24-h day; data from children are particularly scarce. Circadian patterns in seizure occurrence may be of importance in epilepsy research and may have important implications in diagnosis and therapy. Methods: We have analyzed clinical seizures of 176 consecutive patients (76 children, 100 adults) who had continuous electroencephalography (EEG) and video monitoring lasting more than 22 h. Several aspects of seizures were noted, including classification, time of day, origin, and sleep stage. Results: More than 800 seizures were recorded. Significantly more seizures were observed from 11:00 to 17:00 h, and from 23:00 to 05:00 h significantly fewer seizures were seen. The daytime peak incidences were observed in seizures overall, complex partial seizures (in children and adults), seizures of extratemporal origin (in children), and seizures of temporal origin (in adults). Incidences significantly lower than expected were seen in the period 23:00 to 05:00 h in seizures overall, complex partial seizures (in children and adults), and in tonic seizures (in children). In addition, significantly fewer seizures of temporal (in children and adults) and extratemporal origin (in children) were observed in this period. Discussion: The results suggest that certain types of seizures have a strong tendency to occur in true diurnal patterns. These patterns are characterized by a peak during midday and a low in the early night.

Scalp EEG recordings were obtained from six patients with history of intractable partial onset epilepsy treated with VNS as adjunctive therapy to medicines. Averaged scalp EEG samples were used as features for separation. SVM classification accuracy was used as a measure of EEG similarity to separate a time segment during the beginning of stimulation from all the successive non-overlapping time segments within a full VNS on/off cycle. This analysis was performed for all the automated VNS cycles occurring during approximately twenty-four hours of 25 channels of scalp EEG. The patient that resulted in the lowest degree of EEG pattern similarity had the highest VNS stimulation frequency and experienced a monthly seizure rate among the lowest of all six patients included in this study. The patient with the greatest degree of pattern similarity had the lowest VNS stimulation frequency, shortest VNS pulse width, and experienced the greatest monthly seizure rate of all six patients included in this study. It is possible that VNS exerts its therapeutic effect by mimicking a theorized seizure effect for which a seizure has been observed to "reset" the brain from an unfavorable preictal state to a more favorable interictal state. These encouraging results suggest that data mining tools may be able to extract EEG patterns which could be used as an electrographic marker of optimal VNS stimulation parameters.

J	Ookawa, T				Ookawa, T			The electroencephalogram and sleep in the domestic chicken	AVIAN AND POULTRY BIOLOGY REVIEWS			English	Article						sleep; electroencephalogram; domestic chicken	PIGEON COLUMBA-LIVIA; BEHAVIORAL SLEEP; UNIHEMISPHERIC SLEEP; GALLUS-DOMESTICUS; YOUNG CHICKENS; BRAIN; WAKEFULNESS; SYSTEM; ASYMMETRY; PHYLOGENY	Recent electroencephalographic studies on the surface and subsurface of the chicken striatum confirmed that there is a marked correlation between the electroencephalogram (the EEG) and behavioural states of the chicken during wakefulness and sleep. An asymmetrical EEG pattern was recorded from the surface and subsurface of the chicken telencephalon. The chicken EEG changes are essentially similar to those of mammals, though the sleep spindles observed in mammalian neo-cortex are lacking in the chicken cerebrum. Birds exhibit a unique behavioural and electrophysiological state called 'unihemispheric sleep' in which one cerebral hemisphere is awake and the other is sleep. This finding identified electroencephalographically that the optic nervous fibres undergo a complete dicussation in birds. Chicks blinded by bilateral optic enucleation retain the ability to develop normal growth. The EEG associated with sleep was characterised by high amplitude and slow waves, and by low voltage fast waves, that is, paradoxical sleep in blinded chickens. During wakefulness, the EEG of blinded chickens shows the arousal pattern. The classification of stages from wakefulness to sleep has not yet been fully established in the birds.

Our approach seeks to build individual brain interfaces rather than universal ones. This means that the interface should adapt to its owner, as it will incorporate a neural classifier that learns user-specific features. Three feature sets extracted with Fourier transform, autoregressive models and wavelets were evaluated with early stopping MLP committee. The goal was to classify EEG patterns related to imagined hand movements and relax. The best results were obtained with the autoregressive spectral features. The results so far are not satisfactory for their intended use as basis for robust EEG classification but they give us valuable basis for future work.

An Algorithm for Brain Computer Interfacing based on Phase Synchronization Spatial Patterns	2009 THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED ENGINEERING COMPUTING AND APPLICATIONS IN SCIENCES (ADVCOMP 2009)			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Advanced Engineering Computing and Applications in Sciences	OCT 11-16, 2009	Sliema, MALTA			electroencephalogram (EEG); brain computer interfacing (BCI); phase synchronization; common spatial patterns (CSP); phase locking value (PLV)	NEURONAL SYNCHRONY; FILTERS; SIGNALS	Brain computer interfacing (BCI) is an interdisciplinary area that connects biomedical knowledge on brain physiology with the use of effective computational techniques for mental task discrimination. One of the most successful algorithms in BCI is the method of common spatial patterns (CSP). The spatial filters computed using this method are based on a joint diagonalization of the covariance matrices of two classes of data. However, in the standard CSP implementation the influence of amplitude and phase characteristics are not distinguished. In order to investigate phase synchronization links for the scope of task discrimination, we propose a variant of the method of CSP that depends explicitly on phase synchronization information. The phase-based CSP (P-CSP) was tested on simulated data to analyze if the implemented method yields significant patterns of phase interaction. The algorithm was also used on real EEG data for the classification of two motor imagery tasks and results were compared to those obtained using the phase locking value (PLY). The results obtained indicate that using the method of P-CSP with a few spatial filters can yield classification rates close to or exceeding the best classification rate obtained from the PLY measures for any pair of channels.

This paper describes the application of adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model for automatic detection of alterations in the human electroencephalogram (EEG) activities during hypopnoea episodes. Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction by computation of wavelet coefficients and classification by the ANFIS trained with the backpropagation gradient descent method in combination with the least squares method. The EEG signals (pre and during hypopnoea) from three electrodes (C3, C4 and O2) were used as input patterns of the three ANFIS classifiers. To improve diagnostic accuracy, the fourth ANFIS classifier (combining ANFIS) was trained using the outputs of the three ANFIS classifiers as input data. The proposed ANFIS model combined the neural network adaptive capabilities and the fuzzy logic qualitative approach. Some conclusions concerning the saliency of features on detecting any possible changes in the human EEG activity due to hypopnoea (mild case of cessation of breath) occurrences were drawn through analysis of the ANFIS. The performance of the ANFIS model was evaluated in terms of training performance and classification accuracies and the results confirmed that the proposed ANFIS model has potential in detecting changes in the human EEG activity clue to hypopnoea episodes.

Combining ENG and EEG integrated analysis for better sensitivity and specificity of Neuroprosthesis operations	2010 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC 10)	AUG 30-SEP 04, 2010	Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)				Combining non-invasive monitoring of action-related brain signals with the invasive recordings of the nerve motor output could provide robust natural and bidirectional multimodal Brain-Machine interfaces. One 26 years old, right-handed male who had suffered traumatic trans-radial amputation of the left arm was connected in a bidirectional way with a robotic hand prostheses. Cortical signals related with movement programming, execution, and feed-back were recorded by non-invasive scalp electrodes to detect high-level information (i.e. onset of movement intention), while the efferent neural activity containing the low-level commands towards the missing limb was recorded from the amputated nerves by multipolar intra-neural electrodes. The aim of this article is to report advanced experiences aiming to investigate whether information on "hand-related" activities can be decoded by the combined analysis of motor-related signals simultaneously gathered via intraneural electrodes implanted into the peripheral nervous system and scalp recorded electroencephalography signals to govern a dexterous hand prosthesis using the natural neural "pathway".

In our method, first characteristics of EEG, EOG and EMG are compared with characteristic features of alpha waves, delta waves, sleep spindles, K-complexes and REMs. Then, several parameters that are necessary for sleep stage scoring are extracted. We transform these extracted parameters into a few discrete variables using canonical discriminant analysis and the discretization method based on a random walk, and then a committee that consists of several small decision trees is formed from a small number of training instances. Furthermore final sleep stages are decided by a majority decision of the committee. Our method was applied to the digitized PSG chart data, provided by the Japan Society of Sleep Research and we carried out an evaluation experiment. The experiment indicated that our method can quickly execute learning and classification and precisely score sleep stages.

Analysis by computer-synchronized long-term polygraphic video-EEG monitoring	EPILEPTIC DISORDERS			English	Article						neonatal seizures; hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; background EEG activity; electroclinical correlation; video-EEG monitoring	PROGNOSTIC VALUE; CLASSIFICATION; CONTROVERSIES; PREMATURE; DIAGNOSIS; INFANTS; BABIES	Between 1994 and 2000, 30 full-term newborns affected by seizures secondary to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, underwent computerised, polygraphic, video-EEG recordings during the first 48 hours of life, in our neonatal intensive care unit. In this longitudinal study, recordings lasted an average of 10.5 hours. We studied EEG ictal discharges that lacked a clinical correlate, the semeiotics, and the electroclinical correlation during seizures, by reviewing the time-synchronised, video-EEG recordings obtained during these six years. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the relationship between background EEG activity and the electroclinical correlation or dissociation of the seizures. When background activity was depressed and undifferentiated, the seizures were characterised by the electroclinical dissociation except in instances of focal tonic seizures. With all other background patterns, seizures were invariably accompanied by the electrical correlate, the only exception being ocular signs and oral-buccal-lingual movements, which occurred both with and without paroxysmal discharges. Ocular signs and oral-buccal-lingual movements were very frequent and were observed with all patterns of background activity. Only on one occasion were they the sole clinical expression of seizures. In our patients, the electroclinical dissociation was constant only if background EEG activity was depressed and undifferentiated. The constant electroclinical dissociation of seizures was closely correlated with the type of background activity, which, in turn, is indicative of severe cerebral damage.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed and classified electroencephalogram (EEGs) in comatose children between two months and 18 years of age during the period 1996 - 2003 according to modified Young's classification. Outcome at one-year was scored according to the Paediatric Cerebral and Overall Performance Category Scale. Outcomes were compared using Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney test. Results: Analysis of 63 electroencephalogram (EEG) records in 38 patients showed rhythmic patterns in 19 records (30.2%; 9 alpha, 4 spindle, 4 theta and 2 beta coma patterns, total number of children = 14). Aetiology and outcome of alpha coma patterns and other rhythmic coma patterns were similar. In five children, one type of rhythmic pattern changed to another. Records with reactive rhythmic coma 66.7% (6/9), were associated with favourable outcome. Sixty percent of the records (6/10 records in seven children) with non-reactive pattern were associated with unfavourable outcome. This clinically significant difference did not reach statistical significance (lower Paediatric Cerebral and Overall Performance Category Scale score p= 0.14; favourable outcome p=-0.19). Conclusion: Rhythmic coma patterns in comatose children are not uncommon. Aetiology, reactivity and outcome of individual patterns are similar and thus make the rhythmic coma patterns distinct EEG signatures in comatose children.

The number of events under normal conditions is large (several hundreds), and it is necessary to mark the limits of the events with precision, otherwise the time sensitive classification of the CAP phases (A and B) and specially the scoring of different types of A phases will be compromised. The objective of this study is to verify the feasibility of visual CAP scoring with only one channel of EEG, the evaluation of the inter-scorer agreement in a variety of recordings, and the comparison of the visual scorings with a known automatic scoring system. Sixteen hours of one channel (C4-A1 or C3-A2) of NREM sleep were extracted from eight whole night recordings in European Data Format and presented to the different scorers. The average inter-scorer agreement for all scorers is above 70%, the pair wise inter-scorer agreement found was between 69% up to 77.5%. These values are similar to what has been reported in different type studies. The automatic scoring system has similar performance of the visual scorings. The study also has shown that it is possible to classify the CAP using only one channel of EEG.

The technique is based on an adaptive time-frequency analysis of EEG signals computed using local discriminant bases (LDB) derived from local cosine packets (LCP). In an offline step, the EEG data obtained from the C-3/C-4 electrode locations of the standard 10/20 system is adaptively segmented in time, over a non-dyadic grid by maximizing the probabilistic distances between expansion coefficients corresponding to left and right hand movement imagery. This is followed by a frequency domain clustering procedure in each adapted time segment to maximize the discrimination power of the resulting time-frequency features. Then, the most discriminant features from the resulting arbitrarily segmented time-frequency plane are sorted. A principal component analysis (PCA) step is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. This reduced feature set is finally fed to a linear discriminant for classification. The online step simply computes the reduced dimensionality features determined by the offline step and feeds them to the linear discriminant. We provide experimental data to show that the method can adapt to physio-anatomical differences, subject-specific and hemisphere-specific motor imagery patterns. The algorithm was applied to all nine subjects of the BCI Competition 2002. The classification performance of the proposed algorithm varied between 70% and 92.6% across subjects using just two electrodes. The average classification accuracy was 80.6%. For comparison, we also implemented an adaptive autoregressive model based classification procedure that achieved an average error rate of 76.3% on the same subjects, and higher error rates than the proposed approach on each individual subject.

This chapter deals with a classification of states of vigilance based on analysis of an electroencefalographic activity of the brain. Preprocessing of data is done by the discrete Fourier transform. For the recognition radial basis functions (RBF), learning vector quantization (LVQ), multi-layer perceptron networks, k-nearest neighbor and a method based on Bayesian theory are used. Coefficients of bayes classifier are found using the maximum likelihood estimation. The experiments deal with analysis of human vigilance while their eyes are open. Then the reaction on visual stimuli is investigated. For this experiment 10 volunteers were repeatedly measured. The chapter shows that it is possible to classify vigilance in such conditions.

A key aspect of this approach is reestablishing the disrupted sensorimotor feedback loop, i.e., determining the intended movement using a BCI and helping a human with impaired motor function to move the arm using a robot. It has not been studied yet, however, how artificially closing the sensorimotor feedback loop affects the BCI decoding performance. In this article, we investigate this issue in six healthy subjects, and present evidence that haptic feedback facilitates the decoding of arm movement intention. The results provide evidence of the feasibility of future rehabilitative efforts combining robot-assisted physical therapy with BCIs. Moreover, the results suggest that shared-control strategies in Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) may benefit from haptic feedback.

J	Lux, AL				Lux, A. L.			Is hypsarrhythmia a form of non-convulsive status epilepticus in infants?	ACTA NEUROLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Symposium on Status Epilepticus in Infants and Young Children	APR 29-30, 2006	Osaka, JAPAN	Infantile Seizure Soc Japan		hypsarrhythmia; non-convulsive status epilepticus; infantile spasms; west syndrome	WEST-SYNDROME; SPASMS; OUTCOMES; EPILEPSY	Background: Hypsarrhythmia is generally associated with infantile spasms, a combination referred to as West syndrome. It is debatable whether hypsarrhythmia is usefully regarded as a form of non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). Summary Points: The earliest English language description of hypsarrhythmia reported an almost continuous EEG pattern, although later studies showed a degree of state dependence. Its principal features are very high amplitude and irregular slow waves with superimposed multifocal epileptiform discharges. Paroxysms of spasms are clearly overt seizure events, and there are variable EEG patterns associated with this ictus. There remains a debate about the definitional boundaries of hypsarrhythmia, and about the defining characteristics of NCSE. There is evidence that hypsarrhythmia is an age-dependent EEG pattern that evolves, sometimes independently of clinical features. Frequently, hypsarrhythmia is associated with delay in or regression of neuro-developmental skills, and recent studies have reported that a longer lead time to diagnosis and effective treatment is associated with poorer long-term neuro-developmental outcomes. Recent consensus definitions and classifications of NCSE have suggested boundaries that permit inclusion of hypsarrhythmia as an EEG pattern of NCSE. In practice, adopting the idea that hypsarrhythmia is a form of NCSE might lead to earlier appropriate investigation of infants with subtle developmental delay or regression, hence avoiding treatment delays and potentially preserving developmental potential.

Soon after that, attempts for using the EEC for devices' control were made. In both cases, electrooculographic (EOG) artefacts, especially subjects eyeblinks, noticeably contaminate EEG power spectrum and impede the analysis and classification of the signal. Artefacts are noises introduced to the EEG signal by not central nervous system (CNS) sources of electric fields inside and outside subjects body. In this paper; an analysis of the power spectrum of eye-blinking artefacts is described with a connection of using EEC for pattern recognition during mental tasks performance based brain-computer interface (BCI), working with alpha- and mu-rhythms ( 8-13 Hz) brain potentials. The goal of the study is to determine the influence of eye-blinks' power spectrum on EEG and choose a method for their handling.

ICA is a useful technique that allows blind separation of sources, linearly mixed, assuming only the statistical independence of these sources. This suggests the possibility of using ICA to separate different independent brain activities during motor imagery into separate components. This work provides a natural basis for developing an efficient BCI based on single-source data obtained by independent component analysis of multi-channel EEG. The tasks to be discriminated are the imagination of hand grasping and opening and the resting state. The results indicate that the proposed scheme can improve the classification accuracy of the EEG patterns. Imagery is the essential part of the most EEG-based communication systems. Thus, the quality of mental rehearsal, the degree of imagined effort, and mind controllability should have a major effect on the performance of EEG-based BCI. In this work, we are going to examine the role of mental practice and concentration skills on the performance of BCI. The surprising results indicate that mental training has a significant effect on the performance of BCI over the primary motor cortex, temporal, and frontal areas. This supports the hypothesis that mental practice is an effective method for performance enhancement and motor skill learning.

NREM sleep is further divided into 4 stages. Sleep staging attempts to identify these stages based on the signals collected in polysomnogram (PSG). Significant information can be derived from the EEG signals collected during PSG. In our study we extract spectral features from EEG signals. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used for selecting best features and then Support Vector Machine (SVM) with different kernels have been applied to differentiate sleep stages. According to chaotic characteristic of EEG signal, we use non-linear features, as well. Nonlinear and spectral features can differentiate stages awake and REM with 98.15% accuracy. Chaotic features improved classification rate as a necessary component. Succinctly, through the feature space constructed by approximate entropy and fractal dimension, different stages of EEG signals can be recognized from each other expressly. That is to say, Pattern varies under the different sleep stages. Therefore Healthy humans with a regular night's sleep will follow these sleep stages in a particular pattern.

Specific frequency bands are also optimized simultaneously in this algorithm. So it can perfect the BCI pattern. It is applied to BCI datasets to illustrate the performance and validity of the algorithm. And the results indicate the algorithm can improve the accuracy of classification.

J	Archer, J; Bunby, R				Archer, John; Bunby, Ruth			Epilepsy in indigenous and non-indigenous people in Far North Queensland	MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA			English	Article							DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; COMMUNITY; DISTRICT; PREVALENCE; SEIZURES; ECUADOR	Objective: To compare patterns of epilepsy in Indigenous and non-Indigenous people presenting to hospital. Study design: Retrospective cross-sectional survey of individuals admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of epilepsy (1 January 2001 - 31 December 2004); presenting to the emergency department with a seizure (2004); or presenting to the epilepsy clinic (1 September 2002 - 31 March 2005). Setting: Cairns Base Hospital, the major referral centre for Far North Queensland, including Cape York and the Torres Strait, with a population of 230000 (13% Indigenous). Main outcome measures: Proportion of Indigenous patients presenting for epilepsy; proportion of Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups affected by each of the main epilepsy syndromes. Results: Of 359 patients attending the epilepsy clinic and 918 patients having electroencephalography (EEG), 11 % and 13% were Indigenous, respectively (in proportion with the catchment population). However, 30% (146/486) of patients presenting to the emergency department with seizure, 31% (130/418) of inpatient admissions with epilepsy, and 44% (28/63) of patients admitted with status epilepticus were Indigenous. Indigenous patients were more likely to have an abnormal EEG result (P= 0.025), while non-Indigenous patients presenting to the clinic were more likely to be classified-as non-epileptic (31% v 18%). In those with abnormal EEG, the frequency distribution of abnormalities was similar, and, in those with epilepsy, syndrome classification also showed similar frequencies. There was no significant difference in occurrence of epileptogenic abnormalities detected by imaging (13% non-Indigenous v 18% Indigenous) or in alcohol consumption (38% v 37%). Conclusions: Indigenous Australians have similar epilepsy syndromes to the non-Indigenous population, but they present with more serious disease. This discrepancy may relate to inequitable health care utilisation due to cultural issues or geographic isolation.

To cope with the problem, a framework based on Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and covariate shift adaptation methods is proposed. Covariate shift adaptation is an effective method which can adapt to the testing sessions without the need for labeling the testing session data. This framework has been applied on one electrocorticogram (ECoG) dataset and one Electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset from BCI Competition III. Despite the different characteristics of ECoG and EEG, non-stationarity appeared in both datasets. Results showed that the proposed framework compares favorably with those methods used in the BCI Competition, revealing the effectiveness of covariate shift adaptation in tackling the non-stationarity in Brain Computer Interfaces.

The EEGs can be heavily corrupted by cardiac, eye movement, muscle and noise artifacts, so that EEG experts need to automatically detect them with a given level of confidence. In theory, the BMA methodology allows experts to evaluate the confidence in decision making most accurately. However. the non-stationary nature of EEGs makes the use of this methodology difficult. In our experiments with the sleep EEGs, the proposed BMA technique is shown to provide a better performance in terms of predictive accuracy.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals are the most commonly used source for Epileptic seizure prediction. A variety of temporal changes in perception and behavior may be caused by Epileptic seizures. In the human EEG, they are depicted by multiple ictal patterns, where epileptic seizures typically become perceptible as characteristic, usually rhythmic signals, often concurring with or even preceding the earliest observable changes in behavior. Earliest possible detection of observable onset of ictal patterns in the EEG can, thus, serve to initiate more-detailed diagnostic procedures during seizures and to distinguish epileptic seizures from other stipulations with seizure-like symptoms. Lately, warning and intervention systems triggered by the detection of ictal EEG patterns have fascinated escalating interest. As the workload implicated in the detection and prediction of seizures by human experts is quite formidable, a number of attempts have been made to devise automatic seizure detection and prediction systems. So far, none of these have found extensive application. There have been an increased number of researches carried out with the purpose of devising an automatic seizure detection and prediction system. In this paper, we present an extensive review of the significant researches associated with the detection and prediction of Epileptic Seizures using EEG signals. In addition, we have presented an in depth description of Electroencephalogram, Epileptic Seizure and its types along with Epilepsy.

Because EEG recording and monitoring is relatively safe for the patients in deep coma, it is believed to be valuable for either reducing the risk of brain death diagnosis (while comparing other tests such as the apnea) or preventing mistaken diagnosis. The objective of this paper is to study several statistical methods for quantitative EEG analysis in order to help bedside or ambulatory monitoring or diagnosis. We apply signal processing and quantitative statistical analysis for the EEG recordings of 32 adult patients. For EEG signal processing, independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to separate the independent source components, followed by Fourier and time-frequency analysis. For quantitative EEG analysis, we apply several statistical complexity measures to the EEG signals and evaluate the differences between two groups of patients: the subjects in deep coma, and the subjects who were categorized as brain death. We report statistically significant differences of quantitative statistics with real-life EEG recordings in such a clinical study, and we also present interpretation and discussions on the preliminary experimental results.

Within this paper we present a new method based on a combination of wavelet analysis and the training method used in the field of artificial neural networks. We define a training process applied to a family of wavelets and intended to optimise the pattern detection and location capabilities when applied to a particular class of signals. Later we demonstrate how this method is used to detect and localise the Interictal Epileptic Spikes within human EEG bio-signals.

Out of 39 infants with symptomatic West syndrome, 18 infants (age 3-14 months) with 61 serial non-REM sleep EEG records of the prehypsarrhythmic phase were identified. The prehypsarrhythmic phase encompassed 2 to 13 months (mean 4.5 months) after an initial insult. A classification system of three EEG types corresponding to the clinical states prior to West syndrome occurrence was developed. In addition, follow-up of all patients presenting with type 2 EEGs (n = 22) was evaluated. Three clinical states and corresponding EEG types were classified. Clinical state 1 (weeks to months, silent phase) presented with (multi-)focal epileptic discharges < 50% of the non-REM EEG recording time (type 1 EEG). Clinical state 2 (several weeks, beginning mental deterioration) was accompanied by type 2 EEG with bihemispheric epileptic discharges > 50% of the non-REM EEG recording time within abnormal background activity (imminent hypsarrhythmia). Clinical state 3 (mental deterioration) was characterized by hypsarryhthmia. Interrater reliability of seven blinded raters was good (median weighted kappa 0.67). Out of 22 patients presenting with type 2 EEGs, two were lost for follow-up, and 16 developed West syndrome, whereas four were treated early with anti-epileptic drugs and remained stable. Infants with West syndrome could be reliably identified several weeks before the occurrence of hypsarrhythmia by a typical EEG pattern (type 2), thereby opening the way for early intervention studies.

We have applied various feature extraction methods and combined their results. Two methods, greedy algorithms and genetic algorithms, are used for selecting the pair feature extractor-classifier (we called expert) between the existed pair.

In existing approaches, model parameters are usually found manually through experimentation, a tedious task that often leads to suboptimal estimates. We propose an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for model parameter estimation that is fully automatic and gives optimal estimates. Further, we apply a Kalman smoother to obtain ERD estimates. Results show that the EM algorithm significantly improves the performance of the Kalman smoother. Application of the proposed approach to the motor-imagery EEG data shows that useful ERD patterns can be obtained even without careful selection of frequency bands.

The exact composition of brain oscillations was assessed by the probability-classification analysis of short-term EEG spectral patterns. In contrast to previous studies of depression, the current study found that major depression affects brain activity in nearly the whole cortex and manifests itself in considerable reorganization of the composition of brain oscillations in a broad frequency range: 0.5-30 Hz. At the same time, the magnitude of the effect of depression was maximal in the posterior cortex of the brain. Interhemisphere asymmetry during major depression was also observed in the whole cortex with right hyperactivity in frontal, parietal and occipital brain areas. It is suggested that depressive brain is manifested in the superposition of distributed multiple oscillations. Our findings provide new insight on the relationship between major depressive disorder and cortical oscillatory activity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

One of the major problems in this regard is the extensive variability and inconsistency of brain signal patterns, observed especially in electroencephalogram (EEG). This paper presents a fuzzy logic (FL) approach to the problem of handling of the resultant uncertainty effects. In particular, it outlines the design of a novel type-2 FL system (T2FLS) classifier within the framework of an EEG-based BCI, and examines its on-line applicability in the presence of short- and long-term nonstationarities of spectral EEG correlates of motor imagery (imagination of left vs. right hand movement). The developed system is shown to effectively cope with real-time constraints. In addition, a comparative post hoc analysis has revealed that the proposed T2FLS classifier outperforms conventional BCI methods, like LDA and SVM, in terms of the maximum classification accuracy (CA) rates by a relatively small, yet statistically significant, margin.

One method to increase ITR is to extend two-class mental tasks to multiple tasks. Accordingly an efficient method for feature extraction is needed to ensure good classification performance. This paper generalizes well-known common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm from two task conditions to multi-task case by Jacobi Rotations. The detailed mathematical derivation of the algorithm is given, followed by a computer simulation. The algorithm is then applied to four data sets recorded during motor imagery of three mental tasks. The simulation shows that the algorithm can correctly extract signal components specific to each task, while the classification experiments verify the validity and effectiveness of the method.

With this, a BCI provides a new non-muscular communication channel, which can be used to assist patients who have highly compromised motor functions. The Graz-BCI uses motor imagery and associated oscillatory EEG signals from the sensorimotor cortex for device control. As a result of research in the past 15 years, the classification of ERD/ERS patterns in single EEG trials during motor execution and motor imagery forms the basis of this sensorimotor-rhythm controlled BCI. The major frequency bands of cortical oscillations considered here are the 8-13 and 15-30 Hz bands. This chapter describes the basic methods used in Graz-BCI research and outlines possible clinical applications.

A powerful and widely acknowledged BMI approach, so far only applied in invasive recording techniques, uses neuronal signals related to limb movements for equivalent, multidimensional control of an external effector. Here, we investigated whether this approach is also applicable for noninvasive recording techniques. To this end, we recorded whole-head MEG during center-out movements with the hand and found significant power modulation of MEG activity between rest and movement in three frequency bands: an increase for <= 7Hz (low-frequency band) and 62-87 Hz (high-gamma band) and a decrease for 10-30 Hz (beta band) during movement. Movement directions could be inferred on a single-trial basis from the low-pass filtered MEG activity as well as from power modulations in the low-frequency band, but not from the beta and high-gamma bands. Using sensors above the motor area, we obtained a surprisingly high decoding accuracy of 67% on average across subjects. Decoding accuracy started to rise significantly above chance level before movement onset. Based on simultaneous MEG and EEG recordings, we show that the inference of movement direction works equally well for both recording techniques. In summary, our results show that neuronal activity associated with different movements of the same effector can be distinguished by means of noninvasive recordings and might, thus, be used to drive a noninvasive BMI.

Since the synchronized oscillatory activity and the phase dynamics between the brain areas are two important mechanisms in the brain's function and information transfer, we decided to examine whether it is possible to extract the encoded information from the EEG signals using the phase-demodulation approach. The EEG was measured during the performance of different visuomotor tasks and the information we were trying to decode was the gripping force as applied by the subjects. The study revealed that it is possible, by using simple beta-rhythm filtering, phase demodulation, principal component analysis and a fuzzy model, to estimate the gripping-force response by using EEG signals as the inputs for the proposed model. The presented study has shown that even though EEG signals represent a superposition of all the active neurons, it is still possible to decode some information about the current activity of the brain centers. Furthermore, the cross-validation showed that the information about the gripping force is encoded in a very similar way for all the examined subjects. Thus, the phase shifts of the EEG signals seem to have a key role during activity and information transfer in the brain, while the phase-demodulation method proved to be a crucial step in the signal processing.

In this paper, the usefulness of EEG for the prediction of performance is investigated. Methods: We present a new methodology that combines various ongoing EEG measurements to predict performance level during a cognitive task. We propose a voting approach that combines the outputs of elementary support vector machine (SVM) classifiers derived from various sets of EEG parameters in different frequency bands. The spectral power and phase synchrony of the oscillatory activities are used to classify the periods of rapid reaction time (RT) versus the slow RT responses of each subject. Results: The voting algorithm significantly outperforms classical SVM and gives a good average classification accuracy across 12 subjects (71%) and an average information transfer rate (ITR) of 0.49 bit/min. The main discriminating activities are laterally distributed theta power and anterio-posterior alpha synchronies, possibly reflecting the role of a visual-attentional network in performance. Conclusions: Power and synchrony measurements enable the discrimination between periods of high average reaction time versus periods of low average reaction time in a same subject. Moreover, the proposed approach is easy to interpret as it combines various types of measurements for classification, emphasizing the most informative. Significance: Ongoing EEG recordings can predict the level of performance during a cognitive task. This can lead to real-time EEG monitoring devices for the anticipation of human mistakes.

It is usually subdivided into symptomatic and cryptogenic types, the latter accounting for at least one fourth of all patients. Symptomatic cases are due to diverse cerebral conditions, which are usually bilateral, diffuse, or multifocal, involving cerebral gray matter. Twenty percent of all patients with LGS have prior infantile spasms with hypsarrythmia. The characteristic interictal EEG pattern of LGS is 1.5 to 2.5 Hz SSW activity, which is bilaterally synchronous, dominant over the frontocentral regions, and usually symmetric. There are varying degrees of slowing of the background. Sleep discloses paroxysms of generalized fast (10 to 25 Hz) rhythmic activity.

In this way, classification of mental tasks is under investigation in the BCI society as a basic research. In this paper, a Weighted Distance Nearest Neighbor (WDNN) classifier is presented to improve the classification rate between the left and right imagery tasks in which a weight is assigned to each stored instance. The specified weight of each instance is then used for calculating the distance of a test pattern to that instance. We propose an iterative learning algorithm to specify the weights of training instances such that the error rate of the classifier on training data is minimized. ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) signals are caught from four familiar subjects with the cue-based BCI. The proposed WDNN classifier is applied to the band power and fractal dimension features, which are extracted from EEG signals to classify mental tasks. Results show that our proposed method performs better in some subjects in comparison with the LDA and SVM, as well-known classifiers in the BCI field.

In the first stage, a discrete perceptron is used to eliminate definite non-SSs. The pre-classification done in the first stage not only reduces the computation time but also increases the overall detection performance of the procedure. In the second stage, the remaining SS candidates after pre-classification procedure are aimed to be separated from each other by an artificial neural network that would function as a post-classifier. Two different networks, i.e. a backpropagation multilayer perceptron and radial basis support vector machine (SVM), are proposed as the post-classifier and compared in terms of their classification performances. Visual evaluation, by two electroencephalographers (EEGers), of 19 channel EEG records of 6 subjects showed that the best performance is obtained with a radial basis SVM providing an average sensitivity of 94.6% and an average false detection rate of 4.0%.

J	Lin, CJ; Hsieh, MH				Lin, Cheng-Jian; Hsieh, Ming-Hua			Classification of mental task from EEG data using neural networks based on particle swarm optimization	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization; Migration; Principle component analysis (PCA)	GENETIC ALGORITHM; FEATURE-SELECTION	The brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that transforms the brain activity of different mental tasks into a control signal. The system provides an augmentative communication method for patients with severe motor disabilities. In this paper, a neural classifier based on improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) is proposed to classify an electroencephalogram (EEG) of mental tasks for left-hand movement imagination, right-hand movement imagination, and word generation. First, the EEG patterns utilize principle component analysis (PCA) in order to reduce the feature dimensions. Then a three-layer neural network trained using particle swarm optimization is used to realize a classifier. The proposed IPSO method consists of the modified evolutionary direction operator (MEDO) and the traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). The proposed MEDO combines the evolutionary direction operator (EDO) and the migration. The MEDO can strengthen the searching global solution. The IPSO algorithm can prevent premature convergence and outperform the other existing methods. Experimental results have shown that our method performs well for the classification of mental tasks from EEG data. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Four to five representatives of each drug category have been looked at in terms of changes of frequency content with respect to 6 different frequency ranges (delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta1 and beta2). Basically all drugs within one category show a very similar pattern of changes providing a disease specific "fingerprint" of electrical activity. Discriminant analysis provides the statistical fundament for classification of single drugs into disease specific clusters. The data suggest that this type of analysis of the electrical activity of the brain not only allows for classification of unknown compounds but also can accelerate drug development to a major degree. Finally the recognition of new indications of already launched drugs not only becomes feasible but has resulted in filing of new indication patents.

Preprocessing of EEG signals plays an important role, because an effective preprocessing method will help enhance the efficiency of the feature extraction. In this paper, sparse component analysis (SCA) is employed as a preprocessing method for EEG based BCI. A combined feature vector is constructed. This feature vector consists of a dynamical power feature and a dynamical common spatial pattern (CSP) feature. The dynamical power feature is extracted from selected SCA components, while the dynamical CSP feature is extracted from raw EEG data. Using the presented preprocessing and feature extraction method, we analyze the data for a cursor control BCI carried out at Wadsworth Center. Our results show that SCA preprocessing is the most effective in extracting a component which reflects the subject's intention, and demonstrate the validity of SCA preprocessing for the enhancement of feature extraction.

Three subjects (two males and one female) are volunteered to participate in the experiment. We use a technique of complexity measure based on fractal analysis to reveal feature patterns in the EEG signal. Effective algorithm, namely, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) has been selected to estimate embedded fractal dimension (FD) values between relaxing and imaging states of the recorded EEG signal. To show the waveform of FDs, we use a windowing-based method or called time-dependent fractal dimension (TDFD) and the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence. Two feature parameters; K-L divergence and different expected values are proposed to be input variables of the classifier. Finally, featured data are classified by a three-layer feed-forward neural network based on a simple backpropagation algorithm. Experimental results can be considerably applied in a brain-computer interface (BCI) application and show that the proposed method is more effective than the conventional method by improving average classification rates of 87.5% and 88.3% for left- and right-hand movement imagery tasks, respectively.

In this work, an algorithm based on gradient boosting is presented, that detects event-related potentials in single electroencephalogram (EEG) trials. The algorithm is used to detect the P300 in the human EEG and to build a brain-computer interface (BCI), specifically a spelling device. Important features of the method described here are its high classification accuracy and its conceptual simplicity. The algorithm was tested with datasets recorded in our lab and one benchmark dataset from the BCI Competition 2003.

A New Improved Model-based Seizure Detection using Statistically Optimal Null Filter	2009 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY, VOLS 1-20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	SEP 03-06, 2009	Minneapolis, MN	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc		Automatic seizure detection; EEG; SONF		A patient-specific model-based seizure detection method using statistically optimal null filters (SONF)has been recently proposed to aid the review of long-term EEG [1, 2]. The method relies on the model of a priori known seizure (template pattern) for subsequent detection of similar seizures. Artifacts, non-epileptic EEG rhythms, and at times modeling errors lead to increased false or missed detections. In this paper, we present a new improved model-based seizure detection that introduces a pre-processing block for artifact rejection, an adaptive technique of modeling the template patterns, and a new evolution-based classifier. The proposed classifier tracks the temporal evolution of seizure to improve the classification accuracy. With the help of simulated EEG, we illustrate the significance and need for these modifications. Further, performance of the complete algorithm is tested on single channel depth EEG of seven patients, and compared with the previous approaches. In terms of sensitivity and specificity, the proposed method resulted in 84% and 100%, method of [1] 65% and 84%, and method of [2], 84% and 90% respectively. An overall performance improvement is seen as enhanced detection sensitivity and reduced false positives. This is preliminary result on seven patient data.	[Yadav, Rajeev; Agarwal, R.; Swamy, M. N.

Seperability of four-class motor imagery data using independent components analysis	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; CLASSIFICATION; SEPARATION; PATTERNS; AREAS	This paper compares different ICA preprocessing algorithms on cross-validated training data as well as on unseen test data. The EEG data were recorded from 22 electrodes placed over the whole scalp during motor imagery tasks consisting of four different classes, namely the imagination of right hand, left hand, foot and tongue movements. Two sessions on different days were recorded for eight subjects. Three different independent components analysis (ICA) algorithms (Infomax, FastICA and SOBI) were studied and compared to common spatial patterns (CSP), Laplacian derivations and standard bipolar derivations, which are other well-known preprocessing methods. Among the ICA algorithms, the best performance was achieved by Infomax when using all 22 components as well as for the selected 6 components. However, the performance of Laplacian derivations was comparable with Infomax for both cross-validated and unseen data. The overall best four-class classification accuracies (between 33% and 84%) were obtained with CSR For the cross-validated training data, CSP performed slightly better than Infomax, whereas for unseen test data, CSP yielded significantly better classification results than Infomax in one of the sessions.

In the case of discriminating two classes of signals, EEG signals are projected onto a space where one class of signals is maximally scattered and the other is minimally scattered. This paper finds a minimal number of electrodes that can achieve the discrimination. Applying many electrodes is tedious and time-consuming. To reduce the number of electrodes, we propose inducing sparsity in the spatial filter. We reformulate the optimization problem in Common Spatial Patterns by introducing an l(1)-norm regularization term. Experimental results on five subjects show that the proposed method significantly reduces the number of electrodes while generating features with good discriminatory information. The number of electrodes on average, is reduced to 11% (of the 118 electrodes) while the average drop in the classification accuracy is only 3.8%.

The possible significance of the kind of imagery, involving rather kinesthetic or visual representations of actions, was addressed using the following experimental conditions: kinesthetic motor imagery (MIK), visual-motor imagery (MIV), motor execution (ME) and observation of movement (OOM). Based on multi-channel EEG recordings in 14 right-handed participants, we applied a learning classifier, the distinction sensitive learning vector quantization (DSLVQ) to identify relevant features (i.e., frequency bands, electrode sites) for recognition of the respective mental states. For ME and OOM, the overall classification accuracies were about 80%. The rates obtained for MIK (67%) were better than the results of MIV (56%). Moreover, the focus of activity during kinesthetic imagery was found close to the sensorimotor hand area, whereas visual-motor imagery did not reveal a clear spatial pattern. Consequently, to improve motor-imagery-based BCI control, user training should emphasize kinesthetic experiences instead of visual representations of actions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The electro-encephalographic segments (EEG) delimited by a sequence of photic stimuli presented every 10 sec during a simple reaction-time task (37 min duration) were classified into nine cerebral patterns (EEGP). EEGP segment classifications were grouped into six transitions: (1)alpha-blockade, (2) alpha-persistence, (3) beta-persistence, (4) alpha-induction, (5) activation, and (6) deactivation. The results indicated that GABOB provoked significant changes in EEGP transitions, similar to those usually showed by benzodiazepines. Zolpidem produced a significant amount of alpha blockades h after its administration. By contrast, diazepam and zopiclone did not modify significantly cortical EEG activity.

However, it is known that localized lesions can induce WS and that patients with WS often subsequently develop focal seizures. We evaluated such patients using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Method: Fourteen patients of 3 months to 6 years of age who had or who had previously had WS were examined. MEGs were recorded using a laying-type A hole-cortex MEG system with a 160-channel first-order gradiometer. Twelve-channel electroencephalography (EEG) and one-channel electrocardiography (ECG) were simultaneously recorded. Equivalent current dipoles were estimated at the point of spikes on the EEG. Results: Patients were classified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings into a focal lesion group (group F, n = 7) and a non-focal lesion group (group N, n = 7). The dipoles estimated from the MEG were classified into three groups: W, with the dipoles distributed over a wide brain area (n = 7); WC, dipoles distributed over a wide area along with a dense dipole distribution in a specific cortical area (n = 3); and C, closed dipole distribution in a unilateral cerebral focal area (n = 4). Patients were also classified by the stage of the disease during which the MEG was recorded, and by the type of seizure they experienced. Those with hypsarrhythmia examined early in the disease all had pattern W regardless of their lesion group, whereas those examined later exhibited more diverse dipole patterns that corresponded to seizure type. Conclusions: Dipoles were distributed widely over bilateral cerebral cortex when patients had infantile spasms with hypsarrhythmia whether or not they had focal lesions. The dipole distribution pattern in MEG changed according to changes in seizure type. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

However, accurate SL estimates require the use of many EEG electrodes, when local estimation methods are used. Since BCI devices have to use a limited number of electrodes for practical reasons, we investigated the performances of spline methods for SL estimates using a limited number of electrodes (low resolution SL). In this paper, recognition of mental activity was attempted on both raw and SL-transformed EEG data from five healthy people performing two mental tasks, namely imagined right and left hand movements. Linear classifiers were used including Signal Space Projection (SSP) and Fisher's linear discriminant. Results showed an acceptable average correlation between the waveforms obtained with the low resolution SL and those obtained with the SL computed from 26 electrodes (full resolution SL). Recognition scores for mental EEG-patterns were obtained with the low-resolution surface Laplacian transformation of the recorded potentials when compared with those obtained by using full resolution SL (82%).

This method is based on various techniques: a time-frequency decomposition using sinusoidal filters which improve phase accuracy for low frequencies, a Bayesian approach for the estimation of significant synchrony changes, and a time-frequency-topography visualization technique which allows for easy exploration and provides detailed insights of a particular experiment. Particularly, we focus on in-phase synchrony using an instantaneous phase-lock measure. We also discuss some of the most common methods in the literature, focusing on their relevance to long-range synchrony analysis; this discussion includes a comparison among various synchrony measures. Finally, we present the analysis of a figure categorization experiment to illustrate our method. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The paradigm based on event related evoked potentials is used in this work. Our main goal was to efficiently solve a binary classification problem: presence or absence of P300 in the registers. Genetic Algorithms and Support Vector Machines were used in a wrapper configuration for feature selection and classification. The original input patterns were provided by two channels (Oz and Fz) of resampled EEG registers and wavelet coefficients. To evaluate the performance of the system, accuracy, sensibility and specificity were calculated. The wrapped wavelet patterns show a better performance than the temporal ones. The results were similar for patterns from channel Oz and Fz, together or separated.

Two non-motor imagery tasks were used, Auditory Imagery of a familiar tune and Spatial Navigation imagery through a familiar environment. The aims of this study were to evaluate which method extracts features that could be best differentiated and determine which channels are best suited for classification. EEG activity from 18 electrodes over the temporal and parietal lobes of nineteen healthy subjects was recorded. The features used were auto-regressive and reflection coefficients extracted using autoregressive modeling with several model orders and marginals of the wavelet spaces generated by the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An optimization algorithm with 4 and 6 taps filters and mother wavelets from the Daubechies family were used. The classification was performed for each single channel and for all possible combination of two channels using a Bayesian Classifier. The best classification results were found using the marginals of the Optimized DWT spaces for filters with 6 taps in a 2 channels classification basis. Classification using 2 channels was found to be significantly better than using 1 channel (p << 0.01). The marginals of the optimized DW7 using 6 taps filters showed to be significantly better than the marginals of the Daubechies family and autoregressive coefficients. The influence of the combination of number of channels and feature extraction method over the classification results was not significant (p = 0.97). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The CK-SVDD has lower computational complexity than the widely-used SVM, and better classification accuracy than both SVM and SVDD, thus being able to improve the usability of the P300 speller when it is used in an online mode. We also developed a real-time EEG acquisition and preprocessing module, as well as the software written in C#, which executes the functions of data processing and classification. The results, carried out on three subjects, show that the proposed CK-SVDD consistently performs better than the SVM and the original SVDD in different numbers of rounds. The results also indicate that it can achieve a high character classification accuracy of over 95% for all subjects, even when the number of rounds is less than 4 in some cases, thus being able to provide a fast online testing speed without losing classification accuracy.

Their nosologic independence is now widely accepted, although some controversy initially occurred because of their common characteristics such as age of onset, EEG features, seizure intractability, and poor prognosis. Major differences between the two syndromes include (1) tonic spasms in OS versus partial seizures and erratic myoclonias in EME, (2) continuous suppress ion-burst pattern in both waking and sleeping states in OS versus this EEG pattern almost limited to sleep in EME, and (3) static structural brain damage in OS versus genetic or metabolic disorders in EME. The most important differentiating point is their evolutional pattern with age, which may reflect their pathophysiologic difference. Ohtahara syndrome evolves to West syndrome and further to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome with age, but EME demonstrates no unique evolution; namely, it continues as such for a long time or changes into partial epilepsy or severe epilepsy with multiple independent spike foci.

Designing for uncertain, asymmetric control: Interaction design for brain-computer interfaces	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article						Brain-computer interaction; EEG; Text entry	CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; TOP	Designing user interfaces which can cope with unconventional control properties is challenging, and conventional interface design techniques are of little help. This paper examines how interactions can be designed to explicitly take into account the uncertainty and dynamics of control inputs. In particular, the asymmetry of feedback and control channels is highlighted as a key design constraint, which is especially obvious in current non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Brain-computer interfaces are systems capable of decoding neural activity in real time, thereby allowing a computer application to be directly controlled by thought. BCIs, however, have totally different signal properties than most conventional interaction devices. Bandwidth is very limited and there are comparatively long and unpredictable delays. Such interfaces cannot simply be treated as unwieldy mice. In this respect they are an example of a growing field of sensor-based interfaces which have unorthodox control properties. As a concrete example, we present the text entry application "Hex-O-Spell", controlled via motor-imagery based electroencephalography (EEG). The system utilizes the high visual display bandwidth to help compensate for the limited control signals, where the timing of the state changes encodes most of the information. We present results showing the comparatively high performance of this interface, with entry rates exceeding seven characters per minute. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Parrino, L; Smerieri, A; Rossi, M; Terzano, MG				Parrino, L; Smerieri, A; Rossi, M; Terzano, MG			Relationship of slow and rapid EEG components of CAP to ASDA arousals in normal sleep	SLEEP			English	Article						sleep; EEG; arousals; cyclic alternating pattern	CYCLIC ALTERNATING PATTERN; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; CARDIAC ACTIVATION; HIERARCHY; AGE	Study Objectives: Besides arousals (according to the ASDA definition), sleep contains also K-complexes and delta bursts which, in spite of their sleep-like features, are endowed with activating effects on autonomic functions. The link between phasic delta activities and enhancement of vegetative functions indicates the possibility of physiological activation without sleep disruption (i.e., arousal without awakening). A functional connection seems to include slow (K-complexes and delta bursts) and rapid (arousals) EEG events within the comprehensive term of activating complexes. CAP (cyclic alternating pattern) is the spontaneous EEG rhythm that ties both slow and rapid activating complexes together during NREM sleep. The present study aims at exploring the relationship between arousals and CAP components in a selected sample of healthy sleepers. Design: Polysomnographic analysis according to the scoring rules for sleep stages and arousals. CAP analysis included also tabulation of subtypes Al (slow EEG activating complexes), A2 and A3 (activating complexes with fast EEG components). Setting: 40 sleep-lab accomplished recordings. Participants: Healthy subjects belonging to a wide age range (38 +/- 20 yrs.). Interventions: N/A Measurement and Results: Of all the arousals occurring in NREM sleep, 87% were inserted within CAP. Subtypes A2 and A3 of CAP corresponded strikingly with arousals (r=0.843; p <0.0001), while no statistical relationship emerged when arousals were matched with subtypes Al of CAP. Subtypes Al instead correlated positively with the percentages of deep sleep (r=0.366; p <0.02). Conclusions: The CAP subtype classification encompasses both the process of sleep maintenance (subtypes Al) and sleep fragmentation (subtypes A2 and A3), and provides a periodicity dimension to the activating events of NREM sleep.

In order to evaluate their usefulness, the most common instrumental procedures were evaluated, on the basis of evidence from the literature, by an EFNS Task Force (TF) on neurophysiological tests and imaging procedures in non-acute headache patients. The conclusions of the TF regarding each technique are expressed in the following guidelines for clinical use. 1 Interictal electroencephalography (EEG) is not routinely indicated in the diagnostic evaluation of headache patients. Interictal EEG is. however, indicated if the clinical history suggests a possible diagnosis of epilepsy (differential diagnosis). Ictal EEG could be useful in certain patients suffering from hemiplegic and basilar migraine. 2 Recording of evoked potentials is not recommended for the diagnosis of headache disorders. 3 There is no evidence to justify the recommendation of autonomic tests for the routine clinical examination of headache patients. 4 Manual palpation of pericranial muscles, with standardized palpation pressure, can be recommended for subdividing patient groups but not for diagnosis. Pressure algometry and electromyography (EMG) cannot be recommended as clinical diagnostic tests. 5 In adult and paediatric patients with migraine, with no recent change in attack pattern, no history of seizures, and no other Focal neurological signs or symptoms, the routine use of neuroimaging is not warranted. In patients with atypical headache patterns, a history Of seizures and/or focal neurological signs or symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be indicated. 6 If attacks can be fully accounted for by the standard headache classification [International Headache Society (IHS)], a positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and scan will generally be of no further diagnostic value. 7 Nuclear medicine examinations of the cerebral circulation and metabolism can be carried out in Subgroups of headache patients for diagnosis and evaluation of complications, when patients experience unusually severe attacks, or when the quality or severity of attacks has changed. 8 Transcranial Doppler examination is not helpful in headache diagnosis. Although many of the examinations described are of little or no value in the clinical setting, most of the tools have a vast potential for further exploring the pathophysiology of headaches and the effects of pharmacological treatment.

Method. The FTD sample consisted of 19 patients, the AD sample of 16 patients, and the control group of 19 subjects. Groups were matched on the group level with respect to demographic variables. For qEEG the global field power was calculated for six frequency bands: delta (1.0-3.5 Hz), theta (4.0-7.5 Hz), alpha (8.0-11.0 Hz), beta1 (12.0-15.5 Hz), beta2 (16.0-19.5 Hz), beta3 (20.0-23.5 Hz), and spectral ratio as the ratio of the sum of fast frequency bands alpha + beta1 + beta2 + beta3 and slow frequency bands delta + theta. Results: In comparison to controls FTD patients were marked by an absence of an increase in slow qEEG activities and a decrease in fast activities, whereas AD patients were marked by an increase in slow activities and a smaller decrease in fast activities. According to the Mann-Whitney U test the cognitive functions of attention, visuospatial thinking and episodic memory were significantly better in FTD than in AD. Using logistic regression analysis the best predictors of FTD and AD were in a model using the delta and theta activities, and high levels of visuospatial ability and episodic memory. Classification accuracy of the model was 93.3%. Conclusion: FTD patients reveal a different pattern of qEEG changes than AD patients. This result demonstrates the importance of qEEG for FTD diagnosis. Cognition is selectively better in FTD than in AD. A combination of qEEG and neuropsychology is recommended for differential diagnoses of FTD and AD. Copyright (C) 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.

We have devised a novel pattern recognition procedure based on independent component analysis (ICA). Different from the conventional cancer classification methods, which are limited in their clinical applicability of cancer diagnosis, our method extracts explicitly, by ICA algorithm, a set of specific diagnostic patterns of normal and tumor tissues corresponding to a set of biomarkers for clinical use. We validated our procedure with the colon and prostate cancer data sets and achieved good diagnosis (> 90%) on the data sets studied here. This technique is also suitable for the identification of diagnostic expression patterns for other human cancers and demonstrates the feasibility of simple and accurate molecular cancer diagnostics for clinical implementation.

J	Acir, N				Acir, N			Automated system for detection of epileptiform patterns in EEG by using a modified RBFN classifier	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						EEG; automatic spike detection; radial basis function networks; neural networks; pattern recognition	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SPIKE DETECTION; DISCHARGES; RAW; QUANTIFICATION; RECOGNITION	In this paper, we present a two-stage system based on a modified radial basis function network (RBFN) classifier for an automated detection of epileptiforrn pattern (EP) in an electroencephalographic signal. In the first stage, a discrete perceptron fed by six features are used to classify the peaks into two subgroups: (i) definite non-EPs and (ii) definite EPs and EP-like non-EPs. In the second stage, the peaks falling into the second group are aimed to be separated from each other by a modified RBFN designed by a perturbation method that would function as a post-classifier. If there exist redundant data components in training data set, they can be discarded by analyzing the total disturbance of the RBFN output corresponding to the perturbed inputs. Thus, input dimension size is reduced and network becomes smaller. The classification performance of the system is comparatively evaluated for three different feature sets such as raw EEG data, discrete Fourier transform coefficients, and discrete wavelet transform coefficients.

It's development is based on known combinations of computational geometric algorithms with the aim of distinguishing between the EEGs of unrelated healthy individuals for person identification purposes. In the present study the classification results of the proposed method and those of a Radial Basis Function-(RBF) network, which were presented in our latest study, are evaluated statistically. The aim of this statistical process is to corroborate the claim that the CGA method is more efficient than the RBF network at correctly classifying EEG vectors and to verify the results of our previous studies, which showed that the EEGs of an individual carry common, specific, "genetic" features.

The biological basis of this task design is on the understanding that mental fatigue is a cortical deactivation. This AVT is simple to perform, free of learning curve and independent on acquired skills (aptitude, knowledge). The validity and sensitivity of this task was verified by a scientifically controlled 25-hour fatigue experiment recorded by Electroencephalogram (EEG). Results showed that this AVT is highly sensitive to changes during fatigue process. The effectiveness of this AVT was compared to one subjective rating scale (FSS). The 5-level fatigue EEG datasets (labeled by AVT and FSS respectively) were fed into Support Vector Machines (SVM). SVM test accuracy indicated that AVT is more effective than subject's own estimation. The results demonstrate conclusively that this AVT is suitable for fatigue detection study as a reliable validation criterion.

J	Popovici, V; Thiran, JP				Popovici, V; Thiran, JP			Pattern recognition using higher-order local autocorrelation coefficients	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article								The autocorrelations have been previously used as features for 1D or 2D signal classification in a wide range of applications, like texture classification, face detection and recognition, EEG signal classification, and so on. However, in almost all the cases, the high computational costs have hampered the extension to higher orders (more than the second order). In this paper we present an effective method for using higher order autocorrelation functions for pattern recognition. We will show that while the autocorrelation feature vectors (described below) are elements of a high dimensional space, one may avoid their explicit computation when the method employed can be expressed in terms of inner products of input vectors. Different typical scenarios of using the autocorrelations will be presented and we will show that the order of autocorrelations is no longer an obstacle. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We propose a combination of linear and nonlinear features for classification of four different types of heart rhythms through heart rate variability analysis. Classification accuracy is evaluated by three well-known machine learning algorithms: C4.5, support vector machines and random forest. The algorithms' success rates are compared. The method of combining linear and nonlinear measures shows promising results in heart rate variability modeling. Random forest method has exhibited 99.6% classification accuracy.

In this paper, the EEG signal recorded during three motor imagery tasks, which were imagination of left hand, right hand and foot movements, was investigated. A novel method named Hilbert Huang transform (HHT) is introduced to extract the feature from signal. Firstly, raw signal is decomposed using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). And then, several Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) are gained. For further study, the IMFs whose main frequency is higher than 5 Hz are selected. Secondly, based on the IMFs selected above, hilbert spectrum is calculated. In each motor imagery task, local instantaneous energies, within specific frequency band of electrode C3 and C4, are selected as the features. A three-layer BP Neural Network classifier is structured for pattern classification.

In this study we propose an application of this body of technologies, originally developed to obtain functional images of the brain's electrical activity, in the context of brain-computer interfaces (130). Our working hypothesis predicted that, since HREEG pre-processing removes spatial correlation introduced by current conduction in the head structures, by providing the BCI with waveforms that are mostly due to the unmixed activity of a small cortical region, a more reliable classification would be obtained, at least when the activity to detect has a limited generator, which is the case in motor related tasks. HREEG techniques employed in this study rely on (i) individual head models derived from anatomical magnetic resonance images, (ii) distributed source model, composed of a layer of current dipoles, geometrically constrained to the cortical mantle, (iii) depth-weighted minimum L-2-norm constraint and Tikhonov regularization for linear inverse problem solution and (iv) estimation of electrical activity in cortical regions of interest corresponding to relevant Brodmann areas. Six subjects were trained to learn self modulation of sensorimotor EEG rhythms, related to the imagination of limb movements. Off-line EEG data was used to estimate waveforms of cortical activity (cortical current density, CCD) on selected regions of interest. CCD waveforms were fed into the BCI computational pipeline as an alternative to raw EEG signals; spectral features are evaluated through statistical tests (r(2) analysis), to quantify their reliability for BCI control. These results are compared, within subjects, to analogous results obtained without HREEG techniques. The processing procedure was designed in such a way that computations could be split into a setup phase (which includes most of the computational burden) and the actual EEG processing phase, which was limited to a single matrix multiplication. This separation allowed to make the procedure suitable for on-line utilization, and a pilot experiment was performed. Results show that lateralization of electrical activity, which is expected to be contralateral to the imagined movement, is more evident on the estimated CCDs than in the scalp potentials. CCDs produce a pattern of relevant spectral features that is more spatially focused, and has a higher statistical significance (EEG: 0.20 +/- 0.114 S.D.; CCD: 0.55 +/- 0. 16 S.D.; p = 10(-5)). A pilot experiment showed that a trained subject could utilize voluntary modulation of estimated CCDs for accurate (eight targets) on-line control of a cursor. This study showed that it is practically feasible to utilize HREEG techniques for on-line operation of a BCI system; off-line analysis suggests that accuracy of BCI control is enhanced by the proposed method.

In some cases, there is a need to accurately measure a person's level of attention to monitor a sportsman performance, to detect Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children, to evaluate the effectiveness of neuro-feedback treatment, etc. In this paper we propose a novel approach to extract, select and learn spectral-spatial patterns from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Our approach improves over prior-art methods that was, typically, only concerned with power of specific EEG rhythms from few individual channels. In this new approach, spectral-spatial features from multichannel EEG are extracted by a two filtering stages: a filter-hank (FB) and common spatial patterns (CSP) filters. The most important features are selected by a Mutual Information (MI) based feature selection procedure and then classified using Fisher linear discriminant (FLD). The outcome is a measure of the attention level. An experimental study was conducted with 5 healthy young male subjects with their EEG recorded in various attention and non-attention conditions (opened eyes, closed eyes, reading, counting, relaxing, etc.). EEGs were used to train and evaluate the model using 4x4fold cross-validation procedure. Results indicate that the new proposed approach outperforms the prior-art methods and can achieve up to 89.4% classification accuracy rate (with an average improvement of up to 16%). We demonstrate its application with a two-players attention-based racing car computer game.

EEG-based classification for elbow versus shoulder torque intentions involving stroke subjects	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Electroencephalograph (EEG); Classification; Stroke; Elbow flexion; Shoulder abduction; Brain-computer interface; Time-frequency synthesized spatial pattern algorithm; Support-vector machine; Classification and regression tree	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; BCI COMPETITION 2003; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; MOTOR IMAGERY; DESYNCHRONIZATION; RECOGNITION; SELECTION; SIGNAL; POWER	The ultimate aim for classifying elbow versus shoulder torque intentions is to develop robust brain-computer interface (BCI) devices for patients who suffer from movement disorders following brain injury such as stroke. In this paper, we investigate the advanced classification approach classifier-enhanced time-frequency synthesized spatial pattern algorithm (classifier-enhanced TFSP) in classifying a subject's intent of generating an isometric shoulder abduction (SABD) or elbow flexion (EF) torque using signals obtained from 163 scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) electrodes. Two classifiers, the support vector classifier (SVC) and the classification and regression tree (CART), are integrated in the TFSP algorithm that decomposes the signal into a weighted time, frequency and spatial feature space. The resulting high-performing methods (SVC-TFSP and CART-TFSP) are then applied to experimental data collected in four healthy subjects and two stroke subjects. Results are compared with the original TFSP, and significantly higher reliability in both healthy subjects (92% averaged over four healthy subjects) and stroke subjects (75% averaged over two subjects) are achieved. The accuracies of classifier-enhanced TFSP methods are further improved after a rejection scheme is applied (similar to 100% in healthy subjects and > 80% in stroke subjects). The results are among the highest reliability reported in literature for tasks with spatial representations on the motor cortex as close as shoulder and elbow. The paper also discusses the impact of applying rejection strategy in detail and reports the existence of an optimal rejection rate on a stroke subject. The results indicate that the proposed algorithms are promising for future use of rehabilitative BCI applications in neurologically impaired patients. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The assessment of wavelet transform (WT) as a feature extraction method was used in representing the electrophysiological signals. Considering that classification is often more accurate when the pattern is simplified through representation by important features, the feature extraction and selection play an important role in classifying systems such as neural networks. The PPG, ECG, EEG signals were decomposed into time-frequency representations using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the statistical features were calculated to depict their distribution. Our pilot study investigation for any possible electrophysiological activity alterations due to ELF PEMF exposure, was evaluated by the efficiency of DWT as a feature extraction method in representing the signals. As a result, this feature extraction has been justified as a feasible method. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

EEG-based BCI features are often noisy and likely to contain outliers. This contribution describes the application of a fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) with a radial basis function kernel for classifying motor imagery tasks, while the statistical features over the set of the wavelet coefficients were extracted to characterize the time-frequency distribution of EEG signals. In the proposed FSVM classifier, a low fraction of support vectors was used as a criterion for choosing the kernel parameter and the trade-off parameter, together with the membership parameter based solely on training data. FSVM and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers outperformed the winner of the BCI Competition 2003 and other similar studies on the same Graz dataset, in terms of the competition criterion of the mutual information (MI), while the FSVM classifier yielded a better performance than the SVM approach. FSVM and SVM classifiers perform much better than the winner of the BCI Competition 2005 on the same Graz dataset for the subject 03 according to the competition criterion of the maximal MI steepness, while the FSVM classifier outperforms the SVM method. The proposed FSVM model has potential in reducing the effects of noise or outliers in the online classification of EEG signals in BCIs. (C) 2009 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Automatic detection of A phases of the Cyclic Alternating Pattern during sleep	2010 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC 10)	AUG 30-SEP 04, 2010	Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			MICROSTRUCTURE; DOMAIN	This study aimed to develop an automatic algorithm to detect the activation phases (A phases) of the Cyclic Alternating Pattern. The sleep EEG microstructure of 4 adult, healthy subjects was scored by a sleep medicine expert. Features were calculated from each of the six EEG bands (low delta, high delta, theta, alpha, sigma and beta), and three additional characteristics were computed: the Hjorth activity in the low delta and high delta bands, and the differential variance of the raw EEG signal. The correlation between couples of features was analyzed to find redundancies for the automatic analysis. The features were used to train an Artificial Neural Network to automatically find the A phases of CAP. The data were divided into training, validation and testing set, and the visual scoring provided by the clinician was used as the desired output. The statistics on the second by second classification show an average sensitivity equal to 76%, specificity equal to 83% and accuracy equal to 82%. The results obtained are encouraging, since an automatic classification of the A phases could benefit the practice in clinics, preventing the physician from the time-consuming activity of visually scoring the sleep microstructure over the whole eight-hour sleep recordings. Moreover, it would provide an objective criterion capable of overcoming the problems of inter-scorer variability.

State I indicates heightened alertness and is frequently present during the first few minutes of time on task. State 2 indicates normal alertness, often following and lasting longer than State 1. State 3 indicates fatigue, usually following State 2, but sometimes alternating with State I and State 2. Thirty-channel EEGs were recorded from 16 subjects who performed up to 180 min of nonstop computer-based mental arithmetic. Alert or fatigued states were independently confirmed with measures of subjects' performance and pre- or post-task mood. We found convergent evidence for a three-state model of fatigue using Bayesian analysis of two different types of EEG features, both computed for single 13-s EEG epochs: 1) kernel partial least squares scores representing composite multichannel power spectra; 2) amplitude and frequency parameters of multiple single-channel autoregressive models.

Imaging haemodynamic changes related to seizures: Comparison of EEG-based general linear model, independent component analysis of fMRI and intracranial EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							TRIGGERED FUNCTIONAL MRI; SPIKE; EPILEPSY; LOCALIZATION; SIGNATURES; NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; DISCHARGES; RESPONSES; PERFUSION	Background: Simultaneous EEC-fMRI can reveal haemodynamic changes associated with epileptic activity which may contribute to understanding seizure onset and propagation. Methods: Nine of 83 patients with focal epilepsy undergoing pre-surgical evaluation had seizures during EEG-fMRI and analysed using three approaches, two based on the general linear model (GLM) and one using independent component analysis (ICA): 1. EEGs were divided into up to three phases: early ictal EEG change, clinical seizure onset and late ictal EEG change and convolved with a canonical haemodynamic response function (HRF) (canonical GLM analysis). 2. Seizures lasting three scans or longer were additionally modelled using a Fourier basis set across the entire event (Fourier GLM analysis). 3. Independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to the fMRI data to identify ictal BOLD patterns without EEG. The results were compared with intracranial EEG. Results: The canonical GLM analysis revealed significant BOLD signal changes associated with seizures on EEG in 7/9 patients, concordant with the seizure onset zone in 4/7. The Fourier GLM analysis revealed changes in BOLD signal corresponding with the results of the canonical analysis in two patients. ICA revealed components spatially concordant with the seizure onset zone in all patients (8/9 confirmed by intracranial EEG). Conclusion: Ictal EEG-fMRI visualises plausible seizure related haemodynamic changes. The GLM approach to analysing EEG-fMRI data reveals localised BOLD changes concordant with the ictal onset zone when scalp EEG reflects seizure onset. ICA provides additional information when scalp EEG does not accurately reflect seizures and may give insight into ictal haemodynamics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Thornton, R.

At present, however, the use of BCIs is severely limited by low bit-transfer rates. We systematically analyze and develop two recent concepts, both capable of enhancing the information gain from multichannel scalp EEG recordings: 1) the combination of classifiers, each specifically tailored for different physiological phenomena, e.g., slow cortical potential shifts, such as the premovement Bereitschaftspotential or differences in spatio-spectral distributions of brain activity (i.e., focal event-related desynchronizations) and 2) behavioral paradigms inducing the subjects to generate one out of several brain states (multiclass approach) which all bare a distinctive spatio-temporal signature well discriminable in the standard scalp EEG. We derive information-theoretic predictions and demonstrate their relevance in experimental data. We will show that a suitably arranged interaction between these concepts can significantly boost BCI performances.

The sequential forward floating search (SFFS) was used to select features from relative average power for channel locations in frequency bands delta, theta, alpha, and beta, and coherence between intrahemispheric channel pairs for the same frequency ranges. The selected feature sets allowed us to achieve close to 90% classifier accuracy when classifying MCI patients and normal subjects. Our results showed that selecting features from a combined set of power and coherence features produced better results than the use of either feature independently. The combined feature set also showed better classification rates than a Bayesian classifier fusion approach.

To this end, we propose an alternative to the conventional regression/classification-based mechanism for building the transformation from EEG features into a univariate control signal. Based on information theory, the mechanism formulates the optimum transformation as maximizing the mutual information between the control signal and the mental state. We introduce a non-parametric mutual information estimate for general output distribution, and then develop a gradient-based algorithm to optimize the transformation using training data. We conduct an offline simulation study using motor imagery data from the BCI Competition IV Data Set I. The results show that the learning algorithm converged quickly, and the proposed method yielded significantly higher BCI performance than the conventional mechanism.

Following optimum classification schemes, the sensitivity of the network ranges from 79.2% to 87.5%, while the false positive rate ranges from 3.8% to 15.5%. Furthermore, due to the operation of the ANN on time-domain EEG data, there is agreement with visual assessment concerning temporal resolution. Specifically, the total inter-spindle interval duration and the total duration of spindles are calculated with 99% and 92% accuracy, respectively. Therefore, the present method may be suitable for investigations of the dynamics among successive inter-spindle intervals, which could provide information on the role of spindles in the steep process, and for studies of pharmacological effects on steep structure, as revealed by the modification of total spindle duration.

The proposed system can help individuals get the feel of motor imagery by presenting them with real-time brain activation maps on their cortex. Ten healthy participants took part in our experiment, half of whom were trained by the suggested training system and the others did not use any training. All participants in the trained group succeeded in performing motor imagery after a series of trials to activate their motor cortex without any physical movements of their limbs. To confirm the effect of the suggested system, we recorded EEG signals for the trained group around sensorimotor cortex while they were imagining either left or right hand movements according to our experimental design, before and after the motor imagery training. For the control group, we also recorded EEG signals twice without any training sessions. The participants' intentions were then classified using a time-frequency analysis technique, and the results of the trained group showed significant differences in the sensorimotor rhythms between the signals recorded before and after training. Classification accuracy was also enhanced considerably in all participants after motor imagery training compared to the accuracy before training. On the other hand, the analysis results for the control EEG data set did not show consistent increment in both the number of meaningful time-frequency combinations and the classification accuracy, demonstrating that the suggested system can be used as a tool for training motor imagery tasks in BCI applications. Further, we expect that the motor imagery training system will be useful not only for BCI applications, but for functional brain mapping studies that utilize motor imagery tasks as well.

Based on Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), we recently proposed an approach to ARD utilizing genetic algorithms. Another approach is the Generalized Relevance LVQ which has been shown to outperform other algorithms of the LVQ family. In the following we present a unique description of a number of LVQ algorithms and compare them concerning their classification accuracy and their efficacy. For this purpose a real world data set consisting of spontaneous EEG and EOG during overnight-driving is employed to detect so-called microsleep events. Results show that relevance learning can improve classification accuracies, but do not reach the performance of Support Vector Machines. The computational costs for the best performing classifiers are exceptionally high and exceed basic LVQ1 by a factor of 10(4).

High resolution event related brain potentials were recorded to capture the brain activation underlying the motor execution and motor imagery. ERS and ERD were studied using a complex morlet wavelet decomposition of EEG responses. The results show similar patterns of beta ERD/ERS after the stimulus onset, for both the actual and imagery finger tapping task. This approach and results can be regarded as indicative evidences of a new strategy for recognizing imagined movements in EEG-based brain computer interface research. The long-term objective of this study is to create a multiposition brain controlled switch that is activated by signals that are measured directly from a human's brain.

These EEGs are heavily corrupted by cardiac, eye movement, muscle, and noise artifacts and, as a consequence, some EEG features are irrelevant to classification problems. Combining the polynomial network and decision tree techniques, we discover comprehensible classification rules while also attempting to keep their classification error down. This technique is shown to outperform a number of commonly used machine learning technique applied to automatically recognize artifacts in the sleep EEGs.

The BCI uses the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) generated in response to phase-reversing checkerboard patterns. Two power-spectrum estimation methods were employed for feature extraction in a series of offline classification tests. Both methods were also implemented during real-time game play. The performance of the BCI was found to be robust to distracting visual stimulation in the game and relatively consistent across six subjects, with 41 of 48 games successfully completed. For the best performing feature extraction method, the average real-time control accuracy across subjects was 89%. The feasibility of obtaining reliable control in such a visually rich environment using SSVEPs is thus demonstrated and the impact of this result is discussed.

Part 4: Neural frame simulation	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Hilbert transform; neural frame; noise (1/f); phase slip; simulated EEG; spatial power spectral density (PSDX); volume conduction	NEUROBIOLOGICAL THEORY; STATE TRANSITIONS; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; GAMMA EEGS; PHASE; DYNAMICS; SYNCHRONIZATION; METASTABILITY; OSCILLATIONS; PERCEPTION	Objective: To develop a method for simulating background EEG based on the premise that the self-organized activity from synaptic interaction among populations Of neurons creates Sustained fluctuations that can be modeled with the filtered output of a random number generator. Methods: The logarithm of the amplitude of activity was weighted in accordance with 1/f, the log frequency in both temporal (PSDT) and spatial (PSDx) power spectral densities. The activity was spatially smoothed by volume conduction. Further deviation from full randomness was by sustained spatial coherence averaging 25% of total power. The departure from the background state to an active state, as seen in the awake EEG, was Simulated by adding segments that were 90% correlated while attenuating by 50% the uncorrelated background activity in those segments. Spatial amplitude modulation was imposed on the correlated noise to create signals that simulated AM patterns. Results: The statistical properties of the EEG that were replicated (Freeman, 2004a,b, 2005) included the PSDT, PSDX, point spread function (PSF), partitioning of the variance with PCA, and the percentages of correct classification of AM patterns. Conclusions: The origin of background EEG was traced to self-sustaining mutual excitation among pyramidal cells creating stable noise that was filtered by self-organized criticality to give l/f(2) PSD, by inhibitory feedback to give oscillations in the classic clinical bands, and by Volume conduction to give smoothing. The essential chance that identified a frame in EEG was transient synchrony by phase transition among cortical populations in beta and gamma bands of the PSDT. Significance: This simulation can provide test data with which to optimize techniques for noninvasively extracting information from the EEG for diagnosis and treatment evaluation of neuropsychiatric disorders and for operation by paraplegics of prosthetic devices.

J	Freeman, WJ; Barrie, JM				Freeman, WJ; Barrie, JM			Analysis of spatial patterns of phase in neocortical gamma EEGs in rabbit	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; OLFACTORY EEG; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CORTICAL AREAS; NEURONS; RAT; SYNCHRONIZATION	Arrays of 64 electrodes (8 X 8, 7 X 7 mm) were implanted epidurally on the surface of the visual, auditory or somatosensory cortex of rabbits trained to discriminate conditioned stimuli in the corresponding modality. The 64 electroencephalographic (EEG) traces at all times displayed a high degree of spatial coherence in wave form, averaging >90% of the variance in the largest principal components analysis component. The EEGs were decomposed with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to give the spatial distributions of amplitude and phase modulation (AM and PM) in segments 128 ms in duration. Spatial (2-dimensional) and temporal (1-dimensional) filters were designed to optimize classification of the spatial AM patterns in the gamma range (20-80 Hz) with respect to discriminative conditioned stimuli. No evidence was found for stimulus-dependent classification of the spatial PM patterns. Instead some spatial PM distributions conformed to the pattern of a cone. The location and sign (maximal lead or lag) of the conic apex varied randomly with each recurrence. The slope of the phase gradient varied in a range corresponding to that of the conduction velocities reported of axons to extend parallel to the cortical surfaces. The durations and times of recurrence of the phase cones corresponded to those of the optimally classified spatial AM patterns. The interpretation is advanced that the phase cones are manifestations of state transitions in the mesoscopic dynamics of sensory cortices by which the intermittent AM patterns are formed. The phase cones show that the gamma EEG spatial coherence is not due to volume conduction from a single deep-lying dipole generator nor to activity at the site of the reference lead on monopolar recording. The random variation of the apical sign shows that gamma AM patterns are self-organized and are not imposed by thalamic pacemakers. The half-power radius of the phase gradient provides a useful measure of the soft boundary condition for the formation and read-out of cooperative cortical domains responsible for binding sensory information into the context of prior experience in the process of perception.

Methods: The EEGs of 60 female patients between 22 and 85 years of age were monitored continuously during standardized induction of anaesthesia with 2 mg of propofol kg(-1)60 s(-1). The EEGs were visually assessed in 20-s epochs according to a scale from A (awake) to F (very deep hypnosis). Visual EEG classifications, spectral parameters, and induction times were compared between different age groups. Additionally, data of 546 patients included in a multicentre study with 4630 patients (EEG monitor Narcotrend(R), MT MonitorTechnik, Bad Bramstedt, Germany) were analyzed with regard to age-dependent changes of propofol consumption using target-controlled infusion (TCI). Results: During induction, patients older than 70 years reached significantly deeper EEG stages than younger patients, needed a longer time to reach the deepest EEG stage, and needed more time until a light EEG stage was regained. In patients aged 70 years and older, the total power, mainly in deep EEG stages, was significantly smaller due to a distinctly smaller absolute power of the delta frequency band. No single spectral parameter was able to reliably distinguish all EEG stages. During the steady state of anaesthesia, older patients needed less propofol for the maintenance of a defined stage of hypnosis than younger patients. Conclusion: Older patients differ from younger ones regarding the hypnotic effect of propofol and the spectral patterns in the EEG. For an efficient automatic assessment of the EEG during anaesthesia a multivariable approach accounting for age-effects is indispensable.

We aimed at identifying prognostic factors for the surgical outcome of lesional neocortical TLE. Methods: We included consecutive patients who had undergone presurgical evaluation including ictal. video-EEG and high-resolution MRI, who had TLE due to neocortical lateral epileptogenic lesions, who had a lesionectomy and who had > 2-year follow-up. Results: There were 29 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Twenty of them became postoperatively seizure-free. Patients' mean age was 34.8 +/- 9 years (range 18-52). The age at epilepsy onset was 20.1 +/- 8 years. We found that left-sided surgery (p = 0.048) and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) on MRI (p = 0.005) were associated with non-seizure-free outcome, while lateralized/localized EEG seizure pattern (p = 0.032), tumors on the MRI (p = 0.013), and a favorable seizure situation at the 6-month postoperative evaluation were associated with 2-year postoperative seizure-freedom (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that the side of surgery was not an independent predictor. Conclusion: More than two-thirds of the patients with neocortical TLE became seizure-free postoperatively. Lateralized/localized EEG seizure pattern and tumors on the MRI were associated with postoperative seizure-freedom, while FCD were associated with a poor outcome. The 6-month postoperative outcome is a reliable predictor for the tong-term outcome. (c) 2006 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While the neurophysiological mechanisms of action for many CAM treatments and pain are not well understood and controversy regarding their clinical efficacy remains, neuroimaging research can begin to decode any specific treatment-related mechanisms, if indeed they exist. This chapter will briefly outline the pain neuromatrix and modern neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetoencephalography (MEG). We will also summarize neuroimaging results for several CAM treatments, though the focus will be on acupuncture, which has been most extensively researched with neuroimaging. Acupuncture is an ancient healing modality that originated in China and has been in use for over 2000 years. Importantly, acupuncture needling often evokes complex somatosensory sensations and may modulate the cognitive/affective perception of pain, Suggesting that many effects are mediated by the brain and extending central nervous system (CNS) networks. Other CAM modalities evaluated with neuroimaging include meditation and biofeedback. We will also discuss future directions for CAM neuroimaging research, as this is a very dynamic and evolving field which may ultimately shed light on the mechanisms of action for several CAM treatments.

A pattern recognition system determines which brain activity pattern a user is producing and thereby infers the user's mental task, allowing users to send messages or commands through brain activity alone. Unfortunately, despite extensive research to improve classification accuracy, BCIs almost always exhibit errors, which are sometimes so severe that effective communication is impossible. We recently introduced a new idea to improve accuracy, especially for users with poor performance. In an offline simulation of a "hybrid" BCI, subjects performed two mental tasks independently and then simultaneously. This hybrid BCI could use two different types of brain signals common in BCIs - event-related desynchronization (ERD) and steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs). This study suggested that such a hybrid BCI is feasible. Here, we re-analyzed the data from our initial study. We explored eight different signal processing methods that aimed to improve classification and further assess both the causes and the extent of the benefits of the hybrid condition. Most analyses showed that the improved methods described here yielded a statistically significant improvement over our initial study. Some of these improvements could be relevant to conventional BCIs as well. Moreover, the number of illiterates could be reduced with the hybrid condition. Results are also discussed in terms of dual task interference and relevance to protocol design in hybrid BCIs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yuan, H; Perdoni, C; He, B				Yuan, Han; Perdoni, Christopher; He, Bin			Relationship between speed and EEG activity during imagined and executed hand movements	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MOTOR IMAGERY TASKS; CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; ARM MOVEMENTS; ALPHA-RHYTHM; CORTEX; DIRECTION; CLASSIFICATION; NEURONS; HUMANS	The relationship between primary motor cortex and movement kinematics has been shown in nonhuman primate studies of hand reaching or drawing tasks. Studies have demonstrated that the neural activities accompanying or immediately preceding the movement encode the direction, speed and other information. Here we investigated the relationship between the kinematics of imagined and actual hand movement, i.e. the clenching speed, and the EEG activity in ten human subjects. Study participants were asked to perform and imagine clenching of the left hand and right hand at various speeds. The EEG activity in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (18-28 Hz) frequency bands were found to be linearly correlated with the speed of imagery clenching. Similar parametric modulation was also found during the execution of hand movements. A single equation relating the EEG activity to the speed and the hand (left versus right) was developed. This equation, which contained a linear independent combination of the two parameters, described the time-varying neural activity during the tasks. Based on the model, a regression approach was developed to decode the two parameters from the multiple-channel EEG signals. We demonstrated the continuous decoding of dynamic hand and speed information of the imagined clenching. In particular, the time-varying clenching speed was reconstructed in a bell-shaped profile. Our findings suggest an application to providing continuous and complex control of noninvasive brain-computer interface for movement-impaired paralytics.

Techniques for early detection of Alzheimer's disease using spontaneous EEG recordings	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						MCI; Alzheimer's disease; EEG; CSP; entropy	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; BACKGROUND ACTIVITY; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; NONLINEARITY; ENTROPY; BCI	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease which causes serious cognitive decline. Studies suggest that effective treatments for AD may be aided by the detection of the disease in its early stages, prior to extensive neuronal degeneration. In this paper, we propose a set of novel techniques which could help to perform this task, and present the results of experiments conducted to evaluate these approaches. The challenge is to discriminate between spontaneous EEG recordings from two groups of subjects: one afflicted with mild cognitive impairment and eventual AD and the other an age-matched control group. The classification results obtained indicate that the proposed methods are promising additions to the existing tools for detection of AD, though further research and experimentation with larger datasets is required to verify their effectiveness.

The EEGs from the patients were compared with recordings from 80 dextral healthy female controls. Only those subjects who could provide 20 1-s artefact-free segments of EEG were admitted into the study. The analysis consisted of the identification of the spatial patterns in the EEGs that maximally differentiated the two groups and the estimation of the cortical source distributions underlying these patterns. Spatial patterns were analyzed in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (14-20 Hz) bands and the source distributions were estimated using the Borgiotti-Kaplan BEAMFORMER algorithm. The results indicate that the spatial patterns identified were effective in separating the two groups, providing a minimum correct retrospective classification rate of 72% in both frequency bands while the subjects were at rest to a maximum of 83% in the alpha band during the verbal cognitive condition. Underlying cortical source distributions showed significant differences between the two groups in both frequency bands and in all cognitive conditions. Lateralized cortical differences were evident between the two groups in the both frequency bands during both the verbal and spatial cognitive conditions. During these active cognitive conditions, the CFS group showed significantly greater source-current activity than the controls in the left frontal-temporal-parietal regions of the cortex.

Our goal was to investigate further the clinical and EEG features of hypomotor seizures. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 110 hypomotor seizures from 34 patients recorded with video-EEG. Results: Twenty-seven (79%) patients were younger than 48 months, and seven (21%) were aged 4 to 15 years. Seventy-one (64%) seizures had regional or lateralized EEG onset, arising predominantly from temporal or parietal lobe regions. The other 39 (35%) seizures had generalized onset, usually with abrupt onset of diffuse rhythmic high-amplitude theta activity or diffuse electrodecrement and only rarely (two patients) with slow spike-wave complexes or 3-Hz spike-wave complexes. Hypomotor seizures with generalized EEG onset were significantly shorter than those with regional or lateralized onset (p = 0.01, GEE model). Unsustained head or eye movements and subtle mouth automatisms were commonly seen in hypomotor seizures with either focal or generalized onset. Seventeen percent of hypomotor seizures with focal onset evolved to include version of head and eyes or jerking of one arm, whereas 2% of generalized hypomotor seizures evolved to a cluster of spasms. Conclusions: Hypomotor seizures may be either focal or generalized. Regional EEG onsets were most often temporal or parietal, suggesting that focal hypomotor seizures may be a bland form of "complex partial" seizures with no or minimal automatisms, seen predominantly in infants. Generalized hypomotor seizures were rarely associated with an ictal pattern of generalized spike-wave complexes, suggesting a different mechanism from absence seizures seen later in life.

We studied the electro-clinical features of FSSs recorded in 28 patients. Methods: Using long-term surface video-EEG recordings, we examined 28 patients (from a consecutive series of 64) with stereotyped FSSs and complex partial seizures (CPS) preceded in at least one instance by identical subjective manifestations (overall 255 FSSs and 39 CPS were recorded). FSSs were subdivided according to the type of sensation into somatosensory visual or oculosensory, viscerosensory, experiential, cephalic and diffuse warm sensations. The EEG discharges accompanying FSSs were examined by two of the authors either blinded as to the type and timing of the seizure, or unblinded, i.e. after receiving complete clinical information including timing of the patient's warning. Results: The ictal pattern accompanying FSSs was identified blind in 13 patients and unblind in 8 patients. In seven patients, the ictal discharge remained undetected. In the cases with recognizable ictal abnormalities, two main patterns could be distinguished, static and dynamic. FSSs whose ictal discharge could be recognized by blind EEG examination more frequently consisted of somatosensory and visual or oculosensory manifestations, and the discharge generally involved the centro-parieto-occipital regions. The ictal discharge of viscerosensory and experiential FSSs more easily remained undetected; when identified, it generally involved the fronto-temporal regions. Conclusions: FSSs are often accompanied by ictal abnormalities recognizable on surf ace EEG. A thorough knowledge of their EEG accompaniments may be a useful diagnostic aid in patients with partial epilepsy. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of BEA Trading Ltd.

The goals of BCI system should be a small size, rugged, lightweight, and have low power consumption to meet the requirements of wearability, portability, and durability. This study proposes and implements a moving-windowed Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on a battery-powered, miniature, embedded BCI. This study also tests the embedded BCI on simulated and real EEG signals. Experimental results indicated that the efficacy of the online ICA decornposition is comparable with that of the offline version of the same algorithm, suggesting the feasibility of ICA for online analysis of EEG in a BCI. To demonstrate the feasibility of the wearable embedded BCI, this study also implements an online spectral analysis to the resultant component activations to continuously estimate subject's task performance in near real time.

Assessment of a scalp EEG-based automated seizure detection system	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Scalp EEG seizure detection; Independent seizure review; Bootstrap re-sampling; Pattern-match regularity statistic (PMRS); Artifact rejection; Spatiotemporal dynamics	EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; CLASSIFICATION; AGREEMENT	Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate and validate an offline, automated scalp EEG-based seizure detection system and to compare its performance to commercially available seizure detection software. Methods: The test seizure detection system, IdentEvent (TM), was developed to enhance the efficiency of post-hoc long-term EEG review in epilepsy monitoring units. It translates multi-channel scalp EEG signals into multiple EEG descriptors and recognizes ictal EEG patterns. Detection criteria and thresholds were optimized in 47 long-term scalp EEG recordings selected for training (47 subjects, similar to 3653 h with 141 seizures). The detection performance of IdentEvent was evaluated using a separate test dataset consisting of 436 EEG segments obtained from 55 subjects (similar to 1200 h with 146 seizures). Each of the test EEG segments was reviewed by three independent epileptologists and the presence or absence of seizures in each epoch was determined by majority rule. Seizure detection sensitivity and false detection rate were calculated for IdentEvent as well as for the comparable detection software (Persyst's Reveal (R), version 2008.03.13, with three parameter settings). Bootstrap re-sampling was applied to establish the 95% confidence intervals of the estimates and for the performance comparison between two detection algorithms. Results: The overall detection sensitivity of IdentEvent was 79.5% with a false detection rate (FDR) of 2 per 24 h, whereas the comparison system had 80.8%, 76%, and 74% sensitivity using its three detection thresholds (perception score) with FDRs of 13, 8, and 6 per 24 h, respectively. Bootstrap 95% confidence intervals of the performance difference revealed that the two detection systems had comparable detection sensitivity, but IdentEvent generated a significantly (p < 0.05) smaller FDR. Conclusions: The study validates the performance of the IdentEvent (TM) seizure detection system. Significance: With comparable detection sensitivity, an improved false detection rate makes the automated seizure detection software more useful in clinical practice.

J	Coyle, D				Coyle, Damien			Neural Network Based Auto Association and Time-Series Prediction for Biosignal Processing in Brain-Computer Interfaces	IEEE COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE MAGAZINE			English	Article							FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION	Neural networks (NNs) can be deployed in many different ways in signal processing applications. This paper illustrates how neural networks are employed in a prediction based preprocessing framework, referred to as neural-time-series-prediction-preprocessing (NTSPP), in an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). NTSPP has been shown to increase feature separability by mapping the original EEG signals via time-series-prediction to a higher dimensional space. Preliminary results of a similar novel framework are also presented where, instead of using predictive NNs, auto-associative NNs are employed and features are extracted from the output of auto-associative NNs trained to specialize on EEG signals for particular brain states. The results show that this preprocessing framework referred to as auto-associative NN preprocessing (ANNP) also has the potential to improve the performance of BCIs. Both the NTSPP and ANNP are compared with and deployed in conjunction with the well know common spatial patterns (CSP) to produce a BCI system which significantly outperforms either approach operating independently and has the potential to produce good performances even with a lower number of EEG channels compared to a multichannel BCI. Multichannel BCIs normally perform better that 2-3 channel BCIs however reducing the number of EEG channels required can positively impact on the time needed to mount electrodes and minimize the obtrusiveness of the electrode montage for the user. It is also shown that NTSPP can improve the potential for employing existing BCI methods with minimal subject-specific parameter tuning to deploy the BCI autonomously. Results are presented with six different classification approaches including various statistical classifiers such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machines ( SVM) and a Bayes classifier.

Four motor imagery tasks (left hand movement, right hand movement, feet movement, and tongue movement) were investigated for each EEG recording session. Ten subjects volunteered to participate in this study. As we known, fractal geometry is a mathematical tool for dealing with complex systems like EEG signal. Therefore, we used the fractal dimension (FD) as feature for the application of brain-machine interface (BMI). Effective algorithm, namely, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) has been selected to estimate embedded FD values between relaxing and imaging states of the recorded EEG signal. To show the pattern of FDs, we propose a windowing-based method or also called time-dependent fractal dimension (TDFD) and the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence. The K -L divergence and different expected values are employed as the input parameters of classifier. Finally, featured data are classified by a three-layer feed-forward neural network based on a simple backpropagation algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method is more effective than the conventional methods.

J	Felzer, T; Freisleben, B				Felzer, T; Freisleben, B			Analyzing EEG signals using the probability estimating guarded neural classifier	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface (BCI); counterpropagation electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis; human-computer interaction	PATTERN-RECOGNITION; NETWORK	This paper introduces a neural network architecture for classifying feature vectors symbolizing portions (or segments) of an electroencephalogram (EEG) trace of a human subject. This classification task is the one that is typically required when developing a so-called brain-computer interface (BCI), which analyzes the EEG signals of a subject in order to "understand" the subject's thoughts. However, instead of merely saying which "category of thoughts" (i.e., which class) the respective input feature vector belongs to, the network described here estimates the probabilities of an EEG segment being associated with each individual class. The network, which is called PeGNC (for probability estimating guarded neural classifier), is tested with two kinds of experiments. In the first experiment, the a-rhythm associated with a human subject closing the eyes is detected online with the help of a frequency-based representation. Since the EEG signal is, in general, always a mixture of numerous action, potentials generated simultaneously and it is, thus, very likely that mental activities result in overlapping classes, it is reasonable to believe that the PeGNC network-which does not select any one single class, but determines probability values for each mental category-is particularly suitable for this kind of EEG analysis. The second experiment deals with this issue on the basis of an offline analysis of simulated data.

N.; Mueller, Klaus-Robert			Towards adaptive classification for BCI	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; BOOSTING BIT RATES; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; COMPETITION 2003; MOTOR IMAGERY; EEG; COMMUNICATION	Non-stationarities are ubiquitous in EEG signals. They are especially apparent in the use of EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs): (a) in the differences between the initial calibration measurement and the online operation of a BCI, or (b) caused by changes in the subject's brain processes during an experiment (e.g. due to fatigue, change of task involvement, etc). In this paper, we quantify for the first time such systematic evidence of statistical differences in data recorded during offline and online sessions. Furthermore, we propose novel techniques of investigating and visualizing data distributions, which are particularly useful for the analysis of (non-) stationarities. Our study shows that the brain signals used for control can change substantially from the offline calibration sessions to online control, and also within a single session. In addition to this general characterization of the signals, we propose several adaptive classification schemes and study their performance on data recorded during online experiments. An encouraging result of our study is that surprisingly simple adaptive methods in combination with an offline feature selection scheme can significantly increase BCI performance.

This paper reports on novel developments in interval T2FLS (IT2FLS) classifier design methodology so that system non-stationarities can be effectively handled. In general, the approach presented here rests on a general concept of two-stage FLS design in which an initial rule base structure is first initialized and then system parameters are globally optimized. The proposed incremental enhancements of existing fuzzy techniques, adopted from the area of conventional type-1 (T1) FL, are heuristic in nature. The IT2FLS design methods have been empirically verified in this work in the realm of pattern recognition. In particular, the potential and the suitability of IT2FLS to the problem of classification of motor imagery (M1) related patterns in electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings has been investigated. The outcome of this study bears direct relevance to the development of EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) since the problem under examination poses a major difficulty for the state-of-the-art BCI methods. The IT2FLS classifier is evaluated in this work on multi-session EEG data sets in the framework of an off-fine BCI. Its performance is quantified in terms of the classification accuracy (CA) rates and has been found to be favorable to that of analogous systems employing a conventional T1FLS, along with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM), commonly utilized in MI-based BCI systems.

Several transformational techniques have been used for this purpose: Principal Component Analysis, the Adaptive Autoregressive Model, FFT or Wavelet Transforms, etc. However, it would be useful to automatically build significant attributes appropriate for each particular problem. In this paper, we use Genetic Programming to evolve projections that translate EEG data into a new vectorial space (coordinates of this space being the new attributes), where projected data can be more easily classified. Although our method is applied here in a straightforward way to check for feasibility, it has achieved reasonable classification results that are comparable to those obtained by other state of the art algorithms. In the future, we expect that by choosing carefully primitive functions, Genetic Programming will be able to give original results that cannot be matched by other machine learning classification algorithms.

J	Krauledat, M; Tangermann, M; Blankertz, B; Muller, KR				Krauledat, Matthias; Tangermann, Michael; Blankertz, Benjamin; Mueller, Klaus-Robert			Towards Zero Training for Brain-Computer Interfacing	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are highly subject-specific and vary considerably even between recording sessions of the same user within the same experimental paradigm. This challenges a stable operation of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems. The classical approach is to train users by neurofeedback to produce fixed stereotypical patterns of brain activity. In the machine learning approach, a widely adapted method for dealing with those variances is to record a so called calibration measurement on the beginning of each session in order to optimize spatial filters and classifiers specifically for each subject and each day. This adaptation of the system to the individual brain signature of each user relieves from the need of extensive user training. In this paper we suggest a new method that overcomes the requirement of these time-consuming calibration recordings for long-term BCI users. The method takes advantage of knowledge collected in previous sessions: By a novel technique, prototypical spatial filters are determined which have better generalization properties compared to single-session filters. In particular, they can be used in follow-up sessions without the need to recalibrate the system. This way the calibration periods can be dramatically shortened or even completely omitted for these 'experienced' BCI users. The feasibility of our novel approach is demonstrated with a series of online BCI experiments. Although performed without any calibration measurement at all, no loss of classification performance was observed.

First, a large collection of candidate features, mostly consisting of various statistical quantities, are calculated from the subject's EEG. This large set of candidate features is then reduced into a much smaller set of most relevant features using a feature selection procedure. The selected features are then used to evaluate the class likelihoods, through the use of a mixture of factor analysis (MFA) statistical model [7]. In a training set of 207 subjects, including 64 subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD), 40 subjects with chronic schizophrenia, 12 subjects with bipolar depression and 91 normal or healthy subjects, the average correct diagnosis rate attained using the proposed method is over 85%, as determined by various cross-validation experiments.

Asynchronous BCI offers more natural human-machine interaction, but it is a great challenge to train and adapt an asynchronous BCI online because the user's control intention and timing are usually unknown. This paper proposes a novel motor imagery based asynchronous BCI for controlling a simulated robot in a specifically designed environment which is able to provide user's control intention and timing during online experiments, so that online training and adaptation of motor imagery based asynchronous BCI can be effectively investigated. This paper also proposes an online training method, attempting to automate the process of finding the optimal parameter values of the BCI system to deal with non-stationary EEG signals. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method for online training of asynchronous BCI significantly improves the performance.

Adaptation of Hybrid Human-Computer Interaction Systems Using EEG Error-Related Potentials	2010 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC 10)	AUG 30-SEP 04, 2010	Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)				Performance improvement in both humans and artificial systems strongly relies in the ability of recognizing erroneous behavior or decisions. This paper, that builds upon previous studies on EEG error-related signals, presents a hybrid approach for human computer interaction that uses human gestures to send commands to a computer and exploits brain activity to provide implicit feedback about the recognition of such commands. Using a simple computer game as a case study, we show that EEG activity evoked by erroneous gesture recognition can be classified in single trials above random levels. Automatic artifact rejection techniques are used, taking into account that subjects are allowed to move during the experiment. Moreover, we present a simple adaptation mechanism that uses the EEG signal to label newly acquired samples and can be used to re-calibrate the gesture recognition system in a supervised manner. Offline analysis show that, although the achieved EEG decoding accuracy is far from being perfect, these signals convey sufficient information to significantly improve the overall system performance.

Using the machine learning method for this classification is effective, but constructing feature vectors with all data points might result in very high-dimensional data. Because such redundant features are undesirable from the viewpoint of computation and classification performance, EEG has been downsampled in several studies. In the present study, we propose a new downsampling method aiming at the improvement of P300 classification accuracy. In particular, each single trial EEG is segmented at non-uniform intervals and then averaged in each segment. The segmentation is decided in such a way that the degree of separating two classes from training data is increased by applying a time series segmentation algorithm. Our experiment using the BCI Competition III P300 Speller paradigm data set demonstrated that our method resulted in higher accuracy than traditional downsampling methods.

Our observations led us to consider a conceptual synthesis between PLEDs and periodic complexes (PCs). Methods: Retrospective review of acute neuroimaging results (CT/MRI) on patients identified to have EEG PLEDs, for the period 1999-2003 (n = 106). Blinded classification of original EEG recordings. Results: Neuroimaging abnormalities were classified as acute or chronic cortical, or acute or chronic subcortical. Seven out of 106 scans were classified nonlesional. Overall similar to 70% of scans had cortical abnormalities, whether acute or chronic; similar to 23% had subcortical abnormalities. "Cortical" PLEDs were significantly longer in duration (p < 0.05) and more variable in morphology (p < 0.01) than "subcortical" PLEDs. Conclusions: Structural brain disease commonly, but not invariably, underlies PLEDs; lesion type is spatiotemporally variable. Cortical and subcortical PLEDs have distinct EEG signatures. There is evidence that these may relate to mechanisms for other pathological large-scale oscillatory brain synchronies (e.g., PCs).

The classifiers are to be embedded in a portable brain-computer interface called ABI, We evaluate different kinds of classifiers, from statistical approaches to neural networks, with 8 healthy persons, Subjects' performance is analyzed off-line and, for three of them, also on-line in the presence of biofeedback. The proposed ABI robustly recognizes three mental tasks from on-line spontaneous EEG signals. Correct recognition is around 70%, This modest rate is largely compensated by two properties of ABI: wrong responses are below 5% and it makes decisions every 1/2 second. Also, since the subject end his/her personal ABI learn simultaneously from each other, subjects master it rapidly: one of the subjects achieved excellent control in just 5 days of training. Analysis of learned EEG patterns confirms that for a subject to operate satisfactorily an ABI, the latter must fit the individual features of the former, Building individual interfaces greatly increases the likelihood of success, as demonstrated for all subjects we have worked with despite the short training time of most of them.

One is based on the EMG signal and the other is based on the EEG signal. Two major features of such interfaces are their relatively simple data acquisition and processing systems, which need just a few hardware and software resources, so that they are, computationally and financially speaking, low cost solutions. Both interfaces were applied to robotic systems, and their performances are analyzed here. The EMG-based HMI was tested in a mobile robot, while the EEG-based HMI was tested in a mobile robot and a robotic manipulator as well. Results: Experiments using the EMG-based HMI were carried out by eight individuals, who were asked to accomplish ten eye blinks with each eye, in order to test the eye blink detection algorithm. An average rightness rate of about 95% reached by individuals with the ability to blink both eyes allowed to conclude that the system could be used to command devices. Experiments with EEG consisted of inviting 25 people ( some of them had suffered cases of meningitis and epilepsy) to test the system. All of them managed to deal with the HMI in only one training session. Most of them learnt how to use such HMI in less than 15 minutes. The minimum and maximum training times observed were 3 and 50 minutes, respectively. Conclusion: Such works are the initial parts of a system to help people with neuromotor diseases, including those with severe dysfunctions. The next steps are to convert a commercial wheelchair in an autonomous mobile vehicle; to implement the HMI onboard the autonomous wheelchair thus obtained to assist people with motor diseases, and to explore the potentiality of EEG signals, making the EEG-based HMI more robust and faster, aiming at using it to help individuals with severe motor dysfunctions.

In order to obtain their objective, BCI devices make use of classifiers which translate inputs from the users brain signals into commands for external devices. This paper describes an adaptive bi-stage classifier. The first stage is based on Radial Basis Function neural networks, which provides sequences of pre-assignations to the second stage, that it is based on three different Hidden Markov Models, each one trained with pre-assignation sequences from the cognitive activities between classifying. The segment of EEG signal is assigned to the HMM with the highest probability of generating the pre-assignation sequence. The algorithm is tested with real samples of electroencephalografic signal, from five healthy volunteers using the cross-validation method. The results allow to conclude that it is possible to implement this algorithm in an on-line BCI device. The results also shown the huge dependency of the percentage of the correct classification from the user and the setup parameters of the classifier.

During single-hand movements, three kinds of task, grasping, releasing, and holding were considered. The tasks considered during two-hand movements are left and right grasping, left and right releasing, and holding. The subject performs the tasks spontaneously without waiting for and responding to any external cues. In addition, a neural adaptive noise canceller is developed that accomplishes eye blinks suppression. The neural adaptive filter is here implemented by means of a three-layer feed-forward neural network. The feature vectors are formed from the three channels (Fz, C3, and 173). We employ the multilayer perceptron (MLP) with back-propagation learning algorithm and Radial Basis Function (RBF) network with stochastic gradient learning rule for discriminating different patterns of the EEG signals. In the classical approach to RBF and MLP network implementation, the number of hidden units is predetermined. It, usually, results in too many hidden units. To overcome this drawback, we develop an enhanced resource-allocating network (RAN) for discriminating the EEG patterns. These networks start with no hidden units and grow by allocating new hidden units based on the novelty in the EEG signals, which arrive sequentially. The results of this analysis show that the neural networks would be able to detect the movements of a single hand and two hands with an average classification accuracy of 98.82% and 96.40%, respectively. Moreover, the RAN provides a reduction in the training epochs as compared to the MLP and RBF networks. This work represents a promising approach to control prosthesis device.

In most nonlinear systems inputs are unknown and measurements of the dynamic properties of the system are sought from the measured output. The neural networks in the brain, evaluated during sleep, constitute one such dynamic system. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is the principle output time series that is used to characterize one feature of the underlying dynamics of the neural system recorded from sleep. The EEG patterns are the result of extracellular electrical current flow generated in the brain, which underlies the recording electrode. The EEG is the primary tool used in the qualification and classification of sleep. The aim of this study was to develop a set of tests that examine the nature of a time series, such as the EEG, to establish the presence of nonlinear dynamics. There is no single test that unambiguously identifies nonlinear dynamics in a time series but there are a number of tests that taken together are a powerful predictor of deterministic chaos. A singular stage 2 EEG sleep epoch is put through the full set of tests to 1) describe the test applications to "real data" and to introduce some of the tools of deterministic chaos theory; 2) identify nonlinear dynamics in sleep EEG that warrant further investigation using a nonlinear system model. The theory of each test is described and its proper application is exemplified using the sleep EEG data. The consequences of nonlinear test applications and their inappropriate use are discussed. These formal descriptions indicate the presence of deterministic chaos in EEG time series recorded during sleep and suggest that the tools for deterministic chaos are appropriate for system characterization of sleep EEG.

In this paper, we present our effort in developing a new approach to the quantification of movement patterns in patients during epileptic seizures. We attach markers at landmark points of a patient's body and use a camera and a commercial video-electroencephalogram (EEG) system to synchronously register EEG and video during seizures. Then, we apply image-processing techniques to analyze the video frames and extract the trajectories of those points that represent the course of the quantified movement of different body parts. This information may help clinicians in seizure classification. We describe the framework of our system and a method of analyzing video in order to achieve the proposed goal. Our experimental results show that our method can reflect quantified motion patterns of epileptic seizures, which cannot be accessed by means of traditional visual inspection of video recordings. We were able, for the first time, to quantify the movement of different parts of a convulsive human body in the course of an epileptic seizure. This result represents an enhanced value to clinicians in studying seizures for reaching a diagnosis.

Using a previously introduced classification procedure, transient patterns of cortical activity suitable to discriminate between the rising and the falling modulation were identified. Early (locked to stimulus onset) and late (emerging at variable times poststimulus) patterns could be differentiated. Deletion of increasing numbers of randomly selected electrodes was used to determine a critical density of recording channels required to capture the discriminative power of the early and late patterns. Statistical analysis of the classification revealed a sigmoid dependence of the discriminative power from the number of remaining electrodes with an inflection point at 12 electrodes. The analysis of the minima of the classification statistic revealed that in the early patterns discriminative information was focal on regions corresponding to the tonotopic representation of the stimuli, whereas in late patterns this information seemed to be distributed nonfocally across larger cortical regions. This analysis supports the previous notion of the coexistence of topographically organized activity states related to the physical stimulus features and nontopographically organized states determined largely by intrinsic factors (Ohl et al. 2001).

A user-friendly SSVEP-based brain-computer interface using a time-domain classifier	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							COMMUNICATION	We introduce a user-friendly steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system. Single-channel EEG is recorded using a low-noise dry electrode. Compared to traditional gel-based multi-sensor EEG systems, a dry sensor proves to be more convenient, comfortable and cost effective. A hardware system was built that displays four LED light panels flashing at different frequencies and synchronizes with EEG acquisition. The visual stimuli have been carefully designed such that potential risk to photosensitive people is minimized. We describe a novel stimulus-locked inter-trace correlation (SLIC) method for SSVEP classification using EEG time-locked to stimulus onsets. We studied how the performance of the algorithm is affected by different selection of parameters. Using the SLIC method, the average light detection rate is 75.8% with very low error rates (an 8.4% false positive rate and a 1.3% misclassification rate). Compared to a traditional frequency-domain-based method, the SLIC method is more robust (resulting in less annoyance to the users) and is also suitable for irregular stimulus patterns.

The key problems in BCI research are feature extraction and classification. In this paper, two experiments were performed, and the EEG data were recording. during each experiment. One experiment contains five mental tasks, including "baseline", "rotation", "multiplication", "counting" and "letter-composing", the other contains two mental tasks which are left hand imagery movement and right hand imagery movement. EEG data recorded from both experiments are analyzed by approximate entropy (Apen), which is used to extract the characteristic feature of different mental tasks. A three-layer BP Neural Network classifier was structured for pattern classification. Different results were gained from the mental task experiment and imagery movement experiment. The results show that Apen is an effective method to extract the feature of different brain states.

In this context, one of the most effective approaches for optimal feature extraction is subclass discriminant analysis. However, in this approach, the major problem is to determine the optimal number of subclasses in each class. This paper presents a novel approach for efficient feature extraction via subclass discriminant analysis using dynamic cluster formation (DSDA). The main component of this paper is to design a method to automatically discover the optimal set of subclasses in each class. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by using the classification of EEG signals. The tasks to be discriminated are the imaginative hand movement and the resting state. The results demonstrate that the proposed method performed well in several experiments on different subjects and can improve the classification accuracy in the BCI systems.

Uncontrolled epilepsy poses a significant burden to society due to associated healthcare cost to treat and control the unpredictable and spontaneous occurrence of seizures. The objective of this study is to develop and present a novel classification technique that is used to classify normal and abnormal (epileptic) brain activities through quantitative analyses of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Such technique is based on the integration of sophisticated approaches from data mining and signal processing research (i.e., chaos theory, k-nearest neighbor, and statistical time series analysis). The proposed technique can correctly classify normal and abnormal EEGs with a sensitivity of 81.29% and a specificity of 72.86%, on average, across ten patients. Experimental results suggest that the proposed technique can be used to develop abnormal brain activity classification for detecting seizure precursors. Success of this study demonstrates that the proposed technique can excavate hidden patterns/relationships in EEGs and give greater understanding of brain functions from a system perspective, which will advance current diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy.

A major challenge when dealing with the intra-cortical recordings is to develop decoders that are robust in time. In this paper we present for the first time a technique that uses the qualitative information derived from multiple LFP channels rather than the absolute power of the recorded signals. In this novel method, we use a power based inter-channel ranking system to define the quality of a channel in multi-channel LFP. This representation enables us to bypass the problems associated with the dynamic ranges of absolute power. We also introduce a parameter based ranking system that provides the same rank to channels that have comparable powers. We show that using our algorithms, we can develop models that provide stable decoding of eight movement directions with an average efficiency of above 56% over a period of two weeks. Moreover, the decoding power using this method is 46% at the end of two weeks versus the 13% using the traditional approaches. We also applied these models to decoding movements performed in a force field and again achieved significantly higher decoding power than the existing methods.

The developed ANFIS model combined the neural network adaptive capabilities and the fuzzy logic qualitative approach. This study comprises of three stages. In the first stage, three types of EEG signals (alert signal, drowsy signal and sleep signal) were obtained from 30 healthy subjects. In the second stage, for feature extraction, obtained EEG signals were separated to its sub-bands using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Then, entropy of each sub-band was calculated using Shannon entropy algorithm. In the third stage, the ANFIS was trained with the back-propagation gradient descent method in combination with least squares method. The extracted features of three types of EEG signals were used as input patterns of the three ANFIS classifiers. In order to improve estimation accuracy, the fourth ANFIS classifier (combining ANFIS) was trained using the outputs of the three ANFIS classifiers as input data. The performance of the ANFIS model was tested using the EEG data obtained from 12 healthy subjects that have not been used for the training. The results confirmed that the developed ANFIS classifier has potential for estimation of vigilance level by using EEG signals. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Noninvasive BCI techniques based on neuroimaging modalities are reviewed in terms of their methodological approaches as well as their similarities and differences. Trends in automated data interpretation through machine learning algorithms are also introduced. Applications of functional neuromodulation techniques to BCI systems would allow for bidirectional communication between the brain and the computer. Such bidirectional interfaces can relay information directly from one brain to another using a computer as a medium, ultimately leading to the concept of a brain-to-brain interface (BM).

The EEG has therefore been included in the World Health Organisation diagnostic classification criteria of CID. In sporadic CID (sCJD), the EEG exhibits characteristic changes depending on the stage of the disease, ranging from nonspecific findings such as diffuse slowing and frontal rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) in early stages to disease-typical periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWC) in middle and late stages to areactive coma traces or even alpha coma in preterminal EEG recordings. PSWC, either lateralized (in earlier stages) or generalized, occur in about two-thirds of patients with sCJD, with a positive predictive value of 95%. PSWC occur in patients with methionine homozygosity and methionine/valine heterozygosity but only rarely in patients with valine homozygosity at codon 129 of the prion protein gene. PSWC tend to disappear during sleep and may be attenuated by sedative medication and external stimulation. Seizures are an uncommon finding, occurring in less than 15% of patients with sCJD. In patients with iatrogenic CJD, PSWC usually present with more regional EEG findings corresponding to the site of inoculation of the transmissible agent. In genetic CJD, PSWC in its typical form are uncommon, occurring in about 10%. No PSWC occur in EEG recordings of patients with variant CID.

Methods: EEG signals were acquired from 9 healthy volunteers during imagination of four tasks of the right wrist that involved two speeds (fast and slow) and two types of movement (wrist extension and rotation), each repeated 60 times in random order. Average movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) were compared among the four tasks. Moreover, single-trial classification was performed using the rebound rate of MRCP and the power in the mu and beta bands as features. Results: The rebound rate of the average MRCPs was greater for faster than for slower movements but did not depend on the type of movement. Accordingly, pairs of tasks executed at different speeds led to lower misclassification rate than pairs of tasks executed at the same speed. The average misclassification rate between task pairs was 21 +/- 2% for the best channel and task pair. Conclusion: The task parameter speed can be discriminated in single-trial EEG traces with greater accuracy than the type of movement when tasks are executed at the same joint. Significance: The speed of movement execution may be included among the variables that characterize imagined tasks for brain-computer interface applications.

Methods: We reviewed the video and EEG files of all infantile seizures recorded at Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL, from 2000 to 2005. Electrographic and clinical features were entered into separate databases. The electrographic component of the database analyzed the predominant location and pattern at onset, the evolution, the termination and the duration of each seizure. The clinical data sheet included 25 items. Each seizure was assigned to a specific category according to its most prominent clinical feature, according to the opinion of both observers. Results: Thirteen seizure types were identified. In a significant number of cases, the EEG correlate could not be predicted on the basis of clinical observations only. Generalized seizures were observed, on average, at a later age than focal seizures. Excluding spasms, the mean duration of seizures was short (36 s). Conclusions: The results of this study are useful in describing the clinical and electrographic repertoire of infantile seizures. The findings show that video-EEG recordings in infants with frequent, recur-rent seizures are useful by fully allowing complete recognition of subtle events, and in fully categorizing the true nature of the ictus. Video-EEG findings and accurate seizure classification may add fundamental information with regards to epilepsy syndrome diagnosis and specific treatment options, including surgery.

DISCRIMINATIVE CHANNEL SELECTION METHOD FOR THE RECOGNITION OF ANTICIPATION RELATED POTENTIALS FROM CCD ESTIMATED CORTICAL ACTIVITY	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON MACHINE LEARNING FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING	IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP 2009)	SEP 01-04, 2009	Grenoble, FRANCE	IEEE			HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; BRAIN	Recognition of brain states and subject's intention from electroencephalogram (EEG) is a challenging problem for brain-computer interaction. Signals recorded from each of EEG electrodes represent noisy spatio-temporal overlapping of activity arising from very diverse brain regions. However, un-mixing methods such as Cortical Current Density (CCD) can be used for estimating activity of different brain regions. These methods not only improve spatial resolution but also signal to noise ratio, hence the classifiers computed using this activity may ameliorate recognition performances. However, these methods lead to a multiplied number of channels, leading to the question - "How to choose relevant and discriminant channels from a large number of channels?". In the current paper we present a channel selection method and discuss its application to the recognition of anticipation related potentials from surface EEG channels and CCD estimated cortical potentials. We compare the classification accuracies with previously reported performances obtained using Cz electrode potentials of 9 subjects (3 experienced + 6 naive). As hypothesized, we observed improvements for most subjects with channel selection method applied to CCD activity as compared to surface-EEG channels and baseline performances. This improvement is particularly significant for subjects who are naive and did not show a clear pattern on ERP grand averages.

A single parameter can not fully describe it. In this paper, power spectral indices of HRV and wavelet packet parameters of EEG are firstly combined to analyze the impacts of long time switch task on autonomic nervous system and central nervous system. Then wavelet packet parameters of EEG are extracted as the features of brain activity in different cognitive fatigue state, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and support vector machine (SVM) are jointly applied to differentiate two states. The experimental results show that the predominant activity of autonomic nervous system of subjects turns to the sympathetic activity from parasympathetic activity after the task. The wavelet packet parameters of EEG are strongly related with cognitive fatigue. Moreover, the joint KPCA-SVM method is able to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors, speed up the convergence in the training of SVM and achieve higher recognition accuracy (90.04%) of cognitive fatigue state. The KPCA-SVM method could be a promising tool for the evaluation of cognitive fatigue. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to analyze the role of ictal HR changes in localizing both mesial and lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in a group of 68 patients. The influence of the gender and the side of epilepsy on HR modulation was also evaluated. Methods: Ictal HR was recorded during prolonged Video-EEG monitoring performed in 68 patients affected by drug-resistant TLE during a non-invasive pre-surgical protocol. According to the electro-clinical correlation, obtained by video-EEG monitoring, one hundred-thirteen seizures (n = 113) and one hundred-forty-four auras (n = 144) were identified and included in the study. Furthermore, the electro-clinical correlation allowed the classification of all the epileptic events (seizures and auras) as having mesial or lateral origin, based on the temporal lobe seizure onset zone. Ictal HR was calculated with respect to the R-R waves, and assessed from 15 see (s) before (T-15) to 15 s after (T+15) the time of EEG seizure onset (T-0). Results: We observed a high incidence (92%) of ictal HR increase in TLE seizures. When the ictal EEG indicated a seizure onset from the mesial temporal structures, the onset of ictal HR increase preceded by about 5 s the EEG ictal onset (SD +/- 18.4), whereas the onset of HR increase coincided with the onset of EEG discharges (SD +/- 14.8) when the ictal EEG indicated the onset of seizures from the lateral temporal structures. No significant differences were found between male and female patients; and between right and left TLE. Conclusions: Our findings show that ictal HR increase, preceding the onset of the EEG discharge, is associated with ictal EEG seizure pattern defining temporal lobe seizures originating from the mesial temporal lobe structures; this association suggests that the HR changes may be coupled to the functional impairment of neural circuits involved in sympathetic cardiovascular regulation, in the mesial temporal lobe structures. Further studies investigating the relationship between intracranial EEG monitoring and ECG recording are worthwhile, to confirm our results and to give further indications on the pathogenesis of ictal HR abnormalities.

This is achieved by a collaborative adaptive signal processing approach based on a hybrid filter. By tracking the dynamics of the adaptive mixing parameter within the employed hybrid filtering architecture, we show that it is possible to quantify the degree of nonlinearity within both real- and complex-valued data. Implementations for tracking nonlinearity in general and then more specifically sparsity are illustrated on both benchmark and real world data. It is also shown that by combining the information obtained from hybrid filters of different natures it is possible to use this method to gain a more complete understanding of the nature of the nonlinearity within a signal. This also paves the way for building multidimensional feature spaces and their application in data/information fusion.

Visual spatial attention has been expected to provide a new channel of non-invasive independent brain computer interface (130), but little work has been done on the new interfacing method. The flickering stimuli used in previous work cause a decline of independency and have difficulties in a practical use. Therefore we investigated whether visual spatial attention could be detected without such stimuli. Further, the common spatial patterns (CSP) were for the first time applied to the brain states during visual spatial attention. The performance evaluation was based on three brain states of left, right and center direction attention. The 30-channel scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) signals over occipital cortex were recorded for five subjects. Without CSP, the analyses made 66.44 (range 55.42 to 72.27) % of average classification performance in discriminating left and right attention classes. With CSP, the averaged classification accuracy was 75.39 (range 63.75 to 86.13) %. It is suggested that CSP is useful in the context of visual spatial attention, and the alpha band modulation during visual spatial attention without flickering stimuli has the possibility of a new channel for independent BCI as well as motor imagery.

Methods: In this report, we will describe the case of a 54-year-old female patient with a depressive syndrome who first experienced very rapid atypical panic attacks with dizziness, trance-like and distorted optical perception, but without clear epileptic symptoms. Results: Several EEG recordings showed temporal sharp-waves and spike-wave patterns. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a hypodense area near left mesial temporal structures. Brain imaging with SPECT showed a hyperfusion of the basal temporal cortical structures on the left side. Treatment with antidepressants had no effect, but the addition of valproic acid led to an attenuation of the panic attacks and epileptic potentials on the EEG. Discussion: A clinical trial using anti-epileptics could be successful in patients not responding to antidepressants or in the presence of epileptiform EEG activity. In this article, we will review the literature concerning the complex relationship between panic attacks and ictal activity of limbic structures and discuss the difficult diagnostic classification of atypical cases.

However, research has shown that classification techniques perform better if the EEG signal is previously preprocessed to provide high quality attributes to the classifier. Spatial and frequency-selection filters can be applied for this purpose. In this paper, we propose to automatically optimize these filters by means of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). The technique has been tested on data from the BCI-III competition, because both raw and manually filtered datasets were supplied, allowing to compare them. Results show that the CMA-ES is able to obtain higher accuracies than the datasets preprocessed by manually tuned filters.

In one study, we report that the mu rhythm is not only modulated by the expression of self-generated movement but also by the observation and imagination of movement. In another study, we show that simultaneous self-generated multiple limb movements exhibit properties distinct from those of single limb movements. Identification and classification of these signals with pattern recognition techniques provides the basis for the development of a practical BCI.

In this paper, we compared the performance of three different feature classifiers for the detection of the imagined movements in a group of 6 normal subjects by means the EEG. The feature classifiers compared were those based on the Hidden Markov Models (HMM), the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and on the Mahalanobis distance (MD).

Feature dimensionality reduction is essential to improve generalization and optimal exploitation of the information content in the feature vector. Dimensionality reduction eliminates redundant dimensions that do not convey reliable statistical information for classification, determines a manifold on which projections of the original high-dimensional feature vector exhibit maximal information about the class label, and reduces the complexity of the classifier to help avoid over-fitting. In this chapter we demonstrate computationally efficient algorithms for estimating and optimizing mutual information, specifically for the purpose of learning optimal feature dimensionality reduction solutions in the context of pattern recognition. These techniques and algorithms will be applied to the classification of multichannel EEG signals for brain computer interface design, as well as sonar imagery for target detection. Results will be compared with widely used benchmark alternatives such as LDA and kernel LDA.

Clinical and EEG findings have been described in the past for classic types, but several variants have recently been reported. The authors reviewed the clinical and EEG findings of 18 childhood onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses cases. In the late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses type, both typical and variant cases have been observed. In this type, the presence of a particular pseudoperiodic EEG pattern that we found in 15/18 patients and observed in the first stages of the disease could be useful in early diagnosis, especially if associated with the absence of sleep spindles. A precise nosological classification, based both on clinical and instrumental findings is the prerequisite for a correct genotype-phenotype correlation that could greatly improve our knowledge of this disease, providing a better understanding of pathogenesis and increasing our ability to treat it.

Electroencephalographic monitoring during hypothermia after pediatric cardiac arrest	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							NONCONVULSIVE STATUS EPILEPTICUS; HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; REFRACTORY STATUS EPILEPTICUS; NEONATAL SEIZURES; ELECTROGRAPHIC SEIZURES; CIRCULATORY ARREST; COMATOSE SURVIVORS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PROGNOSTIC VALUE	Background: Hypoxic ischemic brain injury secondary to pediatric cardiac arrest (CA) may result in acute symptomatic seizures. A high proportion of seizures may be nonconvulsive, so accurate diagnosis requires continuous EEG monitoring. We aimed to determine the safety and feasibility of long-term EEG monitoring, to describe electroencephalographic background and seizure characteristics, and to identify background features predictive of seizures in children undergoing therapeutic hypothermia (TH) after CA. Methods: Nineteen children underwent TH after CA. Continuous EEG monitoring was performed during hypothermia (24 hours), rewarming (12-24 hours), and then an additional 24 hours of normothermia. The tolerability of these prolonged studies and the EEG background classification and seizure characteristics were described in a standardized manner. Results: No complications of EEG monitoring were reported or observed. Electrographic seizures occurred in 47% (9/19), and 32% (6/19) developed status epilepticus. Seizures were nonconvulsive in 67% (6/9) and electrographically generalized in 78% (7/9). Seizures commenced during the late hypothermic or rewarming periods (8/9). Factors predictive of electrographic seizures were burst suppression or excessively discontinuous EEG background patterns, interictal epileptiform discharges, or an absence of the expected pharmacologically induced beta activity. Background features evolved over time. Patients with slowing and attenuation tended to improve, whereas those with burst suppression tended to worsen. Conclusions: EEG monitoring in children undergoing therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest is safe and feasible. Electrographic seizures and status epilepticus are common in this setting but are often not detectable by clinical observation alone. The EEG background often evolves over time, with milder abnormalities improving and more severe abnormalities worsening. Neurology (R) 2009; 72: 1931-1940	[Abend, N.

Depend on these main findings correlated with MS, we attempt to develop an EEG based classification system to automatically classify subject's MS level and find the suitable EEG features via common feature extraction, selection and classifiers technologies in this study. If we can find the regulations and then develop an algorithm to predict MS occurring, it would be a great benefit to construct a safe and comfortable environment for all drivers and passengers when they are cruising in the car, bus, ship or airplane. EEG is one of the best methods for monitoring the brain dynamics induced by motion-sickness because of its high temporal resolution and portability. After collecting the EEG signals and subjective MS level in a realistic driving environment, we first do the data pre-processing part including ICA, component clustering analysis and time-frequency analysis. Then we adopt three common feature extractions and two feature selections (FE/FS) technologies to extract or select the correlated features such as principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminate analysis (LDA), nonparametric weighted feature extraction (NWFE), forward feature selections (FFS) and backward feature selections (BFS) and feed the feature maps into three classifiers (Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Classifier (ML), k-Nearest-Neighbor Classifier (kNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)). Experimental results show that classification performance of all our proposed technologies can be reached almost over 95%. It means it is possible to apply the effective technology combination to predict the subject's MS level in the real life applications. The better combination in this study is using LDA and Gaussian based ML classifier. This advantage can be widely used in machine learning area for developing the prediction algorithms in the future.

Certain types of partial seizures can be difficult to differentiate from nonepileptic seizures because of their intense motor presentation and, at times, lack of alteration of consciousness. Based on a published semiologic seizure classification, this type of seizures can be described as "hyperkinetic," characterized by intense motor activity involving the extremities and trunk. We report five children diagnosed with hyperkinetic seizures by video-EEG monitoring. All patients were referred for video-EEG evaluation because of an initial suspicion of pseudoseizures. Presented in this study is a review of the patients' clinical data, including video-EEG evaluation. There were three boys and two girls; the mean age at presentation was 10 +/- 3 years. In four patients, there was a history of behavioral disorder, with two patients carrying a diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). One girl had significant developmental delay and an abnormal neurologic examination. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was normal in three patients and abnormal in two. The semiology of the seizures consisted of stereotypic intense motor activity, mainly upper extremity flailing and kicking. Screaming and shouting were noted in three cases, and intense fear was present in two patients. The hyperkinetic ictal activity progressed to tonic-clonic seizures in two patients. Seizures occurred out of sleep or on awakening in four patients. The interictal EEG activity was normal in one patient and revealed a continuous generalized slowing and slowing of the posterior dominant rhythm in two patients. One of the latter patients had interictal epileptiform activity in the frontal and midline regions. An intermittent rhythmic slow activity of the left hemisphere with superimposed bifrontal sharp waves was noted in the fifth patient. The ictal EEG revealed profuse superimposed electromyographic (EMG) activity in all patients, making some of the EEG interpretation difficult to analyze, particularly a longitudinal bipolar montage. However, with digital manipulation of the ictal EEG data, such as changes in EEG sensitivity, application of fast frequency filters, and use of different EEG montages, it was possible to discern an ictal EEG pattern or postictal slowing following the diffuse EMG artifact in all patients. On clinical follow-up, adequate seizure control was achieved in three patients. Based on the clinical history, one patient was diagnosed with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. Diagnosis of hyperkinetic seizures can be difficult because of the similarity of the clinical manifestations with nonepileptic events such as certain parasomnias and pseudoseizures. Video-EEG is the most effective way of diagnosing this type of seizure.

However, the effectiveness of these devices is limited due to their lack of situational awareness and sense for the users' needs. To overcome this problem we develop intelligent transparent human-centered systems that sense, analyze, and interpret the user's needs. We implemented learning approaches that derive the current task demand from the user's brain activity by measuring the electroencephalogram. Using Support Vector Machines we can discriminate high versus low task demand with an accuracy of 92.2% in session dependent experiments, 87.1% in session independent experiments, and 80.0% in subject independent experiments. To make brain activity measurements less cumbersome, we built a comfortable headband with which we achieve 69% classification accuracy on the same task.

Methods: Seven healthy volunteers, naive to BCI technology, participated in this study. Signals were recorded from 275-channel MEG, and synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) was employed as the spatial filter. The four-class classification was performed offline. Genetic algorithm based Mahalanobis linear distance (GA-MLD) and direct-decision tree classifier (DTC) techniques were adopted for the classification through 10-fold cross-validation. Results: Through SAM imaging, strong and distinct event-related desynchronization (ERD) associated with sustaining, and event-related synchronization (ERS) patterns associated with ceasing of right and left hand movements were observed in the beta band (15-30 Hz) on the contralateral hemispheres for motor execution and motor imagery sessions. Virtual channels were selected from these areas of high activity for the corresponding events as per the paradigm of the study. Through a statistical comparison between SAM-filtered virtual channels from single-trial MEG signals and basic MEG sensors, it was found that SAM-filtered virtual channels significantly increased the classification accuracy for motor execution (GA-MLD: 96.51 +/- 2.43%) as well as motor imagery sessions (GA-MLD: 89.69 +/- 3.34%). Conclusion: Multiple movement intentions can be reliably detected from SAM-based spatially filtered single-trial MEG signals. Significance: MEG signals associated with natural motor behavior may be utilized for a reliable high-performance brain-computer interface (BCI) and may reduce long-term training compared with conventional BCI methods using rhythm control.

Three training algorithms are investigated: SpikeProp (using both incremental and batch processing), QuickProp, and RProp. Since the epilepsy and epileptic seizure detection problem requires a large training dataset the efficacy of these algorithms is investigated by first applying them to the XOR and Fisher iris benchmark problems. Three measures of performance are investigated: number of convergence epochs, computational efficiency, and classification accuracy. Extensive parametric analysis is performed to identify heuristic rules and optimum parameter values that increase the computational efficiency and classification accuracy. The result is a remarkable increase in computational efficiency. For the XOR problem, the computational efficiency of SpikeProp, QuickProp, and RProp is increased by a factor of 588, 82, and 75, respectively, compared with the results reported in the literature. EEGs from three different subject groups are analyzed: (a) healthy subjects, (b) epileptic subjects during a seizure-free interval, and (c) epileptic subjects during a seizure. It is concluded that RProp is the best training algorithm because it has the highest classification accuracy among all training algorithms specially for large size training datasets with about the same computational efficiency provided by SpikeProp. The SNN model for EEG classification and epilepsy and seizure detection uses RProp as training algorithm. This model yields a high classification accuracy of 92.5%.

Our algorithm automatically identifies contiguous brain regions that yield maximum mean test statistics from hypothesis tests over individual brain sources. We show that by utilizing these sources of interest it is possible to predict the experimental conditions via Bayesian decoding using single trials. Furthermore, we examine how these sources evolve spatially and temporally over the brain surface by running our algorithm at sequential time intervals. We demonstrate our method in a visually-guided wrist movement task where the goal is to infer the direction of wrist movement. MEG data were recorded using an Elekta Neuromag (R) device while subjects performed center-out wrist movements in 4 directions, and sources were estimated from raw data using the Minimum Norm Estimate method [1]. Our results demonstrate that the algorithm is a potential alternative to traditional ROI analysis using p-values, successfully discovers optimal clusters of sources relevant to the task, and achieves significant decoding accuracies in leave-one-out cross validation.

They are chaotic, unstable, nonlinear, nonstationary, nonGaussian, asynchronous, noisy, and unpredictable in fine grain, yet undeniably they are among the most successful devices that a billion years of evolution has produced. No one can justifiably claim that fie or she has modeled brains, but they are a flowing spring of now concepts, and they provide a gold standard of what we can aspire to accomplish in developing more intelligent machines. The most fertile source of ideas with which to challenge and break the restrictions that characterize modern engineering practice is the electroencephalogram (EEG). It was the action potential of single neurons that provided the foundation of neurobiology for the 20th century, and in its time it supported the development of digital computers, neural networks, and computational neuroscience. Now in the 21st century, the EEG will lead us in a remarkably different direction of growth for the computing industry, which will be dominated by highly parallel, hierarchically organized, distributed analog machines. These devices now exist in prototype form. They feed on noise in support of chaotic attractor landscapes, which are shaped by reinforcement learning through self-governed experience, not training by 'teachers', and they may solve many of the problems of interfacing between finite state automata and the infinite complexity of the real world.

The algorithm was evaluated in three different patients, with prediction defined over a horizon of 5 minutes before unequivocal electrographic onset. Experiments are carried out using 20 baseline epochs (non-seizures) and 18 preictal epochs (pre-seizures).

Methods: Five letters appearing sequentially on a screen had to be memorized. The letters constituted a word in one condition and a pronounceable non-word in the other. Power changes of 248 channel MEG data were extracted in frequency sub-bands and a two-step filter and Search algorithm was used to select informative features that discriminated patients and controls. Results: The discrimination between patients and controls was greater in the word condition than in the non-word condition. Furthermore, in the word condition, the most discriminant patterns were extracted in delta (1-4 Hz), alpha (12-16 Hz) and beta (16-24 Hz) frequency bands. These features were located in the left dorso-frontal, occipital and left fronto-temporal, respectively. Conclusion: The analysis of the oscillatory patterns of MEG recordings in the working memory task provided a high level of correct classification of patients and controls. Significance: We show, using a newly developed algorithm, that the temporo-spatial patterns of brain oscillations can be used as biometric marker that discriminate schizophrenia patients and healthy controls.

Extratemporal ictal clinical features in hippocampal sclerosis: Their relationship to the degree of hippocampal volume loss and to the outcome of temporal lobectomy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						temporal lobe epilepsy; hippocampal sclerosis; atypical clinical features; postsurgery outcome	COMPLEX PARTIAL SEIZURES; LOBE EPILEPSY; BEHAVIORS; PATTERNS; PARIETAL; ATROPHY; MRI	Purpose: Since extratemporal clinical features in patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (HS) are likely to indicate aberrant ictal spread or a more extensive epileptogenic zone, we asked whether such features are associated with more severe HS and a worse outcome following temporal lobectomy. Patients and methods: We reviewed all patients (174) who had undergone temporal lobectomy for histologically proven unilateral HS related temporal lobe epilepsy between 1997-2005 at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. We divided patients into those with severe HS (side-to-side ratio < 0.6) and those with mild HS (side-to-side ratio > 0.75). We examined all seizures recorded on electroencephalography (EEG) video telemetry in these patients for clinical features of temporal lobe epilepsy. The postsurgical outcome was classified using the Engel classification at the time of follow up (median 4.7 years, range 1-9 years). Results: Patients (28 out 39) with severe HS had atypical features compared to 7 out of 27 in the mild HS [Chi square (chi(2)) test, p = 0.0013]. The mean number of atypical clinical features was 2.2 in the severe HS group and 0.62 in the mild HS group (Mann Whitney U Test, p < 0.001). The percentage of postsurgery seizure freedom (class 1 Engel classification) was 87%, and there was no significant effect of the presence of atypical clinical features. Conclusions: This study shows that atypical (extratemporal) clinical features tend to occur more frequently in patients with severe HS and do not correlate with worse surgical outcome.

A pattern recognition method for electronic noses. based on an olfactory neural network	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL			English	Article						artificial neural networks; electronic nose; pattern recognition; transient phase; olfactory model; sensor drift	DYNAMIC-MODEL; SENSOR ARRAY; EEG PATTERNS; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM	Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are generally considered as the most promising pattern recognition method to process the signals from a chemical sensor array of electronic noses, which makes the system more bionics. This paper presents a chaotic neural network entitled KIII, which modeled olfactory systems, applied to an electronic nose to discriminate six typical volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Chinese lice wines. Thirty-two-dimensional feature vectors of a sensor array consisting of eight sensors, in which four features were extracted from the transient response of each TGS sensor, were input into the KIII network to investigate its generalization capability for concentration influence elimination and sensor drift counteraction. In comparison with the conventional back propagation trained neural network (BP-NN), experimental results show that the KM network has a good performance in classification of these VOCs of different concentrations and even for the data obtained I month later than the training set. Its robust generalization capability is suitable for electronic nose applications to reduce the influence of concentration and sensor drift. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Researches have been conducted on motor imaginary detection to aid individuals who cannot use any motor system for communication, to operate the computer and other devices by prosthesis. In this paper, we developed a classifier that can distinguish EEG signals responding to visual stimuli. Brightness difference was used as a preliminary case study of this approach as it is easily controllable and provides stable stimuli. The brain activities were measured by an electroencephalogram (EEG) system, and an adaptive auto-regressive (AAR) model was utilized to extract the features of different brain states corresponding to stimuli in different brightness. A minimum distance analysis (MDA) classifier was created to discriminate different brightness perception. By this means, different perceptions of four brightness conditions were decoded successfully based on the brain activities of single trials.

Detecting neural changes during stress and fatigue effectively: a comparison of spectral analysis and sample entropy	2007 3RD INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering	MAY 02-05, 2007	Kohala Coast, HI	IEEE, EMBS			SYSTEM	Brain computer interface (BCI) technology as its name implies, relies upon decoding brain signals into operational commands. Aside from needing effective means of control, successful BCIs need to remain stable in varying physiological conditions. BCIs need to be developed with mechanisms to recognise and respond to physiological states (such as stress and fatigue) that can disrupt user capability. This paper compares a spectral analysis of EEG signals technique with a nonlinear method of sample entropy to detect changes in brain dynamics during moments of stress and fatigue. The results demonstrated few changes in the spectral frequency bands of the EEG during fatigue and stress conditions. However, when the EEG signals were analysed with the nonlinear technique of sample entropy the results indicated a reduction of complexity during moments of fatigue and stress and an increase in complexity during moments of engagement to the task.

So far, the applicability of such an interface is strongly limited by low bit-transfer rates, slow response times and long training sessions for the subject. The Berlin Brain-Computer Interface (BBCI) project is guided by the idea to train a computer by advanced machine learning techniques both to improve classification performance and to reduce the need of subject training. In this paper we present two directions in which Brain-Computer Interfacing can be enhanced by exploiting the lateralized readiness potential: (1) for establishing a rapid response BCI system that can predict the laterality of upcoming finger movements before EMG onset even in time critical contexts, and (2) to improve information transfer rates in the common BCI approach relying on imagined limb movements.

System performance inherently relates to the user's perception of the system behavior. Thus, the user should be guiding the adaptation process. This should be automatic, transparent, and unconscious. We capitalize on advances in electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing that allow for error related potentials (ErrP) recognition. ErrP are emitted when a human observes an unexpected behavior in a system. We propose and evaluate a hand gesture recognition system from wearable motion sensors that adapts online by taking advantage of ErrP. Thus the gesture recognition system becomes self-aware of its performance, and can self-improve through re-occurring detection of ErrP signals. Results show that our adaptation technique can improve the accuracy of a user independent gesture recognition system by 13.9% when ErrP recognition is perfect. When ErrP recognition errors are factored in, recognition accuracy increases by 4.9%. We characterize the boundary conditions of ErrP recognition guaranteeing beneficial adaptation. The adaptive algorithms are applicable to other forms of activity recognition, and can also use explicit user feedback rather than ErrP.

Five naive subjects performed either sustaining or stopping a motor task with time locking to a predefined time window by using motor execution with physical movement or motor imagery. Spatial filtering, temporal filtering, feature selection and classification methods were explored. The performance of the proposed BCI was evaluated by both offline classification and online two-dimensional cursor control. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) and post-movement event-related synchronization (ERS) were observed on the contralateral hemisphere to the hand moved for both motor execution and motor imagery. Feature analysis showed that EEG beta band activity in the contralateral hemisphere over the motor cortex provided the best detection of either sustained or ceased movement of the right or left hand. The offline classification of four motor tasks (sustain or cease to move right or left hand) provided 10-fold cross-validation accuracy as high as 88% for motor execution and 73% for motor imagery. The subjects participating in experiments with physical movement were able to complete the online game with motor execution at an average accuracy of 85.5 +/- 4.65%; the subjects participating in motor imagery study also completed the game successfully. The proposed BCI provides a new practical multidimensional method by noninvasive EEG signal associated with human natural behavior, which does not need long-term training.

Discrimination of behaviorally irrelevant auditory stimuli in stage II sleep	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						auditory; discrimination; pattern recognition; polysomnography	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; INTENSITY; P300	In sleep, the brain responds to significant stimuli such as one's own name or loud tones. It is, however, not yet known whether in sleep, the brain's response can vary systematically with change in an irrelevant stimulus. Here, we varied the intensity of a 1000 Hz tone and recorded the neural response of the participants by using electroencephalography. The P200 component of the auditory-evoked potential increased linearly and significantly with intensity in wake and in stage 11 sleep. Pattern classification confirmed that there is information about tone intensity in the poststimulus period, especially in the period corresponding to the P200. The sleeping brain is capable of discriminating the fine aspects of a stimulus that is of no significance to the individual.

The dominant frequency bands are subject-specific and therefore performance of motor imagery based BCIs are sensitive to both temporal filtering and spatial filtering. As the optimum filter is strongly subject-dependent, we propose a method that selects the subject-specific discriminative frequency components using time-frequency plots of Fisher ratio of two-class motor imagery patterns. We also propose a low complexity adaptive Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter bank system based on coefficient decimation technique which can realize the subject-specific bandpass filters adaptively depending on the information of Fisher ratio map. Features are extracted only from the selected frequency components. The proposed adaptive filter bank based system offers average classification accuracy of about 90%, which is slightly better than the existing fixed filter bank system.

However, natural and sophisticated interactions manner between brain and computer still remain challenging. In this paper, we investigate how the duration of event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) caused by motor imagery (MI) can be modulated and used as an additional control parameter beyond simple binary decisions. Furthermore, using the non-time-locked properties of sustained (de) synchronization, we have developed an asynchronous BCI system for driving a car in 3D virtual reality environment (VRE) based on cumulative incremental control strategy. The extensive real time experiments confirmed that our new approach is able to drive smoothly a virtual car within challenging VRE only by the MI tasks without involving any muscular activities.

In constructing a BCI-based mental speller, we got the visual evoked potentials (VEP) by '' imitating-natural-reading '' inducing paradigm, and exploit them as the communication carriers between brain and computer. Support vector machine (SVM) was adopted in the single-trail feature classification. To improve the accuracy of pattern recognition, thus to boost up the bit rate of whole system, a 300ms-width signal window was used to estimate the accurate time of target stimuli presentation in Electroencephalogram. We applied an independent component analysis on the raw signals, which recorded from four channels, to get the embedded features enhanced. N2 components of VEP were investigated. Experimental results indicate that the object-specified component can be estimated in single-trial with an accuracy of up to 97% by SVM.

However, a large number of features and the complex decision boundaries for classification of seizures eventually lead to a trade-off between sensitivity and false detection rate (FDR). Thus, no single classifier can fulfill the requirements of high sensitivity with a low FDR and at the same time be a computationally efficient system suitable for real-time application. We present a novel, simple, computationally efficient seizure detection system to enhance the sensitivity with a low FDR by proposing a dual-stage classifier. This overall system consists of a pre-processing unit, a feature extraction unit and a novel dual-stage classifier. The first stage of the proposed classifier detects all true seizures, but also many false patterns, whereas the second stage of the proposed classifier minimizes false detections by rejecting patterns that may be artifacts. The performance of the novel seizure detection system has been evaluated on 300 hours of single-channel depth electroencephalogram (SEEG) recordings obtained from fifteen patients. An overall improvement has been observed in terms of sensitivity, specificity and FDR.	[Yadav, Rajeev; Agarwal, Rajeev; Swamy, M. N.

Four hours continuous three channel polygraphic signals such as EEG (electroencephalogram), EOG (electrooculogram) and EMG (electromyogram) from conscious subjects were digitally recorded and stored in computer. EOG and EMG signals were used for manual identification of sleep states before training and testing of ANN. The percentages power of the 2 s epochs of the digitized EEG signals from each of three sleep-wake patterns, sleep spindles (SS), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and awake (AWA) sates, were calculated and analyzed to select the manually confirmed sleep-wake states for each epoch. Further, second order Daubechies mother wavelet has been used to get the wavelet coefficients for the selected EEG epochs. The wavelet coefficients for the EEG epochs (64 data) were selected as inputs for the training the network and to classify SS, REM sleep and AWA stages. The ANN architecture used (64-14-3) in present study shows overall very good agreement with manual sleep stage scoring with an average of 95.35% for all the 1,140 samples tested from SS, REM and AWA stages. This architecture of ANN was also found effectively differentiating the EEG power spectra from different sleep-wake states (96.84% in SS, 93.68% in REM sleep, 95.52% in AWA state). The high performance observed with the system based on wavelet coefficients along with the ANN, highlights the need of this computational tool into the field of sleep research.

In this paper, we describe an experiment we conducted to explore some of the issues around using an electroencephalograph (EEG) for classifying working memory load. Within this experiment, we present our classification methodology, including a novel feature selection scheme that seems to alleviate the need for complex drift modeling and artifact rejection. We demonstrate classification accuracies of up to 99% for 2 memory load levels and up to 88% for 4 levels. We also present results suggesting that we can do this with shorter windows, much less training data, and a smaller number of EEG channels, than reported previously. Finally, we show results suggesting that the models we construct transfer across variants of the task, implying some level of generality. We believe these findings extend prior work and bring us a step closer to the use of such technologies in HCI research.	[Grimes, David; Shenoy, Pradeep; Rao, Rajesh P.

During the last two decades, wavelet transform has been developing as one of the most powerful processors in various areas of science and technology. Many papers have been documented with different types of mother wavelet functions in various fields using different criteria (e.g. similarity between signals and mother wavelet). To name a few. machine condition monitoring including vibration, acoustic and ultrasonic signals, image processing, Electromyographic (EMG) and Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals have been taken into consideration using wavelet transform. The selection wavelet function represents an ongoing challenge in biosignal processing. This paper focuses on the selection of mother wavelet function for human biological signals. In this research, three measures were analyzed. These include surface and intramuscular EMG of the upper limb and psychophysical EEG in response to visual stimuli. 324 mother wavelet functions from wavelet families; including Haar, Daubechies (db), Symlet, Coiflet.

Methods: Twenty children with clinical and laboratory features of Glut-1 DS were evaluated. Age at seizure diagnosis, seizure classification, and response to treatment were determined by chart review. Thirty-two continuous 24-h EEG monitoring sessions and reports of 42 routine EEG studies were assessed. Results: Age at seizure diagnosis was between 4 weeks and 18 months (mean, 5 months). Seizure types were generalized tonic or clonic (14), absence (10), partial (nine), myoclonic (six), or astatic (four). During 24-h EEGs, background activity showed generalized 2.5- to 4-Hz spike-wave discharges (41%), generalized slowing or attenuation (34%), no abnormalities (34%), focal epileptiform discharges (13%), or focal slowing or attenuation (9%). No seizures were captured during 69% of the studies; the remainder had absence (19%), myoclonic (9%), or partial seizures (3%). On evaluation of routine and 24-h EEG studies, focal epileptiform discharges (24%) and slowing (11%) were more frequent in ages 0-24 months. In older children (2-8 years), generalized epileptiform discharges (37.5%) and slowing (21 %) were more common. Conclusions: In all ages, a normal interictal EEG was the most common EEG finding. When abnormalities occurred, focal slowing or epileptiform discharges were more prevalent in the infant. In older children (2 years or older), a generalized 2.5- to 4-Hz spike-wave pattern emerged. Seizure types observed included, absence, myoclonic, partial, and astatic.

The Abdominal respiration signals were separated into spectral sub-band energy components with multi-resolution Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The energy content of these spectral components was applied to the input of the artificial neural network (ANN). The ANN was configured to give three outputs dedicated to SAS cases; obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea (CSA) and mixed sleep apnea (MSA).

In particular the proposed approach implements a time-frequency plane feature extraction strategy from multichannel ECoG signals by using a dual-tree undecimated wavelet packet transform. The dual-tree undecimated wavelet packet transform generates a redundant feature dictionary with different time-frequency resolutions. Rather than evaluating the individual discrimination performance of each electrode or candidate feature, the proposed approach implements a wrapper strategy to select a subset of features from the redundant structured dictionary by evaluating the classification performance of their combination. This enables the algorithm to optimally select the most informative features coming from different cortical areas and/or time frequency locations. We show experimental classification results on the ECoG data set of BCI competition 2005. The proposed approach achieved a classification accuracy of 93% by using only three features.

The introduced method requires no prior knowledge of the reactive frequency bands, their temporal behavior or cortical locations. The algorithm implements an arbitrary time-frequency segmentation procedure by using a flexible local discriminant base algorithm for given multichannel brain activity recordings to extract subject specific ERD and ERS patterns. Extracted time-frequency features are processed by principal component analysis to reduce the feature set which is highly correlated due to volume conduction and the neighbor cortical regions. The reduced feature set is then fed to a linear discriminant analysis for classification. We give experimental results for 9 subjects to show the superior performance of the proposed method where the classification accuracy varied between 76.4% and 96.81% and the average classification accuracy was 84.9%.

Altered evoked gamma-band responses reveal impaired early visual processing in ADHD children	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						ADHD; Attention; EEG; Gamma activity; Memory; Visual	DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; BRAIN ACTIVITY; HUMAN EEG; OSCILLATIONS; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS; SOUND; ACTIVATION	Neurophysiological studies yield contrary results whether attentional problems of patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are related to early visual processing deficits or not. Evoked gamma-band responses (GBRs), being among the first cortical responses occurring as early as 90 ms after visual stimulation in human EEG, have been assigned a pivotal role in early visual processing. In particular, they are involved in memory matching processes and are enhanced when known stimuli are processed. The current study examined whether evoked GBR patterns during early memory matching processes could be indicative of an early visual processing deficit in ADHD patients. EEG was recorded from 13 young ADHD patients as well as 13 age-matched healthy participants. Both groups performed a simple forced choice reaction task employing line drawings of either known real-world items with representations in long-term memory or physically similar unknown items without such representations. Evoked GBRs of ADHD patients did not differentiate between known and unknown items. However, in healthy children, evoked GBRs were enhanced when stimuli matched a representation stored in memory. This finding indicates disadvantages at early visual processing stages in ADHD patients: In contrast to healthy participants, ADHD children lack an early memory based classification, possibly resulting in an impaired ability to rapidly reallocate attentional resources to relevant stimuli. These findings suggest that impaired early automatic stimulus classification in ADHD patients could be involved in deficits of selective and sustained attention. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In the earlier works were proposed various approaches of determining features of bio-signals that are capable of discerning predefined motions/intentions of human, but most of them were only applicable to a single subject due to inherent characteristics of bio-signals. Lately, several structures of pattern classifier with the known features have been proposed to cope with the subject-dependency, but their error rates are still conspicuous in accommodating multiple subjects. Based on the separability matrix and rough set theory, this paper presents a comparative experimental study to minimize the subject-dependency. It is shown that the induced feature set obtained by the proposed feature selection algorithm, has less subject-dependency than other existing methods.

However, most of the studies are mainly focused on facial expression classifications and speech recognition and not much attention has been paid until recently to physiological pattern recognition. In this paper, an integrative approach is proposed to emotional interaction by fusing multi-modal signals. Subjects are exposed to pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). A feature extraction procedure is used to discriminate between four affective states by means of a Mahalanobis distance classifier. The average classifications rate (74.11%) was encouraging. Thus. the induced affective state is mirrored through an avatar by changing its facial characteristics and generating a voice message sympathising with the user's mood. It is argued that multi-physiological patterning in combination with anthropomorphic avatars may contribute to the enhancement of affective multi-modal interfaces and the advancement of machine emotional intelligence.

This technology gives a new way to communicate between human and computer or machine. BCI system enables persons to command a computer without spontaneous limb movement by measuring the brain signal and interpreting the intention of users in real-time basis. MEG/EEG signal at sensor should be combination of signals originated from infinitely many sources. So, signals at sensor are so noisy and are hard to discriminate different state information (feature), which contains implicitly user's intention. In general, it is too difficult to improve the performance of EEG based BCI without seeking better feature extraction. For seeking different features from the existing features, we try to do source localization in the belief that projection of EEG data into source space enables us to see unseen information in sensor space. Eigenbased minimum variance beamformer is introduced for this purpose in this work. It gives reconstructed source image on each voxel and is too robust to noise as well as fast (real-time reconstruction is tractable in some sense), which is well-suited to BCI system. Each trial for the given condition is projected into source space by beamformer localizer. Then in the source space feature extractions and classification are attempted. In this work, left-right hand motor imagery experimental paradigm was used, and common spatial pattern (CSP) and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) were applied for feature extraction and classification, respectively. In the specific regions of interest (for example, regions under the C3 and C4), voxel-based CSP is applied and compared with sensor-based CSP. Their BCI performance are investigated and compared for various datasets.

We then report some preliminary results of its application, illustrate some of the many future projects in which we expect the technique will be of considerable use (including a way to relate fMRI to EEG), and describe a research resource for investigating functional cooperation in the cortex that will be made publicly available through the lab web site. One significant finding is that differences between cognitive domains appear to be attributable more to differences in patterns of cooperation between brain regions, rather than to differences in which brain regions are used in each domain. This is not a result that is predicted by prevailing localization-based and modular accounts of the organization of the cortex.

The presented chaotic oscillator array model is used for electroencephalogram (EEG) signal feature extraction, which works based on the phase transition characteristics of the chaotic oscillator. The dynamic characteristics of Duffing system and the corresponding bifurcation process are discussed in detail. We define a quantitative measure to characterize the response in dynamic behaviors of COA considering the trajectory divergence degree in phase space. The learning vector quantization networks (LVQ) is viewed as classification model in our method. Different response patterns of COA can be clustered and mapped with predefined BCI commands through a well-trained LVQ model. The experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed method.

On the other hand, neonatal seizures may represent a first or even the only sign of central nervous system dysfunction. However, establishing the diagnosis of neonatal seizures poses several problems, and clinical observation is not sufficient in many cases. Neonatal polysomnography is a valuable tool both in the diagnostic and in the prognostic assessment of neonatal seizures. The present text reviews some technical aspects related to neonatal polysomnographies, and its usefulness in the area of suspected neonatal seizures. Moreover, some questions are raised regarding rhythmic discharges and their significance as a possible ictal and interictal epileptic pattern in the neonate. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

In the present study, we investigated these possible preictal changes in long-term intracranial recordings of five patients by a measure of phase synchronization. In order to clearly distinguish preictal changes from all the other interictal states, we developed an automatic extraction of representative patterns of interictal synchronization activity. This reference library was used to classify the successive synchronization patterns of long-term recordings into groups of similar patterns. Altered states of brain synchronization were identified as deviating from patterns in the reference library and were evaluated relative to the times of seizure onset in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Methods: A phase-locking measure was estimated using a sliding window analysis on 15 frequency bands (2 Hz steps between 0 and 30 Hz), for all pairs of EEG channels in the epileptogenic temporal lobe (14-20 channels), over the entire data sets (total analyzed duration 305 h). The preictal identification encompasses three basic stages: (1) a preprocessing stage involving the determination of a reference library of characteristic interictal synchronization patterns using a K-means algorithm, and the identification of discriminant variables differentiating interictal from preictal states, (2) a classification stage of the synchronization pattern via a minimum Mahalanobis distance to the reference patterns, as well as detection of outliers, (3) an evaluation stage, of the sensitivity and specificity of the detection by receiver-operating characteristic curves. Results: In most of the cases (36 of 52 seizures, i.e. 70%), a specific state of brain synchronization can be observed several hours before the actual seizure. The changes involved both increases and decreases of the synchronization levels, occurring mostly within the 4-15 Hz frequency band, and were often localized near the primary epileptogenic zone. Conclusions: The analysis of phase synchronization offers a way to distinguish between a preictal state and normal interictal activity. These findings suggest that brain synchronizations are preictally altered in the epileptogenic temporal lobe, inducing a pathological state of higher susceptibility for seizure activity. Significance: Phase synchronization is capable of extracting information from the EEG that allow the definition of a preictal state. Although the proposed analysis does not constitute genuine seizure anticipation, these changes in neuronal synchronization may provide helpful information for prospective seizure warning.

We give an overview of different approaches and focus on a particular BMI approach: the movement of an artificial effector (e.g. arm prosthesis to the right) by those motor cortical signals that control the equivalent movement of a corresponding body part (e.g. arm movement to the right). This approach has been successfully applied in monkeys and humans by accurately extracting parameters of movements from the spiking activity of multiple single-units. Here, we review recent findings showing that analog neuronal population signals, ranging from intracortical local field potentials over epicortical ECoG to non-invasive EEG and MEG, can also be used to decode movement direction and continuous movement trajectories. Therefore, these signals might provide additional or alternative control for this BMI approach, with possible advantages due to reduced invasiveness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An algorithm for the automatic detection of seizures in neonatal amplitude-integrated EEG	ACTA PAEDIATRICA			English	Article						cerebral function monitor; detection; neonatal seizures	CEREBRAL FUNCTION MONITOR	Aim: To develop and evaluate an algorithm for the automatic screening of electrographic neonatal seizures (ENS) in amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) signals. Methods: CFM recordings were recorded in asphyxiated (near)term newborns. ENS of at least 60 sec were detected based on their characteristic pattern in the aEEG signal, an increase of its lower boundary. The algorithm was trained using five CFM recordings (training set) annotated by a neurophysiologist, observer1. The evaluation of the algorithm was based on eight different CFM recordings annotated by observer1 (test set observer 1) and an independent neurophysiologist, observer2 (test set observer 2). Results: The interobserver agreement between observer1 and 2 in interpreting ENS from the CFM recordings was high (G coefficient: 0.82). After dividing the eight CFM recordings into 1-min segments and classification in ENS or non-ENS, the intraclass correlation coefficient showed high correlations of the algorithm with both test sets (respectively, 0.95 and 0.85 with observer1 and 2). The algorithm showed in five recordings a sensitivity >= 90% and approximately 1 false positive ENS per hour. However, the algorithm showed in three recordings much lower sensitivities: one recording showed ENSs of extremely high amplitude that were incorrectly classified by the algorithm as artefacts and two recordings suffered from low interobserver agreement. Conclusion: This study shows the feasibility of automatic ENS screening based on aEEG signals and may facilitate in the bed-side interpretation of aEEG signals in clinical practice.

Some constraints of the system are 1) the supervision and monitoring of the driver-vehicle-environment system is a complex problem due to particularities such as stochastic, personal and dynamic. 2) The solution must be based on a non-intrusive system and 3) able to diagnose and predict Hypovigilance from peripheral on-board sensors. The proposed diagnosis system is based on intelligent signal processing algorithms and real time methodologies as the Wavelets analysis and the Support Vector Machines learning approach for density estimation. The framework of this study is the AWAKE European research project. The value of such a system is demonstrated by some field experiments and its validation by means of EEG/EOG physiological measures.

However, their development usually requires a manual effort from the human expert in which several parameter configurations (architectures, training parameters, etc) are tried. This paper proposes a new evolutionary method that evolves ANNs without any participation from the human expert. This system can be used to evolve feed-forward and recurrent ANNs. A real-world problem has been used to test the behaviour of this system: detection of epileptic seizures in EEG signals. A comparison of the results obtained using recurrent and feed-forward ANNs to solve this problem is presented in this paper. This comparison shows the good accuracies obtained by this method (almost 100%). Moreover, these results show an important feature: the system tries to evolve simple ANNs, with a low number of neurons and connections (in many cases, the networks have only 1 hidden neuron).

Feature extraction for multi-class BCI using canonical variates analysis	2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INTELLIGENT SIGNAL PROCESSING, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS BOOK	International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing-WISP		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing	OCT 03-05, 2007	Alcala de Henares, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Instrumentat & Measurement Soc, IEEE Secc Espana, Univ Alcala, Dept Elect		electroencephalogram; brain-computer interfaces; canonical variates analysis; linear discriminant analysis	EEG	Objective: To propose a new feature extraction method with canonical solution for multi-class Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). The proposed method should provide a reduced number of canonical discriminant spatial patterns (CDSP) and rank the channels sorted by power discriminability (DP) between classes. Methods: The feature extractor relays in Canonical Variates Analysis (CVA) which provides the CDSP between the classes. The number of CDSP is equal to the number of classes minus one. We analyze EEG data recorded with 64 electrodes from 4 subjects recorded in 20 sessions. They were asked to execute twice in each session three different mental tasks (left hand imagination movement. rest, and words association) during 7 seconds. A ranking of electrodes sorted by power discriminability between classes and the CDSP were computed. After splitting data in training and test sets, we compared the classification accuracy achieved by Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in frequencv and temporal domains. Results: The average LDA classification accuracies over the four subjects using CVA on both domains are equivalent (57.89% in frequency domain and 59.43% in temporal domain). These results, in terms of classification accuracies, are also reflected in the similarity between the ranking of relevant channels in both domains. Conclusions: CVA is a simple feature extractor with canonical solution useful for multi-class BCI applications that can work on temporal or frequency domain.	[Galan, Ferran; Ferrez, Pierre.

'Conscious behaviour' was defined in terms of awareness and responsiveness. The constituent functions of consciousness examined included the orientation to the examiner, intentional behaviour demonstrated by expressive or receptive speech, and postictal memory. Frequency and patterns of impairment of constituent functions and 'conscious behaviour' were assessed. To achieve this, pre-surgical video-EEG (n = 40) or video-electrocorticography recordings (n = 76) of ictal neuropsychological assessments were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were divided into groups with frontal (n = 29), right temporal (n = 21), left temporal (n = 38) and bitemporal (n = 28) seizure activity. Consciousness was most commonly impaired in patients with bitemporal and left temporal seizure activity. There were different patterns of impairment of the assessed constituent functions in the four groups: patients with frontal seizure activity showed loss of orientation behaviour and expressive speech whereas patients with left temporal seizure activity had impairments of memory, expressive and receptive speech. Patients with seizure activity limited to the right temporal lobe rarely exhibited ictal impairment of any of the assessed functions. In contrast, patients with bitemporal seizure activity showed impairment of all examined functions. Hence, normal functioning of the left temporal lobe or both temporal lobes is necessary for the preservation of all constituent aspects of consciousness. The localizing value of patterns of impairment of constituent functions is superior to that of 'consciousness' as a whole.

THE NEUROBIOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF NATURAL COMPUTING: INTENTIONALITY	NEW MATHEMATICS AND NATURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article						AM pattern; electrocorticogram ECoG; electroencephalogram EEG; koniocortex; neural operator; number; neurodynamics; symbol	BACKGROUND EEG ACTIVITY; BRAIN; ORIGIN; MODEL; DYNAMICS; BODY	Brains and computers are both dynamical systems that manipulate symbols, but they differ fundamentally in their architectures and operations. Human brains do mathematics; computers do not. Computers manipulate symbols that humans put into them without grounding them in what they represent. Human brains intentionally direct the body to make symbols, and they use the symbols to represent internal states. The symbols are outside the brain. Inside the brains, the construction is effected by spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity that are operators, not symbols. The operations include formation of sequences of neural activity patterns that we observe by their electrical signs. The process is by neurodynamics, not by logical rule-driven symbol manipulation. The aim of simulating human natural computing should be to simulate the operators. In its simplest form natural computing serves for communication of meaning. Neural operators implement non-symbolic communication of internal states by all mammals, including humans, through intentional actions. The neural operators that implement symbol formation must differ, but how is unknown, so we cannot yet simulate human natural computing. Here, I propose that symbol-making operators evolved from neural mechanisms of intentional action by modification of non-symbolic operators. Both kinds of operators can be investigated by their signs of neuroelectric activity. I propose that the postulated differences should be sought by classification of the spatial textures of the signs in EEG recorded from the scalp overlying those cortical structures unique to humans in the brain that I designate as koniocortex, while the subjects are engaged in elementary arithmetic operations.

Our technique maps intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) time series into corresponding novelty sequences by classifying short-time, energy-based statistics computed from one-second windows of data. We train a classifier on epochs of interictal (normal) EEG. During ictal (seizure) epochs of EEG, seizure activity induces distributional changes in feature space that increase the empirical outlier fraction. A hypothesis test determines when the parameter change differs significantly from its nominal value, signaling a seizure detection event. Outputs are gated in a "one-shot" manner using persistence to reduce the false alarm rate of the system. The detector was validated using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) on a sample of 41 interictal and 29 ictal epochs, and achieved 97.1% sensitivity, a mean detection latency of -7.58 seconds, and an asymptotic false positive rate (FPR) of 1.56 false positives per hour (Fp/hr). These results are better than those obtained from a novelty detection technique based on Mahalanobis distance outlier detection, and comparable to the performance of a supervised learning technique used in experimental implantable devices (Echauz et al., 2001). The novelty detection paradigm overcomes three significant limitations of competing methods: the need to collect seizure data, precisely mark seizure onset and offset times, and perform patient-specific parameter tuning for detector training.

These signals are non-stationary which makes time-invariant filtering unsuitable. The new method assumes a signal model and performs denoising by filtering the signal of each channel using a time-variable filter which is an estimate of the Wiener filter. The approximate Wiener filters are obtained using the time-frequency coherence functions between all channel pairs, and a fix-point algorithm. We estimate the coherence functions using the multiple window method, after which the fix-point algorithm is applied. Simulations indicate that this method improves upon its restriction to assumed stationary signals for realistically non-stationary data, in terms of mean square error, and we show that it can also be used for time-frequency representation of noisy multichannel signals. The method was applied to two epileptic seizure onset signals, and it turned out that the most informative output of the method are the filters themselves studied in the time-frequency domain. They seem to reveal hidden features of the epileptic signal which are otherwise invisible. This algorithm can be used as preprocessing for seizure onset EEG signals prior to time-frequency representation and manual or algorithmic pattern classification.

However, by sliding window and cross validation, DSP can not catch MRP temporal feature effectively. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called temporal-spatial filter (TSF). Given MRP signals, TSF employs alternate optimization to seek a pair of temporal-spatial projections that simultaneously maximizes the between-class scatter and minimizes the within-class scatter. The experimental results show that TSF outperforms DSP in extracting MRP feature. If combining the event-related desynchronization (ERD) and MRP, TSPF still obtains better performance than DSP.

Brain network analysis of seizure evolution	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI			English	Article							PREDICTION; COHERENCE; CLASSIFICATION	The human brain is one of the most complex biological systems. Neuroscientists seek to understand the brain function through detailed analysis of neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. In this study, we propose a network analysis framework to stud), the evolution of epileptic seizures. We apply a signal processing approach, derived from information theory, to investigate the synchronization of neuronal activities, which can be captured by electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Two network-theoretic approaches are proposed to globally model the synchronization of the brain network. We observe some unique patterns related to the development of epileptic seizures, which can be used to illuminate the brain function governed by the epileptogenic process during the period before a seizure. The proposed framework can provide a global structural patterns in the brain network and may be used in the simulation study of dynamical systems (e.g. the brain) to predict oncoming events (e.g. seizures). To analyze long-term EEG recordings in the future, we discuss how the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology can be applied to estimate the clique parameters. This MCMC framework fits very well with this work as the epileptic evolution can be considered to be a system with unobservable state variables and nonlinearities.

The compounds antagonised apomorphine-induced stereotypy with ED(50)s of 0.15 mg/kg s.c. for risperidone, 0.42 mg/kg s.c. for olanzapine and 1.3 mg/kg s.c. for clozapine. At a dose close to that required for apomorphine antagonism (0.16 mg/kg s.c.), risperidone induced only minor changes in EEG power spectral activity. At a higher dosage (0.63 mg/kg s.c.) it increased the power density in the high frequency range (9.8-18.6 Hz), characteristic of a sedative-like effect. Olanzapine and clozapine caused a dose-dependent increase in power density in all frequency bands. These effects were already present at doses (0.04 and 0.16 mg/kg s.c., respectively) 10 times below those required for apomorphine antagonism. The effects increased dose-dependently and were pronounced at the doses required for apomorphine antagonism. These results in rats are in agreement with the clinical observation that risperidone has less propensity for inducing sedation at therapeutic dose levels than olanzapine and clozapine.

Methods: Using the database of the pediatric epilepsy monitoring unit (Children's Hospital of New York), clinical and EEG characteristics of partial seizures were distributed by age groups 0-2, 2-6, and 6+ years for 123 patients who had at least one such seizure with a clear EEG correlate during their admission. chi (2) tests for trend were used to examine clinical and EEG features as a function of age. Results: The frequency of aura, limb automatisms. dystonic posturing. secondary generalization, and unresponsiveness increased with age, whereas asymmetric clonus and symmetric tonic posturing decreased with age. There were no clear changes in the types of EEG ictal patterns observed with age; however. partial seizures emanating from the anterior regions of the brain tended to increase with age, whereas those from the posterior regions tended to decrease with age. Conclusions: Important differences exist in the clinical expression of seizures between young children and adults. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of ictal ontogeny that will promote more accurate classification of seizures and of the epilepsies in young patients. Such efforts can be used to identify young patients for focal epilepsy surgery and to select appropriate anticonvulsive medications.

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (SE) is a term used to denote a range of conditions in which electrographic seizure activity is prolonged and results in nonconvulsive clinical symptoms. Nowadays, some experts on nonconvulsive SE have emphasized the utility on the clinical practice to consider the classification taking in account both the clinical setting and the severity of consciousness impairment, differentiating between ambulatory patients (from almost normal mental state to stupor) which includes absence SE and complex partial SE; and nonconvulsive SE in coma. Aim. To review the literature in relation to the diagnosis of nonconvulsive SE in comatose and/or critically ill patients. Development. Nonconvulsive SE has been reported with surprising frequency in a wide variety of acute neurological processes such as cerebrovascular disease, anoxia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cranial trauma, encephalitis and following convulsive SE. Conclusions. Nonconvulsive seizures and episodes of nonconvulsive SE in patients with severe impairment of consciousness are frequent and, therefore, continuous EEG monitoring is an essential neurophysiologic tool in the evaluation of comatose subjects. EEG interpretation in patients with nonconvulsive SE may be particularly difficult and problematic and, therefore, requires expert knowledge and a clinical and neurophysiologic specific training.

Methods: EEG data including an array of spikes from 3 patients were decomposed by ICA, and source estimation was performed by applying RAP-MUSIC to the spatial information defined by the set of ICA components that showed epileptiform activity in their waveform. Sources were also estimated from the same data using RAP-MUSIC based on eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix of averaged spikes, and common spatial pattern decomposition for comparison. Results: RAP-MUSIC based on ICA could estimate generally correct epileptic sources in the 3 patients, and its results were better than those of the other methods, when compared to intracerebral data. The present analysis proceeded without introduction of subjective decision after data selection. The separation of epileptiform discharges from the background is essential for this analysis, and was successfully performed in the real EEG data. Conclusions: RAP-MUSIC based on ICA appears promising for estimation of epileptic sources with minimal dependence on subjective decisions in the process of analysis. In particular, it was not necessary to select the number of sources. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Invasive BCIs, almost exclusively investigated in animal models using implanted electrodes in brain tissue, and noninvasive BCIs using electrophysiological recordings in humans are described. Clinical applications were reserved with few exceptions for the noninvasive approach: communication with the completely paralyzed and locked-in syndrome with slow cortical potentials, sensorimotor rhythm and P300, and restoration of movement and cortical reorganization in high spinal cord lesions and chronic stroke. It was demonstrated that noninvasive EEG-based BCIs allow brain-derived communication in paralyzed and locked-in patients but not in completely locked-in patients. At present no firm conclusion about the clinical utility of BCI for the control of voluntary movement can be made. Invasive multielectrode BCIs in otherwise healthy animals allowed execution of reaching, grasping, and force variations based on spike patterns and extracellular field potentials. The newly developed fMRI-BCIs and NIRS-BCIs, like EEG BCIs, offer promise for the learned regulation of emotional disorders and also disorders of young children.

Person authentication using brainwaves (EEG) and maximum a posteriori model adaptation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						emerging technologies; electroencephalogram; biometry; signal processing; probabilistic algorithms; machine learning		In this paper, we investigate the use of brain activity for person authentication. It has been shown in previous studies that the brain-wave pattern of every individual is unique and that the electroencephalogram ( EEG) can be used for biometric identification. EEG-based biometry is an emerging research topic and we believe that it may open new research directions and applications in the future. However, very little work has been done in this area and was focusing mainly on person identification but not on person authentication. Person authentication aims to accept or to reject a person claiming an identity, i.e., comparing a biometric data to one template, while the goal of person identification is to match the biometric data against all the records in a database. We propose the use of a statistical framework based on Gaussian Mixture Models and Maximum A Posteriori model adaptation, successfully applied to speaker and face authentication, which can deal with only one training session. We perform intensive experimental simulations using several strict train/test protocols to show the potential of our method. We also show that there are some mental tasks that are more appropriate for person authentication than others.

Impaired percent alpha variability on continuous electroencephalography is associated with thalamic injury and predicts poor long-term outcome after human traumatic brain injury	JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA			English	Article						adult brain injury; electrophysiology; outcome measures; recovery; secondary insult	SEVERE HEAD-INJURY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; METABOLIC-RATE; EEG FREQUENCY; CLASSIFICATION; RHYTHMS; STEM; MECHANISMS; PROGNOSIS; COMA	Continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) is potentially useful in determining prognosis in patients with traumatic brain injuries (TBI). The objective of this prospective, observational cohort study was to determine if the percent alpha variability (PAV) on cEEG was predictive of outcome following TBI. Injury characteristics were indexed to assess whether lesions in specific cerebral loci were correlated with PAV and patient recovery. Fifty-three TBI patients were studied using cEEG recording and serial neuroimaging. Clinical recovery was assessed at regular intervals in hospital and following discharge. The principal outcome measures included the mean 3-day PAV score, the 7-day PAV pattern, delineation of the anatomical sites of brain injury, and the 6-month clinical outcome, as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Significant univariate (p = 0.030) and multivariate (p = 0.008) relations were identified between PAV and GOS scores. PAV offered good discrimination between favorable and unfavorable 6-month outcomes (AUC 0.76) and, with a cut-point of 0.20, had a sensitivity of 87% and negative predictive value of 82%. Multivariate modeling revealed that injuries of the thalamus (p = 0.009) and basal ganglia (p = 0.016), and the presence of diffuse edema (p = 0.009), were the key anatomical predictors of PAV. Brainstem injuries (p = 0.020) and indicators of diffuse cerebral trauma, such as deep white matter shearing (p = 0.036) and multiple subcortical lesions (p = 0.033), were the principal determinants of 6-month recovery. Inclusion of PAV enhanced the accuracy of prediction models that encompassed a selective combination of clinical and anatomical variables (adjusted R-2 = 0.458, p < 0.001). The two main results of this study are (1) PAV is a sensitive predictor of 6-month clinical outcomes following TBI, and (2) injury to the thalamus is related to impaired PAV. PAV appears best utilized as a functional adjunct to traditional clinical and anatomical predictors.

However, the linearity assumption may be too restrictive for many practical applications. The implementation of nonlinear models in time series analysis involves the estimation of a large set of parameters, frequently leading to overfitting problems. In this article, a predictability coefficient is estimated using a combination of nonlinear autoregressive models and the use of support vector regression in this model is explored. We illustrate the usefulness and interpretability of results by using electroencephalographic records of an epileptic patient.

The system is based on the spectral analysis of brain activity during simple mental tasks performing. Seven independent modules were developed and implemented in the form of ActiveX controls. Every ActiveX control makes one processing stage required and when they are combined allows building the interface between the brain and the machine. The classification of the mental tasks associated patterns was done by a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network. The system implemented, can simulate the remote control of standard device like a TV or Radio by the brain.

Although subjects with muscular dystrophy (MD) appear to be potential BCI users, the actual long-term effects of BCI use on brain activities in MD subjects have yet to be clarified. To investigate these effects, we followed BCI use by a chronic tetraplegic subject with MD over 5 months. The topographic changes in an electroencephalogram (EEG) after long-term use of the virtual reality (VR)-based BCI were also assessed. Our originally developed BCI system was used to classify an EEG recorded over the sensorimotor cortex in real time and estimate the user's motor intention (MI) in 3 different limb movements: feet, left hand, and right hand. An avatar in the internet-based VR was controlled in accordance with the results of the EEG classification by the BCI. The subject was trained to control his avatar via the BCI by strolling in the VR for 1 hour a day and then continued the same training twice a month at his home. Results: After the training, the error rate of the EEG classification decreased from 40% to 28%. The subject successfully walked around in the VR using only his MI and chatted with other users through a voice-chat function embedded in the internet-based VR. With this improvement in BCI control, event-related desynchronization (ERD) following MI was significantly enhanced (p < 0.01) for feet MI (from -29% to -55%), left-hand MI (from -23% to -42%), and right-hand MI (from -22% to -51%). Conclusions: These results show that our subject with severe MD was able to learn to control his EEG signal and communicate with other users through use of VR navigation and suggest that an internet-based VR has the potential to provide paralyzed people with the opportunity for easy communication.

The difficulties of the problem reside essentially in the fact that traditional methods do not apply when observations are in a high dimensional space, which is a common case in biomedical engineering. Our objective is to propose new hypothesis tests that give p-values reflecting the reality of the efficacy criterion of drugs. Our test is based on a pattern recognition approach. We first study the stability of different training algorithms. We then exhibit a relationship between stability and power functions of the corresponding tests. We finally apply our method to test the efficacy of Lorazepam versus placebo to modify generators of brain activity.

We report six patients who had recorded seizures with generalized onset, but subsequent evolution into a focal discharge. The clinical seizure onset was generalized absence or myoclonic, and the most common subsequent clinical pattern was prolonged behavioral arrest with mild automatisms, and then postictal confusion. The ictal discharge started with generalized spike-and-wave activity and then acquired a focal predominance. Interictal epileptiform activity was generalized. There were no focal magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities. Four patients were misdiagnosed with complex partial seizures. All patients were initially refractory, but three became seizure-free and three improved after treatment with antiepileptic medications appropriate for absence or myoclonic seizures. Generalized-onset seizures that acquire focal features are easily misdiagnosed as complex partial. These seizures have a more favorable response to medications effective against generalized absence and myoclonic seizures.

Automatic recognition of hemodynamic responses to rare stimuli using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy	11TH MEDITERRANEAN CONFERENCE ON MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTING 2007, VOLS 1 AND 2	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	11th Mediterranean Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing (MEDICON 2007)	JUN 26-30, 2007	Ljubljana, SLOVENIA	Int Federat Med & Biomed Engn		fNIRS; pattern classification; attention		Attention domain is of crucial importance for goal-directed behaviors and it has been widely studied through response analysis to rare stimuli using electroencephalography, (EEC). More recent researches have explored the brain circuitry of attention by applying neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance. This paper investigates for the first time the feasibility of automatic recognition of responses to rare stimuli by using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS is a portable brain imaging modality that optically measures the cortical hemodynamic activation and may prove useful in monitoring localized activity changes in frontal cortex related to attention processes. In this preliminary study, Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) is used to discriminate between average responses to rare task-relevant stimuli and responses to task-irrelevant stimuli.

Recurrent neural network (RNN) was implemented and used as basis for detection of variabilities of ECG signals. Four types of ECG beats (normal beat, congestive heart failure beat. ventricular tachyarrhythmia beat, atrial fibrillation beat) obtained from the PhysioBank database were classified. Decision making was performed in two stages: computing features which were then input into the RNN and classification using the RNN trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The research demonstrated that the Lyapunov exponents are the features which are well representing the ECG signals and the RNN trained on these features achieved high classification accuracies (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

This is achieved by using a brain-computer interface (BCI) that transforms thought-modulated electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings into a control signal. A BCI establishes a communication channel between the human brain and the computer. The basic principle of the Gr-az-BCI is the detection and classification of motor-imagery-related EEG patterns, whereby the dynamics of sensorimotor rhythms are analyzed. A BCI is a closed-loop system and information is visually fed back to the user about the success or failure of an intended movement imagination. Feedback can be realized in different ways, from a simple moving bar graph to navigation in VEs. The goals of this work are twofold: first, to show the influence of different feedback types on the same task, and second, to demonstrate that it is possible to move through a VE (e.g., a virtual street) without any muscular activity, using only the imagination of foot movement. In the presented work, data from BCI feedback displayed on a conventional monitor are compared with data from BCI feedback in VE experiments with a head-mounted display (HMD) and in a high immersive projection environment (Cave). Results of three participants are reported to demonstrate the proof-of-concept. The data indicate that the type of feedback has an influence on the task performance, but not on the BCI classification accuracy. The participants achieved their best performances viewing feedback in the Cave. Furthermore the VE feedback provided motivation for the subjects.

Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE, Neural Networks Council			EEGS	Brains are characterized by every property that engineers and computer scientists detest and avoid. They are chaotic, unstable, nonlinear, nonstationary, non-Gaussian, asynchronous, noisy, and unpredictable in fine grain, yet undeniably they are among the most successful devices that a billion years of evolution has produced. No one can justifiably claim that he or she has modeled brains, but they are a flowing spring of new concepts, and they provide a gold standard of what we can aspire to accomplish in developing more intelligent machines. The most fertile source of ideas with which to challenge and break the restrictions that characterize modem engineering practice is the electroencephalogram (EEG). It was the action potential of single neurons that provided the foundation of neurobiology for the 20th century, and in its time it supported the development of digital computers, neural networks, and computational neuroscience. Now in the 21st century, the EEG will lead us in a remarkably different direction of growth for the computing industry, which will be dominated by highly parallel, hierarchically organized, distributed analog machines. These devices now exist in prototype form. They feed on noise in support of chaotic attractor landscapes, which are shaped by reinforcement learning through self-governed experience, not training by 'teachers', and they may solve many of the problems of interfacing between finite state automata and the infinite complexity of the real world.

The brain switch is operated through foot motor imagery (MI) and is based on the classification of event-related desynchronization (ERD) during a motor task or event-related synchronization (ERS) after the termination of the task (also known as the beta rebound). The methods described in this work are suitable for operating a brain-computer interface (BCI) as an attractive control alternative for healthy users. A general description of ERD/ERS is obtained with several band power features and a rigid paradigm timing. Two support vector machines (SVMs) are trained in a novel fashion by using the patterns from motor execution (ME) and a priori information about the significance of ERD/ERS patterns. A maximum true positive rate (TPR) of 0.92 and a minimum of 0.43 was achieved (in 8 out of 9 subjects) during training of the classifiers; with a mean false positive rate (FPR) of 0.09 +/- 0.05. A simulation of an asynchronous BCI using MI data and the classifiers trained with ME data achieved a maximum TPR of 0.88, a minimum of 0.50 (in 6 out of 9 subjects) and an average FPR of 0.09 +/- 0.04. This work presents a step forward towards an easy-to-set-up and easy-to-use asynchronous BCI system for healthy users. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we have developed an application that will support the prediction of the pro-peptide cleavage site of fungal extracellular proteins which display mostly a monobasic or dibasic processing site. Many of the secretory proteins and peptides are synthesized as inactive precursors and they become active after post-translational processing. A collection of fungal proprotein sequences are used as a training data set. A specifically designed kernel is expressed as an application of the well-known Gaussian kernel via feature spaces defined for our problem. Rather than fixing the kernel parameters with cross validation or other methods, we introduce a novel approach that simultaneously performs model selection together with the test of accuracy and testing confidence levels. This leads us to higher accuracy at significantly reduced training times. The results of the server ProP1.0 which predicts pro-peptide cleavage sites are compared with the results of this study.

The study is performed on 8 healthy subjects and 35 BCI-nave hemiparetic stroke patients. This study also investigates whether the performance of the stroke patients in operating MI-BCI correlates with the extent of neurological disability. The performance is objectively computed from the 10x10-fold cross-validation accuracy of employing the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) algorithm on their EEG measurements. The neurological disability is subjectively estimated using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) of the upper extremity. The results show that the performance of BCI-naive hemiparetic stroke patients is comparable to healthy subjects, and no correlation is found between the accuracy of their performance and their motor impairment in terms of FMA.

If this can be done bypassing the usual human output pathways like peripheral nerves and muscles it can ultimately become a valuable tool for paralyzed patients. Most activity in BCI research is devoted to finding suitable features and algorithms to increase information transfer rates (ITRs). The present paper studies the implications of using more classes, e.g., left vs. right hand vs. foot, for operating a BCI. We contribute by (1) a theoretical study showing under some mild assumptions that it is practically not useful to employ more than three or four classes, (2) two extensions of the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm, one interestingly based on simultaneous diagonalization, and (3) controlled EEG experiments that underline our theoretical findings and show excellent improved ITRs.

Methods: EEG was recorded in ten healthy volunteers while performing different cue based, 3 s sustained, real and imaginary right hand movements. Energy density maps were calculated over fixed 240 ms and 2 Hz time-frequency windows (called resets) for each movement and statistically significant resets were determined. After that, normalised energy values of the statistically significant resets were compared between two real as well as between two imaginary movements using a parametric test. Results: The largest differences between energy density maps between two motor tasks were noticed on electrode location Cp3 in the higher alpha and the beta bands (i.e., 12-30 Hz), for both real and imaginary movements. The method reduced a total number of discriminative features between two motor tasks to fewer than 2% for the imaginary and fewer than 3% for the real movements on the electrode location Cp3. Conclusions: The method can be used for visualisation and feature extraction for BCI and other applications where event related desynchronisation/synchronisation (ERD/ERS) maps should be compared. Significance: If a reliable on-line classification of imaginary movements of the same limb would be achieved it could be combined with classification of movements of different parts of the body. That would increase a number of separable classes of a BCI system, thereby providing a larger number of command signals to control the external devises such as computers and robotic devices.

To address this challenge, we propose a machine learning (ML) methodology to predict the response to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication in subjects suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD), using pre-treatment electroencephalograph (EEG) measurements. The proposed feature selection technique is a modification of the method of Peng et al [10] that is based on a Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance measure. The classifier was realized as a kernelized partial least squares regression procedure, whose output is the predicted response. A low-dimensional kernelized principal component representation of the feature space was used for the purposes of visualization and clustering analysis. The overall method was evaluated using an 11-fold nested cross-validation procedure for which over 85% average prediction performance is obtained. The results indicate that ML methods hold considerable promise in predicting the efficacy of SSRI antidepressant therapy for major depression.

We term these types of BCI systems "cortically-coupled computer vision" (C3Vision). C3Vision exploits (1) the ability of the human visual system to get the "gist" of a scene with brief (10's-100's of ms) and rapid serial (10 Hz) image presentations and (2) our ability to decode from the EEG whether, based on the gist, the scene is relevant, informative and/or grabs the user's attention. In this chapter we describe two system architectures for C3Vision that we have developed. The systems are designed to leverage the relative advantages, in both speed and recognition capabilities, of human and computer, with brain signals serving as the medium of communication of the user's intentions and cognitive state.

The method is minimally dependent on subjective decisions. Methods: Ten electroencephalographic (EEG) data matrices were generated by computer, each matrix including real background activity from a normal subject and an array of added simulated spikes. Each spike was a summation of two transients originating from slightly different 'original dipole sources'. The unaveraged EEG matrices were decomposed by ICA, and source estimation was performed by applying RAP-MUSIC to the spatial information defined by the ICA components showing epileptiform activity in their waveform. For comparison, dipoles were also estimated from the same matrices using two existing methods: RAP-MUSIC based on eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrices of averaged spikes and common spatial pattern decomposition. Results: In every simulated EEG data matrix, two dipoles close to the original sources were estimated by the present method. Their unaveraged activities were also similar to those of the original sources. The two existing methods gave less precise results than the proposed method. Conclusions: RAP-MUSIC based on ICA thus proved promising for source estimation of unaveraged epileptiform discharges. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A vast buffer of information is transiently available to be broadcasted which, if not retrieved in time, fades rapidly without reaching consciousness. An interesting feature of this experiment is that objective performance and subjective confidence is decoupled. This converts this paradigm in an ideal vehicle to understand the brain dynamics of the construction of confidence. Here we report a high-density EEG experiment in which we infer elements of the EEG response which are indicative of subjective confidence. We find that an early response during encoding partially correlates with perceived confidence. However, the bulk of the weight of subjective confidence is determined during a late, N400-like waveform, during the retrieval stage. This shows that we can find markers of access to internal, subjective states, that are uncoupled from objective response and stimulus properties of the task, and we propose that this can be used with decoding methods of EEG to infer subjective mental states.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for early detection of AD using only electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings for patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) without any clinical symptoms of the disease who later developed AD. In our method, first a blind source separation algorithm is applied to extract the most significant spatiotemporal uncorrelated components; afterward these components are wavelet transformed; subsequently the wavelets or more generally time frequency representation (TFR) is approximated with sparse bump modeling approach. Finally, reliable and discriminant features are selected and reduced with orthogonal forward regression and the random probe methods. The proposed features were finally fed to a simple neural network classifier. The presented method leads to a substantially improved performance (93% correctly classified - improved sensitivity and specificity) over classification results previously published on the same set of data. We hope that the new computational and machine learning tools provide some new insights in a wide range of clinical settings, both diagnostic and predictive.

Moderate Excitation Leads to Weakening of Perceptual Representations	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						cognition; EEG (electroencephalogram); pattern classification; learning and memory; plasticity	CORRELATED PATTERNS; DECISION-MAKING; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MEMORY; SUPPRESSION; RETRIEVAL; SELECTION; MODEL; TASK	A fundamental goal of memory research is to specify the conditions that lead to the strengthening and weakening of neural representations. Several computational models of memory formation predict that learning effects should vary as a nonmonotonic function of the amount of excitation received by a neural representation. Specifically, moderate excitation should result in synaptic weakening, while strong excitation should result in synaptic strengthening. In vitro investigations of plasticity in rodents have provided support for this prediction at the level of single synapses. However, it remains unclear whether this principle scales beyond the synapse to cortical representations and manifests changes in behavior. To address this question, we used electroencephalogram pattern classification in human subjects to measure trial-by-trial fluctuations in stimulus processing, and we used a negative priming paradigm to measure learning effects. In keeping with the idea that moderate excitation leads to weakening, moderate levels of stimulus processing were associated with negative priming (slower subsequent responding to the stimulus), but higher and lower levels of stimulus processing were not associated with negative priming. These results suggest that the same principles that account for synaptic weakening in rodents can also account for diminished accessibility of perceptual representations in humans.

The algorithm was evaluated in three patients, with prediction defined over a horizon that varies between 1 and 5 minutes before unequivocal electrographic onset of seizure. For one patient, a perfect classification was achieved. For the other two patients, high classification accuracy was reached, predicting three seizures out of four for one, and eleven seizures out of fifteen for the other. For the latter, also, only one normal (non-seizure) signal was misclassified. These results compare favorably with other prediction approaches for patients from the same population.

Electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings during performance of the tasks revealed similar event-related potentials during the presentation of faces at 120 and 170 ms after stimulus onset in both of the tasks but significant differences in amplitudes between 180 and 300 ms. Whereas faces in the emotion recognition task produced high amplitudes in that latency range, potentials in response to faces in the blurred object condition were virtually absent. These data point to the assumption that decoding of facial expressions starts early in the brain and might be processed separately from basic stages of face perception.

The framework is centered around the concept of temporal evolution of regularized Fisher Linear Discriminant classifier constructed from the instantaneous signal value. The value of the regularization parameter is selected to minimize the classifier error estimated by cross-validation. In addition, we build upon the proposed framework to develop a feature selection technique. We demonstrate the framework and the feature selection technique on MEG data recorded from 10 subjects in a simple visual classification experiment. We show that using a very simple adaptive feature selection strategy yields considerable improvement of classifier accuracy over the strategy that uses fixed number of features.

Sixteen of the subjects were AD patients, 24 were mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients while 16 were age-matched controls. With MDA, an overall classification rate (CR) of 84% was obtained for AD vs. MCI vs. Controls classifications. The high CR implies that it is possible to distinguish between the three groups. The coherence features were also statistically analyzed to derive a neural model of AD and MCI, which indicated that patients with AD may have a greater number of damaged cortical fibers than their MCI counterparts, and furthermore, that MCI may be an intermediary step in the development of AD.

Seizures at onset are mainly characterized by partial motor seizures and IS. Subtle partial seizures may be present in the early neonatal period and may precede the onset of IS. Visual recording techniques have led to significant progress in the classification of seizures associated with TSC, demonstrating that they have a focal or multifocal origin in the vast majority of cases. In most cases, an awake interictal EEG shows focal or independent multifocal spike and slow-wave activity at onset and later a pseudo-hypsarrhythmic pattern. Ictal EEG starts with focal spikes originating from the posterotemporal, or occipital regions followed by a generalized irregular slow transient and an abrupt diffuse flattening. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the coexistence of partial seizures and IS are still unclear, IS associated with TSC may be the result of a rapid secondary generalization. The presence of IS due to TSC is strongly predicted by the cortical tuber count, while the age of onset of seizures and the age of occurrence of EEG foci depend on the localization of cortical tubers with an earlier expression of the parietooccipital than of the frontal regions. Early recognition of these distinctive features appears worthwhile for therapeutic and prognostic implications. Despite the efficacy of vigabatrin the prognosis of IS is generally poor. Studies using combined topographic mapping of EEG, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography may provide new strategies for selecting candidates suitable for surgery.

(Neural Comput. 11 (1999) 1983-2003) proposed an adaptive neural coding model that makes spiking neurons adapt its input/output relation to the stimulus statistics. In a surprisingly precise manner, the adaptive neural coding model has been supported by recent experiments. Although the adaptive neural coding model was developed based on the noise shaping neural coding hypothesis, their connection was not explained clearly in the previous report. In this paper, I present how the noise shaping neural coding hypothesis resulted in such a precise model without any available experimental data at that time. Moreover, I extend the previous model by including a biologically plausible adaptive signal decoding process. Finally, I propose the relationship between noise shaping spiking neurons and EEG, which is also supported by experiments published in this issue. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential relationship between age, BIS (Aspect&TRADE;), and the EEG bispectrum during anaesthesia with sevoflurane. Methods. BIS and raw EEG were recorded at a steady state of 1 MAC in 100 children, and during a decrease from 2 to 0.5 MAC in a sub-group of 29 children. The bispectrum of the EEG was estimated using MATLAB(C) software. For analysis, the bispectrum was divided into 36 frequencies of coupling (P-i)-the MatBis. A multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was used to establish an underlying structure of the pattern of each individual's MatBis at 1 MAC. Clustering of children into homogeneous groups was conducted by a hierarchical ascending classification (HAC). The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05. Results. At 1 MAC, the BIS values for all children ranged from 20 to 74 (median 40). Projection of both age and BIS value recorded at 1 MAC onto the structured model of the MCA showed them to be distributed along the same axis, demonstrating that the different values of BIS obtained in younger or older children are mainly dependent on their MatBis. At 1 MAC, six homogeneous groups of children were obtained through the HAC. Groups 5 (30 months; range 23-49) and 6 (18 months; range 6-180) were the younger children and Group 1 (97 months; range 46-162) the older. Groups 5 and 6 had the highest median values of BIS (54; range 50-59) (55; range 26-74) and Group 1 the lowest values (29; range 22-37). Conclusion. The EEG bispectrum, as well as the BIS appeared to be strongly related to the age of children at 1 MAC sevoflurane.

The next goal was to review and compare a large number of measures to find the suitable candidates for the study of steep onset and steep evolution. Methods and material: A huge number of characteristics, including relevant simple measures in time domain, characteristics of distribution, linear spectral, measures, measures of complexity and interdependency measures were computed for polysomnographic recordings of 20 healthy subjects. Summarily, all-night evolutions of 818 measures (73 characteristics for various channels and channel combinations) were analysed and compared with visual scorings of experts (hypnograms). Our tests involved classification of the data into five classes (waking and four steep stages) and 10 classification tasks to distinguish between two specific steep stages. To discover measures of the best decision-making ability, discriminant analysis was done by Fisher quadratic classifier for one-dimensional case. Results and conclusions: The most difficult decision problem, between S1 and REM steep, were best managed by measures computed from etectromyogram led by fractal exponent (classification error 23%). In the simplest task, distinction between wake and deep steep, the power ratio between delta and beta band of electroencephalogram was the most successful measure (classification error 1%). Delta/beta ratio with mean classification error 42.6% was the best single-performing measure also in discrimination between all five stages, However, the error level shows impossibility to satisfactorily separate the five steep stages by a single measure. Use of a few additional characteristics is necessary. Some novel measures, especially fractal. exponent and fractal dimension turned up equally successful or even superior to the conventional scoring methods in discrimination between particular states of sleep. They seem to provide a very promising basis for automatic steep analysis particularly in conjunction with some of the successful spectral standards. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The shared vision in this research area is that one day patients will control a prosthetic device with signals originating directly from their brain. This review provides a new perspective on the brain-computer interface (BCI), by asking instead "How can BCI be used to assist neurologically healthy individuals in specifically demanding tasks?" The limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of noninvasive brain signals suggests that one must tailor the application of BCI to tasks where a small increment in information can make a large difference. High throughput tasks may provide such a scenario, as will be exemplified in this review for one such task: rapid visual target detection. BCI can assist in this task by prioritizing perceived target images. Due to the speeded nature of this and related tasks, it is essential to use fast and effective signal processing. Effective performance is achieved by extracting spatiotemporal discriminant brain activity in high dimensions (typically >64 electrodes distributed across the skull surface, with sampling rates of 1,000 Hz). Fast processing speed is achieved by constraining the methods to linear analysis of these data. In fact, considering the low SNR of scalp electroencephalography (EEG) even linear features require careful regularization. This review summarizes linear spatiotemporal signal analysis methods that derive their power from careful consideration of spatial and temporal features of skull surface potentials.

Brain-Computer Interface Research Comes of Age: Traditional Assumptions Meet Emerging Realities	JOURNAL OF MOTOR BEHAVIOR			English	Article						brain-computer interface; brain-machine interface; EEG; human; neuroprosthesis	MOTOR CORTEX; FRONTAL-LOBE; ORGANIZATION; AREAS	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) could provide important new communication and control options for people with severe motor disabilities. Most BCI research to date has been based on 4 assumptions that: (a) intended actions are fully represented in the cerebral cortex; (b) neuronal action potentials can provide the best picture of an intended action; (c) the best BCI is one that records action potentials and decodes them; and (d) ongoing mutual adaptation by the BCI user and the BCI system is not very important. In reality, none of these assumptions is presently defensible. Intended actions are the products of many areas, from the cortex to the spinal cord, and the contributions of each area change continually as the CNS adapts to optimize performance. BCIs must track and guide these adaptations if they are to achieve and maintain good performance. Furthermore, it is not yet clear which category of brain signals will prove most effective for BCI applications. In human studies to date, low-resolution electroencephalography-based BCIs perform as well as high-resolution cortical neuron-based BCIs. In sum, BCIs allow their users to develop new skills in which the users control brain signals rather than muscles. Thus, the central task of BCI research is to determine which brain signals users can best control, to maximize that control, and to translate it accurately and reliably into actions that accomplish the users' intentions.

Online and offline implementation of time-frequency template matching method for classifying motor imagery in brain computer interface	2007 JOINT MEETING OF THE 6TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON NONINVASIVE FUNCTIONAL SOURCE IMAGING OF THE BRAIN AND HEART AND THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUNCTIONAL BIOMEDICAL IMAGING			English	Proceedings Paper	Joint Meeting of the 6th Symposium on Noninvasive Functional Source Imaging of the Brain and Heart/International Conference on Functional Biomedical Imaging	OCT 12-14, 2007	Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE			CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION	The Purpose of this study was to develop and online evaluate an effective feature-extraction method for distinguishing signal patterns of scalp EEG during imageries of left and right hand movements, Time-frequency template based on Morlet wavelet decomposition and event-related (de)synchronization patterns was extracted from two electrodes. The template matching index was calculated based on correlation coefficient with the template, which was further classified by linear discriminant analysis classifier to distinguish the imagined movements, The 9-subject left/right motor imagery data from NIPS2001 (Neural Information Processing System) competition were used to test the algorithm offline. The tenfold cross-validation averaged accuracy was 79.3%, better than previously reported accuracy. A pilot experiment was subsequently Performed online on four subjects. Three of the four subjects achieved an accuracy of more than 70% at the end of the 15-minute training session.

The original concept of vigilance as phenomenon observed only under conditions of monotony and signal regularity is increasingly falling into disfavor, embracing at present a much broader spectrum of behaviour: Currently, vigilance may be regarded as a "readiness to adopt the appropriate behavior in a given situation, which thus finds outward expression through the quality and quantity of the behavior occuring in response to a given (internal or external) stimulus situation". The assuption that vigilance is a multifactorial phenomenon and not merely EEG data should be taken into account in order to study it accurately. Specifically, in drug research, apart from subjective reports and psychomoter performance tests, neurophysiological evaluations are regularly used such as Multiple Sleep Latency Test, Vigilance Epoch Classification or Parameters within a continuous scale. Although with limitations, temporal patterns of changes in activity of different frequency bands, indexes as the alpha slow-wave or the alpha anteriorization, computated from the EEG quantification, yielded different definitions of the intermediate states of the transition from sakefulness to sleep through the so-calledd subvigil stages. Spatial patterns are less documented. The recently proposed mathematical models to explain and predict variations in alertness are presented. Examples of the effects of different classes of drugs with the methods reported and its theoretical and practical relevance to vigilance research are introduced. (C) 2002 Prous Science.

J	Sun, MG; Sclabassi, RJ				Sun, MG; Sclabassi, RJ			The forward EEG solutions can be computed using artificial neural networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						artificial neural network; efficient algorithm; efficient computation; EEG; electrostatic theory; forward problem; head geometry; head model; machine learning; partial differential equation; signal processing; source localization	VOLUME CONDUCTOR; HUMAN BRAIN; HEAD; LOCALIZATION; MODELS	Study of electroencenphalogarphy (EEG) is the one of the most utilized methods in both basic brain research and clinical diagnosis of neurological disorders. Recent technological advances in computer and electronic systems have allowed the EEG to be recorded from large electrode arrays. Modeling the brain waves using a head volume conductor model provides an effective method to localize functional generators within the brain. However, the forward solutions to this model, which represent theoretical potentials in response to current sources within the volume conductor, are difficult to compute because of time-consuming numerical procedures utilized in either the boundary element method (BEM) or the finite element method (FEM), This paper presents a novel computational approach using an artificial neural network (ANN) to map two vectors of forward solutions. These two vectors correspond to different head models but with respect to the same current source, The input vector to the ANN is based on the spherical head model, which can be computed efficiently but involves large errors. The output vector from the ANN is based on the spheroidal model, which is more precise, but difficult to compute directly using the traditional means, Our experiments indicate that this ANN approach provides a remarkable improvement over the BEM and FEM methods: 1) the mean-square error of computation was only approximately 0.3% compared to the exact solution; 2) the online computation was extremely efficient, requiring only 168 floating point operations per channel to compute the forward solution, and 10.2 K-bytes of storage to represent the entire ANN, Using this approach it is possible to perform real-time EEG modeling accurately on personal computers.

Methods: Consecutive patients with IGE, defined as generalised seizures with spike or polyspike and wave on EEG, were studied in the setting of a first seizure clinic where an early postictal EEG record is part of the protocol. Patients were divided into two groups: "classical IGE" with onset before 20 years and inclusive of all the IGE subsyndromes recognised by the international classification; and. adult onset IGE", when seizure onset was at age 20 years or later. Seizure patterns, clinical features, and genetics of the adult onset group were examined. Results: Of 121 patients with an electro-clinical diagnosis of IGE, 34 (28%) were diagnosed as adult onset IGE. The seizure patterns in these 34 cases were tonic-clonic seizures + absences (3), tonic-clonic seizures + myoclonus (6), and tonic-clonic seizures alone (25). Tonic-clonic seizures were often precipitated by alcohol or sleep deprivation. The proportion of affected first and second degree relatives did not differ between the classical and adult onset IGE groups. Twenty adult onset cases were treated with sodium valproate, four with other antiepileptic drugs, and 10 were untreated. Follow up of 32 of the 34 cases (for 3 1 (22) months (mean (SD)) showed that tonic-clonic seizures recurred in eight patients: five with identified provocative factors and three without. Conclusions: Adult onset IGE is a relatively frequent and benign disorder. Seizures are usually provoked and are easy to control. Patients in this age group may often be misdiagnosed as having nonlesional partial epilepsy. Early postictal EEG and sleep deprivation studies may improve the detection of these patients. Pedigree analysis suggests that adult onset IGE, like classical IGE, has a genetic aetiology.

J	Ratcliff, R; Philiastides, MG; Sajda, P				Ratcliff, Roger; Philiastides, Marios G.; Sajda, Paul			Quality of evidence for perceptual decision making is indexed by trial-to-trial variability of the EEG	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						diffusion-model; single-trial; neuroimaging; machine learning; visual discrimination	DIFFUSION-MODEL; REACTION-TIME	A fundamental feature of how we make decisions is that our responses are variable in the choices we make and the time it takes to make them. This makes it impossible to determine, for a single trial of an experiment, the quality of the evidence on which a decision is based. Even for stimuli from a single experimental condition, it is likely that stimulus and encoding differences lead to differences in the quality of evidence. In the research reported here, with a simple "face''/"car'' perceptual discrimination task, we obtained late (decision-related) and early (stimulus-related) single-trial EEG component amplitudes that discriminated between faces and cars within and across conditions. We used the values of these amplitudes to sort the response time and choice within each experimental condition into more-face-like and less-face-like groups and then fit the diffusion model for simple decision making (a well-established model in cognitive psychology) to the data in each group separately. The results show that dividing the data on a trial-by-trial basis by using the late-component amplitude produces differences in the estimates of evidence used in the decision process. However, dividing the data on the basis of the early EEG component amplitude or the times of the peak amplitudes of either component did not index the information used in the decision process. The results we present show that a single-trial EEG neurophysiological measure for nominally identical stimuli can be used to sort behavioral response times and choices into those that index the quality of decision-relevant evidence.

An Efficient Model to Decipher the Electroencephalogram Signals Using Machine Learning Approach	4TH KUALA LUMPUR INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING 2008, VOLS 1 AND 2	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th Kuala Lumpur International Conference on Biomedical Engineering	JUN 25-28, 2008	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA			Wavelet; Neural Network; Biomedical; EEG	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE	The objective of this paper is to develop a powered Room Automation and Robot control based on Electro encephalogram signals (EEG) for users with high-level spinal cord injury. A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) provides a new non-muscular channel for sending messages and commands to the external world. This BCI was designed with two Operational Modes (OM): Training with Feedback OM and Execute OM. Our project emphasized on design to implementation of Execute OM in BCI. The main functionality of a Execute OM is described as follows: it receives EEG data taken from the user, interprets and classifies it as a Mental Activity Task defined in a previous Training Phase and finally executes a specific action using a rendering component, in this case the one dimensional(1D) platform. This classification can be achieved using a classification technique known as Wavelet feature Extraction followed by Neural Network. The development of this 1D platform is also part of this paper, such platform uses a Graphical user interface (GUI) developed in Visual Basic (VB). Its task is to receive the Mental Activity Task output from MATLAB and execute a predetermined action such as 1D movement of cursor. Additionally hardware is integrated for room automation and robotic control which can be controlled by Offline EEG data taken from the user. In the Training with Feedback OM shows visual clues to the user, treats the input data and shows a visual feedback to the user. The body of paper starts with a brief introduction to the BCI system architecture, its implementation using MATLAB followed with the experimental results of the system and ends with conclusion.

Usually, no neurophysiological knowledge is used within the classification algorithms. Here, a method is proposed that includes prior knowledge about the locations of sources of imagined movement of the left and the right hand by projecting EEG/MEG data onto a subspace defined by modeled sources at the corresponding locations in somatosensory areas. Three different source models are investigated. First, one radial dipole on each side is based on the assumption that both location and orientation are known. Hence, for two sides, a 2 subspace is selected. Second, three dipoles at each location span a 6-dimensional subspace assuming known locations but uncertain orientations. Third, we modeled the sources as multipoles up to quadrupolar order resulting in a 16-dimensional subspace. The multipole expansion systematically corrects for inaccuracies both in location and exact shape of the source. After the projection onto respective topographies, feature extraction is performed on the reduced data by Common Spatial Filter (CSP) analysis. Finally, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is applied for classification. The projection of the data leads to a reduction of the dimensionality of the signal focusing on those parts of the signal which are generated or suppressed in the motor cortex during imagined hand movement. Since EEG/MEG data are strongly affected by various types of artifacts hampering the classification the proposed procedure leads to a removal of parts of the signal and therefore a reduction of artifacts. For EEG data it is shown that a projection with respect to source locations prior to CSP analysis leads to a gain of BCI performance when the sources are modeled as multipoles.

Toward a hybrid brain-computer interface based on imagined movement and visual attention	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							OPTIMAL ELECTRODE POSITIONS; EEG; COMMUNICATION; TECHNOLOGY; SEARCH; BCI; CLASSIFICATION; PATIENT; IMAGERY; PEOPLE	Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems do not work for all users. This article introduces a novel combination of tasks that could inspire BCI systems that are more accurate than conventional BCIs, especially for users who cannot attain accuracy adequate for effective communication. Subjects performed tasks typically used in two BCI approaches, namely event-related desynchronization (ERD) and steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), both individually and in a 'hybrid' condition that combines both tasks. Electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded across three conditions. Subjects imagined moving the left or right hand (ERD), focused on one of the two oscillating visual stimuli (SSVEP), and then simultaneously performed both tasks. Accuracy and subjective measures were assessed. Offline analyses suggested that half of the subjects did not produce brain patterns that could be accurately discriminated in response to at least one of the two tasks. If these subjects produced comparable EEG patterns when trying to use a BCI, these subjects would not be able to communicate effectively because the BCI would make too many errors. Results also showed that switching to a different task used in BCIs could improve accuracy in some of these users. Switching to a hybrid approach eliminated this problem completely, and subjects generally did not consider the hybrid condition more difficult. Results validate this hybrid approach and suggest that subjects who cannot use a BCI should consider switching to a different BCI approach, especially a hybrid BCI. Subjects proficient with both approaches might combine them to increase information throughput by improving accuracy, reducing selection time, and/or increasing the number of possible commands.

Methods: Twenty-three patients were identified by criteria for drug-resistant HMS. Surgical treatment and presurgical evaluation modalities including semiology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), interictal/ictal scalp video-EEG (electroencephalography), and intracranial recording were analyzed retrospectively. Results: The common seizure frequency of 60-300 per month was observed among 15 patients. Sixteen patients (69.6%) experienced auras such as fear and palpitation. Marked agitation was observed in 12 patients and mild agitation in 11 patients. Groaning/shouting and asymmetric posturing were common accompanying symptoms. Asymmetric posturing was observed more often in patients with mild agitation than in those with marked agitation (p = 0.027). MRI detected focal abnormalities in six patients. Intracranial recording was conducted in 16 patients. The origins of seizures were localized in mesial frontal cortex in four patients, dorsolateral frontal cortex in four patients, and mesial temporal cortex in two patients. The epileptogenic zones (EZs) were resected from the frontal lobe in 21 patients and from the temporal lobe in 2 patients. The follow-up ranged from 12-60 months. Seventeen patients (73.9%) had been seizure-free, 11 of whom had presented with marked agitation (11 of 12) and 6 with mild agitation (6 of 11) (p = 0.069). Histologic examinations demonstrated focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) in 18 patients. Discussion: The HMSs can originate from both the mesial and dorsolateral frontal cortex, and occasionally from the temporal lobe. Patients with drug-resistant HMSs should be recommended for resective surgical treatment.

To improve applicability of fully automated sleep staging, we have designed a formal classification framework to rigorously (1) select robust candidate features, (2) emulate artificial neural network classifiers, and (3) assign sleep wake stages using flexible decision rules. An extensive database of 48 PSG records scored in 20 s epochs by two independent clinicians was used. A small subset of 2 s elementary epochs representative of each stages with unequivocal expert scores was selected to form a limited set of learning exemplars. From 16 statistical, spectral and non-linear candidate features extracted in 2 s epochs from EEG and EMG signals, a sequential forward search selected an optimal set of five features with a 22% error rate. Multiple layer perceptrons were trained from this optimal feature set while classification accuracy was assessed using the unequivocal instance subset. A simple majority vote among 10 consecutive classifier outputs ensured a final scoring resolution comparable to that of the experts. Poor classification performance was obtained for movement time, wakefulness, and intermediate sleep stages with a 36 +/- 15% error rate (Cohen's kappa 0.48 +/- 0.18). In contrast, deep and paradoxical sleep was classified with an 82% accuracy not far from inter-expert expert agreement (83 +/- 3%). Significant improvements should be expected using a larger learning set compensating for a high inter-individual variability, and decision rules incorporating more domain-knowledge.

Reducing the number of sensors allows reducing the time required for the installation of sensors and therefore increases user's comfort. The proposed approach is based on a recursive elimination where the cost function is based on the signal to signal plus noise ratio (SSNR), after spatial filtering. We show that this cost function is more robust and less costly in computing time than other functions based on evaluation of the detection of P300 or targets, thus avoiding a step of classification. We also propose a decision function to better categorize the importance of a sensor based on the number of desired sensors. The proposed approach is tested and validated on 20 subjects over several sessions.

The programs are capable of detecting and classifying the spikes from multiple, simultaneously active neurons, even in situations where there is a high degree of spike waveform superposition on the recording channels. Sparse Decomposition (SD) approach was used to define the linearly independent signals underlying sensory information in cortical spike tiring patterns. We have investigated motor cortex responses recorded during movement in freely moving rats to provide evidence for the relationship between these patterns and special behavioral task. Ensembles of neurons were simultaneously recorded in this during long periods of spontaneous behaviour. Waveforms provided from the neural activity were then processed and classified. Typically, most information correlated across neurons in the ensemble were concentrated in a small number of signals. This showed that these encoding vectors functioned as a feature detector capable of selectively predicting significant sensory or behavioural events. Thus it encoded global magnitude of ensemble activity, caused either by combined sensory inputs or intrinsic network activity. SD on an overcomplete dictionary has recently attracted a lot of attention in the literature. because of its potential application in many different areas including Compressive Sensing (CS). SD approach is compared to the generative approach derived from the likelihood-based framework, in which each class is modeled by a known or unknown density function. The classification of electroencephalographic (EEG) waveforms present 2 main statistical issues: high dimensional data and signal representation.

Electroencephalographic (EEG), electrooculographic (EOG), and electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded while ten healthy subjects imagined right-sided isometric ankle plantar-flexion tasks at moderate [from 0% to 60% of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) in 4 s] and ballistic (from 0% to 60% MVC as fast as possible) RTDs. The EEG signals were classified using feature extraction based on the marginal distribution of a discrete wavelet transform with optimization of the mother wavelet. The classifier was based on support vector machines (SVMs). Minimum misclassification rate for the best case was 8.3%. Average minimum misclassification rate over the ten subjects was (17.4 +/- 8.4)%. The two RTDs could be best differentiated from channel C4 on average. In conclusion, different RTDs could be differentiated in imaginary isometric plantar-flexion by only using cortical potentials recorded with surface EEG. This result constitutes the first step for the development of a new type of brain-computer interfaces that rely on kinetic parameters of a single limb rather than movements of opposite limbs.

We extend the method joint approximate diagonalization (JAD) for spatial filtering using a maximum likelihood framework. This generic formulation: 1) bridges the gap between the common spatial patterns (CSPs) and blind source separation of nonstationary sources; and 2) leads to a neurophysiologically adapted version of JAD, accounting for the successive activations/deactivations of brain sources during motor imagery (MI) trials. Using dataset 2a of BCI Competition IV (2008) in which nine subjects were involved in a four-class two-session MI-based BCI experiment, a quantitative evaluation of our extension is provided by comparing its performance against JAD and CSP in the case of cross-validation, as well as session-to-session transfer. While JAD, as already proposed in other works, does not prove to be significantly better than classical one-versus-rest CSP, our extension is shown to perform significantly better than CSP for cross-validated and session-to-session performance. The extension of JAD introduced in this paper yields among the best session-to-session transfer results presented so far for this particular dataset; thus, it appears to be of great interest for real-life BCIs.

Moreover, recent basic research findings in biological olfaction combined with computational neuroscience promote its development both in methodology and application. In this review, the basic information processing principle of biological olfaction and artificial olfaction are summarized and compared, and four olfactory models and their applications to electronic noses are presented. Finally, a chaotic olfactory neural network is detailed and the utilization of several biologically oriented learning rules and its spatiotemporal dynamic propties for electronic noses are discussed. The integration of various phenomena and their mechanisms for biological olfaction into an electronic nose context for information processing will not only make them more bionic, but also perform better than conventional methods. However, many problems still remain, which should be solved by further cooperation between theorists and engineers.

Quantitative analysis of EMG signals provides an important source of information for the diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders. Following the recent development of computer-aided EMG equipment, different methodologies in the time domain and frequency domain have been followed for quantitative analysis. In this study, feedforward error backpropagation artificial neural networks (FEBANN) and wavelet neural networks (WNN) based classifiers were developed and compared in relation to their accuracy in classification of EMG signals. In these methods, we used an autoregressive (AR) model of EMG signals as an input to classification system. A total of 1200 MUPs obtained from 7 normal subjects, 7 subjects suffering from myopathy and 13 subjects suffering from neurogenic disease were analyzed. The success rate for the WNN technique was 90.7% and for the FEBANN technique 88%. The comparisons between the developed classifiers were primarily based on a number of scalar performance measures pertaining to the classification. The WNN-based classifier outperformed the FEBANN counterpart. The proposed WNN classification may support expert decisions and add weight to EMG differential diagnosis. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

One of the biggest challenges in BCI research is to understand and solve the problem of "BCI Illiteracy", which is that BCI control does not work for a non-negligible portion of users (estimated 15 to 30%). Here, we investigate the illiteracy problem in BCI systems which are based on the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms. In this paper, a sophisticated adaptation scheme is presented which guides the user from an initial subject-independent classifier that operates on simple features to a subject-optimized state-of-the-art classifier within one session while the user interacts the whole time with the same feedback application. While initial runs use supervised adaptation methods for robust co-adaptive learning of user and machine, final runs use unsupervised adaptation and therefore provide an unbiased measure of BCI performance. Using this approach, which does not involve any offline calibration measurement, good performance was obtained by good BCI participants (also one novice) after 3-6 min of adaptation. More importantly, the use of machine learning techniques allowed users who were unable to achieve successful feedback before to gain significant control over the BCI system. In particular, one participant had no peak of the sensory motor idle rhythm in the beginning of the experiment, but could develop such peak during the course of the session (and use voluntary modulation of its amplitude to control the feedback application).

Five-minute QEEG data were obtained from 90 normal controls (NCs) and 66 children with ASD. Spectrum analyses revealed that ASD children showed significantly less relative alpha and more relative delta than NC. Specifically, 26% of ASD children and 2% of NCs showed 1.5 SDs of relative alpha below the normative mean.

In this study, a biomedical system based on Discrete Hidden Markov Model (DHMM) has been developed in order to classify the internal carotid artery Doppler signals recorded from 191 subjects (136 of them had suffered from internal carotid artery stenosis and rest of them had been healthy subjects). Developed system comprises of three stages. In the first stage, for feature extraction, obtained Doppler signals were separated to its sub-bands using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). In the second stage, entropy of each sub-band was calculated using Shannon entropy algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors via DWT. In the third stage, the reduced features of carotid artery Doppler signals were used as input patterns of the DHMM classifier. Our proposed method reached 97.38% classification accuracy with 5 fold cross validation (CV) technique. The classification results showed that purposed method is effective for classification of internal carotid artery Doppler signals.

In this paper, several modifications are proposed to improve the recognition accuracy. In the method, gamma band spectral power (GBSP) features were computed from the visual evoked potential (VEP) signals recorded from 61 electrodes while subjects perceived a picture. Two methods were used to improve the classification rate. First, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the noise and background electroencephalogram (EEG) effects from the VEP signals. Second, the GBSP of each channel was normalized by the total GBSP from all the channels. Three classifiers were used: simplified fuzzy ARTMAP (SFA), linear discriminant (LD) and k-nearest neighbor (kNN). The experimental results using 800 VEP signals from 20 subjects with leave-one-out cross-validation strategy showed that PCA improves the classification performance for all the classifiers with normalization giving improved results in certain cases. The best classification performance of 96.50% obtained using the improved method shows that brain signals have suitable biometric properties that could be further exploited. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Epileptiform phenomena occurred on at least one EEG in 42 (91%) patients. Twenty-three (50%) of the 46 patients displayed at least one type of independently occurring abnormality (spikes, excess delta, or theta) in each hemisphere. Nineteen of these 23 (83%), thus 41% of all 46 patients, showed independently occurring epileptiform abnormalities (spikes) in each hemisphere, i.e., the multiple independent spike foci phenomenon. In an additional 13 of the 46 (28%) patients, spike foci involving more than one lobe appeared within a single hemisphere. Thus, spike foci involving more than one lobe appeared in 32 of the 46 (70%) patients. Generalized bilaterally synchronous epileptiform features (spike waves, slow spike waves, or fast rhythmic waves) appeared in 10 (22%) of the 46 patients. Two findings suggest more widespread dysfunction among extratemporal patients than temporal patients: (1) a significantly higher number of lobes containing focal interictal epileptiform activity in extra temporal patients (mean = 3.14) than among temporal patients (mean = 2.14) (P = 0.02), (2) a higher percentage of bisynchronous epileptiform abnormalities: 8 of 23 (35%) versus 2 of 23 (9%). Among 34 patients with a Principal Spike Lobe (more active spiking over more EEGs), those of 32 (94%) arose from the ultimately resected lobe. Of the 30 patients with scalp-recorded seizures, relationship between seizure origin and ultimately resected lobe were same lobe (16 patients), same and adjacent lobes (12), adjacent lobe only (1), and distant lobe (1). Thus, despite the multifocality of several EEG features, Principal Spike Lobe and scalp-recorded seizure origin correlate well with epileptogenesis.

Hippocampal electroencephalographic (HPC) and nuchal electromyographic signals were recorded by a digital polygraph. The HPC channel was filtered off-line to obtain the original plus theta and delta waves. Statistics of each of these four channels were obtained every 5 s and exported to a standard spreadsheet. The automated staging consisted of five steps: (1) automatic detection of waking, nonrapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep patterns (5-s periods); (2) calculation of statistics for each vigilance state; (3) final classification of 5-s periods; (4) construction of a primary 20-s epoch hypnogram; and (5) automatic refinement of the previous hypnogram. The system includes indices about the accuracy of the staging and was validated with five recordings of 23 h each. The global agreement between human and automatic scoring in the validation recordings was 94.32%. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There are, however, also important phase related changes in the brain signals associated with ERD/ERS which we investigate here. We quantify for the first time the "delta-phase" component of the Complex Band Power (CBP) features introduced in [G. Townsend, B. Graimann, G. Pfurtscheller, A comparison of common spatial patterns with complex band power features in a four-class BCI Experiment, IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 53 (2006) 642-651] and [G. Townsend, Brain Computer Interfaces: Phase Features and Post Processing Issues, Ph.D. Thesis, 2006, p. 97]. Although this component, which makes explicit use of phase, is known from these earlier studies to provide improved classification results in a brain-computer interface (BCI), this phenomenon has never been investigated purely in the context of a physiological phenomenon. The importance of this study is to fill this gap in our knowledge by providing an analysis and quantification of this new feature so that an improved understanding of its nature will allow further exploitation of this feature to further improve BCI systems. Given that the primary use of BCIs is as an assistive technology for the disabled, the importance of this work to society cannot be overstated. Changes in band power in the context of ERD/ERS have been investigated in the past using a visualization tool called an ERD/ERS map [B. Graimann, Movement-Related Patterns in ECoG and EEG: Visualization and Detection, Ph.D. Thesis, 2003, p. 107]. We present and discuss here for the first time, an equivalent tool called the delta-phase map used to visualize the occurrence of delta-phase in different frequency bands and over the time courses of motor imagery trials. In this study, the delta-phase feature is shown to be proportional to frequency and is quantified and presented in that context for clarity. It was found that the most prominent ERD activity occurring in the frequency bands studied here are correlated to the activity captured in the delta-phase maps. The underlying nature of ERD/ERS is explored based on evidence provided by the delta-phase feature. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Angelman syndrome (AS) is a heterogeneous genetically-based disorder that is characterised by severe mental retardation, absence of language, ataxia, craniofacial dysmorphia and a characteristic behavioural phenotype. Patients and methods. We analyse 12 patients with a mean age of 10.9 years diagnosed with AS. The study focuses on the characteristics of epilepsy and attempts to correlate the findings with the genotype of the disease. Results. All the patients presented early-onset generalised seizures and all except one had polymorphic seizures. Eight of them also presented focal seizures. All the patients displayed electroencephalographic alterations before the age of two years. Although there are no pathognomonic abnormalities in the electroencephalogram (EEG), knowledge of them in AS can be an important element of assessment for reaching an early diagnosis of this condition. In our series, all the patients with 15q11-13 deletion presented and EEG pattern that was typical of the disease. The most commonly used and most effective antiepileptic drug was valproic acid (used in all patients), followed by lamotrigine and clobazam. Up to 10 antiepileptic drugs had been tried in some patients. Epilepsy usually has a very early onset and even precedes the diagnosis of AS in most cases, which means that the epileptic seizures can be an important aid in reaching an early diagnosis. Suitable classification of such seizures is essential. Conclusions: As must be considered as a different diagnosis in children who present early severe epilepsy together with psychomotor retardation and important gait and language disorders. This diagnosis is backed by the typical findings in the EEG.	[Munoz-Cabello, B.; Rufo-Campos, M.; Madruga-Garrido, M.; Blanco-Martinez, B.; Portal, L. Ruiz-Del; Fernandez-Mensaque, R.

Such an algorithm is vital for the realization of brain-computer interface. Methods: The target algorithm developed in this study was based on the wavelet decomposition neural network (WDNN). Surface Laplacian EEG was recorded at central cortical areas and processed with wavelet decomposition (WD) for feature extraction and neural network for pattern recognition. The new algorithm was compared with nother three methods, namely, threshold-based WD and short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and Fourier transform neural network (FTNN), for performance. The trainings of all algorithms were based, respectively, on the changes of p and P rhythms before and after voluntary movements. In order to investigate whether WDNN could adapt to the nonstationarity of EEG or not, we also compared two training modes, namely, fixed and updated weight. The significances of the success rates were tested by ANOVA (analysis of variance) and verified by ROC (receiver operating characteristic) analysis. Results: The experimental data showed that (1) success rates of movement detection were acceptable even when the training set was reduced to a single trial data, (2) WDNN performed better than WD or STFT without optimized thresholds and (3) when weights were updated and thresholds were optimized, WDNN still performed better than WD, while FTNN had a marginal advantage over STFT. Conclusions: We developed a detection algorithm based on WDNN with the training set being reduced to a single trial data. The overall performance of this algorithm was better than the conventional methods as such. Significance: V wave suppression could be detected more precisely by the wavelet decomposition with neural network than the conventional algorithms such as STFT and WE). The size of training data could be reduced to a single trial and the success rates were up to 75-80%. (c) 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The MRD was produced in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex by means of a movement of the right hand. Thirteen volunteers took part in the experiments. They were all right-handed and had ages between 22 and 37 years old. The volunteers were asked to do one of two tasks: (a) just one movement by trial; (b) repetition of movements. The EEG signal was taken in the scalp near to C3 lead. The signal was amplified, sampled and digitally filtered off-line. The time response of the mu band was computed with the FFT. Windows of the time response was used as predicates in the training and testing of a neural network classifier. Representative samples of MRD and background activity was taken for each class. The neural networks used were LVQ and they were trained by session, by task and by volunteer. The performance was measured by the geometric mean of the sensibility and specificity indexes, calculated for every training epoch over test data. The best detection performance was 88% for the single movement task and 78% for repetition of movements, with an average of 66% for both tasks. For the LVQ, only 3 subclasses for every class were sufficient, and a constant learning rate of 0.01 with the number of training epochs calculated by the relation of 250 x (total number of subclasses) was enough to get the best results.

The bottleneck in retrieving these often precious datasets is the onboard data storing capability and the communication bandwidth, which limit the amount of data that can be sent back to Earth. In this paper, we propose a method based on the analysis of brain electrical activity to identify the scientific interest of experts towards a given image in a large set of images. Such a method can be used to efficiently create an abundant training set (images and whether they are scientifically interesting) with a considerably faster image presentation rate that can go beyond expert consciousness, with less interrogation time for experts and relatively high performance.

Study design A retrospective analysis of a hospital based prevalence cohort. Methods The cohort consisted of 163 patients (104 females, 59 males) treated at the Universitatsklinik fur Neurologie, Innsbruck between 1970 and 1997. All had absences according to the ILAE classification. Follow up was in 1999 to 2000. We assessed multiple clinical and EEG factors as predictors of outcome and compared a classification according to the predominant pattern of seizure recurrence (pyknoleptic, PA or non pyknoleptic absence, NPA) with the ILAE classification with respect to prognosis. Results The mean age at seizure onset was 10.9 years (range, 3 to 27); age at follow up was 36.7 years (range, 13 to 81); duration of follow up was 25.8 years (range, 3 to 69). Sixty four patients (39%) had CAE and 64 (39%) JAE, while 35 (22%) had typical absences but could not be clearly defined as either CAE or JAE, and were therefore called "the overlap group". Patients with JAE or patients in the overlap group developed more often generalized tonic clonic seizures (GTCS) (p<0.001) and myoclonic attacks (p<0.05) during the course of the disease. At follow up 36 (56%) of patients with CAE, 40 (62%) with JAE and 19 (54%) of the overlap group were seizure free for at least two years (p=ns). When classified according to the predominant absence pattern at seizure onset 42 (51%) patients with PA and 53 (65%) with NPA were in remission (p=ns). In a stepwise binary logistic regression analysis the pattern of absence (PA or NPA) together with the later development of additional seizure types (myoclonias or GTCS), but not the CAE/JAE classification was predictive for long term lack of remission with a correct prediction of 66% of all patients. Conclusion Only 58% of patients with absences were in remission after a long term follow up. CAE and JAE are closely related syndromes with large overlap of the age of onset. A classification according to the predominant seizure pattern at onset, together with later development of myoclonic attacks or GTCS is useful in predicting seizure remission in absence epilepsies.

A self-paced BCI requires continuous analysis of the continuing brain activity, however, not only the intentional-ontrol (IC) states have to be detected (e.g., motor imagery and imagination) but also the inactive periods, where the user is in a non-control state (NC). The nonstationary nature of the brain signals provides a rather unstable input resulting in uncertainty and complexity in the control. Intelligent processing algorithms adapted to the task at hand are a prerequisite for reliable self-paced BCI applications. This work presents a novel intelligent processing strategy for the realization of an effective self-paced BCI which has the capability to reduce noise as well as adaptation to continuous online biasing. A Savitzki-Golay filter has been applied to remove spikes/outliers while preserving the feature set structure. An anti-bias system is introduced which readjusts the classification output based on the brain's current and previous states. Furthermore, a multiple threshold algorithm is applied on the resultant unbiased classifier output for improved accuracy. These algorithms are tested on 4 real and 3 artificial datasets and results shown are considerably promising and demonstrate the significance of the proposed intelligent and adaptive algorithms.

An effective BCI system should be adaptive to and robust against the dynamic variations in brain signals. One solution to it is to adapt the model parameters of BCI system online. However, CSP is poor at adaptability since it is a batch type algorithm. To overcome this, in this paper, we propose the Incremental Common Spatial Pattern (ICSP) algorithm which performs the adaptive feature extraction on-line. This method allows us to perform the online adjustment of spatial filter. This procedure helps the BCI system robust to possible non-stationarity of the EEG data. We test our method to data from BCI motor imagery experiments, and the results demonstrate the good performance of adaptation of the proposed algorithm.

Features are used to represent patterns with the goal of minimizing the loss of important information. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) as a feature extraction method was used in representing the spike-wave discharges (SWDs) records of Wistar Albino Glaxo/Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats. The SWD records of WAG/Rij rats were decomposed into time-frequency representations using the DWT and the statistical features were calculated to depict their distribution. The obtained wavelet coefficients were used to identify characteristics of the signal that were not apparent from the original time domain signal. The present study demonstrates that the wavelet coefficients are useful in determining the dynamics in the time-frequency domain of SWD records. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The 4 stimulus conditions were (1 and 2) supraliminal acquaintance name primed by subliminal acquaintance name (A-A) versus subliminal nonacquaintance name (N-A) and (3 and 4) supraliminal nonacquaintance name primed by subliminal acquaintance name (A-N) versus subliminal nonacquaintance name (N-N). In Experiment 1 and replication, principal components analysis-derived event-related potential components revealed significant differences between dishonestly answered supraliminal acquaintance conditions with differing primes (A-A vs. N-A). In Experiment 2 subjects were required to lie in A-N and N-N conditions, in contrast to Experiment 1, in which subjects lied in A-A and N-A conditions. No significant effects were found. In Experiment 3, the lying task was removed and no significant differences were found. We conclude that subliminal primes modulate ERPs in conditions with supraliminal acquaintance name when the task involves lying.

By using that signal to, e.g., control a wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis, a BCI could become a valuable tool for paralyzed patients. One approach to implement a BCI is to let users learn to self-control the amplitude of some of their brain rhythms as extracted from multichannel electroencephalogram. We present a method that estimates subject-specific spatial filters which allow for a robust extraction of the rhythm modulations. The effectiveness of the method was proved by achieving the minimum prediction error on data set IIa in the BCI Competition 2003, which consisted of data from three subjects recorded in ten sessions.

Pattern recognition of sleep in rodents using piezoelectric signals generated by gross body movements	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						activity; automated; behavior; classification; instrumentation; mice; noninvasive; respiration; wake	INFANTS; STATES	Current research on sleep using experimental animals is limited by the expense and time-consuming nature of traditional EEG/EMG recordings. We present here an alternative, noninvasive approach utilizing piezoelectric films configured as highly sensitive motion detectors. These film strips attached to the floor of the rodent cage produce an electrical output in direct proportion to the distortion of the material. During sleep, movement associated with breathing is the predominant gross body movement and, thus, output from the piezoelectric transducer provided an accurate respiratory trace during sleep. During wake, respiratory movements are masked by other motor activities. An automatic pattern recognition system was developed to identify periods of sleep and wake using the piezoelectric generated signal. Due to the complex and highly variable waveforms that result from subtle postural adjustments in the animals, traditional signal analysis techniques were not sufficient for accurate classification of sleep versus wake. Therefore, a novel pattern recognition algorithm was developed that successfully distinguished sleep from wake in approximately 95% of all epochs. This algorithm may have general utility for a variety of signals in biomedical and engineering applications. This automated system for monitoring sleep is noninvasive, inexpensive, and may be useful for large-scale sleep studies including genetic approaches towards understanding sleep and sleep disorders, and the rapid screening of the efficacy of sleep or wake promoting drugs.

BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Cyclic alternating pattern (CAP); Sleep quality; First-night effect	EEG POWER-DENSITY; CAP; POLYSOMNOGRAPHY; ADAPTATION; INSTRUMENT	Objective: Cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) is defined as periodic EEG activity during NREM sleep that reflects unstable sleep and represents a marker of instability of the sleep process. The aim of the present investigation was to analyze sleep quality of 28 healthy subjects (mean age 53.3 +/- 21.3 years) over two consecutive nights and determine potential differences between them ("first-night effect"). Methods: Evaluations comprised objective and subjective sleep variables as well as macrostructural and microstructural variables of sleep. Results: Macrostructural analysis showed significant differences between the first and the second sleep laboratory night in REM latency (122.39 +/- 60.46 min vs. 95.43 +/- 36.60 min; T = 3.431; p = 0.002) and the amount of sleep stage 1 (42.60 +/- 21.80 min vs. 39.70 +/- 18.95 min; T = 2.223; p = 0.035). Microstructural analysis revealed a significant decrease in the CAP rate (1st night: 33.29%; 2nd night: 26.34%; T = 3.288; p = 0.003) and in the amount of subtype A2 (74.79 +/- 43.47 vs. 58.50 +/- 23.22; T = 2.185; p = 0.038). Subjective variables also demonstrated a significant increase of drive (T = 2.564: p = 0.016). Conclusion: Healthy subjects show hardly any macrostructural differences between the first and the second night in the sleep laboratory. On the microstructural level differences in CAP variables were found. Significance: Microstructural analysis can be seen as a further approach to the classification of sleep and CAP turned out to be sensitive to environmental influences on sleep. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigated the electroclinical and prognostic features of 16 patients with PNH. Methods: Of 120 patients with epilepsy and malformations of cortical development, 16 had PNH. Of these, eight patients had periventricular nodules only (simple PNH) and eight also presented with other cortical or cerebral malformations (subcortical heterotopia; polymicrogyria; focal dysplasia; schizencephaly; cortical infolding; agenesis of the corpus callosum; mega cisterna magna and cerebellar atrophy) (PNH plus). All patients underwent clinical, neurophysiological, and MRI investigation. The mean follow up was 17.3 years (2-40 years). Results: Two electroclinical patterns emerged: (1) The first pattern, associated with simple PNH, was characterised by normal intelligence and seizures, usually partial, which began during the second decade of life. The seizures never became frequent and tended to disappear or become very rare. The EEG showed focal abnormalities. (2) The second pattern, associated with PNH plus, was characterised by mental retardation and seizures that began during the first decade of life. The seizures were very frequent in most cases and sudden drops were observed in six patients. Seizures were medically refractory in four patients. The EEG showed focal and bisynchronous abnormalities. Conclusions: Two groups of PNH patients with different electroclinical and neuroradiological features can be identified after a long term follow up. The presence of other types of cortical or cerebral malformations, in addition to periventricular nodules, determines a poor prognosis.

In this work, data mining (DM) classification techniques were utilized to build an automatic detection model. The selected DM algorithms are: Decision Trees (J4.8), and Statistical Bayesian Classifier (naive model). The main objective was the detection of IS, isolating them from the EEG's base activity. On the other hand, DM has an attractive advantage in such applications, in that the recognition of epileptic discharges does not need a clear definition of spike morphology. Furthermore, previously 'unseen' patterns could be recognized by the DM with proper 'training'. The results obtained showed that the efficacy of the selected DM algorithms is comparable to the current visual analysis used by the experts. Moreover, DM is faster than the time required for the visual analysis of the EEG. So this tool can assist the experts by facilitating the analysis of a patient's information, and reducing the time and effort required in the process. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The selective two-channel complexity (TCC) and field power (TCFP) were investigated between contralateral sensorimotor and mid-central region (close to Cz), and between ipsilateral sensorimotor and mid-central region during left or right hand motor imagery. It is demonstrated that TCC and TCFP can provide information regarding the dynamic interaction of spatially separated brain regions. In the upper alpha band (10-12Hz), TCC and TCFP with mu rhythm of the mid-central region and contralateral sensorimotor hand area show a pronounced increase and decrease respectively at imagination onset, which indicates that there are independent, parallel functional processes over contralateral sensorimotor area and mid-central region with the respective regions becoming active. The preliminary results show that TCC and TCFP could characterize the information exchange between different brain regions and also that the two parameters display good separability for left and right hand motor imagery tasks, so that they could be considered for the classification of two classes of EEG patterns in BCI (Brain Computer Interface).

This work contributes by developing a maxmin approach to robustify the common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm. By optimizing the worst-case objective function within a prefixed set of the covariance matrices, we can transform the respective complex mathematical program into a simple generalized eigen-value problem and thus obtain robust spatial filters very efficiently. We test our maxmin CSP method with real world brain-computer interface (BCI) data sets in which we expect substantial fluctuations caused by day-to-day or paradigm-to-paradigm variability or different forms of stimuli. The results clearly show that the proposed method significantly improves the classical CSP approach in multiple BCI scenarios.

Real-Time Decision Fusion for Multimodal Neural Prosthetic Devices	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PRIMATE MOTOR CORTEX; FREE ARM MOVEMENTS; 3-DIMENSIONAL SPACE; VISUAL TARGETS; BRAIN-TISSUE; DIRECTION; SIGNALS; ROBOT; SENSOR; EEG	Background: The field of neural prosthetics aims to develop prosthetic limbs with a brain-computer interface (BCI) through which neural activity is decoded into movements. A natural extension of current research is the incorporation of neural activity from multiple modalities to more accurately estimate the user's intent. The challenge remains how to appropriately combine this information in real-time for a neural prosthetic device. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we propose a framework based on decision fusion, i.e., fusing predictions from several single-modality decoders to produce a more accurate device state estimate. We examine two algorithms for continuous variable decision fusion: the Kalman filter and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Using simulated cortical neural spike signals, we implemented several successful individual neural decoding algorithms, and tested the capabilities of each fusion method in the context of decoding 2-dimensional endpoint trajectories of a neural prosthetic arm. Extensively testing these methods on random trajectories, we find that on average both the Kalman filter and ANNs successfully fuse the individual decoder estimates to produce more accurate predictions. Conclusions: Our results reveal that a fusion-based approach has the potential to improve prediction accuracy over individual decoders of varying quality, and we hope that this work will encourage multimodal neural prosthetics experiments in the future.

Clinical material comprised twenty-five patients with depression and an equal number of gender and aged-matched healthy controls. All subjects were evaluated by a computerized version of the digit span Wechsler test. EEG activity was recorded from 15 scalp electrodes and recordings were digitized for further computer processing. Features related to the shape of the waveform were generated using a dedicated custom software interface system developed in C++ for the purposes of this work. A sofhvare classification system was designed, consisting of (a) two classifiers, the probabilistic neural network (PNN) and the support vector machines (SVM), (b) two routines for feature reduction and feature selection, and (c) an overall system evaluation routine, comprising the exhaustive search and the leave-one-out methods. Highest classification accuracies achieved were 92% for the PNN and 96% for the SVM, using the 'latencylamplitude ratio' and 'peak-to-peak slope' two-feature combination, In conclusion, employing computer-based pattern recognition techniques with features not easily evaluated by the clinician, patients with depression could be distinguished from healthy, subjects with high accuracy.

M.; De Azevedo, Fernando M.; Neto, Jose Marino; Grillo, Eugenio			SADE(3): an effective system for automated detection of epileptiform events in long-term EEG based on context information	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						spike automatic detection; epilepsy; neural networks; wavelet transform; expert systems	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SPIKE DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION; DISCHARGES	Interictal spike detection is a time-consuming, low-efficiency task, but is important to epilepsy diagnosis. Automated systems reported to date usually have their practical efficacy compromised by elevated rates of false-positive detections per minute, which are caused mainly by the influence of artifacts (such as noise activity and ocular movements) and by the adoption of single or simple approaches. This work describes the development of a hybrid system for automatic detection of spikes in long-term electroencephalogram (EEG), named System for Automatic Detection of Epileptiform Events in EEG (SADE(3)), which uses wavelet transform, neural networks and artificial intelligence procedures to recognize epileptic and to reject non-epileptic activity. The system's pre-processing stage filters the EEG epochs with the Coiflet wavelet function, which showed the closest correlation to epileptogenic (EPG) activity, in opposition to some other wavelet functions that did not correlate with these events. In contrast to current attempts using continuous wavelet transform, we chose to work with fast wavelet transform to reduce processing time and data volume. Detail components at appropriate decomposition levels were used to accentuate spikes, sharp waves, high-frequency noise activity and ocular artifacts. These four detailed components were used to train four specialized neural networks, designed to detect and classify the EPG and non-EPG events. An expert module analyzes the networks' outputs, together with multichannel and context information and concludes the detection. The system was evaluated with 126,000 EEG epochs, obtained from seven different patients during long-term monitoring, under diverse behavior and mental states. More than 6,721 spikes and sharp waves were previously identified by three experienced human electroencephalographers. In these tests, the SADE(3) system simultaneously achieved 70.9% sensitivity, 99.9% specificity and a rate of 0.13 false-positives per minute, indicating its usefulness and low vulnerability to artifact influence. After tests, the SADE 3 system showed itself to be able to process bipolar cortical EEG records, from long-term monitoring, up to 32 channels, without any data preparation or event positioning. At the same time, SADE 3 revealed a high capacity to reject non-epileptic paroxysms, robustness in relation to a variety of spike morphologies, flexibility in adjustment of performance rates and the capacity to actually save time during EEG reading. Furthermore, it can be adapted to other applications for pattern recognition, with simple adjustments.

The diagnostic classifications of depression include the concepts of melancholic, endogenous, or severe depression. All subgroups describe severely depressed patients suffering from most of the core symptoms of depression. In addition these patients exhibit the clinical characteristics of a recurrent unipolar or bipolar course, lower placebo response rates, or higher response rates to ECT, to antidepressant treatments with dually or mixed modes of action, or to lithium augmentation. Higher rates of HPA axis hyperactivity and specific EEG patterns may also occur in this patient group. This suggests a broad overlap of patient subgroups within the diagnostic classification of depression. Because the positive diagnosis of the core symptoms of depression may include clinical consequences, it would be useful to integrate all these concepts into the upcoming new versions of the diagnostic systems DSM-V and ICD-11.

The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) was originally intended for the explanation of certain brain: functions and organizations, but it has later been accepted as a new statistical analysis method to many fields of science and technology. At least 3700 scientific works on the SOM have been published. In its basic form, the SOM forms illustrative nonlinear projections of high-dimensional data manifolds, and these projections, usually produced, on a two-dimensional display grid, help in the visualization and understanding of the relationships between complex data sets.

We show that the ICA filters are able to capture the inherent properties of textured images. The new filters are similar to Gabor filters, but seem to be richer in the sense that their frequency responses may be more complex. These properties enable us to use the ICA filter bank to create energy features for effective texture segmentation. Our experiments using multi-textured images show that the ICA filter bank yields similar or better segmentation results than the Gabor filter bank. (C) 2003 Pattern Recognition Society.

Model comparison for automatic characterization and classification of average ERPs using visual oddball paradigm	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Attention; P300; N200; Oddball; Pattern recognition; Linear discriminant analysis; Support vector machines; Neural networks; Target categorization; SVM; M LP	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; SLEEP-DEPRIVATION; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; STIMULUS INTERVAL; P3 AMPLITUDE; ARTIFACTS	Objective: To determine whether automated classifiers can be used for correctly identifying target categorization responses from averaged event-related potentials (ERPs) along with identifying appropriate features and classification models for computer-assisted investigation of attentional processes. Methods: ERPs were recorded during a target categorization task. Automated classification of average target ERPs versus average non-target ERPs was performed by extracting different combinations of features from the P300 and N200 components, which were used to train six classifiers: Euclidean classifier (EC), Mahalanobis discriminant (MD), quadratic classifier (QC), Fisher linear discriminant (FLD), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM). Results: The best classification performance (accuracy: 91-92%; sensitivity: 85-86%; specificity: 95-99%) was provided by QC, MLP, SVM on feature vectors extracted from P300 recorded at multiple sites. In general, non-linear and non-parametric classifiers (QC, MLP, SVM) performed better than linear classifiers (EC, MD, FLD). The N200 did not explain variance beyond that of P300 recorded at multiple sites. Conclusions: The results suggest that automatic characterization and classification of average target and non-target ERPs is feasible. Features of P300 recorded at multiple sites used to train non-linear classifiers are recommended for optimal classification performance. Significance: Automatic characterization of target ERPs can provide an objective approach for detecting and diagnosing abnormalities and evaluating interventions for clinical populations, paving the way for future real-time monitoring of attentional processes.

J	Khadra, L; Al-Fahoum, AS; Binajjaj, S				Khadra, L; Al-Fahoum, AS; Binajjaj, S			A quantitative analysis approach for cardiac arrhythmia classification using higher order spectral techniques	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						atrial fibrillation; bicoherency; bispectrum; ventricular fibrillation; ventricular tachycardia	VENTRICULAR-TACHYCARDIA; WAVELET TRANSFORMATION; FIBRILLATION; PATTERNS; SYSTEMS; EEG	Ventricular tachyarrhythmias, in particular ventricular fibrillation (VF), are the primary arrhythmic events in the majority of patients suffering from sudden cardiac death. Attention has focused upon these articular rhythms as it is recognized that prompt therapy can lead to a successful outcome. There has been considerable interest in analysis of the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) in VF centred on attempts to understand the pathophysiological processes occurring in sudden cardiac death, predicting the efficacy of therapy, and guiding the use of alternative or adjunct therapies to improve resuscitation success rates. Atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) are other types of tachyarrhythmias that constitute a medical challenge. In this paper, a high order spectral analysis technique is suggested for quantitative analysis and classification of cardiac arrhythmias. The algorithm is based upon bispectral analysis techniques. The bispectrum is estimated using an autoregressive model, and the frequency support of the bispectrum is extracted as a quantitative measure to classify atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Results show a significant difference in the parameter values for different arrhythmias. Moreover, the bicoherency spectrum shows different bicoherency values for normal and tachycardia patients. In particular, the bicoherency indicates that phase coupling decreases as arrhythmia kicks in. The simplicity of the classification parameter and the obtained specificity and sensitivity of the classification scheme reveal the importance of higher order spectral analysis in the classification of life threatening arrhythmias. Further investigations and modification of the classification scheme could inherently improve the results of this technique and predict the instant of arrhythmia change.

The objective of our study was to determine the frequency and type of IED on routine and multihour EEGs in a tertiary epilepsy center to estimate the frequency of left-sided versus right-sided IED and to determine interictal spike distribution pattern differences between adult and pediatric epilepsy patients. The current study retrospectively reviewed 31,207 EEGs (25,793 routine EEGs and 5414 multihour EEGs) recorded on 24,003 patients during the period from 1993 to 2003. All EEGs were read according to a systematic EEG classification system. Every patient was considered only once by including the first abnormal EEG. Regional unilateral or bilateral IEDs were recorded in 1707 patients (7%). Regional unilateral or bilateral slow was recorded in 2297 patients (9.6%). Left-sided regional IED were seen in 828 patients and accounted for 58% of all unilateral IED. Left-sided slow was seen in 1389 patients and accounted for 65% of all unilateral slow. Lateralization of slow was due to intermittent slow, whereas continuous slow involved both hemispheres equally. There was no lateralization difference in benign focal epileptiform discharges of childhood. Lateralization shows a tendency toward greater left-sided lateralization of interictal findings with aging. Benign focal epileptiforrn discharges were only seen under the age of 20 years old. Regional IEDs were seen in approximately 7% of patients and slowing occurs in 10% of patients. Both abnormalities were seen more frequently in the left hemisphere. Age adjusted analysis of the data revealed that this left-sided predominance was mildly increased in adults as compared with pediatric patients.

An offline/real-time artifact rejection strategy to improve the classification of multi-channel evoked potentials	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						artifact detection; evoked potentials; decision fusion	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; EEG; MOVEMENT; REMOVAL	The primary goal of this paper is to improve the classification of multi-channel evoked potentials (EPs) by introducing a temporal domain artifact detection strategy and using this strategy to (a) evaluate how the performance of classifiers is affected by artifacts and (b) show how the performance can be improved by detecting and rejecting artifacts in offline and real-time classification experiments. Using a pattern recognition approach, an artifact is defined in this study as any signal that may lead to inaccurate classifier parameter estimation and inaccurate testing. The temporal domain artifact detection tests include: a within-channel standard deviation (STD) test that can detect signals with little or abnormal variations in each channel and also detect faulty channels, a within-channel clipping (CL) test to detect amplitude clipped EPs in each channel, and a multi-channel EP median distance (MC-MED) test to detect atypical signals not identified by the STD and CL tests. Because the MGMED test is class-dependent, a novel "pre-testing" approach is developed to identify artifacts in real-time classification experiments. The performance of the artifact detection strategy is demonstrated on real single-trial EP ensembles and it is shown that the strategy is quite effective in identifying atypical El's. In order to demonstrate the effects of artifacts on classifier performance, a series of classification experiments are designed using a multi-channel decision fusion classification algorithm. Specifically, the classification performance is evaluated on (a) real EP ensembles with artifact contaminations in the training and test sets and (b) ensembles that are free of artifacts in both the training and test sets. It is shown that the improvement in classification accuracy through the incorporation of the artifact detection strategy can be quite significant in real-time classification trials. Furthermore, the generalized formulation of the artifact rejection classification strategy makes it adaptable to various other problems involving the multi-class classification of multivariate signals of multiple sensors.

The purpose of this study was to extend a previously introduced pattern recognition method for the ERP assessment in this application. This extension was done by the further extending the feature set and also the employing a method for the selection of optimal features. For the evaluation of the method, several subjects went through the designed GKT paradigm and their respective brain signals were recorded. Next, a P300 detection approach based on some features and a statistical classifier was implemented. The optimal feature set was selected using a genetic algorithm from a primary feature set including some morphological, frequency and wavelet features and was used for the classification of the data. The rates of correct detection in guilty and innocent subjects were 86%, which was better than other previously used methods. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In addition, the application of fuzzy logic allows to emulate expert's procedures. Additionally, we built a database of 56 all-night polysomnographic recordings from children for training and testing, which is among the largest annotated databases published on the subject. The database was split into training (27 recordings), validation (10 recordings), and testing (19 recordings) datasets. The SS events were marked by sleep experts using visual inspection, and these marks were used as golden standard. The overall SS detection performance on the testing dataset of continuous all-night sleep recordings was 88.2% sensitivity, 89.7% specificity, and 11.9% false-positive (FP) rate. Considering only non-REM sleep stage 2, the results showed 92.2% sensitivity, 90.1% specificity, and 8.9% FP rate. In general, our system presents enhanced results when compared with most systems found in the literature, thus improving SS detection precision significantly without the need of hypnogram information.

Our video archive of 105 neonates with seizures or suspected seizures revealed six neonates with such tonic clonic or tonic myoclonic sequences. Two of those neonates had pyridoxine dependent seizures. The other four neonates had drug refractory seizures and demonstrated similarities in electro-clinical pattern, clinical course and outcome. Their seizures started with tonic posturing and after 10-20 s tonic posturing was superimposed by focal or multifocal cloni or myocloni. Ictal EEG started with voltage attenuation followed by bilateral or alternating focal epileptic discharges. The interictal EEG was abnormal. One child died, while the other three children became seizure free but had severe motor delay and mental retardation.

For the BCI application, the brief motion of objects embedded into onscreen virtual buttons is used to evoke mVEP that is time locked to the onset of motion. EEG data registered from 15 subjects are used to investigate the spatio-temporal pattern of mVEP in this paradigm. N2 and P2 components, with distinct temporo-occipital and parietal topography, respectively, are selected as the salient features of the brain response to the attended target that the subject selects by gazing at it. The computer determines the attended target by finding which button elicited prominent N2/P2 components. Besides a simple feature extraction of N2/P2 area calculation, the stepwise linear discriminant analysis is adopted to assess the target detection accuracy of a five-class BCI. A mean accuracy of 98% is achieved when ten trials data are averaged. Even with only three trials, the accuracy remains above 90%, suggesting that the proposed mVEP-based BCI could achieve a high information transfer rate in online implementation.

This is relevant when using the free energy as an approximation to the log-evidence in Bayesian model averaging and selection. By setting restricted maximum likelihood (ReML) in the larger context of variational learning and expectation maximisation (EM), we show how the ReML objective function can be adjusted to provide an approximation to the log-evidence for a particular model. This means ReML can be used for model selection, specifically to select or compare models with different covariance components. This is useful in the context of hierarchical models because it enables a principled selection of priors that, under simple hyperpriors, can be used for automatic model selection and relevance determination (ARD). Deriving the ReML objective function, from basic variational principles, discloses the simple relationships among Variational Bayes, EM and ReML. Furthermore, we show that EM is formally identical to a full variational treatment when the precisions are linear in the hyperparameters. Finally, we also consider, briefly, dynamic models and how these inform the regularisation of free energy ascent schemes, like EM and ReML. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

JOURNAL OF CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Joint Annual Meeting of the Hong-Kong-Neurologc-Society/Hong-Kong-Epilepsy-Society	NOV 07-09, 2003	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	Hong Kong Neurol Soc, Hong Kong Epilepsy Soc			PEDIATRIC MIGRAINE; PREVALENCE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ADOLESCENTS; REVISIONS	There has been a lack of published data on the pattern of recurrent headache in Chinese children. The validity of the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria has not been evaluated in Chinese children. We performed a retrospective medical record review of 124 children aged < 18 years with an International Classification of Diseases coding of headache followed up in a general outpatient clinic in a university-based hospital over a 3-year period (2000-2002). The aims of our study were to (1) study the pattern of recurrent headache in Chinese children and (2) study any agreement between clinical diagnoses made by our board-certified pediatricians and symptom-based diagnoses using the second edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (International Classification of Headache Disorders-II). The most common type was unclassified headache (70.2%), followed by infrequent episodic tension-type headache (24.2%) and migraine without aura (5.6%). A family history of headache or migraine was more commonly found in children with infrequent episodic tension-type headache or migraine without aura. (P =.0109) The co-occurrence of abdominal pain with infrequent episodic tension-type headache was 30%; for, unclassified headache, it was 19.5%. Dysmenorrhea occurred in 7.1% of girls with infrequent episodic tension-type headache and 8.6% of girls with unclassified headache. However, migraine without aura was not associated with abdominal pain or dysmenorrhea. Children with migraine without aura were more frequently referred to child neurologists (P = .0207) and admitted (P = .0000). Neurologic investigations, including electroencephalography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, were performed in less than 30% of cases. Abnormal results were found in only seven cases; with two referred to a neurosurgeon and none requiring surgical intervention. Thus, by using the clinical diagnosis of our board-certified pediatricians as the standard, the sensitivity and specificity of International Classification of Headache Disorders-H-based definition of migraine without aura was 23.1% and 93.4%, respectively, and for infrequent episodic tension-type headache, it was 37.5% and 76%, respectively. The typical characteristics of migraine tend to emerge later and might have led to underdiagnosis of the younger age group, with a higher rate of referral and inpatient management. The new edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria is still restrictive in clinical practice and might not be able to reflect current pediatric practice. Further studies with a defined study period or recurrent headache might be more useful in analyzing the use of these new International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria in the diagnosis of recurrent headache in children.

Electrocorticography (ECoG) monitoring in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) has been employed since the 40's as a means to delineate surgical removal especially in lesional epilepsy, to reduce resection size and decrease cognitive sequelae (memory, naming). However in recent years, ECoG has been claimed to lack indications and prognostic value in cases of non-lesional TLE. On the grounds of the pathophysiological relationship between mesial structures and neocortex (through propagation pathways) we have suggested a classification of ECoG activity patterns regarding the activities simultaneously recorded in mesial and neocortical grids. Patients and methods. Two experienced neurophysiologists (over 200 ECoG performed) have independently reviewed the recordings (including video-EEG monitoring with foramen ovale electrodes) of 33 consecutive (28 non-lesional), TLE patients with the major criterion of a leading activity in mesial or neocortical areas, and related the results to the clinical course. Results. As a result we identified five patterns: I. Pure mesial; II. Mesial with neocortical-related activity; III. Non-related mesial and neocortical activities; IV. Neocortical preponderance (although some mesial unrelated discharges may be seen), and V. Neocortical origin. In all 33, a tailored, ECoG-guided two-steps resection was performed. Surgical success significantly (X-2 test) associated with patterns I, II and IV. Pattern V precluded a good outcome. Conclusions. ECoG reflects the state of pathological involvement of neocortex and mesial structures. An expertise approach, although brief in time (20-30 min), may either lead to preservation of relevant tissue (patterns I, II) and to establish a prognosis on the grounds of the initial epileptogenic activity.

J	Li, YQ; Guan, CT				Li, Yuanqing; Guan, Cuntai			An extended EM algorithm for joint feature extraction and classification in brain-computer interfaces	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							SINGLE TRIAL EEG; HAND MOVEMENT; BCI; COMMUNICATION	For many electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), a tedious and time-consuming training process is needed to set parameters. In BCI Competition 2005, reducing the training process was explicitly proposed as a task. Furthermore, an effective BCI system needs to be adaptive to dynamic variations of brain signals; that is, its parameters need to be adjusted online. In this article, we introduce an extended expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, where the extraction and classification of common spatial pattern (CSP) features are performed jointly and iteratively. In each iteration, the training data set is updated using all or part of the test data and the labels predicted in the previous iteration. Based on the updated training data set, the CSP features are reextracted and classified using a standard EM algorithm. Since the training data set is updated frequently, the initial training data set can be small (semisupervised case) or null (unsupervised case). During the above iterations, the parameters of the Bayes classifier and the CSP transformation matrix are also updated concurrently. In online situations, we can still run the training process to adjust the system parameters using unlabeled data while a subject is using the BCI system. The effectiveness of the algorithm depends on the robustness of CSP feature to noise and iteration convergence, which are discussed in this article. Our proposed approach has been applied to data set IVa of BCI Competition 2005. The data analysis results show that we can obtain satisfying prediction accuracy using our algorithm in the semisupervised and unsupervised cases. The convergence of the algorithm and robustness of CSP feature are also demonstrated in our data analysis.

In order to evaluate quantities provided by these methods and in order to relate them to the notion of functional coupling between cerebral structures, we developed a neurophysiologically relevant model able to generate EEG signals from organized networks of neural populations. We showed that the model can produce realistic multichannel epileptiform signals (when compared to real SEEG signals) under certain conditions (excitation/inhibition ratio within populations, uni/bi-directional coupling between populations). In this paper, the model framework is used to evaluate the performances of nonlinear regression analysis as a method to characterize couplings between cerebral structures from the SEEG signals they produce. Two quantities, a nonlinear correlation coefficient and a direction index, respectively related to coupling parameters in the model (degree/direction) are presented. These two quantities are measured on real SEEG signals recorded in patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy and candidate to surgical treatment. Results show that the characterization of functional couplings leads to the identification of networks referred to as 'epileptogenic networks', which might be responsible for the triggering of seizures. These results also corroborate our previous results on the classification of temporal lobe epilepsies, showing that there exist recurrent seizure patterns that can be classified on the basis of interactions between medial and lateral neocortical structures.

Thus far, the fastest and more accurate control of neuroprostheses is achieved through direct recordings of neural activity [Nicolelis, M.A., 2001. Actions from thoughts. Nature 409, 403-407; Donoghue, J.P., 2002. Connecting cortex to machines: recent advances in brain interfaces. Nat. Neurosci. 5 (Suppl.), 1085-1088]. However, invasive recordings have inherent medical risks. Here we discuss some approaches that could enhance the speed and accuracy of non-invasive devices, namely, (1) enlarging the spectral analysis to include higher frequency oscillations, able to transmit substantial information over short analysis windows; (2) using spectral analysis procedures that minimize the variance of the estimates: and (3) transforming EEG recorded activity into local field potential estimates (eLFP). Theoretical and experimental arguments are used to explain why it is erroneous to think that scalp EEG cannot sense high frequency oscillations and how this might hinders further developments. We further illustrate how non-invasive eLFPs derived from the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) can be combined with robust, broad band spectral analysis to accurately detect (off-line) the laterality of upcoming hand movements. Interestingly, the use of pattern recognition to select the brain voxels differentially engaged by the explored tasks leads to sound neural activation images. Consequently, our results indicate that both research lines, i.e., neuroprosthetics and electrical neuroimaging, might effectively benefit from their mutual interaction. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Though few epileptic syndromes are associated with sleep seizures (SS) its frequencies in Indian patients is still unknown. Aim: To find out the patterns of epilepsies in patients having SS and compare them with patients having wake seizures (WS). Setting and Design: Open label hospital based study. Materials and Methods: One hundred and forty-four (13%) patients having predominantly SS were compared with 976 (87%) patients of WS by various clinical, electrophysiological and radiological factors. Statistical Analysis: Chi square test and student T test, using software SPSS (version 10, 1999) was applied to compare various parameters. Relative risk was calculated by 2 x 2 contingency table. Results: The seizure semiology was better defined in patients with WS and GTCS was more common in SS (P = 0.001). Wake-electroencephalogram (EEG) was abnormal in significantly (P = 0.001) higher number of patients with WS. Symptomatic etiologies were found in more than half patients. Left lobe involvement was more common in patients having SS (P = 0.000). After symptomatic, idiopathic generalized and frontal lobe epilepsy were most frequent with SS. Undetermined epilepsy was found in 37 (25.7%) patients with SS. Conclusion: Epilepsies associated with SS were less frequent and had symptomatic cause in most cases. Left hemispherical and frontal lobe lesion were more commonly associated with SS. Frontal lobe and idiopathic generalized epilepsy was most frequent in patients of SS. Sleep EEG should always be done in patients with sleep seizures.	[Goel, Deepak; Mittal, Manish; Singhal, A.] Himalayan Inst Med Sci, Dept Neurol, Dehra Dun 249014, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Bansal, K.

Among other criteria, this classification relies on the identification of two different electroclinical patterns, those of medial (limbic) and lateral (neocortical) temporal lobe seizures, depending on the structure initially involved in the seizure activity. Recent electrophysiologic studies have now identified seizures in which medial and neocortical structures are both involved at seizure onset. The purpose of the study was therefore to study the correlations of ictal semiology with the spatiotemporal pattern of discharge in temporal lobe seizures. Methods: The 187 stereoelectroencephalography-recorded seizures from 55 patients were analyzed. Patients were classified into three groups according to electrophysiologic findings: medial (M; seizure onset limited to medial structures, n = 24), lateral (L; seizure onset limited to lateral structures, n = 13), and medial-lateral (ML; seizure onset involving both medial and lateral structures, n = 18). Clinical findings were compared between groups. Results: Initial epigastric sensation, initial fear, delayed oroalimentary and elementary upper limb automatisms, delayed loss of contact, long seizure duration, and absent or rare secondary generalizations were associated with M seizures. Initial auditory illusion or hallucination, initial loss of contact, shorter duration of seizures, and more frequent generalizations were associated with L seizures. Initial epigastric sensation, initial loss of contact, early oroalimentary and verbal automatisms, and long duration of seizures were associated with ML seizures. Conclusions: Although the syndrome of mesial temporal epilepsy is now relatively well defined, our findings support the idea that the organization of temporal lobe seizures may be complex and that different patterns exist. We demonstrate three distinct patterns, characterized by both semiologic and electrophysiologic features. This distinction may help to define better the epileptogenic zone and the subsequent surgical procedure.

Because visual scoring is subjective and cumbersome, we developed an automated P-wave analysis system, which could detect and classify P-waves as clusters or as isolated events in bipolar recordings of the pontine electroencephalogram (EEG) of conscious rats. Design: A computer algorithm was developed to extract and normalize each half-wave of the pontine EEG according to the background noise level. Candidate events for different P-wave patterns (uniphasic, biphasic, and triphasic) were compared to a corresponding set of amplitude and duration thresholds to identify P-waves and to reject artifacts. Participants: Ten adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were instrumented for chronic polysomnography. Measurements and Results: Two human experts manually scored each recording, and their consensus score was used as the "gold standard" for algorithm optimization and validation. The algorithm's scoring thresholds were optimized on a training set of 5 six-hour polysomnographic records, yielding 96.8% accuracy and 97.7% sensitivity versus human consensus scoring. Validation of the algorithm, using the optimized threshold values, was conducted using a set of 5 independent recordings, resulting in 94.8% accuracy and 94.7% sensitivity versus human consensus scoring. Conclusions: We have developed and validated an automated system for detection and classification of P-waves in conscious rats with advantages over human scoring, including increased speed and perfect reliability.

The purpose of this study is to report on 35 patients with Angelman syndrome (AS) in whom we evaluated the electroclinical characteristics and the progression of their epilepsy. Patients and methods. The following factors were evaluated sex,family background, neurological examination, age at onset and semiology of the epileptic seizures, EEG, types of epilepsy according to the international classification and response to therapy. We investigated the karyotype, and conducted FISH and methylation tests for AS. Results. The 35 patients had an average follow-up time of 5.6 years. Epilepsy was diagnosed in 25 cases, with an average age of onset of 1.6 years. The epileptic syndromes were: epilepsy with myoclonic seizures in 13, of which seven presented a myoclonic state in their history, focal epilepsy in seven, West's syndrome in three, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in two. Intercritical EEG showed generalised MSW and SW paroxysms in 13, unilateral spikes in seven, hypsarrhythmia in three, generalised fast-rhythm paroxysms and slow SW activity in two. Basal electroencephalographic activity was: slow hypervoltage waves with or without inserted spikes situated at the rear in 19, at the front in six, diffuse in six, and normal in four cases. Conclusions. 71.4% of patients with AS suffered epileptic seizures; epilepsy with myoclonic seizures was the most frequently observed epileptic syndrome and hypervoltage slow wave activity with or without spikes inserted in the posterior quadrants was a characteristic encephalographic pattern. Inpatients with mental retardation, with or without epilepsy and these electroencephalographic findings, even in the absence of characteristic clinical signs, methylation and FISH analyses for AS should be performed.

These works have also demonstrated that human brain activity can be used to recover from machine errors, and as reward signals to teach a simulated robot how to perform given tasks. This paper studies the elicitation of this activity during the operation of a real robot. Experimental results have been obtained with 4 participants observing the operation of a 5 d.o.f. robotic arm performing correct/incorrect reaching tasks, while an EEG system recorded their brain activity. The results give evidence that the brain areas that play a role in detection and monitoring of errors also play a role when observing the operation of a real robot, that a brain discriminative response is elicited during the observation of a correct/incorrect operation of a real robot, and that it is possible to learn a classifier that provides online categorization with high accuracy (80%).

Methods: The method employs a genetic-based selection process, and then tunes a probabilistic neural network classifier to predict seizures within a 10 min prediction horizon. Initial seizure and interictal data were used for training, and the remaining IEEG data were used for testing. The method continues to train and learn over time. Results: Validation of these results over two workshop patients demonstrated a sensitivity of 100%, and 1.1 false positives per hour for Patient E, using a 2.4 s block predictor, and a failure of the method on Patient B. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a prospective, exploratory implementation of a seizure prediction method designed to adapt to individual patients with a wide variety of pre-ictal patterns, implanted electrodes and seizure types. Its current performance is limited likely by the small number of input channels and quantitative features employed in this study, and segmentation of the data set into training and testing sets rather than using all continuous data available. Significance: This technique theoretically has the potential to address the challenge presented by the heterogeneity of EEG patterns seen in medication-resistant epilepsy. A more comprehensive implementation utilizing all electrode sites, a broader feature library, and automated multi-feature fusion will be required to fully judge the method's potential for predicting seizures.

A relational model of the influence of musical events on the listener's affect is first induced using inductive logic programming paradigms with the emotion data and musical score features as inputs of the induction task. The components of composition such as interval and scale, instrumentation, chord progression and melody are automatically combined using genetic algorithm and melodic transformation heuristics that depend on the predictive knowledge and character of the induced model. Out of the four targeted basic emotional states, namely, stress, joy, sadness, and relaxation, the empirical results reported here show that the system is able to successfully compose tunes that convey one of these affective states.

We investigated the relation of IS to seizure control and pathology after anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL). Methods: All patients undergoing intracranial ictal monitoring from a single institution since 1989 were identified. Those who did not undergo ATL or had postoperative follow-up of <1 year were excluded. All received at a minimum bilateral temporal depth electrodes. Ictal recordings were reviewed for the presence of IS, and the proportion of seizures with IS was determined for each patient. Outcome was determined by using Engel's classification. Surgical specimens were reviewed for pathology. Statistics used were chi(2), Fisher exact test, and Wilcoxon rank sum. Results: Forty patients with 571 seizures were reviewed. In 292 seizures from 32 patients, IS was seen. Outcomes were 24 class I (22 with IS), five class II (four with IS), three class III tone with IS). seven class IV (four with IS), and one lost to follow-up (with IS). Pathologic review revealed 25 with MTS, 22 of whom had IS. The presence of IS was associated with class I outcomes (p = 0.04), but not MTS (p = 0.06). Patients with class I outcomes had a significantly greater proportion of seizures with IS (mean, 0.58 +/- 0.3) compared with other outcomes (mean, 0.30 +/- 0.3, p = 0.02). Conclusions: The presence of IS and higher proportion of seizures with IS correlated with good seizure outcome after ATL. This information may be used in preoperative counseling.

Automated seizure onset detection for accurate onset time determination in intracranial EEG	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Seizure onset detection; Machine learning; EEG	SPONTANEOUS EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; APPLIED CURRENTS; CORTICAL STIMULATION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; PULSE STIMULATION; PATTERNS; EPILEPSY; AFTERDISCHARGES; TRANSITION	Objective: A novel algorithm for automated seizure onset detection is presented. The method allows for precise identification of electrographic seizure onset times within large databases of electrographic data. Methods: The patient-specific algorithm extracts salient spectral and temporal features in five frequency bands within a sliding window of an electrographic recording. Feature windows are classified as containing or not containing a seizure onset via Support vector machines. A clustering and regression analysis is utilized to accurately localize seizure onsets in time. User-adjustable parameters allow for tuning of detection sensitivity, false positive rate, and latency. The method was tested on intracranial electrographic data recorded from six patients with a total of 1792 recorded seizure onsets from 8246 total electrographic recordings. Results: Testing of algorithm performance via cross-validation resulted in sensitivities between 80% and 98%, false positive rates from 0.002 to 0.046 per minute (0.12-2.8 per hour), and median detection time within 100 ms of the electrographic onset for all patients. In five of the six patients, more than 90% of all detected onsets were less than 3 s from the electrographic onset. Conclusions: The detection system was able to detect seizure onset times in a temporally unbiased fashion with low latency while maintaining reasonable sensitivities and false positive rates. The regression algorithm for temporal localization of onsets confers a considerable benefit in terms of detection latency. Significance: With the use Of Our algorithm, large databases of electrographic data can be rapidly processed and seizure onset times accurately marked, facilitating research and analyses of peri-onset events that require precise seizure onset alignment.

The observations we make are then taken to be related to these sources through some unknown functionaility. Furthermore, the (unknown) number of underlying latent sources may be different to the number of observations and hence issues of model complexity plague the analysis. Recent developments in Independent Component Analysis (ICA) have shown that, in the case where the unknown function linking sources to observations is linear, data decomposition may be achieved in a mathematically elegant manner. In this paper we extend the general ICA paradigm to include a very flexible source model and prior constraints and argue that for particular biomedical signal processing problems (we consider EEG analysis) we require the constraint of positivity in the mixing process.

Sensor Selection for Energy-Efficient Ambulatory Medical Monitoring	MOBISYS'09: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 7TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MOBILE SYSTEMS, APPLICATIONS, AND SERVICES			English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications and Services	JUN 22-25, 2009	Cracow, POLAND	ACM SIGMOBILE, USENIX		ambulatory medical monitoring; epilepsy; reducing energy consumption; channel selection; electroencephalography (EEG)	EPILEPSY	Epilepsy affects over three million Americans of all ages Despite recent advances, more than 20% of individuals with epilepsy never achieve adequate control of their seizures The use of a small, portable, non-invasive seizure monitor could benefit these individuals tremendously. However, in order for such a device to be Suitable for long-term wear, it must be both comfortable and lightweight. Typical state-of-the-art non-invasive seizure onset detection algorithms require 2 1 scalp electrodes to be placed oil the head. These electrodes are used to generate 18 data streams, called channels The large number of electrodes is inconvenient for the patient and processing 18 channels can consume a considerable amount of energy, a problem for a battery-powered device In this paper, we describe an automated way to construct detector-3 that use fewer channels, and thus fewer electrodes. Starting from an existing technique for constructing 18 channel patient-specific detectors, we use machine learning to automatically construct reduced channel detectors We evaluate our algorithm on data from 16 patients used in all earlier study. On average, our algorithm reduced the number of channels from 18 to 4.6 while decreasing the mean fraction of seizure onsets detected from 99% to 9 90 7, For 12 out of the 16 patients, there was no degradation in the detection rate. While the average detection latency increased from 7 8 s to 11 2 s. the average rate of false alarms per hour decreased from 0 35 to 0 19. We also describe a prototype implementation of a single channel EEC monitoring device built using off-the-shelf components, and use this implementation to derive all energy consumption model. Using fewer channels reduced file average energy Consumption by 69%, which amounts to a 3 3x increase in battery lifetime Finally, we show how additional energy savings call be realized by using a low-power screening detector to rule out segments of data that are obviously not seizures. Though this technique does not reduce the number of electrodes needed, it does reduce the energy consumption by an additional 16%	[Shih, Eugene I.; Shoeb, Ali H.; Guttag, John V.] MIT, Dept EECS, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA		Shih, EI (corresponding author), MIT, Dept EECS, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.	eishih@mit.edu; ashoeb@mit.edu; guttag@mit.edu							32	23	23	0	4	ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY	NEW YORK	1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA			978-1-60558-566-6				2009							347	358						12	Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Telecommunications	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science; Telecommunications	BLX02					2022-08-02	WOS:000271246300026

Towards Emotion Aware Computing: a study of Arousal Modulation with Multichannel Event-Related Potentials, Delta Oscillatory Activity and Skin Conductivity Responses	8TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOENGINEERING, VOLS 1 AND 2	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering		English	Proceedings Paper	8th IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering	OCT 08-10, 2008	Athens, GREECE	IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc				Emotion identification has recently been considered as a key element in contemporary studies for advanced human-computer interaction. The achievement of this goal is usually attempted via methods incorporating facial expression and speech recognition, as well as, human motion analysis. In this paper it is attempted to fuse multi-modal physiological signals of the autonomic (skin conductance) and central nervous systems (EEG), through the use of appropriate feature extraction procedures discriminating emotional arousal modulations, to a neural network classifier. Thus, skin conductivity responses, evoked-related potential peaks, and delta frequency oscillatory patterns are analyzed for a comparatively large number of subjects exposed to different emotions, evoked by pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System. The achieved neural network classifications were encouraging. It was found that fear was successfully differentiated (100%), pleasant emotions differing in their arousal level were well distinguished (80%), but the discrimination of low arousing negative feelings such as melancholy was more difficult (70%). It is argued that physiological patterning of multimodal recordings may successfully contribute to the enhancement of human computer interaction and emotion aware computing.

Members of highly dangerous professions must obtain rigorous training so that they could bear the great historical mission. Generally speaking, these professions include armed forces, special police force, fire department, astronauts and mine disaster rescue troop. The game-based professional training systems for highly dangerous professions have their own distinct requirements. The aim of game-based learning systems is not only the study of declarative knowledge, but also entraining procedural knowledge through repeated practice until it becomes an automatic skill. The result of highly dangerous professional training is extremely important, since if a trainee dose not master the basic knowledge and skill, they could be in grave danger; the trainee's mental qualities should be continuously prompted by the training system so that they could be act intuitively under the most execrable circumstance. Based on requirements analysis and taking the case of mining rescue into account, we divide the whole training system into three parts: machine learning subsystem, brain information subsystem and credit-assignment subsystem. The machine learning subsystem (as know as serious game subsystem), contains the audio-visual coherency analysis, semantic annotation of a scene based on association memory, cooperating management of audio-visual cross-modal signals, personalization rendering of a scene. The brain information subsystem includes functions for receiving, storing and analyzing trainee's trial data based on visual and auditory signals from EEG, sEMG and psychological tests. The credit-assignment subsystem involves trainee's profiles and effect evaluation which are sent from brain information subsystem to machine learning subsystem, while the plan of knowledge learning, the result of skills training and consequence of the desensitization trial are sent as the feedback to brain information subsystem. Therefore, the whole framework works as a reinforcement learning system. The kernel of this system is the cooperating learning schema of audio-visual cross-modal signals. Furthermore, in this system the main visual signals contain scene textures, 3D character animation, 3D scene animation, while the main auditory signals contain the realistic sound, the on-the-spot orders, the on-the-spot yells and background music. In the light of cognitive principles, the following factors should be considered when a game-based leaning system is designed: (1) The working memory including phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad act as two slave systems, play the role of dual sensory channels so that semantic coherency of the visual and the auditory data could be combined with the prior knowledge to be formed as long-term memory; (2) A goal of cooperative learning for audio-visual cross-modal signals is to create an approach which can process verbal information(like the realistic sound and the on-the-spot orders) and non-verbal information(such as 3D character animation as well as 3D scene animation) from the two separate subsystems; (3) Schema acquisition (based on Theory of Cognitive Load-TCL) should be a primary means of learning, and the automation of cognitive process (including declarative knowledge procedural knowledge) will be used to reduce working memory load.

Methods We investigated 17 patients with PMG syndromes during presurgical workup, which included long-term video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, neurological and psychiatry assessments, invasive EEG, and the subtraction of ictal-interictal SPECT coregistered to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (SISCOM). Results The analysis of the PMG cortex, using SISCOM, revealed intense hyperperfusion in the polymicrogyric lesion during epileptic seizures in all patients. Interestingly, other localizing investigations showed heterogeneous findings. Twelve patients underwent epilepsy surgery, three achieved seizure-freedom, five have worthwhile improvement, and four patients remained unchanged. Conclusions Our study strongly suggests the involvement of PMG in seizure generation or early propagation. Both conventional ictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and SISCOM appeared as the single contributive exam to suggest the localization of the epileptogenic zone. Despite the limited number of resective epilepsy surgery in our study (n=9), we found a strong prognostic role of SISCOM in predicting surgical outcome. This result may be of great value on surgical decision-making of whether or not the whole or part of the PMG lesion should be surgically resected.

Improved Team Performance Using EEG- and Context-Based Cognitive-State Classifications for a Vehicle Crew	FOUNDATIONS OF AUGMENTED COGNITION, PROCEEDINGS: NEUROERGONOMICS AND OPERATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Foundation of Augmented Cognition	JUL 19-24, 2009	San Diego, CA					We present an augmented cognition (AugCog) system that utilizes two sources to assess cognitive state as a basis for actions to improve operator performance. First, continuous EEG is measured and signal processing algorithms utilized to identify patterns of activity indicative of high cognitive demand. Second, data from the automobile is used to infer the ongoing driving context. Subjects participated as eleven 2-person crews consisting of a driver/navigator and a commander/gunner. While driving a closed-loop test route, the driver received through headphones a series of communications and had to perform two secondary tasks. Certain segments of the route were designated as threat zones. The commander was alerted when entering a threat zone and their task was to detect targets Mounted on the roadside and engage those targets To determine targeting success, a photo was taken with each activation of the trigger and these photos were assessed with respect to the position of the reticle relative to the target. In a secondary task, the commander was presented a series of communications through headphones. Our results show that it is possible to reliably discriminate different cognitive states on the basis of neuronal signals. Results also confirmed Our hypothesis: improved performance at the crew level in the AugCog condition for a secondary communications tasks, as compared to a control condition, with no change in performance for the primary tasks.

A new adaptive neuro-fuzzy technique will attempt to estimate movement-related potentials within multi-channel EEG recordings, enabling this method to completely adapt to each input sweep without system training procedures. We assume that one of the sensors is corrupted by noise deriving from other sensors via an unknown function that will be estimated. We will approach this problem by: (1) spatially decorrelating the sensors in the preprocessing phase, (2) choosing the most informative of the filtered channels that will permit the best MRP estimation (input-selection phase) and (3) training the neuro-fuzzy model to fit the noise over the chosen sensor and therefore estimating the buried MRP. We tested this framework with simulations to validate the analytical results before applying them to the real biological data. Whenever it is applied to biological data, this method improves the SNR by more than 12dB, even to very low SNRs. The processing method proposed here is likely to complement other estimation techniques and can be useful to process, enhance and analyse single-trial MRPs.

We examined diagnostic patterns and trends and use of specialty consultations in the evaluation of syncope. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of consecutive adult patients hospitalized with the principal diagnosis of syncope (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code 780.2) during 1994 and 1998 at 2 community teaching hospitals. Results: A total of 649 patients (57% female) with a mean (+/- SD) age of 68 +/- 15 years were identified in 1994 (n=451) and 1998 (n=198). Three hundred forty-one patients (53%) underwent at least 1 neurologic test, including brain computed tomographic (CT) scan (n=283), electroencephalography (n=253), carotid Doppler echocardiography (n=185), and brain magnetic resonance imaging (n=10). Only brain CT scan and electroencephalography yielded diagnoses in 5 (2%) and 6 patients (2%), respectively with history consistent with seizures or stroke. Cardiovascular tests providing the highest diagnostic yields (postural blood pressure check in 52 [30%], head-up tilt-table test in 32 [24%], and electrophysiologic study in 5 [16%]) were used in 176 (27%), 132 (20%), and 31 patients (5%), respectively. Differences in the use of some tests were noted at the participating hospitals and over time (1994 vs 1998). The total number of diagnosed cases was similar for patients undergoing evaluation by primary care physicians alone (65/103 [63%]), compared with cardiology (48/85 [56%]), neurology (29/48 [60%]), or both (81/141 [57%]). After a mean (+/- SD) length of stay of 5 +/-4 days, 320 (49%) of 649 cases remained undiagnosed. Conclusions: Despite a reduction in the use of some tests (eg, brain CT scan and carotid Doppler) over time, lower-yield neurologic tests were over-used and higher-yield cardiovascular tests were likely underused. The untargeted, seemingly random use of specialty evaluations did not seem to contribute to an increase in the overall number of diagnosed cases. Increased use of specific tests directed by history and results of physical examination may improve diagnostic yield and decrease the cost of evaluating syncope.

To clarify the clinical validity and feasibility of the diagnostic scheme for seizures and epilepsy proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) in 2001 (the 2001 Scheme) and the report of the ILAE classification core group in 2006 (the 2006 Report). Methods. One hundred consecutive patients with epilepsy who visited the Neurology Clinic (Group 1) and 100 patients with intractable epilepsy who had undergone prolonged scalp video-EEG monitoring (Group 2) in Kyoto University Hospital were enrolled. The 2001 Scheme (Axis 1 to 4) and the 2006 Report (seizure types and epileptic, syndromes) were applied to Group I. Axis 1 was applied to Group 2 to evaluate the diversity of seizure semiology. Results. Group I demonstrated 145 seizures of different types (generalized tonic-clonic seizures: 23%, complex partial seizures (CPS): 29%, simple partial seizures: 210% and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures: 21'% according to the 1981 classification. In Axis 1 (ictal phenomenology) of the 2001 scheme, 184 and 333 items were listed in Groups I and 2, respectively, and seizure semiology was described independent of EEG findings. However, there Was duplications or discordance among the items. In Axis 2 (seizure types) of Group 1, 62% and 26% of CPS were further labeled as focal motor or sensory seizures, respectively; the remainder (24%) did not meet inclusion criteria for any category. In Axis 3 (epilepsy syndromes), 94% of patients were sorted, and familial temporal lobe epilepsy was added. Axis 4 described detailed etiology. Application of seizure types of the 2006 Report required consideration of ictal phenomenology to determine spread patterns. Epileptic syndromes of the 2006 Report were assignable to 70% of patients. Conclusions. It is important to achieve intra- and inter-axial accordance for the establishment of a more practical diagnostic scheme, which may provide a more useful tool for the diagnosis of less obvious aspects of epilepsy.

Regression was associated with loss of sociability, interest in toys, and other behavioral skills, without motor regression. After months or longer, language usually returns, but variably severe autistic features persist. Nonverbal cognitive skills may or may not be affected. Some parents recall some antecedent nonspecific illness or stressor like the absence of a parent, a move, or the birth of a sibling. Occasionally, regression seems temporally related to an epileptic seizure, suggesting an overlap with acquired epileptic aphasia (Landau-Kleffner syndrome-LKS) in which language regression is associated with either clinical seizures or subclinical perisylvian temporo-parietal epileptiform EEG activity. LKS onset peaks at 4-6 years, autistic regression before age 2 years and is infrequently associated with seizures or an epileptiform EEG, except in the rare case of disintegrative disorder, a late global autistic regression which, like LKS, may be associated with electrical status epilepticus in slow wave sleep. Mute or dysfluent children with LKS, autism, or developmental language disorders are unable to decode or have difficulty decoding acoustically presented language (speech). They are at higher risk for epilepsy than fluent children with the typically aberrant language of verbal children with autism. The pathogenesis of language regression remains unknown because autistic toddlers are rarely studied at the time of language regression so that no empirically validated effective treatment has yet been devised.

Current techniques utilizing electromyographic (EMG) recordings of vocal tract movements are useful for physically healthy individuals but fail for tetraplegic individuals who do not have accurate voluntary control over the speech articulators. Alternative methods utilizing EMG from other body parts (e.g., hand, arm, or facial muscles) or electroencephalography (EEG) can provide capable silent communication to severely paralyzed users, though current interfaces are extremely slow relative to normal conversation rates and require constant attention to a computer screen that provides visual feedback and/or cueing. We present a novel approach to the problem of silent speech via an intracortical microelectrode brain-computer interface (BCI) to predict intended speech information directly from the activity of neurons involved in speech production. The predicted speech is synthesized and acoustically fed back to the user with a delay under 50 ms. We demonstrate that the Neurotrophic Electrode used in the BCI is capable of providing useful neural recordings for over 4 years, a necessary property for BCIs that need to remain viable over the lifespan of the user. Other design considerations include neural decoding techniques based on previous research involving BCIs for computer cursor or robotic arm control via prediction of intended movement kinematics from motor cortical signals in monkeys and humans. Initial results from a study of continuous speech production with instantaneous acoustic feedback show the BCI user was able to improve his control over an artificial speech synthesizer both within and across recording sessions. The success of this initial trial validates the potential of the intracortical microelectrode-based approach for providing a speech prosthesis that can allow much more rapid communication rates.

Such a stimulus provides a unique opportunity for understanding the neural basis of visual perception because it dissociates the perception from the visual input. In this paper we focus on extracting the percept-related features of the induced activity from the local field potential (LFP) in monkey visual cortex for decoding its bistable structure-from-motion (SFM) perception. Because of the dissociation between the perception and the stimulus in our experimental paradigm, the stimulus-evoked activity in our data is not related to perception. Our proposed feature extraction approach consists of two stages. First, we estimate the stimulus-evoked activity via a wavelet transform based method and remove it from the single trials of each channel. Second, we use the common spatial patterns (CSP) approach to design spatial filters based on the remaining induced activity of multiple channels to extract the percept-related features. We exploit the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier on the extracted features to decode the reported perception on a single-trial basis. We apply the proposed approach to the multichannel intracortical LFP data collected from the middle temporal (MT) visual cortex in a macaque monkey performing a SFM task. We demonstrate that our approach is effective in extracting the discriminative features of the percept-related induced activity from LFP, which leads to excellent decoding performance. We also discover that the enhanced gamma band synchronization and reduced alpha band desynchronization may be the underpinnings of the induced activity.

Recently, however, interest in these signals was spurred as they were proposed Lis potential control signals for neuronal motor prostheses, i.e., for devices fit to record and decode brain activity to restore motor functions in paralyzed patients. Little is known, however, about the functional significance of these cortical field potentials. Here we compared information about arm movement direction in two types of movement related cortical field potentials, obtained during a four direction center-out arm reaching paradigm: local field potentials (LFPs) recorded with intracortical micro-electrodes from monkey motor cortex, and epicortical field potentials (EFPs) recorded with macro-electrode arrays subdurally implanted oil the surface of the human cerebral cortex. While monkey LFPs showed a typical sequence of positive and negative potential peaks, an initial negative peak was the most salient feature of human EFPs. Individual contralateral LFPs from the monkey motor cortex carried approximately twice as Much decoded information (DI) about arm movement direction (median 0.27 bit) as did individual EFPs from the contralateral hand/arm area of primary motor cortex in humans (median 0.12 bit). This relation was similar to the relation between median peak signal-to-noise ratios for directional modulation of movement related potentials (MRPs) of both types of signals. We discuss possible reasons for the observed differences, amongst them epi- vs. intracortical recording and the different electrode dimensions used to measure EFPs and LFPs. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

To address this question, we adopt a unique experimental paradigm in which bistable structure-from-motion (SFM) stimuli are employed to dissociate the visual input from perception while monitoring the cortical neural activity called local field potential (LFP). Consequently, the stimulus-evoked activity of UP is not related to perception but the oscillatory induced activity of LFP may be percept-related. In this paper we focus on extracting the percept-related features of the induced activity from UP in a monkey's Visual cortex for decoding its bistable structure-from-motion perception. We first estimate the stimulus-evoked activity via a wavelet-based method and remove it from the single-trial LFP. We then use the common spatial patterns (CSP) approach to design spatial filters to extract the percept-related features from the remaining induced activity. We exploit the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier on the extracted features to decode the reported perception on a single-trial basis. We demonstrate that our approach has excellent performance in estimating the stimulus-evoked activity, outperforming the Wiener filter, least mean square (LMS), and a local regression method called the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS), and that our approach is effective in extracting the discriminative features of the percept-related induced activity from LFP, which leads to excellent decoding performance. We also discover that the enhanced gamma band synchronization and reduced alpha band desynchronization may be the underpinnings of the induced activity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Starting from the dichotomy between the pragmatic models, for which metaphor is a semantic anomaly, and the direct access models, where metaphor is seen as similar to literal language, the cognitive and linguistic processes involved in metaphor comprehension are analyzed using behavioural data (RTs) and neuropsychological indexes (ERPs). 36 subjects listened to 160 sentences equally shared in the variables content (metaphorical vs literal) and congruousness (anomalous vs not semantically anomalous). The ERPs analysis showed two negative deflections (N3-N4 complex), that indicated different cognitive processes involved in sentence comprehension. Repeated measures ANOVA, applied to peak amplitude and latency variables, suggested in fact N4 as index of semantic anomaly (incongruous stimuli), more localized in posterior (Pz) area, while N3 was sensitive to the content variable: metaphor sentences had an ampler deflection than literal ones and posteriorly distributed (Oz). Adding this results with behavioral data (no differences for metaphor vs literal), it seems that the difference between metaphorical and literal decoding isn't for the cognitive complexity of decoding (direct or indirect access), but for its representation format, which is more iconic for metaphor (as N3 suggests).

Our system uses an adaptive algorithm, based on kernel partial least squares classification (KPLS), to associate patterns in multichannel EEG frequency spectra with cursor controls. Our first BCI, Target Practice, is a system for one-dimensional device control, in which participants use biofeedback to learn voluntary control of their EEG spectra. Target Practice uses a KPLS classifier to map power spectra of 62-electrode EEG signals to rightward or leftward position of a moving cursor on a computer display. Three subjects learned to control motion of a cursor on a video display in multiple blocks of 60 trials over periods of up to six weeks. The best subject's average skill in correct selection of the cursor direction grew from 58% to 88% after 13 training sessions. Target Practice also implements online control of two artifact sources: 1) removal of ocular artifact by linear subtraction of wavelet-smoothed vertical and horizontal electrooculograms (EOG) signals, 2) control of muscle artifact by inhibition of BCI training during periods of relatively high power in the 40-64 Hz band. The second BCI, Think Pointer, is a system for two-dimensional cursor control. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) are triggered by four flickering checkerboard stimuli located in narrow strips at each edge of the display. The user attends to one of the four beacons to initiate motion in the desired direction. The SSVEP signals are recorded from 12 electrodes located over the occipital region. A KPLS classifier is individually calibrated to map multichannel frequency bands of the SSVEP signals to right-left or up-down motion of a cursor on a computer display. The display stops moving when the user attends to a central fixation point. As for Target Practice, Think Pointer also implements wavelet-based online removal of ocular artifact; however, in Think Pointer muscle artifact is controlled via adaptive normalization of the SSVEP. Training of the classifier requires about 3 min. We have tested our system in real-time operation in three human subjects. Across subjects and sessions, control accuracy ranged from 80% to 100% correct with lags of 1-5 s for movement initiation and turning. We have also developed a realistic demonstration of our system for control of a moving map display (http://ti.are.nasa.gov/).

Transmission of Facial Expressions of Emotion Co-Evolved with Their Efficient Decoding in the Brain: Behavioral and Brain Evidence	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VISUAL RECOGNITION; SPATIAL SCALES; ERP EVIDENCE; FACE; INFORMATION; AMYGDALA; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; OBJECTS; DISCRIMINATION	Competent social organisms will read the social signals of their peers. In primates, the face has evolved to transmit the organism's internal emotional state. Adaptive action suggests that the brain of the receiver has co-evolved to efficiently decode expression signals. Here, we review and integrate the evidence for this hypothesis. With a computational approach, we co-examined facial expressions as signals for data transmission and the brain as receiver and decoder of these signals. First, we show in a model observer that facial expressions form a lowly correlated signal set. Second, using time-resolved EEG data, we show how the brain uses spatial frequency information impinging on the retina to decorrelate expression categories. Between 140 to 200 ms following stimulus onset, independently in the left and right hemispheres, an information processing mechanism starts locally with encoding the eye, irrespective of expression, followed by a zooming out to processing the entire face, followed by a zooming back in to diagnostic features (e.g. the opened eyes in "fear'', the mouth in "happy''). A model categorizer demonstrates that at 200 ms, the left and right brain have represented enough information to predict behavioral categorization performance.

The Impact of Microarray Technology in Brain Cancer	OUTCOME PREDICTION IN CANCER			English	Article; Book Chapter							DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED GENES; DNA MICROARRAYS; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION; GLIOMAS; PREDICTION; PROFILES; LYMPHOMA; TUMORS; OVEREXPRESSION	The analysis of global gene expression patterns (expression profiling) produced from the microarray technology (cDNAs and tissue microarrays), has made important contributions to our understanding of the regulation of biological systems and gene function. Recently, it is becoming increasingly significant for the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of brain cancer. Conventional methods used for brain tumour diagnosis utilize modalities (CT, MRI, PET, EEG, Biopsy and Lumbar Puncture) that provide medical information. The genomic analysis used to supplement such medical information is expected to provide appropriate tools for early diagnosis and effective therapy of cancer. Microarray-based clustering and classification methods have been used to reclassify the brain tumours already known by the World Health Organization (WHO) and/or discover new sub-types. Unsupervised and supervised classification methods that have been tested on different brain tumour types using gene expression data as input, have shown promising efficiency. This fact offers great potential to the clinicians that are now able to develop new methods of treatment based on gene therapy instead of applying the traditional ones (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy etc.). This chapter attempts to reveal the important role of genomics in brain cancer. Several genomic-based methods for brain cancer analysis are reviewed and compared to traditional ones with an emphasis to DNA microarray technology that was recently introduced. Finally, feature genomic-based developments that will assist the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of brain cancer are presented.

Clinical material comprised 25 patients with depression and an equal number of gender and aged-matched healthy controls. All subjects were evaluated by a computerized version of the digit span Wechsler test. EEG activity was recorded and digitized from 15 scalp electrodes (leads). Seventeen features related to the shape of the waveform were generated and were employed in the design of an optimum support vector machine (SVM) classifier at each lead. The outcomes of those SVM classifiers were selected by a majority-vote engine (MVE), which assigned each subject to either the normal or depressive classes. MVE classification accuracy was 94% when using all leads and 92% or 82% when using only the right or left scalp leads, respectively. These findings support the hypothesis that depression is associated with dysfunction of right hemisphere mechanisms mediating the processing of information that assigns a specific response to a specific stimulus, as those mechanisms are reflected by the P600 component of ERPs. Our method may aid the further understanding of the neurophysiology underlying depression, due to its potentiality to integrate theories of depression and psychophysiology.

Design: Using training and test datasets of 35 polysomnograms each, we assessed the correlations of an electrocardiogram-based measure of cardiopulmonary interactions with respect to standard sleep staging, as well as to the cyclic alternating pattern classification. The pattern of coupling in 15 healthy individuals was also assessed. Setting: American Academy of Sleep Medicine Accredited Sleep Disorders Center. Interventions: None. Measurements and Results: From a continuous, single-lead electrocardiogram, we extracted both the normal-to-normal sinus interbeat interval series and a corresponding electrocardiogram-derived respiration signal. Employing Fourier-based techniques, the product of the coherence and cross-power of these 2 simultaneous signals was used to generate a spectrographic representation of cardiopulmonary coupling dynamics during sleep. This technique shows that non-rapid eye movement sleep in adults demonstrates spontaneous abrupt transitions between high- and low-frequency cardiopulmonary coupling regimes, which have characteristic electroencephalogram, respiratory, and heart-rate variability signatures in both health and disease. Using the kappa statistic, agreement with standard sleep staging was poor (training set 62.7 %, test set 43.9 %) but higher with cyclic alternating pattern scoring (training set 74 %, test set 77.3 %). Conclusions: A sleep spectrograrn derived from information in a single-lead electrocardiogram can be used to dynamically track cardiopulmonary interactions. The 2 distinct (bimodal) regimes demonstrate a closer relationship with visual cyclic alternating pattern and non-cyclic alternating pattern states than with standard sleep stages. This technique may provide a complementary approach to the conventional characterization of graded non-rapid eye movement sleep stages.

Part I: Information and meaning in nonconvergent and nonlocal brain dynamics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIFURCATION AND CHAOS			English	Review						electroencephalogram (EEG); information; meaning; neurodynamics; perception; sensation	SPATIAL-PATTERNS; OLFACTORY EEG; SYNCHRONOUS SPIKING; STATE TRANSITIONS; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; TIME-SERIES; GAMMA EEGS; SCALP EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION	The aim of this tutorial is to document a novel approach to brain function, in which the key to understanding is the capacity of brains for self-organization. The property that distinguishes animals from plants is the capacity for directed movement through the environment, which requires an organ capable of organizing information about the environment and predicting the consequences of self-initiated actions. The operations of predicting, planning acting, detecting, and learning comprise the process of intentionality by which brains construct meaning. The currency of brains is primarily meaning and only secondarily information. The information processing metaphor has dominated neurocognitive research for half a century. Brains certainly process information for input and output. They pre-process sensory stimuli before constructing meaning, and they post-process cognitive read-out to control appropriate action and express meaning. Neurobiologists have thoroughly documented sensory information processing bottom-up, and neuropsychologists have analyzed the later stages of cognition top-down, as they are expressed in behavior. However, a grasp of the intervening process of perception, in which meaning forms, requires detailed analysis and modeling of neural activity that is observed in brains during meaningful behavior of humans and other animals. Unlike computers, brains function hierarchically. Sensory and motor information is inferred from pulses of microscopic axons. Meaning is inferred from local mean fields of dendrites in mesoscopic and macroscopic populations. This tutorial is aimed to introduce engineers to an experimental basis for a theory of meaning, in terms of the nonlinear dynamics of the mass actions of large neural populations that construct meaning. The focus is on the higher frequency ranges of cortical oscillations. Part I introduces background on information, meaning and oscillatory activity (EEG). Part II details the properties of wave packets. Part III describes the covariance structure of the oscillations. Part IV addresses the amplitude modulations, and Part V deals with the phase modulations. The significance of a theory of meaning lies in applications using population neurodynamics, to open new approaches for treatment of clinical brain disorders, and to devise new machines with capacities for autonomy and intelligence that might approach those of simpler free-living animals.

METHODS: Two-hundred fifteen stereotactic implantations of multilead intracerebral electrodes were performed in 211 patients (4 patients were explored twice), who showed variable patterns of localizing incoherence among electrical (interictal/ictal scalp electroencephalography), clinical (ictal semeiology), and anatomic (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) investigations. MRI scanning showed a lesion in 134 patients (63%; associated with mesial temporal sclerosis in 7) and no lesion in 77 patients(37%; with mesial temporal sclerosis in 14 patients). A total of 2666 electrodes (mean, 12.4 per patient) were implanted (unilaterally in 175 procedures and bilaterally in 40). For electrode targeting, stereotactic stereoscopic cerebral angiograms were used in all patients, coupled with a coregistered three-dimensional MRI scan in 108 patients. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-three patients (87%) were scheduled for resective surgery after SEEG recording, and 174 have undergone surgery thus far. Resections sites were temporal in 47 patients (27%), frontal in 55 patients (31.6%), parietal in 14 patients (8%), occipital in one patient (0.6%), rolandic in one patient (0.6%), and multilobar in 56 patients (32.2%). Outcome on seizures (Engel's classification) in 165 patients with a follow-up period of more than 12 months was: Class I, 56.4%; Class II, 15.1 %; Class III, 10.9%; and Class IV, 17.6%. Outcome was significantly associated with the results of MRI scanning (P = 0.0001) and with completeness of lesion removal (P = 0.038). Morbidity related to electrode implantation occurred in 12 procedures (5.6%), with severe permanent deficits from intracerebral hemorrhage in 2 (1%) patients. CONCLUSION: SEEG is a useful and relatively safe tool in the evaluation of surgical candidates when noninvasive investigations fail to localize the epileptogenic zone. SEEG-based resective surgery may provide excellent results in particularly complex drug-resistant epilepsies.

Even though several attempts have been made to automate the classification process, so far no method has been published that has proven its validity in a study including a sufficiently large number of controls and patients of all adult age ranges. The present paper describes the development and optimization of an automatic classification system that is based on one central EEG channel, two EOG channels and one chin EMG channel. It adheres to the decision rules for visual scoring as closely as possible and includes a structured quality control procedure by a human expert. The final system (Somnolyzer 24 x 7(TM)) consists of a raw data quality check, a feature extraction algorithm ( density and intensity of sleep/wake-related patterns such as sleep spindles, delta waves, SEMs and REMs), a feature matrix plausibility check, a classifier designed as an expert system, a rule-based smoothing procedure for the start and the end of stages REM, and finally a statistical comparison to age- and sex-matched normal healthy controls (Siesta Spot Report(TM)). The expert system considers different prior probabilities of stage changes depending on the preceding sleep stage, the occurrence of a movement arousal and the position of the epoch within the NREM/REM sleep cycles. Moreover, results obtained with and without using the chin EMG signal are combined. The Siesta polysomnographic database (590 recordings in both normal healthy subjects aged 20-95 years and patients suffering from organic or nonorganic sleep disorders) was split into two halves, which were randomly assigned to a training and a validation set, respectively. The final validation revealed an overall epoch-by-epoch agreement of 80% (Cohen's kappa: 0.72) between the Somnolyzer 24 x 7 and the human expert scoring, as compared with an inter-rater reliability of 77% (Cohen's kappa: 0.68) between two human experts scoring the same dataset. Two Somnolyzer 24 x 7 analyses ( including a structured quality control by two human experts) revealed an inter-rater reliability close to 1 (Cohen's kappa: 0.991), which confirmed that the variability induced by the quality control procedure, whereby approximately 1% of the epochs (in 9.5% of the recordings) are changed, can definitely be neglected.

Cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) is the expression of rhythmic arousability during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. CAP parameters, arousals and conventional sleep measures were studied in narcoleptic patients with cataplexy. Patients and methods: Data were collected from all-night polysomnographic (PSG) recordings and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) on the intervening day of 25 drug-naive patients (10 males and 15 females; mean age: 34 16 years) after adaptation and exclusion of other sleep disorders. A group of 25 age- and gender-matched normal sleepers were selected as controls. Each PSG recording was subdivided into sleep cycles. Analysis of CAP included classification of A phases into subtypes A1, A2, and A3. Results: There was an increase in sleep period time mainly due to an increased wake time after sleep onset. REM latency was sharply reduced. The percentage of NREM sleep was slightly reduced and the balance between light sleep (S1 + S2) and deep sleep (S3 + S4) showed a curtailment of the former, while deep sleep was slightly increased. Excluding sleep cycles with sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs), the duration of ordered sleep cycles was not different between narcoleptics and controls. The two groups showed similar values of arousal index, while CAP time, CAP rate, number of CAP cycles and of phase A subtypes (in particular subtypes All were significantly reduced in narcoleptic patients. Conclusions: The reduced periods of CAP in narcoleptic NREM sleep could be the electroencephalographic (EEG) expression of a generally reduced arousability or an increased strength of sleep-promoting forces in the balance between sleep and arousal systems. This can explain some of the clinical correlates of the disorder, i.e. excessive sleepiness, short sleep latency and impaired attentive performances, even without any sign of arousal-induced sleep fragmentation.

The abdominal and thoracic respiration signals are separated into spectral components by using multi-resolution DWT. Then the energy of these spectral components are applied to the inputs of the ANN. The neural network was configured to give three outputs to classify the SAS situation of the subject. The apnea can be mainly classified into three types: obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea (CSA) and mixed sleep apnea (MSA). During OSA, the airway is blocked while respiratory efforts continue. During CSA the airway is open, however, there are no respiratory efforts. In this paper we aim to classify sleep apnea in one of three basic types: obstructive, central and mixed. A significant result was obtained. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Seizures occur in similar to1.8-5/1,000 live births in this country and are caused by virtually any condition that affects neonatal brain function. This review provides a simple classification of seizures and emphasizes that many abnormal intermittent behaviors in this age group are not accompanied by ictal EEG patterns. Additionally, less than or equal to50% of neonatal seizures are not associated with abnormal clinical behavior. This is a common phenomenon, particularly after anticonvulsant treatment in which the clinical seizures are suppressed but electrographic seizures continue unabated. Seizures also may be caused by genetic disorders, several of which are benign, familial, and caused by channelopathies involving potassium channels. The review also discusses the epileptic syndromes seen in neonates, including early myoclonic encephalopathy, Ohtahara syndrome, pyridoxine dependency, and glucose transporter type 1 syndrome.

The method simultaneously segments and identifies the dynamical modes by using predictive models. In extension to previous approaches, it allows an identification of smooth transition between successive modes. The method can be used for analysis, diagnosis, prediction, and control. Tn an application to EEG and respiratory data recorded from humans during afternoon naps, the obtained segmentations of the data agree with the sleep stage segmentation of a medical expert to a large extent. However, in contrast to the manual segmentation, our method does not require a priori knowledge about physiology. Moreover, it has a high temporal resolution and reveals previously unclassified details of the transitions. In particular, a parameter is found that is potentially helpful for vigilance monitoring. We expect that the method will generally be useful for the analysis of nonstationary dynamical systems, which are abundant in medicine, chemistry, biology and engineering.

WaveSim Transform for Multi-Channel signal data mining through linear regression PCA	ADVANCED DATA MINING AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Advanced Data Mining and Applications	AUG 14-16, 2006	Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA	Xian Software Pk, Web Informat Syst Engn Soc, IEEE Queensland Sect, Univ Queensland				Temporal data mining is concerned with the analysis of temporal data and finding temporal patterns, regularities, trends, clusters in sets of temporal data. In this paper we extract regression features from the coefficients obtained by applying WaveSim Transform on Multi-Channel signals. WaveSim Transform is a reverse approach for generating Wavelet Transform like coefficients by using a conventional similarity measure between the function f(t) and the wavelet. WaveSim transform provides a means to analyze a temporal data at multiple resolutions. We propose a method for computing principal components when the feature is of linear regression type i.e. a line. The resultant principal component features are also lines. So through PCA we achieve dimensionality reduction and thus we show that from the first few principal component regression lines we can achieve a good classification of the objects or samples. The techniques have been tested on an EEG dataset recorded through 64 channels and the results are very encouraging.

A potential BCI application is that patients may control a neuro-prosthetic robot directly from their brain so that they can achieve virtual interaction with environment. Therefore, a BCI supports multi-dimensional control is highly demanded for a multi-dimensional robot. We hypothesized that human intentions to move his right, left hand, leg and tongue can be detected by the somatotopic spatial activation patterns from single-trial MEG signal. Under reliable detection, human can intentionally control a two-dimensional robotic motion; right, left, up and down. The hypothesis was tested offline; the classification was performed on beta band activation (15-30Hz) of SAM virtual channels. Cross-validation results using linear discrimination provided high detection accuracy (70-90%) when considering a random level of 25%. We demonstrated that noninvasive BCI methods may support reliable multi-dimensional control of neuro-prosthetic robotics.

In this paper, we implemented a three-class BCI manipulated through imagination of left hand, right hand and foot movements, inducing different spatial patterns of event-related desynchronization (ERD) on mu rhythms over the sensory-motor cortex. A two-step training approach was proposed including consecutive steps of online adaptive training and offline training. Then, the optimized parameters and classifiers were utilized for online control. This paradigm facilitated three directional movement controls which could be easily applied to help the motion-disabled to operate a wheelchair. The average online and offline classification accuracy on five subjects was 79.48% and 85.00% respectively, promoting the three-class motor imagery based BCI a promising means to realize brain control of a mobile device.

Recently, methodological progress has led to a revival of interest in brain oscillations (i.e., a band of periodic neuronal frequencies with a wave-duration from milliseconds to several seconds which may code and decode information). These oscillations will nurture future information processing research during normal and pathological brain development, allowing us to investigate basic neuronal connectivity as well as interactions of brain systems and their modulation (e.g., by temporal neuronal synchronisation) as close correlates of behaviour and intermediate phenotypes from genes to behavioural variations. Especially, a systematic neurodynamic look at transitional processes from rest to stimulus-triggered goal-directed performance will aid behavioural understanding and guidance of children. Preliminary data suggest two separate oscillatory mechanisms in this respect. One is ongoing from pre- to post-stimulus processing and related to quantitative modification of behaviour, while another is merely related to qualitative effects of behaviour and reflects 'on-top' post-stimulus processing by temporal neuronal synchronisation of the oscillatory network in question. Suggested neurodynamic models may be tested in multilevel clinical experiments as well as in the framework of computational neuropsychiatry.

Although researchers have argued that this temporal coding is critical in human memory and perception, no supporting data from humans have been reported. This study provides the first analysis of the temporal relationship between brain oscillations and single-neuron activity in humans. Recording from 1924 neurons, we find that neuronal activity in various brain regions increases at specific phases of brain oscillations. Neurons in widespread brain regions were phase locked to oscillations in the theta-(4-8 Hz) andgamma-(30-90 Hz) frequency bands. In hippocampus, phase locking was prevalent in the delta( 1-4 Hz) and gamma-frequency bands. Individual neurons were phase locked to various phases of theta and delta oscillations, but they only were active at the trough of gamma oscillations. These findings provide support for the temporal-coding hypothesis in humans. Specifically, they indicate that theta and delta oscillations facilitate phase coding and that gamma oscillations help to decode combinations of simultaneously active neurons.

The broad overlap of the clinical and bioelectrical symptomatology might reflect a pathogenetic background common to these epilepsies. In order to understand the great phenotypic variability, the clinical symptomatology in 56 sibships with focal sharp waves of genetic origin was analyzed. A genetic determination was assumed if, in addition to the index case, at least one sibling or offspring revealed typical focal sharp waves. The 56 index-cases and their 61 sib/offspring/parents showed a broad spectrum of epileptic and non-epileptic conditions ranging from mild selective performance deficits to severe complex mental retardation, from neonatal seizures, febrile convulsions, and simple rolandic epilepsy to severe epilepsies with minor seizures or ESES. The different conditions are not disease entities but sets of variably weighted symptoms of a complex pathogenetic background, in which a genetic disposition to focal anomalies of brain function is of decisive importance. As can be demonstrated by the data, this genetic liability coincides with other widespread genetic traits, expressed in certain EEG patterns, as well as with lesional pathogenetic factors. The biological background of the genetic focal anomaly is currently unknown. The marked age dependence of the symptoms justifies the assumption of an hereditary impairment of brain maturation.

DEVELOPMENT OF BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE (BCI) MODEL FOR REAL- TIME APPLICATIONS USING DSP PROCESSORS	2009 4TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering	APR 29-MAY 02, 2009	Antalya, TURKEY	IEEE, EMBS		Brain- Computer Interface; DSP Processor; Neural Networks; Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA)		Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are systems that provide translation of the electrical activity of the brain into commands which can control devices in real-time. It is known that most BCI based application involves non-invasive EEG signals in combination with machine learning algorithms for control of devices. Although there has been some real- time implementation of BCI including cursor movements controlled by a person's thoughts, they have not been done as a portable device, but rather as a laboratory experiment controlled using multi- core processors and computers. This paper focuses on real- time implementation of BCI for motor imagery tasks using a floating point DSP processor (TMS320C6713DSK). The proposed work involves FIR based preprocessing Filter to remove extraneous noise including Electrooculogram (EOG) and Electromyographic (EMG) signals followed by feature extraction using time-frequency domain features. The implications of this kind of a development in Brain- Computer Interface would be tremendous since the whole system can be made into a portable device or a System on a Chip (SoC).

We obtain high accuracies by using an SVM classifier and a novel feature. These techniques enable us to maintain fast performance without sacrificing the accuracy, thus making the speller usable in an online mode. In order to further improve the usability, we perform various studies on the data with a view to minimizing the training time required. We present data collected from nine healthy subjects, along with the high accuracies (of the order of 95% or more) measured online. We show that the training time can be further reduced by a factor of two from its current value of about 20 min. High accuracy, fast learning, and online performance make this P300 speller a potential communication tool for severely disabled individuals, who have lost all other means of communication and are otherwise cut off from the world, provided their disability does not interfere with the performance of the speller.

There are almost no prospective studies with premorbid neuropsychometric studies, and retrospective studies typically include isolated cases, or case series that include conditions in which the cause of NCSE itself causes cognitive morbidity. To summarize available data, absence status (ambulatory generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus) would appear to carry no lasting morbidity. Complex partial status epilepticus in ambulatory patients rarely results in measurable permanent neurologic deficit, although rarely, short or long-standing deficits may clearly occur. Because intensive treatment with intravenous anticonvulsants (e.g. benzodiazepines or phenytoin) can confer morbidity, the equation has not yet been made as to whether the morbidity of such intensive treatment for all cases of NCSE exceeds the morbidity of the disease itself. Larger, prospective studies will be needed to truly determine the prognosis in the different types of NCSE, stratified according to associated degrees of impairment (minimally impaired, moderately obtunded, comatose).

In other words, a BCI allows users to act on their environment by using only brain-activity, without using peripheral nerves and muscles. In this paper, we present a BCI that achieves high classification accuracy and high bitrates for both disabled and able-bodied subjects. The system is based on the P300 evoked potential and is tested with five severely disabled and four able-bodied subjects. For four of the disabled subjects classification accuracies of 100% are obtained. The bitrates obtained for the disabled subjects range between 10 and 25 bits/min. The effect of different electrode configurations and machine learning algorithms on classification accuracy is tested. Further factors that are possibly important for obtaining good classification accuracy in P300-based BCI systems for disabled subjects are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The current sources may be modeled as dipoles. The properties of the current dipole sources may be studied by solving either the forward or in verse problems. The forward problem utilizes a volume conductor model for the head, in which the potentials on the conductor surface are computed based on an assumed current dipole at an arbitrary location, orientation, and strength. In the inverse problem, on the other hand, a current dipole, or a group of dipoles, is identified based on the observed EEG. Both the forward and inverse problems are typically solved by numerical procedures, such as a boundary element method and an optimization algorithm. These approaches are highly time-consuming and unsuitable for the rapid evaluation of brain function. in this paper we present a different approach to these problems based on machine learning. We solve both problems using artificial neural networks which are trained off-line using back-propagation techniques to learn the complex source-potential relationships of head volume conduction. Once trained, these networks are able to generalize their knowledge to localize functional activity within the brain in a computationally efficient manner.

Methods: Eighty-one patients with medically refractory TLE who underwent surgical treatment were studied. Patients underwent comprehensive presurgical investigation, including ictal video-EEG recording, H-1 MRS imaging, and volumetric MRI. Outcome was measured using Engel's classification system, condensed into two outcome groups. Two approaches were taken. First, outcome was defined as experiencing worthwhile improvement with >90% reduction of seizure frequency (Classes I, II, and III) or not (Class IV). A second approach was to define outcome as experiencing freedom from seizures following surgery (Class I) or not (Classes II, III, and IV). For each approach, a Bayesian classifier was constructed to predict outcome by calculating the probability of a patient's pattern of results from spectroscopic analysis of the temporal lobes and volumetric analysis of the amygdala and hippocampus being associated with the various outcome groups. Results: The worthwhile improvement classifier correctly predicted the surgical outcomes of 60 of 65 (92%) of patients who experienced worthwhile improvement and 10 of 16 (63%) of patients who did not. The seizure-free classifier correctly predicted the surgical outcomes of 39 of 52 (75%) of patients who became seizure free and 21 of 29 (72%) of patients who did not. Conclusion: MR features are important markers of surgical outcome in patients with TLE and can provide assistance in identifying surgical candidates.

Moreover, new imaging tools allow the investigation of distinct neurotransmitter systems and their modulation by pharmacological intervention. An important feature of multimodal imaging is the possibility to characterize the activation dependencies of different neurotransmitters and provide the experimental tool to test system models of brain function and dysfunction. The combination of measurement techniques with high temporal resolution (e.g. MEG, EEG) and high spatial resolution (e.g. fMRI) facilitate the understanding of local and global systems as well as time characteristics. Moreover, the association of imaging parameters with genetic variations of neurotransmitter systems allows the investigation of neurotransmitter activity and its role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. To overcome the limitations of standard statistical methods, new approaches in machine learning have to be adapted to handle multiple parameters obtained from brain imaging and genetic measurements.

Disabled patients with appropriate physical care and cognitive ability to communicate with their social environment continue to live with a reasonable quality of life over extended periods of time. Near-infrared spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique which utilizes light in the near-infrared range (700 to 1000 nm) to determine cerebral oxygenation, blood flow and metabolic status of localized regions of the brain. In this paper, we describe a study conducted to test the feasibility of using multichannel NIRS in the development of a BCI. We used a continuous wave 20-channel NIRS system over the motor cortex of 5 healthy volunteers to measure oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin changes during left-hand and right-hand motor imagery. We present results of signal analysis indicating that there exist distinct patterns of hemodynamic responses which could be utilized in a pattern classifier towards developing a BCI. We applied two different pattern recognition algorithms separately, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM), to classify the data offline. SVM classified left-hand imagery from right-hand imagery with an average accuracy of 73 % for all volunteers, while HMM performed better with an average accuracy of 89%. Our results indicate potential application of NIRS in the development of BCIs. We also discuss here future extension of our system to develop a word speller application based on a cursor control paradigm incorporating online pattern classification of single-trial NIRS data.

Each method is employed because of specific advantages over the competing alternatives. An example in medical neuro-imaging is the choice between fMRI and MEG modes where fMRI can provide high spatial resolution in comparison to the superior temporal resolution of MEG. The combination of data from varying modes provides the opportunity to infer results that may not be possible by means of any one mode alone. We discuss a Bayesian and learning theoretic framework for enhanced feature extraction that is particularly suited to multi-modal investigations of massive data sets from multiple experiments. In the following Bayesian approach, acquired knowledge (information) regarding various aspects of the process are all directly incorporated into the formulation. This information can come from a variety of sources. In our case, it represents statistical information obtained from other modes of data collection. The information is used to train a learning machine to estimate a probability distribution, which is used in turn by a second machine as a prior, in order to produce a more refined estimation of the distribution of events. The computational demand of the algorithm is handled by proposing a distributed parallel implementation on a cluster of workstations that can be scaled to address real-time needs if required. We provide a simulation of these methods on a set of synthetically generated MEG and EEG data. We show how spatial and temporal resolutions improve by using prior distributions. The method on fMRI signals permits one to construct the probability distribution of the non-linear hemodynamics of the human brain (real data). These computational results are in agreement with biologically based measurements of other labs, as reported to us by researchers from UK. We also provide preliminary analysis involving multi-electrode cortical recording that accompanies behavioral data in pain experiments on freely moving mice subjected to moderate heat delivered by an electric bulb. Summary of new or breakthrough ideas: a) A new method to estimate probability distribution for measurement of nonlinear hemodynamics of brain from a multi-modal neuronal data. This is the first time that such an idea is tried, to our knowledge. b) Breakthrough in improvement of time resolution of fMRI signals using (a) above.

Congruent activity during action and action observation in motor cortex	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						motor cortex; observation; mirror-neuron; macaque; single-unit; brain machine interface	CORTICAL-NEURONS; ACTIVATION; FACILITATION; MOVEMENTS; DIRECTION	A variety of studies have shown that motor cortical areas can be activated by observation of familiar actions. Here, we describe single-neuron responses in monkey primary motor ( MI) and dorsal premotor ( PMd) cortices during passive observation and execution of a familiar task. We show that the spiking modulation, preferred directions, and encoded information of cells in MI and PMd remain consistent during both observation and movement. Furthermore, we find that the presence of a visual target is necessary to elicit this congruent neural activity during observation. These findings along with results from our analysis of the oscillatory power in the beta frequency of the local field potential are consistent with previous imaging and EEG studies that have suggested that congruence between observation and action is a general feature of the motor system, even outside of canonical "mirror" areas. Such congruent activity has proposed relevance to motor learning, mimicry, and communication and has practical applications for the development of motor-cortical neuroprostheses in paralyzed patients.

Design and Assessment of Fuzzy Rules by Multi Criteria Optimization to Classify Anaesthetic Stages	4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (ECIFMBE)	NOV 23-27, 2008	Antwerp, BELGIUM			Depth of anaesthesia; Fuzzy Modelling; Multi Criteria Optimization		Fuzzy rules have been developed to model and predict the time dependent depth profile during induction and maintenance of anesthesia. Features of times series of the frontal EEG measured at 47 patients during the operating theatre were extracted. Expert knowledge has been used to define 5 fuzzy sets for each of the 62*5 linguistic variables. Five anesthetic stages have been represented by 55 fuzzy rules, selected from a large pool of rules. The non dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II) controlled a multi criteria selection. To evaluate the concordance between the expert and the rule assisted classification during optimization procedure five different criteria were included. This multi-criteria evaluation proved to be useful because of the imbalance in the number of depth specific EEG segments and the aim to get good generalization properties. The basic structures of the fuzzy rules which were automatically received by multi-criteria optimization show strong similarities to the rules applied by experts. The generalization ability of the rules to separate the different stages has been assessed in a second step. Patterns of labeled EEG records were generated to test the degree of concordance with the results of the binary coded rules for all five stages. According to the design aims the degree of concordance represented by the Pareto set in the four dimensional space of fitness criteria served us to infer to classifying power. In cooperation with neural networks, sets of fuzzy rules adapted to different feature sets should be implemented in hybrid fuzzy neural software running on small microcontroller to support the anesthetist during operating tasks. The results of the adapted fuzzy rules working as classifiers are compared with two alternative approaches: populations of optimized neural networks and support vector machines. Despite multi-criteria optimization the performances are slightly lower, but the structure is more transparent for experts.

EPILEPTIC DISORDERS			French	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th Interfaces Workshop of Glaxo-Smith-Kline 2001: EEG Odyssey	MAR 02-03, 2001	VERONA, ITALY	Glaxo Smith Kline		epilepsy; EEG; modeling; nonlinear analysis; epileptogenic networks	EPILEPTIC SIGNALS; OLFACTORY SYSTEM; BASIC MECHANISMS; COHERENCE; INTERDEPENDENCIES; EVENTS; ONSET	This work is focused on the study of the epileptogenic zone organization (EZ) in humans, based on the analysis of stereoelectroencephalographic (SEEG) signals with signal processing methods, and more specially those dedicated to the estimation of signal interdependencies. In order to evaluate quantities provided by these methods and in order to relate them to the notion of functional coupling between cerebral structures, we developed a neurophysiologically relevant model able to generate EEG signals from organized networks of neural populations. We showed [2, 3] that the model can produce realistic multichannel epileptiform signals (when compared to real SEEG signals) under certain conditions (excitation/inhibition ratio within populations, uni/bidirectional coupling between populations). In this paper, the model framework is used to evaluate the performance of nonlinear regression analysis as a method to characterize couplings between cerebral structures from SEEG signals they produce. Two quantities, a nonlinear correlation coefficient and a direction index, respectively related to coupling parameters in the model (degree/direction) are presented. These two quantities are measured on real SEEG signals recorded in patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy and candidate for surgical treatment. Results show that the characterization of functional couplings leads to the identification of networks referred to as "epileptogenic networks" and that might be responsible for the triggering of seizures. These results also corroborate our previous results on the classification of temporal lobe epilepsies [4, 5] showing that a recurrent seizure pattern exists that can be classified on the basis of interactions between medial and lateral neocortical structures. From the identified networks, it is also possible to describe "propagation networks" with a different organization is different and which play a major role in the clinical expression of seizures.

Control signals for brain-machine interfaces may be obtained from a variety of sources, each with their own relative merits. Electrocorticography (ECoG) provides better spatial and spectral resolution than scalp electroencephalography and does not include the risks attendant upon penetration of the brain parenchyma associated with single and multiunit recordings. For these reasons, subdural electrode recordings have been proposed as useful primary or adjunctive control signals for brain-machine interfaces. The goal of the present study was to determine if 2D control signals could be decoded from ECoG. Methods. Six patients undergoing invasive monitoring for medically intractable epilepsy using subdural grid electrodes were asked to perform a motor task involving moving a joystick in 1 of 4 cardinal directions (up, down, left, or right) and a fifth condition ("trigger"). Evoked activity was synchronized to joystick movement and analyzed in the theta, alpha, beta, gamma, and high-gamma frequency bands. Results. Movement-related cortical potentials could be accurately differentiated from rest with very high accuracy (83-96%). Further distinguishing the movement direction (up, down, left, or right) could also be resolved with high accuracy (58-86%) using information only from the high-gamma range, whereas distinguishing the trigger condition from the remaining directions provided better accuracy. Conclusions. Two-dimensional control signals can be derived from ECoG. Local field potentials as measured by ECoG from subdural grids will be useful as control signals for a brain-machine interface.

Towards an EMG-controlled prosthetic hand using a 3-D electromagnetic positioning system	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						electroencephalographic (EEG); electromagnetic sensor; electromyographic (EMG); 3-D electromagnetic positioning system		This paper proposes a novel method of using electromyographic (EMG) potentials generated by the forearm muscles during hand and finger movements to control an artificial prosthetic hand worn by an amputee. Surface EMG sensors were used to record a sequence of forearm EMG potential signals via a PC sound card and a novel 3-D electromagnetic positioning system together with a data-glove mounted with 11 miniature electromagnetic sensors used to acquire corresponding human hand pose in real time. The synchronized measurements of hand posture and associated EMG signals stored as prototypes embody a numerical expression of the current hand shape in the form of a series of data frames, each comprising a set of postures and associated EMG data. This allows a computer generated graphical 3-D model, combined with synthesized EMG signals, to be used to evaluate the approach. This graphical user interface could, also enable handicapped users to practice controlling a robotic prosthetic hand using EMG signals derived from their forearm muscles. We believe this task might be made easier using a dictionary of stored task-specific prototype data frames acquired from able-bodied users. By comparing the resulting EMG data frames with stored prototypes, the most likely data frame sequence can be identified and used to control a robotic hand so that it carries out the user's desire. We explore the feasibility of this approach by applying frequency analysis on the signal derived from a multichannel EMG measurement device and identify pattern recognition techniques in the time and frequency domains to determine plausible hand shapes. This approach offers several advantages over existing methods. First, it simplifies the classification procedure, saving computational time and the requirement for the optimization process, and second, it increases the number of recognizable hand shapes, which in turn improves the dexterity of the prosthetic hand and the quality of life for amputees. The database of EMG prototypes could be employed to optimize the accuracy of the system within a machine learning paradigm. By making a range of EMG prototype databases available, prosthetic hand users could train themselves to use their prosthesis using the visual reference afforded by the virtual hand model to provide feedback.

Estimating MI in high dimensional feature spaces is problematic in terms of computation load and accuracy. We propose an independent component analysis based MI estimation (ICA-MI) methodology for feature selection. This simplifies the high dimensional MI estimation problem into multiple one-dimensional MI estimation problems. Nonlinear ICA transformation is achieved using piecewise local linear approximation on partitions in the feature space, which allows the exploitation of the additivity property of entropy and the simplicity of linear ICA algorithms. Number of partitions controls the tradeoff between more accurate approximation of the nonlinear data topology and small-sample statistical variations in estimation. We test the ICA-MI feature selection framework on synthetic, UCI repository, and EEG activity classification problems. Experiments demonstrate, as expected, that the selection of the number of partitions for local linear ICA is highly problem dependent and must be carried out properly through cross validation. When this is done properly, the proposed ICA-MI feature selection framework yields feature ranking results that are comparable to the optimal probability of error based feature ranking and selection strategy at a much lower computational load.

J	Koban, L; Ninck, M; Li, J; Gisler, T; Kissler, J				Koban, Leonie; Ninck, Markus; Li, Jun; Gisler, Thomas; Kissler, Johanna			Processing of emotional words measured simultaneously with steady-state visually evoked potentials and near-infrared diffusing-wave spectroscopy	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							HUMAN BRAIN; BLOOD-FLOW; TIME-COURSE; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; AMYGDALA ACTIVATION; CORTEX; MODULATION; FEAR; PROJECTIONS; ADJECTIVES	Background: Emotional stimuli are preferentially processed compared to neutral ones. Measuring the magnetic resonance blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response or EEG event-related potentials, this has also been demonstrated for emotional versus neutral words. However, it is currently unclear whether emotion effects in word processing can also be detected with other measures such as EEG steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) or optical brain imaging techniques. In the present study, we simultaneously performed SSVEP measurements and near-infrared diffusing-wave spectroscopy (DWS), a new optical technique for the non-invasive measurement of brain function, to measure brain responses to neutral, pleasant, and unpleasant nouns flickering at a frequency of 7.5 Hz. Results: The power of the SSVEP signal was significantly modulated by the words' emotional content at occipital electrodes, showing reduced SSVEP power during stimulation with pleasant compared to neutral nouns. By contrast, the DWS signal measured over the visual cortex showed significant differences between stimulation with flickering words and baseline periods, but no modulation in response to the words' emotional significance. Conclusions: This study is the first investigation of brain responses to emotional words using simultaneous measurements of SSVEPs and DWS. Emotional modulation of word processing was detected with EEG SSVEPs, but not by DWS. SSVEP power for emotional, specifically pleasant, compared to neutral words was reduced, which contrasts with previous results obtained when presenting emotional pictures. This appears to reflect processing differences between symbolic and pictorial emotional stimuli. While pictures prompt sustained perceptual processing, decoding the significance of emotional words requires more internal associative processing. Reasons for an absence of emotion effects in the DWS signal are discussed.

The rationale was that ipsilateral and contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex can be involved in a nonstationary way in the control of unilateral voluntary movements. The movement-related potentials were surface Laplacian-transformed (SL) to reduce head volume conductor effects and to model the response of the primary sensorimotor cortex. The ANN sampled the SL from four or two central channels overlying the primary motor area of both sides in the period of 80 ms preceding the electromyographic response onset in the active muscle. The performance of the ANN was evaluated statistically by calculating the percentage value of agreement between the STs classified by the ANN and those of two investigators (used as a reference). The results showed that both investigator and ANN were capable of selecting STs with the SL maximum in the central area contralateral to the movement (contralateral STs, about 25%), STs with considerable SL values also in the ipsilateral central area (bilateral STs, about 50%), and STs with neither the contralateral nor bilateral pattern ("spatially incoherent" single trials; about 25%). The maximum agreement (64-84%) between the ANN and the investigator was obtained when the ANN used four spatial inputs (P < 0.0000001). Importantly, the common means of all single trials showed a weak or absent ipsilateral response. These results may suggest that a back-propagation ANN could select EEG single trials showing stationary and nonstationary responses of the primary sensorimotor cortex, based on the same spatial criteria as the experimenter.

Methods: Diagnoses were established by standard presurgical evaluations, which included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), ictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), scalp video-EEG monitoring, and intracranial EEG monitoring. After epilepsy surgery, patients were followed up for > 2 years. Results: Sixteen (61.5%) of the 26 became seizure free after surgery, and another eight patients had a favorable outcome. Sixteen of the 26 patients experienced a type of visual aura (i.e., visual hallucination, visual illusion, blindness, or a field defect). Nine patients had both automotor seizures and secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures at different times. Interictal EEG showed correctly localizing spikes in 10 of the 16 patients who became seizure free, and in three of the 10 non-seizure-free patients. MRI correctly localized the lesion in seven of these 16 seizure-free patients, and in three of the 10 non-seizure-free patients. FDG-PET correctly localized the lesion in eight of the 16 seizure-free patients, and in three of nine non-seizure-free patients. Ictal SPECT was performed in 19 patients and correctly localized the lesion in only three of 12 seizure-free patients, and in four of seven non-seizure-free patients. Ictal EEG correctly localized the lesion in 13 of the 16 seizure-free patients, and in five of the 10 non-seizure-free patients. No significant relation was found between the diagnostic accuracy of any modality and surgical outcome. The localizations of epileptogenic zones by these different diagnostic methods were complementary. The concordance of three or more modalities was significantly observed in seizure-free patients (p = 0.042). However, no definite relation was observed between the presence of lateralizing clinical seizure manifestation and surgical outcome (p = 0.108). Conclusions: Some specific auras indicated an occipital epilepsy onset. Various diagnostic methods can be useful to diagnose OLE, and a greater concordance between presurgical evaluation modalities indicates a better surgical outcome.

Some are rapidly forgotten, but others we recognize later. We accurately predicted recognition success with natural scene photographs using single trial magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures of brain activation. Specifically, we demonstrate that MEG responses in the initial 600 ms following the onset of scene photographs allow for prediction accuracy rates up to 84.1% using linear Support-Vector-Machine classification (ISVM). A permutation test confirmed that all ISVM based prediction rates were significantly better than "guessing". More generally, we present four approaches to analyzing brain function using ISVMs. (1) We show that ISVMs can be used to extract spatio-temporal patterns of brain activation from MEG-data. (2) We show ISVM classification can demonstrate significant correlations between comparatively early and late processes predictive of scene recognition, indicating dependencies between these processes over time. (3) We use ISVM classification to compare the information content of oscillatory and event-related MEG-activations and show they contain a similar amount of and largely overlapping information. (4) A more detailed analysis of single-trial predictiveness of different frequency bands revealed that theta band activity around 5 Hz allowed for highest prediction rates, and these rates are indistinguishable from those obtained with a full dataset. In sum our results clearly demonstrate that ISVMs can reliably predict natural scene recognition from single trial MEG-activation measures and can be a useful tool for analyzing predictive brain function.

These patients are not able to manipulate objects or communicate their needs, even though their mental capabilities are intact. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded from the scalp can be used to decode wishes and intentions. BCI approaches are based on a variety of strategies to generate control signals. For example, the control signals may be the result of visual or auditive stimulation or of imaginary motor tasks. The control signals are analyzed by a translation algorithm which associates a signal to a command. Thus, BCI provides a communication channel not based on nerves and muscles. This paper describes the BCI systems developed at the Center for Sensory-Motor Interaction of Aalborg University, with special emphasis on strategies based on non-motor imagery tasks.

Neuropsychological research has yielded contradicting results regarding WM in OCD. Eighteen patients with OCD symptomatology and 20 normal controls (age and sex matched) were subjected to a computerized version of the digit span Wechsler test. EEG activity was recorded from 15 scalp electrodes (leads). A dedicated computer software was developed to read the ERP signals and to calculate features related to the ER-P P600 component (500-800 ms). Nineteen features were generated, from each ER-P-signal and each lead, and were employed in the design of the Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) classifier. Highest single-lead precision (86.8%) was found at the Fp2 and C6 leads. When the output from all single-lead PNN classifiers fed a Majority Vote Engine (MVE), the system classified correctly all subjects, providing a powerful classification scheme. Findings indicated that OCD patients differed from normal controls at the prefrontal and temporo-central brain regions.

This paper deals with the P300-speller application that enables to write a text based on the oddball paradigm. To improve the ergonomics and minimize the cost of such a BCI, reducing the number of electrodes is mandatory. We propose a new algorithm to select a relevant subset of electrodes by estimating sparse spatial filters. A l(1)-norm penalization term, as an approximation of the l(0)-norm, is introduced in the xDAWN algorithm, which maximizes the signal to signal-plus-noise ratio. Experimental results on 20 subjects show that the proposed method is efficient to select the most relevant sensors: from 32 down to 10 sensors, the loss in classification accuracy is less than 5%.

Since the perception of averted gaze and that of direct gaze trigger distinct cognitive processes, the studies on gaze perception have focused separately on these two gaze directions. The perception of averted gaze induces orienting of spatial attention in the gazed-at direction as well as joint attention processes white direct gaze or gaze contact signals interest directed at the observer's self and is often the preliminary to interindividual interactions. Studies in cognitive neuroscience have focused first on averted gaze perception. However, recent studies have emphasised the asymmetries in the processing of direct versus averted gaze. This has Led to a growing interest in the neural substrates of direct gaze perception. This issue has recently started to be actively addressed in our group using fMRI, MEG, EEG and source reconstruction methods. These studies emphasise that the perception of direct gaze elicits early processes that are related to face and eye movement encoding as welt as to emotion and theory-of-mind.

It is well known that only sessile lesions produce epilepsy, but no correlation has been established between the different types of sessile hamartomas and the diverse manifestations of the epilepsy. We correlate anatomic details of the hamartoma and the clinical and neurophysiologic manifestations of the associated epilepsy. Methods: HHs of seven patients with epilepsy (ages 225 years) were classified as to lateralization and connection to the anteroposterior axis of the hypothalamus by using high-resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging. We correlated the anatomic classification with the clinical and neurophysiologic manifestations of the epilepsy as evaluated in long-term (24 h) video-EEG recordings. Results: HHs ranged in size from 0.4 to 2.6 cc, with complete lateralization in six of seven patients. Ictal manifestations showed good correlation with the lobar involvement of ictal/interictal EEGs. These manifestations suggest the existence of two types of cortical involvement, one associated with the temporal lobe, produced by hamartomas connected to the posterior hypothalamus (mamillary bodies), and the other associated with the frontal lobe, seen in lesions connecting to the middle hypothalamus. Conclusions: A consistent clinical and neurophysiologic pattern of either temporal or frontal lobe cortical secondary involvement was found in the patients of our series. It depends on whether the hamartoma connects to the mamillary bodies (temporal lobe cases) or whether it connects to the medial hypothalamus (frontal lobe cases).

Psychosomatic characteristics of anxiety and anxiety-affinitive constitution	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CHINESE MEDICINE			English	Article							RESPIRATORY PATTERNS; TRAIT ANXIETY; STRESS; CATECHOLAMINES; BLOOD; PERSONALITY; OCCLUSION; EXERCISE	In successive studies of the psychosomatic functioning of ill-health according to Oriental and Western medicine in medical students, we established the existence of the psychosomatic characteristics we have provisionally termed the anxiety-affinite constitution at the core of ill-health. Therefore, we conducted this research because our previous investigation showed this constitution included a high complexity of respiratory movement and eye movement with a significant correlation to the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). We examined the correlation between the STAI and somatic function of 88 medical students to identify the psychosomatic characteristics of anxiety and the anxiety-affinitive constitution. These tests included STAI, fractal (EEG, EGG, plethysmogram, respiratory curves, and EMG) and non-fractal (accelerated plethysmogram) dimension analyses, and malocclusion (based on Angle's classification). In particular, EGG, plethysmogram, and respiratory curves are known to have close association with trait anxiety. We were able to discover the correlation between (1)trait anxiety and thoracic and abdominal respiratory movements, and malocclusion (Class III), and (2) the correlation of state anxiety with thoracic respiratory movement, horizontal eye movement, a plethysmogram and an EEG-Pz (in males only). In subsequent study the relation between thoracic dominance and state-trait anxiety and between abdominal dominance and state-trait anxiety should be assessed to develop this research regarding the psychosomatic characteristics of anxiety and the anxiety-affinitive constitution. Further, it is essential to create an anxiety-affinitve constitution index based on multi-regression analysis.

Our aim was to confirm the correlation between the type of aEEG trace and the level of brain damage in newborn infants in the early hours after the hypoxic event and to introduce this method into routine practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: With 56 newborn infants having suffered a perinatal hypoxic event (the average umbilical arterial PH was 6.95, the average BE value -17.3) and in 2 newborn infants after early postnatal hypoxia, aEEG monitoring was performed continually. The aEEG records of brain activity obtained were analyzed using the Hellstrom-Westas classification. The level of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy was evaluated according to the Sarnat-Sarnat classification. Assessment of future neurological development is not included in this work. RESULTS: 12 (21%) of the 56 newborn infants did not develop any hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, 8 (14%) newborn infants had hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) grade 1, 19 (35%) had HIE grade II and 17 (30%) had HIE grade III. The newborn infants without hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy had normal or slightly abnormal aEEG trace. In the case of newborn infants who had HIE grade 1, we recorded a normal or slightly abnormal aEEG trace. In the case of newborn infants who had HIE grade II, we recorded all types of aEEG trace - from normal to seriously pathological. Of the newborn infants who had HIE grade 111, all had a pathological aEEG trace of "burst suppression patterns", low voltage pattern or flat trace pattern. The results show that if a newborn infant had a pathological type of aEEG trace in the early hours after a hypoxic event he or she later developed at least HIE grade II.53% of the newborn infants with a flat aEEG trace later had HIE grade III. CONCLUSION: Cerebral function monitoring is a non-invasive method used for the early assessment of the severity of a hypoxic event. As it could be used in the first few hours after birth, this method could be applied to select patients suitable for therapeutic hypothermia.

In this paper, we present an on-line EMG-MOUSE system that controls movements of a cursor, which are interpretations of 6 pre-defined wrist motions: up, down, left, right, click, and rest. To emphasize a wearability, we designed the hardware in a way that electrodes are located on a circular arm-band which wraps around the forearm. The prototype hardware device has as integrated parts both the EMG electrodes and an amplifier for magnifying EMG signals, without using adhesive to attach the electrodes on the forearm. A Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Network(FMMNN) was used as a classifier. Also, stochastic values such as integral absolute value were used as features for all appropriate classification of the intended wrist motions. From our experiments, we could observe that six distinctive wrist motions can be class fled well, once the patterns are learned.

In this paper, we consider Amari's alpha-divergence as a discrepancy measure and rigorously derive a multiplicative updating algorithm (proposed in our recent work) which iteratively minimizes the alpha-divergence between X and AS. We analyze and prove the monotonic convergence of the algorithm using auxiliary functions. In addition, we show that the same algorithm can be also derived using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions as well as the projected gradient. We provide two empirical study for image denoising and EEG classification, showing the interesting and useful behavior of the algorithm in cases where different values of alpha (alpha = 0.5,1,2) are used.

However, several previous studies show that CSP's performance deteriorates especially when the number of channels is large compared to small number of training datasets. As a result, it is necessary to choose an optimal subset of the whole channels to save computational time and retain high classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic algorithm to select the optimal channels for CSP. The CSP procedure is applied to training datasets firstly and then a channel score based on l(1) norm is defined for each channel. Finally, channels with larger scores are retained for further CSP processing. This approach utilizes CSP procedure twice to select channels and extract features, respectively; hence the complex optimization problem of channel selection for CSP is solved heuristically. We apply our method and other two existing methods to datasets from BCI competition 2005 for comparison and the experiment results show this method provides an effective way to accomplish the task of channel selection.

From a face to its category via a few information processing states in the brain	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							INFERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; VISUAL CATEGORIZATION; EMOTIONAL EXPRESSIONS; THETA OSCILLATIONS; RECOGNITION; RESPONSES; POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION; MEMORY	Cognitive neuroscience assumes a correspondence between specific spatio-temporal patterns of neural activity and the states of a mechanism that processes cognitive information. Mechanistic explanations of cognition should therefore translate patterns of neural activity into the components of a formal mechanism: a set of information processing states and their transitions. For the first time, we carried out this research programme with four naive observers instructed to categorise randomly presented face information. With classification image techniques, we revealed the diagnostic features that the brain requires to produce correct behaviour (i.e., two eyes for gender categorisation in one session; the mouth for expression in the other session). With the same techniques applied to brain signals, we revealed the features processing states associated with modulations of oscillatory EEG energy (measured on occipito-temporal face-sensitive electrodes). Here we show how transitions between distinct feature processing states in the theta/alpha 14-12 Hzj oscillatory bands implement two face categorisations. On the left and right occipito-temporal electrodes of each observer, processing of the contra-lateral eye precedes bilateral integration of the features required for behaviour. For the first time, we relate stimulus information to behaviour via sequences of categorisation-specific feature processing states in the brain. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This is important to enhance the usability, flexibility, and response time of a BC,I. In this work, we show how subjects, after performing cue-based feedback training (smiley paradigm), learned to navigate self-paced through the "freeSpace" virtual environment (VE). Similar to computer games, subjects had the task of picking up items by using the following navigation commands: rotate left, rotate right, and move forward ( three classes). Since the self-paced control paradigm allows subjects to make voluntary decisions on time, type, and duration of mental activity, no cues or routing directives were presented. The BCI was based only on three bipolar electroencephalogram channels and operated by motor imagery. Eye movements (electrooculogram) and electromyographic artifacts were reduced and detected online. The results of three able-bodied subjects are reported and problems emerging from self-paced control are discussed.

This study has adopted an experimentation in which participants were exposed to a set of pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) while their electrical brain activity was recorded with an electroencephalogram (EEG). The pictures were already rated in a previous study via the affective rating system Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) to assess the three dimensions of pleasure, arousal, and dominance. For each picture, we took the mean of these values for all subjects used in this previous study and associated them to the recorded brainwaves of the participants in our study. Correlation and regression analyses confirmed the hypothesis that brainwave measures could significantly predict emotional dimensions. This can be very useful in the case of impassive, taciturn or disabled learners. Standard classification techniques were used to assess the reliability of the automatic detection of learners' three major dimensions from the brainwaves. We discuss the results and the pertinence of such a method to assess learner's emotions and integrate it into a brainwave-sensing Intelligent Tutoring System.

Myoclonus and epilepsy: Diagnosis and pathophysiology	REVUE NEUROLOGIQUE			French	Review						epilepsy; myoclonus; physiology	CORTICAL MYOCLONUS; CLASSIFICATION; PATHOGENESIS; RESPONSES	Myoclonus presents as a sudden brief involuntary jerk triggered by the central nervous system. Electromyographic studies enable determining whether the jerk is caused by a muscular contraction, i.e. positive myoclonus, or by an interruption of muscular activity, i.e. negative myoclonus. Many classifications have been proposed, reflecting our lack of understanding about myoclonus. Myoclonus is a symptom and should never be considered as a diagnosis. Clinical history and physical examination are the basis to diagnosis. Clinical neurophysiology testing can reveal a neuroanatomical localization and certain patterns have some etiological specificity. Etiological hypotheses can be put forward on the basis of clinical and neurophysiological data. The cortex is the most commonly identified source of myoclonus, but the subcortical area and spinal area can also be involved. Myoclonus is considered epileptic when it is combined with an epileptiform discharge on the EEG. The International Classification of Epileptic Syndromes should be applied in this situation. Myoclonic epilepsies are a collection of syndromes in which myoclonic seizures are a prominent feature. Myoclonus can occur as one among several seizure components, as the only manifestation of seizure, or as one of multiple seizure types within an epileptic syndrome. Neurophysiological studies are needed to investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms of the myoclonus. Electrophysiological studies report that myoclonic seizures are produced through a cortical generator via a polysynaptic mechanism acting on muscles. Apparently, the epileptiform discharges stimulate the motor cortex resulting in myoclonus jerk. Despite recent progress, advances are still needed to achieve a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in myoclonus. In myoclonic epileptic syndromes, more useful information can probably be obtained from studies grouping several patients with a same epileptic syndrome than from single case reports.

As the concept of "generalized epilepsies" is from long ago closely related to the thalamo-cortical system, we briefly summarize the functional anatomy, the double working mode of the thalamo-cortical system in different vigilance states and it's role in development of the spike wave pattern. The next part shows weaknesses of this concept from the EEG, seizure semiology, and neuroimaging point of view. Further experimental and clinical arguments are accumulated from the reflex epileptic features in IGE, indicating local/regional cortical hyperexcitability. A separate part is devoted to genetic aspects of the question. Lastly implications to epilepsy classification are shown and an outlook toward a unified epilepsy concept is provided. The epileptic disorder of the thalamo-cortical system is responsible for the development of "generalized", synchronous spike-wave paroxysms as the common neurophysiological background in "primary" - idiopathic and in "secondary" generalized epilepsies. This disorder is specifically related to the burstfiring working mode of the thalamo-cortical system during NREM sleep (is an epileptic exageration of it). The "generalized" epilepsy category should be abandoned, being misleading. Epilepsies are proposed to be classified according to their network properties and relations to different physiological systems of the brain. The different phenotypes, named earlier idiopathic (primary) generalized, or symptomatic (secondary) generalized (with encephalopathic features), should be delineated depending on the following factors: 1. speed and extent of syncronization within the thalamo-cortical system, 2. the way how the thalamo-cortical system is involved, 3. which kind of cortical triggers play role, 4. the degree and level of the disorder (restricted to the molecular level or extended to the level of structural alterations - in the cortex or more diffusely, 5. genetic targets and features.

Generalized spike-wave discharges in children with idiopathic focal epilepsy can suggest a neurobiological continuum with the idiopathic generalized epilepsies. We assessed the prevalence of generalized epileptiform discharges and generalized seizures in BEOP/BCECTS patients. Methods: Between August 2005 and November 2008, we identified 220 cases with electroclinical features typical of idiopathic focal epilepsies, 172 patients with BCECTS and 48 patients with BEOP, excluding patients whose neurological examinations or brain MRI were abnormal. We analyzed gender, age at onset, manifestation of generalized seizures, and serial EEG records to detect generalized abnormalities. Results: Of our population, 42 patients (19.1%, 22 boys), 30 (17.4%) of 172 BCECTS patients and 12 (25.0%) of 48 BEOP patients, showed generalized spike-wave discharges once or more during follow-up. The typical 3-Hz generalized spike wave discharge was noticed in 7 patients and concurrence with clinical generalized seizure was observed in 11. Conclusion: A relatively high incidence of generalized spike-wave discharge and concurrence with generalized seizure were observed in patients with BEOP/BCECTS, with the incidence being higher in BEOP patients than in those with BCECTS. It may be inferred that idiopathic focal epilepsy is not a fixed syndrome but is a part of a broad, age-related, benign, seizure susceptibility syndrome. (C) 2010 British Epilepsy Association.

The MEGs of 20 AD patients and 21 elderly controls were recorded with eyes closed at rest during 5 min from 148 channels. Five spectral parameters were estimated from PSD: mean frequency (MF), individual alpha frequency (IAF), transition frequency (TF), 95% spectral edge frequency (SEF95) and spectral entropy (SE). To reduce the dimensionality of the problem, we applied a principal component analysis. According to our results, MF was the best discriminating index between both groups (85.00% sensitivity, 85.71% specificity) indicating a shift to the left of the power spectrum in AD. A significant MEG slowing was also observed using both IAF (p < 0.001) and TF (p < 0.01). The lowest classification statistics (65% sensitivity, 66.67% specificity) were obtained with SEF95. However, these results were also significant (p < 0.05). This fact points out that there is a variation in the spectral content at high frequencies of AD patients and controls. Finally, a significant decrease of irregularity in the AD group was observed with SE, with results close to those obtained with MF (90.00% sensitivity, 76.19% specificity). In conclusion, a complete description of PSD can help to increase our insight into brain dysfunction in AD and to extract spectral patterns specific to the disease. (C) 2006 IPEM.

Epidemiological studies demonstrate a high comorbidity between nonorganic hypersomnia and mental disorders. Especially comorbidity with affective disorders increases steadily from the general population over primary to tertiary care settings. Diagnostic criteria of nonorganic hypersomnia have been described in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Nonorganic hypersomnia can be primary or associated with a number of psychiatric disorders such as reaction to severe stress or adjustment disorders, affective disorders, other functional disorders, tolerance to or withdrawal of CNS-stimulating substances and chronic use of CNS-sedating substances. Diagnostic procedures comprise case history and symptom evaluation, sleep-specific and supplementary investigations. Concerning the latter, this article will focus on sleep questionnaires, vigilance and psychological tests as well as CNS investigations. Therapy of nonorganic hypersomnia rests on 3 pillars: psychological, somatic and pharmacological treatment. In view of the wide variety of psychiatric causes, resulting in a number of therapeutic options, it seems desirable that apart from subjective clinical assessment also objective methods be used in diagnosis and treatment. On the neurophysiological level objective measures can be obtained by means of EEG mapping during the day and polysomnography at night. Different mental disorder patients show different brain activity patterns as compared with normal controls and different classes of psychotropic substances cause different changes in neuro-physiological variables. The fact that the changes in electrophysiological brain activity caused by mental disorders are exactly opposite to those induced by the psychotropic drugs used for their treatment suggests a key-lock principle in the diagnosis and treatment of nonorganic hypersomnia.

The indicators considered are the time elapsed during a particular number (n) of significant seismic events before the month in question, the slope of the Gutenberg-Richter inverse power law curve for the n events, the mean square deviation about the regression line based on the Gutenberg-Richter inverse power law for the n events, the average magnitude of the last n events, the difference between the observed maximum magnitude among the last n events and that expected through the Gutenberg-Richter relationship known as the magnitude deficit, the rate of square root of seismic energy released during the n events, the mean time or period between characteristic events, and the coefficient of variation of the mean time. Prediction accuracies of the model are evaluated using three different statistical measures: the probability of detection, the false alarm ratio, and the true skill score or R score. The PNN model is trained and tested using data for the Southern California region. The model yields good prediction accuracies for earthquakes of magnitude between 4.5 and 6.0. The PNN model presented in this paper complements the recurrent neural network model developed by the authors previously, where good results were reported for predicting earthquakes with magnitude greater than 6.0.

Vocalizations carry a symbolic representation of a message from the mind of the speaker to a listener (human or machine) who must decode the representation. Machine-based speech interpreters have libraries of sound templates and word and grammar logic systems that assist in decoding a message. Human listeners have some additional information to assist interpretation such as the context of a discourse: the current topic, the time, etc. Though human-to-human discourse is held as the model for delivery of a message from a human to a machine, even speech between humans is sometimes fraught with difficulty in passing meaning. Can we improve sending the meaning of a message from a speaker? In the mind of the speaker is located the content of a message. Can we access information related to that content and help deliver the message? The production of an utterance by the brain of a speaker involves the setting of a message, selection of vocabulary, determination of syntax, fixing of semantics and creation and execution of a motor program that activates the voice. We suggest that it will be possible to assist in content delivery of a message by accessing neural signals related to the production of an utterance. Since 1980, there have been research studies on electrical signals related to brain events related to speech. Current work on these evoked potentials (EPs) has required averaging. However, new techniques are increasing our ability to resolve signal components that are leading us to the "single shot": pattern detection in a single trial. These techniques include: increasing the number of electrodes and new computational methods such as trained neural networks. Importantly, the technique of Independent Components Analysis (ICA) has lead to the ability to discriminate the many signals that summate to create the potentials recorded at the surface of the scalp. ICA initially requires substantial training of a neural network system based on the signals of a large number of electrical sources. However it can then be used to discriminate features of the data set and match a template of those features to subsequent trials. We propose to use the utterance of a word as a timing signal to match ICA templates to the "pre-potential", the EEG signal preceding the utterance. A statistical match could be made with the pre-potential to candidate meanings for the utterance created by the SR system. Preliminary Results We have collected pilot EEG data from a subject who was triggered to utter the sound (tu(I)) at the presentation a visual cue of the randomly presented words "to" or "too". The subject was instructed to speak the word as soon as they saw it presented. The goal was to review the EEG related to the individual trial utterances and determine if there was a robust set of features related to the utterances that could discriminate the different words. EEG data were collected from 28 scalp electrodes and I EOG electrode. Averaged 2-sec EPs related to the visual stimulus presentations under the two different conditions were examined. EPs of two conditions differed largely at site CPz. However, the time courses of single-trials did not always resemble those of the averaged EPs. The trial-to-trial variability made it difficult to distinguish the brain responses under two conditions without further processing. A single-layer perceptron neural network was trained through supervised methods and found a linear boundary between two clusters ('to' and 'too'). The boundary based on the scalp EEG misclassified 19 of a total of 82 trails. ICA was applied to the concatenated 2-sec single-trial epochs from the subject and derived 29 temporally independent components. The averaged activations and scalp topographies of components 6, 8, and 16 suggested that they together account for the large differences in EPs at cite CPz. The trial-to-trial variability was reduced compared to the raw EPs since the contributions of other components were removed from (not projected to) the electrodes. Similarly, the activations of ICA components accounted for the differences in EPs at site T8 were projected and summed at the scalp electrodes. For each trial, the summed projections between 200 and 1400 ms following stimulus presentations at cites CPz and T8 were averaged. The clusters were tighter compared to those from site CPz alone. Again, a single-layer perceptron neural network was trained through supervised methods and found a linear boundary between two clusters ('to' and 'too'). The boundary based on the scalp EEG misclassified I I of a total of 82 traits (13%). Conclusions In this example, ICA separated the distinct brain processes into different independent components and extracted the signals of interest. Mathematically reducing the interference from the other brain or extra-brain activity generators improved the chance to detect small differences in EEG across conditions. It appears feasible that EPs can be used to assist speech recognition.

In rodents, the majority of principal cells in the hippocampus are known to be correlated with the position of the animal. However, the lack of topography in the hippocampal cognitive map does not support the assumption that connections between these cells are able to store and recall distances between coded positions. In contrast, the firing fields of the grid cells in the medial entorhinal Cortex form triangular grids and are organized on metrical principles. We suggest a model in which a hypothesized 'distance cell' population is able to extract metrics from the activity of grid cells. We show that storing the momentary activity pattern of the grid cell system in a freely chosen position by one-shot learning and comparing it to the actual grid activity at other positions results in a distance dependent activity of these cells. The actual distance of the animal from the origin can be decoded directly by selecting the distance cell receiving the largest excitation or indirectly via transmission of local interneurons. We found that direct decoding works up to the longest grid spacing, but fails on smaller scales, while the indirect way provides precise distance determination up to the half of the longest grid spacing. In both cases, simulated distance cells have a multi-peaked, patchy spatial activity pattern consistent with the experimentally observed behavior of granule cells in the dentate gyrus.

Occipital epilepsy: spatial categorization and surgical management	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						epilepsy surgery; epileptogenic lesion; posterior quadrant; video electroencephalography; vision	LOBE EPILEPSY; CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS; PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; POSTERIOR CORTEX; SURGERY; CLASSIFICATION; ELECTRODES; PATTERNS; SEIZURES	Object. Occipital resections for epilepsy are rare. Reasons for this are the relative infrequency of occipital epilepsy, difficulty in localizing epilepsy originating in the occipital lobe, imprecisely defined seizure outcome in patients treated with focal occipital resections in the MR imaging era, and concerns about producing visual deficits. The impact of lesion location on vision and seizure biology, the management decision-making process, and the outcomes following resection need elaboration. Methods. The authors studied 21 consecutive patients who underwent focal occipital resections for epilepsy at Cleveland Clinic Epilepsy Center over a 13-year period during which MR imaging was used. Demographics, imaging, and data relating to the epilepsy and its surgical management were collected. The collateral sulcus, the border between the medial surface and the lateral convexity, and the inferior temporal sulcus were used to subdivide the occipital lobe into medial, lateral, and basal zones. Lesions that did not involve most or all of the occipital lobe (sublobar) were spatially categorized into these zones. Visual function, semiology, and scalp electroencephalography were evaluated in relation to these spatial categories. Preresection and postresection visual function and seizure frequency were evaluated and compared. Lastly, an exhaustive review and discussion of the published literature on occipital resections for epilepsy was carried out. Results. Five lesions were lobar and 16 were sublobar. Patients with medial or lobar lesions had a much greater likelihood of preoperative visual field defects. Those with basal or lateral lesions had a greater likelihood of having a visual aura preceding some or all of their seizures and a trend (not significant) toward having a concordant lateralized onset by scalp electroencephalography. Invasive recordings were used in 8 cases. All patients had lesions (malformations of cortical development, tumors, or gliosis) that were completely resected, as evaluated on postoperative MR imaging. At last follow-up, 17 patients (81%) were seizure free or had only occasional auras (Wieser Class 1 or 2). The remaining 4 patients (19%) had a worthwhile improvement in seizure control (Class 3 or 4). Of the patients for whom both pre- and postoperative visual testing data were available, 50% suffered no new visual deficits, and 17% each developed a new quadrantanopia or a hemianopia. Conclusions. Lesional occipital lobe epilepsy can be successfully managed with resection to obtain excellent seizure-free rates. Individually tailored resections (in lateral occipital lesions, for example) may help preserve intact vision in a Subset of cases (38% in this series). Invasive recordings may further guide surgical decision-making as delineated by an algorithm generated by the authors. The authors' results suggest that the spatial location of the lesion correlates both with the semiology of the seizure and with the presence of visual deficit.

With the parallel evolution of neuroscience; engineering, and rapid computing the era of clinical neuroprosthetics is approaching as a practical reality for people with severe motor impairment. Patients with such diseases as spinal cord injury; stroke, limb loss, and neuromuscular disorders may benefit through the implantation of these brain computer interfaces that serve to augment their ability to communicate and interact with their environment: In the upcoming years, it will be important for the neurosurgeon to understand what a brain computer interface is, its fundamental principle of operation; and what the salient surgical issues are when considering implantation. We review the current state of the field of motor neuroprosthetics research; the early clinical applications, and the essential considerations from a neurosurgical perspective for the future.

Methods: From a group of 481 patients, 123 patients with TSZ (44 females; mean age, 22.9 years; mean age at onset, 7 years; mean duration of epilepsy, 16 years) were selected. A total of 1595 epileptic seizures, documented during video-electroencephalographic monitoring, were analyzed. Patients who had had surgery for epilepsy previously were excluded. Seizures were classified using a semiological seizure classification. Epilepsy syndromes were classified using all test data (electroencephalography, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and single-photon emission tomography). Data were compared using X-2 analysis or the Fisher exact test. Results: More patients with TSZ had extratemporal than temporal lobe epilepsies (79% vs. 1.7%; p < 0.0001) among those with an epilepsy localized to one lobe (n = 306). In the 123 patients, TSZ were part of 170 different seizure evolutions. Seizure evolutions began with TSZ as the first seizure type more often in patients with frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) compared with patients with parieto-occipital lobe epilepsy (POLE) (40% in POLE vs. 67% in FLE; p < 0.05). In contrast, TSZ in POLE were more likely to be preceded by auras (50% in POLE vs. 26% in FLE; p < 0.05). TSZ were bilateral in 129 (76%) and unilateral in 41 (24%) seizure evolutions. Unilateral TSZ correctly lateralized the epilepsy syndrome to the contralateral hemisphere. Conclusion: Analysis of seizure semiology and evolution in patients with TSZ is helpful for differentiating between focal epilepsies of temporal, frontal, and parieto-occipital origin. Unilateral TSZ provide useful information for the lateralization of the epileptic syndrome.

The proposed system is aimed primarily at people who have lost their ability to communicate via conventional means. The investigations presented here are part of our greater search for an appropriate set of features, classifiers and mental tasks that would maximise classification accuracy in such a system. Here Autoregressive (AR) coefficients and Power Spectral Density (PSD) features have been classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classification accuracy was higher with AR features compared to PSD. In addition, the use of an SVM to classify the AR coefficients increased the classification rate by up to 16.3% compared to that reported in different work, where other classifiers were used. It was also observed that the combination of mental tasks for which highest classification was obtained varied from subject to subject; hence the mental tasks to be used should be carefully chosen to match each subject.

Functioal integration can be described in two distinct ways: functional connectivity and effective connectivity. Whereas functional connectivity merely describes the statistical dependence between two time series, the concept of effective connectivity requires a mechanistic model of the causative effects upon which the data to be observed are based. This article summarises the conceptual and methodological principles of modern techniques for the analysis of functional and effective connectivity on the basis of fMRI and electrophysiological data. Particular emphasis is placed on dynamic causal modelling (DCM), a new procedure for the analysis of non-linear neuronal systems. This method has a highly promising potential for clinical applications, e.g., for decoding pathological mechanisms in brain diseases and for the establishment of neurologically valid diagnostic classifications.

J	Janz, D				Janz, D			Epilepsy with grand mal on awakening and sleep-waking cycle	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						epilepsy; sleep; sleep-waking cycle	JUVENILE MYOCLONIC EPILEPSY; IDIOPATHIC GENERALIZED EPILEPSIES; SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCUS; CLASSIFICATION; CHROMOSOME-6; LINKAGE	Awakening epilepsy (AE) is an age related syndrome of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) characterized by generalized tonic clonic seizures (GTCS) occurring predominantly on awakening (independent of the time of day) or at leisure time (almost at evening). The GTCS can be the only symptom or they can be combined with the other subsyndromes of IGE in childhood or adolescence: The EEG shows the characteristics of IGE (generalized spike wave frequent, focal abnormalities rare, photosensitivity increased). The common denominator of external seizures precipitating influences is lack of sleep. The sleep habits of patients with AE who could roughly be characterized as late sleepers and late risers may dispose them to a chronic sleep deficit. Polygraphic studies indicated that their sleep is more unstable and subject to external influences. Microstructural sleep analysis confirms the presence of a disturbance of sleep stability in patients with IGE. Furthermore it clearly shows that in the prototype of AE, the juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, the epileptiform activity during non-REM sleep is correlated with the arousal phase of the so called cyclic alternating pattern indicating that even in the smallest sleep-waking oscillations awakening is the most sensitive part.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the epileptic histories and EEGs of patients with the CDKL5 mutation. Methods: We reviewed the epilepsy histories and electroclinical analyses of three girls aged 9.5, 7.4, and 9.4 years, each with a mutation of the CDKL5 gene. Results: We revealed the presence of an encephalopathy that started by 1.5 months of age. At first, seizures involved tonic spasms or complex partial seizures, and were complicated by the later appearance of complex partial, tonic, and unexpectedly, myoclonic seizures. This form of epilepsy was drug resistant. Routine and prolonged video EEGs both displayed a homogeneous electroclinical pattern consisting of (a) unique background with diffuse high voltage sharp waves of 6-7 Hz, and absence of the typical rhythmic frontal-central theta activity present in Rett syndrome; (b) unique awake and sleep background, with diffuse, high voltage, continuous sharp waves with multifocal and diffuse spikes; (c) rhythmic, diffuse, 15 Hz activity accompanied clinically by tonic seizures; (d) intercritical pattern with pseudoperiodic, diffuse, sharp waves or pseudoperiodic, diffuse spike and polyspike or wave discharges; and (e) diffuse, spike, polyspike and wave discharges accompanied by massive or focal myoclonias or both. Conclusions: Patients with the CDKL5 mutation have an early onset, epileptic encephalopathy in infancy that evolves into myoclonic seizures in childhood with a unique EEG pattern. Significance: Recognizing this type of encephalopathy could be useful in prompting clinicians to proceed further with their diagnostic work in patients not fitting the criteria of classical Rett syndrome.

J	Wilson, GF; Russell, CA				Wilson, GF; Russell, CA			Real-time assessment of mental workload using psychophysiological measures and artificial neural networks	HUMAN FACTORS			English	Article							PATTERN-RECOGNITION METHODS; ADAPTIVE AUTOMATION SYSTEM; TRACKING TASK; EEG-ANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; INDEXES	The functional state of the human operator is critical to optimal system performance. Degraded states of operator functioning can lead to errors and overall suboptimal system performance. Accurate assessment of operator functional state is crucial to the successful implementation of an adaptive aiding system. One method of determining operators' functional state is by monitoring their physiology. In the present study, artificial neural networks using physiological signals were used to continuously monitor, in real time, the functional state of 7 participants while they performed the Multi-Attribute Task Battery with two levels of task difficulty. Six channels of brain electrical activity and eye, heart and respiration measures were evaluated on line. The accuracy of the classifier was determined to test its utility as an on-line measure of operator state. The mean classification accuracies were 85%, 82%, and 86% for the baseline, low task difficulty, and high task difficulty conditions, respectively. The high levels of accuracy suggest that these procedures can be used to provide accurate estimates of operator functional state that can be used to provide adaptive aiding. The relative contribution of each of the 43 psychophysiological features was also determined. Actual or potential applications of this research include test and evaluation and adaptive aiding implementation.

Brain-computer interfaces: communication and restoration of movement in paralysis	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Journal of Physiology Symposium on Physiology of Brain-Computer Interfaces	OCT 13, 2006	Atlanta, GA				SLOW CORTICAL POTENTIALS; FOREBRAIN INHIBITORY MECHANISMS; SELF-REGULATION; HASTENED DEATH; MOTOR FUNCTION; BIOFEEDBACK; FMRI; DEPRESSION; PLASTICITY; DESIRE	The review describes the status of brain-computer or brain-machine interface research. We focus on non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and their clinical utility for direct brain communication in paralysis and motor restoration in stroke. A large gap between the promises of invasive animal and human BCI preparations and the clinical reality characterizes the literature: while intact monkeys learn to execute more or less complex upper limb movements with spike patterns from motor brain regions alone without concomitant peripheral motor activity usually after extensive training, clinical applications in human diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and paralysis from stroke or spinal cord lesions show only limited success, with the exception of verbal communication in paralysed and locked-in patients. BCIs based on electroencephalographic potentials or oscillations are ready to undergo large clinical studies and commercial production as an adjunct or a major assisted communication device for paralysed and locked-in patients. However, attempts to train completely locked-in patients with BCI communication after entering the complete locked-in state with no remaining eye movement failed. We propose that a lack of contingencies between goal directed thoughts and intentions may be at the heart of this problem. Experiments with chronically curarized rats support our hypothesis; operant conditioning and voluntary control of autonomic physiological functions turned out to be impossible in this preparation. In addition to assisted communication, BCIs consisting of operant learning of EEG slow cortical potentials and sensorimotor rhythm were demonstrated to be successful in drug resistant focal epilepsy and attention deficit disorder. First studies of non-invasive BCIs using sensorimotor rhythm of the EEG and MEG in restoration of paralysed hand movements in chronic stroke and single cases of high spinal cord lesions show some promise, but need extensive evaluation in well-controlled experiments. Invasive BMIs based on neuronal spike patterns, local field potentials or electrocorticogram may constitute the strategy of choice in severe cases of stroke and spinal cord paralysis. Future directions of BCI research should include the regulation of brain metabolism and blood flow and electrical and magnetic stimulation of the human brain (invasive and non-invasive). A series of studies using BOLD response regulation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and near infrared spectroscopy demonstrated a tight correlation between voluntary changes in brain metabolism and behaviour.

Effects of zolpidem on cyclic alternating pattern, an objective marker of sleep instability, in Japanese patients with psychophysiological insomnia: A randomized crossover comparative study with placebo	PHARMACOPSYCHIATRY			English	Article							SITUATIONAL INSOMNIA; CAP; COMPONENTS; ZOPICLONE	Objective: A placebo-controlled randomized crossover study to investigate the effects of zolpidem on sleep stability in Japanese insomniac patients was performed using the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) rate, a polysomnographic marker that reflects sleep instability. Methods: Seventeen patients (5 M and 12 F, mean age: 40.4 +/- 13.6 years) who met the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) criteria for psychophysiological insomnia were evaluated. During the first period, patients were administered the placebo on the first night, followed by either zolpidem or the placebo on the second night (treatment night). The second crossover period was conducted after a minimum 3-day observation. Improvement in the overnight CAP rate was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included the CAP variables, conventional sleep variables, EEG arousals, subjective evaluation of sleep quality (measured by means of a visual analogue scale and the St. Mary's Hospital Sleep Questionnaire), and drug safety. Results: Zolpidem significantly decreased the overnight CAP rate values (57.6 vs. 39.0%, p = 0.009) and improved "sleep depth" (p = 0.044) and "sleep quality" (p=0.023) subjective questionnaire scores. Zolpidem also significantly improved VAS (p=0.036). The amount of time spent in sleep stages 3+4 was significantly increased by zolpidem without affecting the amounts of stage 2 and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Significant negative correlations were found when the sleep quality score was matched to the CAP rate (p=0.022). No serious adverse events occurred during the study. Discussion: In Japanese patients with psychophysiological insomnia, zolpidem increased sleep stability by significantly improving the overnight CAP rate. Zolpidem also improved sleep depth and sleep quality, both subjectively and objectively.

Patient-specific bivariate-synchrony-based seizure prediction for short prediction horizons	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Seizure prediction; Bivariate Phase synchrony; Intracranial electroencephalography; Epilepsy	EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; EEG; LONG; PERIOD; BRAIN	This paper evaluates the patient-specific seizure prediction performance of preictal changes in bivariate-synchrony between pairs of intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) signals within 15 min of a seizure in patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy. Prediction horizons under 15 min reduce the durations of warning times and should provide adequate time for a seizure control device to intervene. Long-term continuous iEEG was obtained from 6 patients. The seizure prediction performance was evaluated for all possible channel pairs and for different prediction methods to find the best performing channel pairs and methods for both pre-ictal decreases and increases in synchrony. The different prediction methods involved changes in window duration, signal filtering, thresholding approach, and prediction horizon durations. Performance for each patient, for all seizures, was first compared with an analytical-Poisson-based random predictor. The performance of the top 5% of channel pairs for each patient closely matched the top 5% of analytical-Poisson-based random predictor performance indicating that patient-specific, bivariate-synchrony-based seizure prediction could be random in general (under the assumption that channel-pair prediction times are statistically independent). Analysis of the spatial patterns of performance showed no clear relationship to the seizure onset zone. For each patient the best channel pair showed better performance than Poisson-based random prediction for a selected subset of prediction thresholds. Given the caveats of comparing with this form of random prediction, alarm time surrogates were employed to assess statistical significance of a four-fold out-of-sample cross-validation analysis applied to the best channel-pairs. The cross-validation analysis obtained reasonable testing performance for most patients when performance was compared to random prediction based on alarm time surrogates. The most significant case was a patient whose testing set sensitivity and false positive rate were 0.67 +/- 0.09 and 3.04 +/- 0.29 h(-1), respectively, for decreases in synchrony, an intervention time of 15 min and a seizure onset period of 5 min. For each testing set for this patient, performance was better than that obtained by random prediction at the significance level of 0.05 (average sensitivity of 0.47 +/- 0.05). Moreover, there were 9 seizures in each testing set which gives greater power to this cross-validation result, although the cross-validation was performed on the best channel pair selected by within-sample optimization for all seizures of the patient. Further validation with larger datasets from individual patients is needed. Improvements in prediction performance should be achievable through investigations of multivariate synchrony combined with non-linear classification methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Propriospinal myoclonus at steep onset	NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE CLINIQUE-CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						spinal; propriospinal; myoclonus; steep-wake transition; insomnia; steep	PERIODIC LIMB MOVEMENTS; SLEEP; RELAXATION; DROWSINESS; PATTERN; ORIGIN	Aims. - To describe the clinical and polygraphic features of propriospinal. myoclonus (PSM) atsteep onset. Material and methods. - PSM was first described in 1997 in patients with jerks occurring in the relaxation period preceding steep. EMG showed jerks to arise in spinally innervated muscles, propagating thereafter to rostral and caudal muscles at a tow speed, typical of propriospinal pathways. Results. - PSM arose when EEG alpha activity spread over the scalp and disappeared during either active wakefulness or actual steep. In some patients EMG activity could sometimes remain localized to the abdominal muscles, propagating to other segments only in fully developed jerks. Neurological examination, brain and spinal MRI were usually normal and clonazepam afforded partial improvement. PSM has been recently observed also in restless Legs syndrome, during relaxed wakefulness preceding falling asleep, coexisting with motor restlessness and sensory discomfort. PSM disappeared when spindles and K-complexes and typical Periodic Limb Movements appeared with EMG activity limited to leg muscles, without propriospinal propagation. Conclusions. - Conceivably, PSM arises in axial muscles due to some spinal generator set into motion by facilitating influences characteristic of the wake-steep transition and then undergoes muttimeric propriospinal propagation. In the International Classification of Steep Disorders (ICSD-2), PSM is listed in chapter VII, among the "Isolated symptoms, apparently normal variants and unresolved issues".

The proposed system is aimed primarily at people who have lost their ability to communicate via conventional means. The investigations presented here are part of our greater search for an appropriate set of features, classifiers and mental tasks that would maximise classification accuracy in such a system. Here Autoregressive (AR) coefficients and Power Spectral Density (PSD) features have been classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classification accuracy was higher with AR features compared to PSD. In addition, the use of an SVM to classify the AR coefficients increased the classification rate by up to 16.3% compared to that reported in different work, where other classifiers were used. It was also observed that the combination of mental tasks for which highest classification was obtained varied from subject to subject; hence the mental tasks to be used should be carefully chosen to match each subject.

It has been suggested that there are at least three different codes for representing number: a verbal code that is used to manipulate number words and perform mental numerical operations (e.g., multiplication), a visual code that is used to decode frequently used visual number forms (e.g., Arabic digits), and an abstract analog code that may be used to represent numerical quantities [1]. Furthermore, each of these codes is associated with a different neural substrate [1-3]. We extend these studies using dense-sensor event-related EEG recording techniques to investigate the temporal pattern of notation-specific effects observed in a parity judgement (odd versus even) task in which single numbers were presented in one of four different numerical notations. Contrasts between different notations demonstrated clear modulations in the visual evoked potentials (VEP) recorded. We observed increased amplitudes for the P1 and N1 components of the VEP that were specific to Arabic numerals and to dot configurations but differed for random and recognizable (die-face) dot configurations. These results demonstrate clear, notation-specific differences in the time course of numerical information processing and provide electrophysiological support for the triple-code model of numerical representation.

Seven naive subjects participated in the study. Signals were recorded from 275-channel MEG and synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) was employed. The multi-class classification for four-directional control was evaluated offline from 10-fold cross-validation using direct-decision tree classifier and genetic algorithm based Mahalanobis linear distance. Beta band (15-30Hz) event-related desynchronization and event related synchronization were observed in right and left hand movement related motor areas for physical movements as well as motor imagery. The cross-validation accuracy for the proposed four-direction classification from SAM-filtered MEG signal was as high as 95-97% for physical movements and 86-87% for motor imagery. The high classification accuracy suggests that a reliable high performance two-dimensional BC! can be achieved from single trial detection of human natural movement intentions from SAM-filtered MEG signals, where user may not need extensive training.

Neuropsychological indexes in comprehending frozen metaphors	JOURNAL OF PRAGMATICS			English	Article						Metaphor; Figurative language; Event-related potentials; Response time	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RIGHT-HEMISPHERE; CONCEPTUAL INTEGRATION; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; IDIOM COMPREHENSION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; TIME-COURSE; LANGUAGE; ERP; CONTEXT	This paper considers the cognitive and linguistic processes underlying the comprehension of frozen metaphors, by analyzing both neuropsychological and behavioral data. In order to explore the dichotomy between the pragmatic models (i.e. the metaphor as a semantic anomaly) and the direct comprehension view (the metaphor as a "standard" meaning) on the one hand, and between an iconic (more imagery-based) vs. not iconic (linguistic) representational modality on the other hand, the paper analyzed the event-related potentials (ERPs) and the behavioral data (response time) of subjects submitted to verbal stimuli. 36 participants were required to comprehend metaphoric and literal sentences, half congruous (semantically not anomalous) and half uncongruous (semantically anomalous). The morphological analysis of the electroencephalographic (EEG) profile allowed to observe two negative deflections (the N3-N4 complex), differently distributed on the scalp surface. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) applied to peak amplitude and latency variables underlined the different role of these deflections in metaphoric decoding. That is, the N4 effect appears to detect the presence of a semantic anomaly of the utterance (uncongruous condition) more localized on the posterior (Pz) area, but not sensitive to the metaphoric/literal content of the stimulus. On the contrary, N3 effect shows an ampler negativity for the metaphoric decoding, increased on the occipital area, likely a marker of a specific iconic representational format. Thus, though not equivalent, the two comprehension processes are not differentiated as a function of the way of the meaning access (direct or indirect), nor for their cognitive complexity (no response time variation) but for the typology of the representational format, more imagery-based for metaphoric stimuli, as it was showed by an increased N3 on the occipital visual area.

This is because it can provide a good discrimination between 2 motor imaginary tasks. In theory, the first and the last spatial filters from CSP should exhibit the most discriminate between 2 classes. But in practice, this is not always true, especially if either of these 2 filters emphasizes on a channel that has high variability of variance of sample matrices among trials. Such spatial filter is unstable on a single class, and thus it is not appropriate to use for discrimination. Furthermore, one or both of these 2 spatial filters may not localize the brain area that relates to motor imagery. The desired spatial filters may be at the second or at an even greater order of sorted eigenvalue. In this work, we propose to find an appropriate set of spatial filters of CSP projection matrix, which may provide higher classification accuracy than using just 2 peak spatial filters. We present 2 selection approaches to select the set of prominent spatial filters: the first one is automatic approach; the second one is semi-automatic approach requiring manual analysis by human. We assessed both of our approaches on the data sets from BCI Competition III and IV. The results show that both selection approaches can find the appropriated prominent spatial filters.

Of the world's 50 million people with epilepsy, fully 1/3 have seizures that are not controlled by anti-convulsant medication. The field of seizure prediction, in which engineering technologies are used to decode brain signals and search for precursors of impending epileptic seizures, holds great promise to elucidate the dynamical mechanisms underlying the disorder, as well as to enable implantable devices to intervene in time to treat epilepsy. There is currently an explosion of interest in this field in academic centers and medical industry with clinical trials underway to test potential prediction and intervention methodology and devices for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. This invited paper presents an overview of the application of signal processing methodologies based upon the theory of nonlinear dynamics to the problem of seizure prediction. Broader application of these developments to a variety of systems requiring monitoring, forecasting and control is a natural outgrowth of this field [1].

According to the codon 129 polymorphism (methionine or valine) and the prion protein type I or 2, a classification into distinct subtypes was established. Further analysis of these subtypes detected atypical clinical forms with longer disease duration or younger age at onset. The CJD subtype influences sensitivity of the technical investigations such as 14-3-3 in CSF, periodic sharp wave complexes in the EEG or hyperintense basal ganglia in MRI. A further characterization of these subtypes is important for reliable diagnosis and identification of rare disease variants. The aim is to establish specific patterns of test results and clinical findings. These improvements in diagnostics may be the reason for the apparent increase in sCJD incidence in Germany from 0.9 in 1994 to 1.6 in a million in 2005. Despite careful surveillance, no patient with variant CJD has been detected to date in Germany. Here we present the data of the OD surveillance of the last 13 years. Additionally, the improvements in diagnostics and differential diagnosis are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A Number-Letter task elicited brain activity related to cognitive processes. In response to the task stimuli, brain activity was recorded as ERPs, whose components were measured by principal components analysis (PCA). The ERP component scores to relevant and irrelevant stimuli were used in discriminant analyses to develop functions that successfully classified individuals as belonging to an early-stage Alzheimer's disease group or a like-aged Control group, with probabilities of an individual belonging, to each group. Applying the discriminant function to the developmental half of the data showed 92% of the subjects were correctly classified into either the AD group or the Control group with a sensitivity of 1.00. The two crossvalidation results were good with sensitivities of 0.83 and classification accuracies of 0.75-0.79. P3 and CNV components, as well as other, earlier ERP components, e.g. C145 and the memory "Storage" component, were useful in the discriminant functions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The locus caeruleus in the pens is suggested to be involved in the activating systems for arousal. We evaluated the effects of bladder distention on the neural activity in the l. caeruleus under different states of anesthesia. Materials and Methods: Experiments were performed on 20 male Sprague-Dawley rats. The spontaneous discharge rate of single neurons in and around the l. caeruleus was recorded with the rat under urethane anesthesia administered intraperitoneally, while the electroencephalogram was monitored simultaneously. The changes of the discharge rate of the neurons were observed during saline infusion into the bladder or during tail pinch stimulation. After recording the location of the neurons was confirmed histologically. Results: Of 42 l. coeruleus neurons whose response was examined during deep anesthesia 31 showed an excitatory response to bladder distention, followed by a change in electroencephalogram pattern to a faster and smaller rate, while the remaining 11 showed no response. Of 28 l. coeruleus neurons examined during light anesthesia only 1 neuron was excited and the remaining 27 showed no response. Virtually all of the l. coeruleus neurons unresponsive to bladder distention were responsive to tail pinch stimulation. Of the nonnoradrenergic neurons ventromedial to the l. coeruleus 4 of 7 during deep anesthesia and 5 of 8 during light anesthesia showed an excitatory response to distention. Conclusions: The excitatory response of the l. coeruleus neurons to bladder distention was strongly affected by the state of anesthesia. The response was observed only during deep anesthesia and was accompanied by lightening of the anesthesia. L. coeruleus may be involved in arousal which is mediated by bladder distention.

Jeavons syndrome (JS) or eyelid myoclonia (EM) with or without absences is an epileptic syndrome characterised by EM on closing the eyes, in bright environments, which coincides on the electroencephalogram with brief generalised polyspike and polyspike-wave discharges at 3-6 Hz. Photoparoxysmal response is associated in photostimulation. The ILAE recognises EM as a special type of myoclonic seizures, yet it still does not include JS as a separate condition in its classification of epileptic syndromes Aim. The aim of this article is to report on a series of 10 cases, with special attention given to their clinical-electroencephalo-graphic description We believe it is a condition that is not infrequent, but one which is underdiagnosed Moreover, we also want to highlight the pros and cons determining the fact that today there is still controversy about whether or not it should be recognised as an independent epileptic syndrome Patients and methods. We conducted a retrospective study of 10 cases collected over the period between 2002 and 2009 in our adult Epilepsy Unit Results. All our patients fulfilled JS criteria. There is a predominance of female S (n = 8), with the existence of cases of idiopathic generalised epilepsy in the family (n = 5), which are associated with clonic-tonic generalised seizures in nearly all of them (n = 9) and are well controlled with treatment in monotherapy, although the EM persist in three cases The results of a neurological exploration and neuroimaging are normal in all cases Conclusions. JS is a photosensitive epilepsy that is not easily confused with other conditions, nevertheless, there can be an overlap with other idiopathic generalised epilepsy syndromes that lead to their being underdiagnosed Genetics and functional neuroimaging will determine whether it is an independent condition or not	[Perez-Errazquin, Francisco; Isabel Chamorro-Munoz, M.; Garcia-Martin, Guillermina; Romero-Acebal, Manuel] Hosp Univ Virgen de la Victoria, Serv Neurol, Unidad Epilepsia, E-29010 Malaga, Spain		Perez-Errazquin, F (corresponding author), Hosp Univ Virgen de la Victoria, Serv Neurol, Unidad Epilepsia, Campus Teatinos S-N, E-29010 Malaga, Spain.

B	Fink, M		Licinio, J; Wong, ML		Fink, Max			Psychobiology of Electroshock	BIOLOGY OF DEPRESSION: FROM NOVEL INSIGHTS TO THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES			English	Article; Book Chapter							ELECTROCONVULSIVE-THERAPY; REACTION PATTERNS	After 70 years inducing grand mal seizures in human beings to achieve a behavior benefit, what have we learned? Convulsive therapy (ECT) was developed as a treatment for psychosis, but clinicians quickly recognized that seizures were more broadly effective, also relieving severe depressed mood, manic excitement, suicide risk, and catatonia. For the behavioral benefits, repeated grand mal seizures must be induced. Not all seizures are equally effective, however, and the characteristics of effective treatments are now better defined. Effective seizures are marked by bilateral electroencephalographic (EEG) brain wave changes with immediate and prolonged neuroendocrine effects. While depressed mood is the most common target, so are other abnormal behaviors. ECT also augments the benefits of psychoactive drugs, especially antipsychotic agents. Memory effects are common but are almost always transient. They are not a practical deterrent to its use, although very frequently cited as the reason why the treatment is delayed or rejected. The memory effects are best viewed as necessary accompaniments of seizures and as similar to the bleeding that accompanies surgery. The breadth of action of ECT argues that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) classification systems are unsound. A syndromal, not a disease approach, is more effective in defining psychiatric illnesses. The mechanism of action of ECT points to the neuroendocrine system as central to its benefits. Such experience should turn neuroscience away from the present obsession with neurohumors as explanations for psychiatric illness. It also points to the failure of animal models to explain psychiatric disorders or offer clues to treatments. The stigmatization of ECT that places it as a "last resort" therapy, and not available in many psychiatric centers, is wasteful and unethical. It guarantees years of unnecessary chronic illness and hardship for the severely mentally ill. ECT is a remarkable model for the study of psychiatric illness and its resolution. Despite its stigmatization, it offers the best hope for advancement in neuroscience.			Fink, M (corresponding author), POB 457, New York, NY 11780 USA.

The main focus was on evaluating the use of so-called "doubt-levels" and "confidence intervals" ("error bars") in improving the results by rejecting uncertain cases and patterns not well represented by the training set. Bayesian inference is used to arrive at distributions of network weights based on training data. We compare the results of the full-blown Bayesian method with results obtained from a k-nearest neighbor classifier. The results show that the Bayesian technique significantly outperforms the k-nearest-neighbor classifier. At the same time, we show that Bayesian inference, for which we have developed an extension for the calculation of error bars in the latent space of hidden units, can indeed be used for improving results by rejecting cases below a doubt-level threshold of probability, as well as for the rejection of artifacts. The performance of the Bayesian solution, however, is not significantly better than alternative techniques such as doubt levels applied to a maximum posterior approach, or the use of density estimation for outlier rejection. We conclude that Bayesian inference is a valid and valuable technique for model estimation but in the given application does not lead to improved results over simpler techniques.

Several histopathological types of FCD are distinguished. The aim of the study was to define distinctive features of FCD subtypes. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed clinical, electroencephalographic, magnetic resonance imaging, neuropsychological, and surgical variables, and seizure outcome data in 200 children. Cortical malformations were histopathologically confirmed in all patients, including mild malformation of cortical development type II (mMCD) in 36, FCD type la in 55, FCD type Ib in 39, FCD type IIa in 35, and FCD type IIb in 35 subjects. abnormal gyral/sulcal patterns, gray/white matter junction blurring, and gray matter signal abnormality in fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and T2-weighted sequences occurred more often in FCD type II, were infrequent in FCD type I, and rare in mMCD. Lobar hypoplasia/atrophy was common in FCD type I. Hippocampal sclerosis was most frequent in FCD type I. Neuropsychological testing demonstrated no significant differences between the groups. There was a trend toward better surgical outcomes in FCD type II compared with FCD type I patients. Interpretation: Different histopathological types of mMCD/FCD have distinct clinical and imaging characteristics. The ability to predict the subtype before surgery could influence surgical planning. Invasive electroencephalographic study should be considered when mMCD/FCD type I is expected based on noninvasive tests.

The aim of this study was to describe in detail such differences in a group of normal children. Polysomnographic recordings from 45 healthy children (18 females and 27 males) aged between 3 and 16 years were scored following both systems and the results compared. Several significant differences between the two scoring systems were found: N1 (AASM) was significantly higher than S1 (R&K) while Stages N2 and R (AASM) were significantly smaller than S2 and rapid eye movement (R&K). The Kendall Tau correlation coefficient revealed a relatively low concordance between the two systems for the scoring of number of stage shifts per hour, minutes and percentage of Stage N1/S1, and of a percentage of Stage S2/N2. The significant differences between R&K and AASM scoring systems suggest taking some caution in adopting the new scoring criteria in children; these might be shown to be potentially useful if careful selection of the appropriate indicators derived from this new method is carried out, such as the percentage of N1 and the number of stage shifts, which are measures very sensitive to the occurrence of arousals in the new AASM system.

A cohort of patients aged greater than or equal to 14 years, suspected with a first epileptic seizure, were included in this study. A team of neurologists evaluated and classified all cases. Diagnostic items for epileptic and non-epileptic seizures were identified using logistic regression analysis. Three hundred and fifty cases entered this study. Distinctive features for epileptic seizures were postictal confusion (OR 0.09), an epileptiform EEG pattern (OR 0.02), and abnormal neuroimaging findings (OR 0.07), whereas for non-epileptic seizures of organic origin there was a history of hypertension (OR 7.5), and provoking factors (OR 13.4) such as exercise and warmth. Diagnostic items for seizures of non-organic origin were a history of febrile seizures (OR 5.8), treatment by a psychologist or psychiatrist (OR 9.1), and presentiment of the seizure (OR 3.7) such as a feeling of choking and palpitations. A separate analysis for the patients who were systematically investigated provided some additional diagnostic items for the different subgroups of patients. For instance, back arching during the seizure for the patients with seizures of non-organic origin and female sex for the patients with non-epileptic seizures of organic origin.

Regions with different evoked frequency band responses during early-stage visual processing distinguish mild Alzheimer dementia from mild cognitive impairment and normal aging	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						VEP; biomarker; neuroimage; dynBSR	ICD-10 FIELD TRIAL; SCREENING-TEST; DISEASE; DIAGNOSIS; BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; POTENTIALS; DEMTECT; DESIGN; HEALTH	Although diagnostic procedures have been developed for detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer dementia (AD), more valid noninvasive tools are needed. In this work, we apply a procedure based on the evidences that different evoked frequency band responses may emerge from different sources during early-stage visual processing in a mental state-specific manner, while subjects were passively viewing a visual stimulus. In this case, spatial differences should arise across mental conditions such as mild Alzheimer dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and normal aging. With the use of EEG source image we found three different neural patterns in aged individuals: (1) left hippocampus and midbrain in mild AD, (2) left lateral orbitofrontal gyrus, left nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, thalamus, posterior cinguli, right precuneous, right superior parietal lobe in MCI, and (3) right lateral-medial orbitofrontal gyrus, caudate nucleus, thalamus, right lateral occipitotemporal gyrus in elderly controls. Although preliminary, these results show remarkably robust differences that distinguish between an age-matched control group, a group with MCI, and a group with mild AD. Because the method applied in this work differentiates among clinical entities with varying severity of cognitive decline, it may eventually serve as an electrophysiological marker in the early detection of neurodegeneration.

We describe the results of epilepsy surgery and the referral patterns at a referral epilepsy programme. Methods: We reviewed the outcome of epilepsy surgery performed at the University of South Florida and Tampa General Hospital epilepsy programme for the years 2000 and 2001. The typical presurgical evaluation included clinical evaluation, EEG-video monitoring, MRI with dedicated epilepsy protocol, PET, SPECT, neuropsychological testing and Wada testing. We used the Engel outcome classification, and focused on the referral information to determine how and when in the course of their illness patients arrive at a referral epilepsy centre. Results: In the 2-year period (2000-2001), a total of 36 epilepsy surgeries were performed. Twenty-nine temporal lobectomies, six extratemporal resections and one corpus callosotomy. Ages varied from 17 to 65 years. Overall results were: 30 (83%) seizure-free [class I], 5 (17%) rare seizures or almost seizure-free [class II] and I no improvement. Of the 29 temporal lobectomies, 27 (93%) are completely seizure-free [class I] and 2 (7%) are >90% improved [class II]. Duration of seizures before being seen at the epilepsy centre averaged 18 years (range 2-58 years). Twenty-two (61%) were sent by their neurologists, while 14 (39%) came self-referred without having discussed surgery with their neurologists. Five (14%) were specifically advised by their neurologist to not consider surgery. Two had participated in clinical trials of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) before being seen at the epilepsy centre. Conclusions: Epilepsy surgery has high efficacy and very low morbidity. Yet, there continues to be a long delay in the referral of patients to the epilepsy centre, suggesting that surgery for epilepsy is underutilised. (C) 2003 BEA Trading Ltd.

Design: Prospective cohort analysis. Setting: University teaching hospital medical-surgical ICU. Patients: Twenty critically ill (APACHE II [acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II] acute physiology store [APS], 10 +/- 5), mechanically, ventilated adults (male 12, female 8, age 62 +/- 15 years) with mild to moderate acute lung injury (lung injury score, 1.8 +/- 0.9) 10 +/- 7 days after admission to the ICU. Measurements and results: Patients were divided into three groups based on 24-h polysomnography (PSG) findings. No patient demonstrated normal sleep. In the "disrupted sleep" group (n = 8), electrophysiologic sleep was identified and was distributed throughout the day (6:00 AM to 10:00 PM; 4.0 +/- 2.9 h) and night (10:00 PM to 6:00 AM; 3.0 +/- 1.9 h) with equivalent proportions of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, Nocturnal sleep efficiency was severely reduced (38 +/- 24%) with an increased proportion of stage 1 NREM sleep (40 +/- 28% total sleep time [TST]) and a reduced proportion of REM sleep (10 +/- 14% TST), Severe sleep fragmentation was reflected by a high frequency of arousals (20 +/- 17/h) and awakenings (22 +/- 25/h), Electrophysiologic sleep was not identifiable in the PSG recordings of the remaining patients. These were classified either as "atypical sleep" (n = 5), characterized bu transitions from stage 1 NREM to slow wave sleep with a virtual absence of stage 2 NREM and reduced stage REM sleep, or "coma" (n = 7), characterized by > 50% delta or theta EEG activity with (n = 5) and without (n = 2) evidence of EEG activation either spontaneously or in response to deep painful stimuli, The combined atypical sleep and coma groups had a higher APS (13 +/- 4 vs 6 +/- 4) and higher doses of sedative medications than the disrupted sleep group. Conclusion: Sleep, as it is conventionally measured, was identified only in a subgroup of critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation and was severely disrupted. We have proposed specific criteria to select patients for future studies to evaluate potential causes of sleep disruption in this; population.

Sixty-three acutely brain injured patients with ICP monitoring, daily (133)Xenon cerebral blood flow (CBF) and daily transcranial Doppler (TCD) assessments were studied. Their ICP recordings were time-aligned with the CBF and TCD measurements so that a 1 h ICP segment near the CBF and TCD measurements was obtained. Each of these recordings was processed by the Morphological Cluster and Analysis of Intracranial Pressure (MOCAIP) algorithm to extract pulse morphological metrics. Then the differential evolution algorithm was used to find the optimal combination of the metrics that provided, using the regularized linear discriminant analysis, the largest combined positive predictivity and sensitivity. At a CBF threshold of 20 ml/min/100 g, a sensitivity of 81.8 +/- 0.9% and a specificity of 50.1 +/- 0.2% were obtained using the optimal combination of conventional TCD and blood analysis metrics as input to a regularized linear classifier. However, using the optimal combination of the MOCAIP metrics alone we were able to achieve a sensitivity of 92.5 +/- 0.7% and a specificity of 84.8 +/- 0.8%. Searching the optimal combination of all available metrics, we achieved the best result that was marginally better than those from using MOCAIP alone. This study demonstrated that the potential role of ICP monitoring may be extended to provide an indicator of low global cerebral blood perfusion.

In spite of their incidence being much greater than at any other period during life, seizures occurring during the neonatal period are difficult to identify, since their patterns are not well organized on account of insufficient anatomical, physiological and/or biochemical development. Objective. To analyse the semiology of seizures during the neonatal period, their classification and subsequent evolution. Patients and methods. We made a retrospective study of 60 patients who had convulsions during the neonatal period, selected from amongst the children admitted to the Neonatology Department of the Hospital Infantil Universitario Virgen de Rocio in Sevilla, between 1990 and 1998. We investigated 22 medical variables related to the clinical history, neurological examination, neuroimaging studies, EEG and drugs used. Results. Anomalies were found on the initial examination in 83.3% of the cases. The hypoxic-ischemic syndrome was the commonest etiology, followed by hemorrhages, metabolic disorders, cardiopathies, malformations and infectious diseases. From the semiological angle, the seizures were seen as partial or generalised increase in muscle tone, followed by clonias, hypotonias and subtle seizures. Cerebral angiography was the most commonly used diagnostic imaging technique. There was a statistically significant relationship between the appearance of sequelae and the earliness of the occurrence of the seizures, but not with the duration, semiology or frequency. Conclusions. Seizures in the newborn are habitually seen in the hypoxic-ischemic syndrome, and usually present as alterations in muscle tone. Phenobarbitone is still the drug of choice for the treatment of seizures in the neonatal period.

A matrix of motion stimuli are displayed for inducing the motion-onset visual response that allows the subject to spell out a message by scalp EEG. Methods: The brief motion of chromatic visual objects embedded in a 36 virtual button onscreen interface is employed to evoke a motion-onset specific N200 component. The user focuses attention on the button labeled with the letter to be communicated and performs color recognition task. The computer determines the target letter by identifying the attended row and column respectively. A support vector machine (SVM) is used in the target detection procedures of the BCI system. Results: Ten subjects participated in this study. The neurophysiological characteristics of the N200-speller were compared with the classical P300-speller. The two paradigms elicit components with distinct spatio-temporal patterns. Classification of the data registered from all subjects reveals that the N200-speller achieves a comparable target detection accuracy with that of the P300-speller, given the same number of trials considered. Conclusions: With the advantages of low contrast and luminance tolerance, the proposed motion-onset stimulus presentation paradigm can be applied to brain-computer interface. Significance: A novel motion-onset paradigm N200-speller is proposed and assessed for BCI spelling application. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Methods: The seizures of 491 consecutive patients with focal epilepsies were prospectively classified according to a recently introduced semiologic seizure classification. All patients underwent prolonged EEG video monitoring and MRI scan. Two hundred twenty-three patients (45%) had temporal lobe epilepsies (TLE); 113 patients (23%) had extratemporal epilepsies; and for 155 (32%) patients, the epilepsy could not be localized to one lobe. Results: Abdominal auras were more frequent with TLE (117 of 223 patients, 52%) than in extratemporal epilepsy (13 of 113 patients, 12%, p < 0.0001) and more frequent in mesial TLE (70 of 110 patients, 64%) than in neocortical TLE (16 of 41 patients, 39%, p = 0.007). No preponderance to one side existed. Abdominal auras were followed by ictal oral and manual automatisms (automotor seizure) in at least one seizure evolution in all patients with TLE (117 patients, 100%). In contrast, only two patients with extratemporal epilepsy (2 of 13 patients, 15%, p < 0.0001) had abdominal auras evolving into automotor seizures. An abdominal aura is associated with TLE with a probability of 73.6%. The evolution of an abdominal aura into an automotor seizure, however, increases the probability of TLE to 98.3%. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that evolution of abdominal aura into automotor seizure permits differentiation between temporal lobe epilepsy and extratemporal epilepsy, showing that analysis of seizure evolution provides more localizing information than does the frequency of particular seizure types.

Ten participants were presented with an auditory oddball task during repeated sleep onset periods. The EEG was recorded from 29 different scalp sites. A 1500-Hz tone pip was presented infrequently (p = .04) within a series of lower pitch 1000-Hz "standard" stimuli (p = .96). Participants were required to button press upon detection of the rare "target" stimulus. During wakefulness, almost all targets were detected. A large amplitude P300 was observed to these detected targets. This P300 was maximum over parietal areas of the scalp. During stage 1 sleep, subjects continued to respond on 47% of trials. The parietal P300 amplitude remained large to these detected targets. It was, however, much attenuated at frontal sites. When the participant failed to detect the target in either stage 1 or 2, no P300 was visible. P300 is thus associated with behavioral detection of the target stimulus, whether in wakefulness or stage 1 "sleep." Trials were also sorted by reaction time (RT), in which bins 1-3 represented increasingly long RT. In the waking state, P300 amplitude did not significantly vary across the different bins. Although mean RT latency varied by 512 ms from bin 1 to bin 3, P300 latency varied by only 25 ms. Differences in RT are thus probably due to response-related processes rather than stimulus classification time.

Gamma band activity (GBA) offers an adequate tool for studying cortical activation patterns during emotional face information processing. In the present study brain oscillations were analyzed in response to facial expression of emotions. Specifically, GBA modulation was measured when twenty subjects looked at emotional (angry, fearful, happy, and sad faces) or neutral faces in two different conditions: supraliminal (10 ms) vs subliminal (150 ms) stimulation (100 target-mask pairs for each condition). The results showed that both consciousness and significance of the stimulus in terms of arousal can modulate the power synchronization (ERD decrease) during 150-350 time range: an early oscillatory event showed its peak at about 200 ms post-stimulus. GBA was enhanced by supraliminal more than subliminal elaboration, as well as more by high arousal (anger and fear) than low arousal (happiness and sadness) emotions. Finally a left-posterior dominance for conscious elaboration was found, whereas right hemisphere was discriminant in emotional processing of face in comparison with neutral face.

Twelve children were treated with an antiepileptic drug (carbamazepine, valproate, or sulthiame). They were compared with an age- and sex-matched control group of 24 children (14 females; age range 8y 2mo to 14y 5mo, mean 11y, SD 1y 8mo). The test battery included tests for facial expressions, lip and tongue movements, repeated syllables, and articulation using nonsense and tongue-twisting words. Sensibility on tongue and lips was tested with two-point discrimination. As language tests, Rapid Confrontation Naming, orthographic, and phonologic decoding tests were used. A dichotic listening test was performed in 13 children with RE and in 14 controls. Compared to control children, those with RE had significantly greater problems concerning tongue movements (p < 0.05) and articulation (nonsense words and tongue-twisting words;p < 0.01), and worse performance on dichotic listening (p < 0.05). Oro-lingual sensibility and results of language tests did not differ between those with RE and control children. The results indicate that children with RE have distinct but mild problems with oromotor performance and auditory discrimination.

Human Brain-Teleoperated Robot between Remote Places	ICRA: 2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION, VOLS 1-7	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	MAY 12-17, 2009	Kobe, JAPAN	IEEE				This paper describes an EEG-based human brain-actuated robotic system, which allows performing navigation and visual exploration tasks between remote places via internet, using only brain activity. In operation, two teleoperation modes can be combined: robot navigation and camera exploration. In both modes, the user faces a real-time video captured by the robot camera merged with augmented reality items. In this representation, the user concentrates on a target area to navigate to or visually explore; then, a visual stimulation process elicits the neurological phenomenon that enables the brain-computer system to decode the intentions of the user. In the navigation mode, the target destination is transferred to the autonomous navigation system, which drives the robot to the desired place while avoiding collisions with the obstacles detected by the laser scanner. In the camera mode, the camera is aligned with the target area to perform an active visual exploration of the remote scenario. In June 2008, within the framework of the experimental methodology, five healthy subjects performed pre-established navigation and visual exploration tasks for one week between two cities separated by 260km. On the basis of the results, a technical evaluation of the device and its main functionalities is reported. The overall result is that all the subjects were able to successfully solve all the tasks reporting no failures, showing a high robustness of the system.

Abnormal spatiotemporal processing of emotional facial expressions in childhood autism: dipole source analysis of event-related potentials	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						BESA; brain; electroencephalography; emotion; faces	FUSIFORM FACE AREA; SPECTRUM DISORDER; YOUNG-CHILDREN; ASPERGERS-SYNDROME; DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; TEMPORAL CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL MRI; TACTILE INPUT; BRAIN	Previous studies of face processing in autism suggest abnormalities in anatomical development, functioning and connectivity/coordination of distributed brain systems involved in social cognition, but the spatial sequence and time course of rapid (sub-second) neural responses to emotional facial expressions have not been examined in detail. Source analysis of high-density event-related potentials (ERPs) is an optimal means to examine both the precise temporal profile and spatial location of early electrical brain activity in response to emotionally salient stimuli. Therefore, we recorded 128-channel ERPs from high-functioning males with autism (aged 6-10 years), and age-, sex- and IQ-matched typically developing controls during explicit and implicit processing of emotion from pictures showing happy, angry, fearful, sad and neutral facial expressions. Children with autism showed normal patterns of behavioural and ERP (P1, N170 and P2) responses. However, dipole source analysis revealed that ERP responses relating to face detection (visual cortex) and configural processing of faces (fusiform gyrus), as well as mental state decoding (medial prefrontal lobe), were significantly weaker and/or slower in autism compared with controls during both explicit and implicit emotion-processing tasks. Slower- and larger-amplitude ERP source activity in the parietal somatosensory cortices possibly reflected more effortful compensatory analytical strategies used by the autism group to process facial gender and emotion. Such aberrant neurophysiological processing of facial emotion observed in children with autism within the first 300 ms of stimulus presentation suggests abnormal cortical specialization within social brain networks, which would likely disrupt the development of normal social-cognitive skills.

However, a phenomenological definition of absence seizures is hampered by difficulties in conceptualizing consciousness and needs to take into account the electroclinical features and anatomical basis of seizures. Sensu stricto, absence seizures are defined as an electroclinical pattern of generalized 3/s spike-wave activity accompanied by loss of awareness and responsiveness. Although there is general belief that absences are most often encountered in childhood or early adolescence, a considerable number of patients suffer from absences late into adulthood, which are often refractory to antiepileptic drugs. These patients generally fall into one of two groups. The first group consists of those who have more or less typical absences in childhood or adolescence which continue into adulthood, and may be accompanied by other generalized seizures or neurological impairment. Few data are available addressing whether the seizure semiology of the absences in these patients changes over time or not. The second class of patients corresponds to those in whom absences emerge for the first time in adulthood or even in the senium. These need to be carefully distinguished from later aggravation or semiological transformation of undiagnosed childhood epilepsies and from certain complex focal seizures originating from the frontal or temporal lobe. A wide range of aetiologically and anatomically diverse processes may lead to the appearance of epileptic absences. It is important to note that absences also vary in their intensity, their impact on the ability of the subject to respond and react, and in particular in their natural history and their response to antlepileptic medication.

The genetics of this condition is largely unknown.We present the electroclinical and genetic findings of 15 MTLE Italian families. Patients and mehtods FMTLE was defined when two or more first-degree relatives had epilepsy suggesting a mesial temporal lobe origin. The occurrence of seizures with auditory auras was considered an exclusion criterion. Patients underwent video-EEG recordings, 1.5-Tesla MRI particularly focused on hippocampal analysis, and neuropsychological evaluation. Genetic study included genotyping and linkage analysis of candidate loci at 4q, 18q, 1q, and 12q as well as screening for LGI1/Epitempin mutations. Results Most of the families showed an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance. Fifty-four (32 F) affected individuals were investigated. Twenty-one (38.8 %) individuals experienced early FS. Forty-eight individuals fulfilled the criteria for MTLE. Epigastric/visceral sensation (72.9 %) was the most common type of aura, followed by psychic symptoms (35.4 %), and deja vu (31.2 %). HS occurred in 13.8% of individuals, three of whom belonged to the same family. Prognosis of epilepsy was generally good. Genetic study failed to show LGI1/Epitempin mutations or significative linkage to the investigated loci. Discussion FMTLE may be a more common than expected condition, clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Some of the reported families, grouped on the basis of a specific aura, may represent an interesting subgroup on whom to focus future linkage studies.

The development of brain-machine interface neuroprosthetic devices	NEUROTHERAPEUTICS			English	Article						brain-machine interface; brain-computer interface; prosthesis; electrode; EEG	REAL-TIME CONTROL; COMPUTER INTERFACE; ENSEMBLE RECORDINGS; MOTOR CORTEX; HAND GRASP; MOVEMENT; NEURONS; ELECTRODE; SIGNALS; THOUGHT	The development of brain-machine interface technology is a logical next step in the overall direction of neuro-prosthetics. Many of the required technological advances that will be required for clinical translation of brain-machine interfaces are already under development, including a new generation of recording electrodes, the decoding and interpretation of signals underlying intention and planning, actuators for implementation of mental plans in virtual or real contexts, direct somatosensory feedback to the nervous system to refine actions, and training to encourage plasticity in neural circuits. Although pre-clinical studies in nonhuman primates demonstrate high efficacy in a realistic motor task with motor cortical recordings, there are many challenges in the clinical translation of even simple tasks and devices. Foremost among these challenges is the development of biocompatible electrodes capable of long-term, stable recording of brain activity and implantable amplifiers and signal processors that are sufficiently resistant to noise and artifact to faithfully transmit recorded signals to the external environment. Whether there is a suitable market for such new technology depends on its efficacy in restoring and enhancing neural function, its risks of implantation, and its long-term efficacy and usefulness. Now is a critical time in brain-machine interface development because most ongoing studies are science-based and noncommercial, allowing new approaches to be included in commercial schemes under development.

The variable precision rough set model (VPRS model), an extension of the original rough set approach, tolerates some degree of misclassification of the training data. The basic idea of the VPRS model is to change the class information of those objects whose class information cannot be induced without contradiction from the available attributes. Thereafter, original methods of RST are applied. An approach of this model is presented that allows uncertain objects to change class information during the process of attribute reduction and rule generation. This method is referred to as variable precision rough set approach with flexible classification of uncertain objects (VPRS(FC) approach) and needs only slight modifications of the original VPRS model. Methods and material: To compare the VPRS model and VPRS(FC) approach both methods are applied to a clinical data set based on electroencephalogram of awake and anesthetized patients. For comparison, a second data set obtained from the LICI machine learning repository is used. It describes the shape of different vehicle types. Further well known feature selection methods were applied to both data sets to compare their results with the results provided by rough set based approaches. Results: The VPRS(FC) approach requires higher computational effort, but is able to achieve better reduction of attributes for noisy or inconsistent data and provides smaller rule sets. Conclusion: The presented approach is a useful method for substantial attribute reduction in noisy and inconsistent data sets. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Visual perception naturally occurs within the context of an integrated array of ongoing cognitive processes involving memory, perception in other modalities, and motor control. In many situations, these processes allow expectations to be formed for likely visual events. This article explores the idea that the formation of visual expectations involves the active organization of visual cortical areas, providing a framework of contextual information within which expected events are interpreted. Retinal inputs are treated as constraints that feed into a complex system of interacting visual cortical areas and thalamic nuclei, which are concurrently imposing constraints on one another. Although the nature of expectational organization in the visual cortex is not well-understood, a reasonable hypothesis is that expectation involves the mutual constraint of spatiotemporal activity patterns in multiple visual cortical areas. In this scenario, expectation is instantiated by a set of activity patterns in high-level visual cortical areas that impose constraints on one another as well as on low-level areas according to the partial information that is available about expected retinal inputs. One approach to testing this proposal is through the analysis of simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from local neuronal assemblies in multiple visual cortical areas. Analysis of LFPs by multivariate autoregressive modeling is showing promise in revealing the organization of expectation in visual cortex.

This ability requires the animal to keep track its direction and distance from specific locations. In rodents, direction of the animal is coded by the activity of head direction cells present in several regions of the brain, but distance information is only indirectly available, through the entorhinal cortical grid cell system. A neural system downstream from the entorhinal cortex seems to be necessary to extract the distance information from the periodic activity of grid cells. We propose that a system of such cells store the distance of the animal from important locations in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus and these "distance cells" might be identified with the dentate granule cells. A computational model is set up to study the neural mechanism of distance information decoding from the ensemble of grids cells. The proposed distance cells receive innervation from entorhinal grid cells, the connection strength between grid cells and distance cells is set by a one-shot-learning rule and the distance cell activity is affected by a winner-take-all mechanism. Simulation results of this model verifies that the activity of the distance cell population is able to unambiguously code the distance of the animal from important places. The proposed distance cells have a multi-peaked, patchy spatial activity pattern similar to the firing pattern of granule cells in dentate gyrus.

Methods: All patients aged >= 14 years with a first seizure or who had undiagnosed seizures before the study period were included. Patients were identified from different sources and were independently evaluated and classified by a team of neurologists. A predictive profile for the occurrence of epileptic and non-epileptic seizures was obtained by stepwise logistic regression analysis. Results: The overall annual incidence was 55/100,000 and 30/100,000 for US and epilepsy, respectively. The age-specific annual incidence of US and epilepsy increased with age and reached 120/100,000 and 62/100,000 for the >= 65 years of age group, respectively. The incidence of epilepsy and US in mates was higher than in females and partial seizures prevailed over generalized seizures (40 versus 9/100,000). In up to 35% of the cases with US or epilepsy, the etiology was mainly cerebrovascular disease and brain tumors. Predictors for epileptic versus non-epileptic seizures of organic origin were an epileptiform EEG pattern (OR = 0.06) versus a history of hypertension (OR = 2.8) or cardiovascular disease (OR = 5.4). Strong predictors for seizures of non-organic origin were female sex (OR = 2.2) and head injury (OR = 2.4). Conclusions: The incidence of US and epilepsy (overall, and age-, sex-, seizure-specific) was similar to those reported by other developed countries. The predictive factors found in this study may assist in the early diagnosis of seizures. (c) 2005 BEA Trading Ltd.

In humans, reports of invasive data acquisition for the purpose of BCI developments are less numerous and signal selection for optimal control still remains poorly investigated. Here we report on our recent implementation of a real-time analysis platform for the investigation of ongoing oscillations in human intracerebral recordings and review various results illustrating its utility for the development of novel brain computer and brain robot interfaces. Our findings show that the insight gained both from off-line experiments and from online functional exploration can be used to guide future selection of the sites and frequency bands to be used in a translation algorithm such as the one needed for a BCI-driven cursor control. Overall, the findings reported with our online spectral analysis platforms (Brain TV and Brain Ball) indicate the feasibility of online functional exploration via intracranial recordings in humans and outline the direct benefits of this approach for the improvement of invasive BCI strategies in humans. In particular, our findings suggest that current BCI performance may be improved by using signals recorded from various systems previously unexplored in the context of BCI research such as the oscillatory activity recorded in the oculomotor networks as well as higher cognitive processes including working memory, attention, and mental calculation networks. Finally, we discuss current limitations of the methodology and outline future paths for innovative BCI research.

Prosodic perception is based on the decoding of acoustic cues with a predominant function of frequency-related information perceived as speaker's pitch. Evaluation of prosodic meaning is a cognitive function implemented in cortical and subcortical networks that generate continuously updated affective or linguistic speaker impressions. Various brain-imaging methods allow delineation of neural structures involved in prosody processing. In contrast to functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques, DC (direct current, slow) components of the EEG directly measure cortical activation without temporal delay. Activation patterns obtained with this method are highly task specific and intraindividually reproducible. Studies presented here investigated the topography of prosodic stimulus processing in dependence on acoustic stimulus structure and linguistic or affective task demands, respectively. Data obtained from measuring DC potentials demonstrated that the right hemisphere has a predominant role in processing emotions from the tone of voice, irrespective of emotional valence. However, right hemisphere involvement is modulated by diverse speech and language-related conditions that are associated with a left hemisphere participation in prosody processing. The degree of left hemisphere involvement depends on several factors such as (i) articulatory demands on the perceiver of prosody (possibly, also the poser), (ii) a relative left hemisphere specialization in processing temporal cues mediating prosodic meaning, and (ill) the propensity of prosody to act on the segment level in order to modulate word or sentence meaning. The specific role of top-down effects in terms of either linguistically or affectively oriented attention on lateralization of stimulus processing is not clear and requires further investigations.

J	Lotte, F; Lecuyer, A; Arnaldi, B				Lotte, Fabien; Lecuyer, Anatole; Arnaldi, Bruno			FuRIA: a new feature extraction algorithm for brain-computer interfaces using fuzzy and inverse models	TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL			French	Article						brain-computer interface (BCI); feature extraction; inverse model; source localization; classification; interpretability; fuzzy set; electroencephalography (EEG)	CLASSIFICATION; BCI; COMMUNICATION; WORKSHOP	When using Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) based on ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG), the identification of mental tasks relies on two main points: feature extraction and classification [MAM(+)06, BFWB07, LCL(+)07]. Feature extraction aims at describing EEG signals by a few relevant values called "features", whereas classification aims at automatically assigning a class to these features. In this paper we focus on feature extraction, as the BCI community has stressed the need to explore new feature extraction algorithms [MAM+06]. Recently, inverse models have been revealed as promising feature extraction algorithms for BCI [QDHO4, GGP(+)05, WGWB05, CLL06]. Such models aims at computing the activity in the whole brain volume, by using only scalp EEG signals and a head model representing the brain as a set of voxels (volume elements). The activity computed in a few brain regions has been used as features for BCI systems. Despite good results, some limitations remain. Indeed, it seems that current methods cannot conciliate genericity, i.e., the capability to deal with any kind of mental task, and the fact of generating few features. On one hand, methods that are generic and automatic tend to generate a large number of features, as they extract several features for each voxel [GGP(+)05], The activity in neighboring voxels can be correlated and, as such, it would be more appropriate to gather these voxels in brain regions. On the other hand, methods that generate few features have been proposed, but they are not generic anymore as they need a priori knowledge on the mental tasks used, and are currently limited to motor imagery-based BCI [QDH04, WGWB05]. Recently, we have proposed a method which is generic and which generates few features, as voxels whose activity is correlated are gathered into Regions Of Interest (ROI) [CLL06]. However, this method is not completely automatic and is limited to the use of two ROI whose spatial extension is hard to define [CLL06]. In this paper, we propose a generic feature extraction algorithm which can automatically identify any number of relevant ROI and can properly define their spatial extension thanks to the new concept of fuzzy ROI. This algorithm is known as FuRIA, which stands for "Fuzzy Region of Interest Activity". The FuRIA algorithm FuRIA is a trainable feature extraction algorithm. Indeed, it can automatically identify what are the relevant ROI to discriminate mental tasks, and what are the frequency bands in which these ROI react. The FuRIA training is performed in 5 steps: Statistical analysis: This step consists in comparing, using a statistical test, the activity in each voxel, possibly averaged over a given time window, between the different classes. This analysis is performed for each of the N-f frequencies considered, Once the analysis is achieved, we obtain N-f statistical maps, each one revealing which voxels are significant for discrimination. Clustering: For each statistical map computed at the previous step, a clustering algorithm is used in order to gather significant voxels into ROI. To perform this clustering, a 4-dimensional vector [x, y, z, s] is associated to each significant voxel. The x, y, z coordinates are the 3D coordinates of the voxel in the head model used and s is the voxel statistic obtained at the previous step. Once the clustering is achieved, all voxels whose associated vector belongs to the same cluster are gathered into the same ROI. Fusion: Once the relevant ROI are identified for each frequency, we have to identify which ROI are relevant in which frequency band. To do so, ROI obtained at similar positions (i.e., with an overlap of more than 50%), for consecutive frequencies, are merged, simply using the union set operator, and identified as reactive in the frequency band resulting from the concatenation of these frequencies. Adaptation: Because of the use of the union as the fusion operator, a ROI Q identified as reactive in the frequency band [f(a); f(b)] can contain voxels which were significant for a single frequency belonging to [f(a); f(b)] but which are not significant anymore for the whole [f(a); f(b)] frequency band. Consequently, we perform another statistical analysis for each ROI, in order to remove voxels that are not significant anymore. Fuzzification: In the ROI defined so far, it can be noticed that all voxels do not have, statistically, the same discriminative power. However, all these voxels contain a given amount of information. Moreover, the brain regions of a given subject are not well defined but are rather naturally fuzzy. Hence, identifying which voxels should be kept in a ROI, and which ones should be removed is a difficult problem. We believe that all voxels that contain information should be in the ROI, but that those which contain less information should be less in the ROI. Thus, we propose the concept of fuzzy ROI, which relies on the fuzzy set theory of Zadeh [Zad96]. A standard (crisp) ROI Omega(c) is defined by the set of voxels it contains. The activity gamma(Omega c) in this ROI Omega(c) is classically computed from the activity gamma(v) of the voxels v of this ROI (see Equation 1). A fuzzy ROI Omega(f) is not defined by a set of voxels anymore, but by a fuzzy membership function mu(Omega f). This function provides the membership degree (in [0; 1]) of any voxel into the ROI Omega(f). The activity in a fuzzy ROI is computed as described in Equation 2, where N-v is the number of voxels in the head model used. This formalism enables use to weigh each voxel according to the importance of its contribution within the ROI, and, as such, to use efficiently the available information. To complete the training of FuRIA, all ROI Omega are turned into fuzzy ROI by associating to each of them a fuzzy membership function mu(Omega) which uses the statistics obtained at the previous step. Once the training of FuRIA is completed, a set of discriminant fuzzy ROI should have been identified together with the corresponding reactive frequency bands. The activity in these ROI and in these frequency bands, possibly averaged over time, can be used as features for any classifier. Evaluation In order to evaluate FuRIA, we used sLORETA (standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography) as the inverse model [PM02], a multiple comparison randomization t-test as the statistical analysis [HBWF96] and the "Mean Shift" algorithm as the clustering algorithm [CM02]. Concerning the fuzzy membership functions, it appears that, due to the low resolution of sLORETA, significant voxels with a relatively high probability of type I error are much more numerous that significant voxels with a relatively low probability of type I error. Consequently, for each ROI Omega, we used a membership function mu(Omega) which assigns a membership degree which decreases exponentially with the voxel statistics, as described in Equation 10. In this equation, N-Omega s is the number of voxels in the ROI Omega; p(min) and p(max) are respectively the minimum and maximum probability, among the ROI voxels, of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis H-0; and p(v) is the probability of correctly rejecting H-0 for voxel v. In order to evaluate FuRIA, we have used the data set IV of the "BCI competition 2003" [WZL(+)04]. These data contain EEG signals recorded 500 ms before a subject hits a keyboard key with a finger from his left or right hand, The goal of the competition participants was to identify, for each trial, the hand that was used. We trained the FuRIA algorithm on the training set provided, by considering the frequencies between 3 Hz and 45 Hz, with a step of 1 Hz, and by considering the time window comprising the last 250 ms of each trial. FuRIA has found 5 discriminant fuzzy ROI (see Figure 1), hence generating 5-dimensional feature vectors. These features has been classified using a linear support vector machine. The recognition rates obtained after 100 training/testing repetitions are displayed in Table 2 and compared with two other methods: the method of the competition winner [WZL+04] and a method using inverse models that we proposed previously [CLL06]. The results obtained withouth the fuzzification step (step 5 of the training, see previous section) are also displayed as a comparison. We can noticed that the method that use FuRIA with fuzzification reached the best results with a recognition score ranging from 85% to 86%, These results suggest that the features extracted with FuRIA are very discriminant, as they are not numerous (there are only 5 features) and still enable us to reach good classification results. It is also interesting to notice that when using FuRIA without fuzzification, the results are significantly lower. This stress the advantage of using efficiently the information contained in any significant voxel, thanks to the concept of fuzzy ROI. In addition to this evaluation, we also proposed a first step towards the design of an interpretable BCI system. To this end, we proposed to classify FuRIA features, which are interpretable features, with a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), which is an interpretable classifier. Indeed, FIS are a set of fuzzy "if-then" rules that can be learnt from data. By combining FuRIA features with FIS, we can obtain a set of rules describing which activity in which brain regions and frequency bands is related to which mental task. An evaluation of this method on the EEG data mentioned above suggested that the obtained rules were consistent with the literature (see Figure 3).

It is however difficult to confirm patient engagement during an MI in the absence of any on-line measure. Fortunately an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) can provide an on-line measure of MI activity as a neurofeedback for the BCI user to help him/her focus better on the MI task. However initial performance of novice BCI users may be quite moderate and may cause frustration. This paper reports a pilot study in which a BCI system is used to provide a computer game-based neurofeedback to stroke participants during the MI part of a protocol. Methods: The participants included five chronic hemiplegic stroke sufferers. Participants received up to twelve 30-minute MI practice sessions (in conjunction with PP sessions of the same duration) on 2 days a week for 6 weeks. The BCI neurofeedback performance was evaluated based on the MI task classification accuracy (CA) rate. A set of outcome measures including action research arm test (ARAT) and grip strength (GS), was made use of in assessing the upper limb functional recovery. In addition, since stroke sufferers often experience physical tiredness, which may influence the protocol effectiveness, their fatigue and mood levels were assessed regularly. Results: Positive improvement in at least one of the outcome measures was observed in all the participants, while improvements approached a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the ARAT. The on-line CA of MI induced sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) modulation patterns in the form of lateralized event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) effects, for novice participants was in a moderate range of 60-75% within the limited 12 training sessions. The ERD/ERS change from the first to the last session was statistically significant for only two participants. Conclusions: Overall the crucial observation is that the moderate BCI classification performance did not impede the positive rehabilitation trends as quantified with the rehabilitation outcome measures adopted in this study. Therefore it can be concluded that the BCI supported MI is a feasible intervention as part of a post-stroke rehabilitation protocol combining both PP and MI practice of rehabilitation tasks. Although these findings are promising, the scope of the final conclusions is limited by the small sample size and the lack of a control group.

Methods: Twenty-two (11 for the PSG) healthy young volunteers of both sexes with no history of sleep disturbances ( Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index <5) participated in a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, repeated-dose, 4-period, cross-over study. All volunteers received all 4 treatment sequences: paroxetine-alprazolam placebo (PAP); paroxetine placebo-alprazolam (PPA); paroxetine-alprazolam (PA), and paroxetine placebo-alprazolam placebo (PLA), in a randomized order. Each treatment was administered over 15 consecutive days, with a treatment-free interval of 7 days prior to the subsequent study period. In each experimental period, one PSG sleep study was performed on the 1st night (single-dose effects) and another study was performed on the 15th night (repeated-dose effects). Additionally, two other PSG studies were assessed: an adaptation recording, and a control night recording. All-night PSG recordings were obtained following standard procedures. Each 30-second period was scored according to the criteria of Rechtschaffen and Kales by means of an automatic sleep analysis system: Somnolyzer 24x7(TM). A self-rating scale for sleep and awakening quality and early morning behavior was completed no later than 15 min after awakening over the 15 days of each experimental intervention. General lineal models (treatment/time) were applied separately to each variable. Results: (1) No significant effects were observed in any sleep variables when control nights were compared with the 1st night with PLA. ( 2) Sleep continuity: After PAP a clear awakening effect was seen both in the first and second evaluations, mainly in wake time, movement time, number of awakenings and stage-1 duration. After PPA an evident hypnotic effect was observed on night 1. This effect was mainly observed in maintenance variables and slightly in sleep initiation variables; it had decreased by night 15. After PA an intermediate behavior in the variables related to sleep continuity was seen, highlighting the absence of the tolerance phenomenon observed when PPA was administered alone. ( 3) Sleep architecture: The most important effects in REM sleep were observed after PAP; an increase in REM latency and decreases in REM sleep. PAP also induced decreases in the number of non-REM and REM periods and increases in the average duration of non-REM periods and sleep cycles. PA presented a similar pattern to PAP, and PPA similar to PLA. In relation to non-REM sleep, PA showed more stage-2 and less slow-wave sleep (SWS). ( 4) Subjective perception: No significant differences were observed between treatments while they were being taken, but impairments in subjective sleep quality, awaking quality, latency and efficiency were seen, mainly after PA but also after PPA discontinuations. Conclusion: The combination of PAP and PPA presented an intermediate pattern in relation to sleep continuity, with less awaking effect than PAP alone and less hypnotic effect than PPA alone, and without developing tolerance. The PAP and PPA combination also showed a similar effect to PAP on REM sleep and was the treatment with the longest stage 2 and shortest SWS. No subjective sleep and awakening effects were seen during drug intake but subjective withdrawal reports were seen after abrupt interruption. The hig agreement rate for the epoch-by-epoch comparison between automatic and human scoring confirms the validity of the Somnolyzer 24x7 and thus facilitates sleep studies in neuropsychopharmacological research.

The temporal dynamics of implicit processing of non-letter, letter, and word-forms in the human visual cortex	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						word reading; ERPs; visual cortex; visual orthography	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; HUMAN EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; RIGHT CEREBRAL HEMISPHERE; FACE PERCEPTION; TIME-COURSE; OCCIPITOTEMPORAL CORTEX; OBJECT RECOGNITION; IMAGING COGNITION; LEXICAL DECISION; LETTER-STRINGS	The decoding of visually presented line segments into letters, and letters into words, is critical to fluent reading abilities. Here we investigate the temporal dynamics of visual orthographic processes, focusing specifically on right hemisphere contributions and interactions between the hemispheres involved in the implicit processing of visually presented words, consonants, false fonts, and symbolic strings. High-density EEG was recorded while participants detected infrequent, simple, perceptual targets (dot strings) embedded amongst a of character strings. Beginning at 130 ms, orthographic and non-orthographic stimuli were distinguished by a sequence of ERP effects over occipital recording sites. These early latency occipital effects were dominated by enhanced right-sided negative-polarity activation for non-orthographic stimuli that peaked at around 180 ms. This right-sided effect was followed by bilateral positive occipital activity for false-fonts, but not symbol strings. Moreover the size of components of this later positive occipital wave was inversely correlated with the right-sided ROcc180 wave, suggesting that subjects who had larger early right-sided activation for non-orthographic stimuli had less need for more extended bilateral (e. g., interhemispheric) processing of those stimuli shortly later. Additional early (130-150 ms) negative-polarity activity over left occipital cortex and longer-latency centrally distributed responses (>300 ms) were present, likely reflecting implicit activation of the previously reported 'visual-word-form' area and N400-related responses, respectively. Collectively, these results provide a close look at some relatively unexplored portions of the temporal flow of information processing in the brain related to the implicit processing of potentially linguistic information and provide valuable information about the interactions between hemispheres supporting visual orthographic processing.

Correlation between the parameters of contingent negative variation and characteristics of variational pulsometry in Parkinsonian patients	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						motor EEG potentials; contingent negative variation; variational pulsometry; parasympathetic and sympathetic control; Parkinson's disease	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; DISEASE; POTENTIALS; BRAIN	In patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD), we analyzed correlations between the parameters of contingent negative variation (CNV) and data of variational pulsometry (according to the measurements of R-R ECG intervals). Studies were carried out on 35 patients (group PD), 49 to 74 years old, with the stage of disease of 1.5 to 3.0 according to the Hoehn-Yahr international classification. In the course of CNV recording (i.e., in the state of a certain functional loading), we observed significant negative correlations between the integral magnitude (area) of this potential and indices of variational pulsometry (RMSSD, SDNN, C. var, and HF) that characterize the intensity of parasympathetic (respiratory) influences on the cardiovascular system. In the control group, such correlations were absent. We found significant correlations between the autonomic balance, CNV magnitude, and stage of PD reflecting the level of generalization of the pathological process. In the subgroup of patients with the PD stage 1.5 to 2.0, significant changes in the mean values of indices of parasympathetic influences during recording of the CNV were not observed, while in another subgroup (the PD stage 2.5 to 3.0), these values increased significantly (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). If the estimates of the PD stage were low, the CNV area demonstrated greater values (P < 0.01). The disturbance of coordination of muscle-to-muscle interactions in the PD group is, probably, an important factor responsible for parasympathetic dysregulation and suppression of the CNV generation. We found positive correlation between the intensity of parasympathetic influences in the course of CNV recording and the level of postural disorders (r = 0.37, P < 0.05). On the contrary, the CNV magnitude demonstrated a negative correlation with the intensity of these disorders (r = -0.36, P < 0.05), as well as with the level of postural instability (r = -0.55, P < 0.001). We hypothesize that alterations of the autonomic balance and the activity of those cerebral structures, which are responsible for the motor readiness, result, to a significant extent, from weakening of the activity of the noradrenergic system due to degenerative processes developing in cells of the locus coeruleus. The impairment of the latter structure, together with degeneration of neurons of the substantia nigra and a decrease in the level of nigro-striatal dopamine, underlies the pathomorphological pattern of PD.

J	McCraty, R; Atkinson, M; Bradley, RT				McCraty, R; Atkinson, M; Bradley, RT			Electrophysiological evidence of intuition: Part 2. A system-wide process?	JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE			English	Article							MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; BRAIN; POTENTIALS; HEART; PSI	Objectives: This study aims to contribute to a scientific understanding of intuition, a process by which information normally outside the range of conscious awareness is perceived by the body's psychophysiological systems. The first objective, presented in two empirical reports (Part 1 and Part 2), was to replicate and extend the results of previous experiments demonstrating that the body can respond to an emotionally arousing stimulus seconds before it is actually experienced. The second objective, to be presented in a forthcoming publication (Part 3), is to develop a theory that explains how the body receives and processes information involved in intuitive perception. Design: The study used a counterbalanced crossover design, in which 30 calm and 15 emotionally arousing pictures were presented to 26 participants under two experimental conditions: a baseline condition of "normal" psychophysiologic function and a condition of physiological coherence. Primary measures included: skin conductance; the electroencephalogram (EEG), from which cortical event-related potentials (ERP) and heartbeat-evoked potentials (HBEP) were derived; and the electrocardiogram (ECG), from which cardiac decelerations/ accelerations were derived. These measures were used to investigate where and when in the brain and body intuitive information is processed. Results: The main findings presented here are: (1) surprisingly, both the heart and brain appear to receive and respond to intuitive information; (2) even more surprisingly, there is compelling evidence that the heart appears to receive intuitive information before the brain; (3) there were significant differences in prestimulus ERPs for calm versus emotional stimuli; (4) the frontal cortex, temporal, occipital, and parietal areas appear to be involved in the processing of prestimulus information; (5) there were significant differences in prestimulus calm/emotional HBEPs, primarily in the coherent mode; (6) there were significant gender differences in the processing of prestimulus information. Especially noteworthy is the apparent interaction between the HBEPs and ERPs in the females, which suggests that the heart modulates the ERP and that females are more attuned to intuitive information from the heart. Conclusions: Overall, our data suggest that the heart and brain, together, are involved in receiving, processing, and decoding intuitive information. On the basis of these results and those of other research, it would thus appear that intuitive perception is a system-wide process in which both the heart and brain (and possibly other bodily systems) play a critical role. To account for the study's results, Part 3 will develop a theory based on holographic principles explaining how intuitive perception accesses a field of energy into which information about "future" events is spectrally enfolded.

The surprising role of the heart	JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE			English	Article							STIMULATION; INFORMATION; PSI	Objectives: This study aims to contribute to a scientific understanding of intuition, a process by which information normally outside the range of conscious awareness is perceived by the psychophysiological systems. The first objective, presented in two empirical papers (Part 1 and Part 2), was to replicate and extend the results of previous experiments demonstrating that the body can respond to an emotionally arousing stimulus seconds before it is actually experienced. The second objective, to be presented in a third paper (Part 3), is to develop a theory that explains how the body receives and processes information involved in intuitive perception. Design: The study used a counterbalanced crossover design, in which 30 calm and 15 emotionally arousing pictures were presented to 26 participants under two experimental conditions: a baseline condition of normal psychophysiologic function and a condition of physiological coherence. Primary measures included: skin conductance; the electroencephalogram (EEG), from which cortical event-related potentials and heartbeat-evoked potentials were derived; and the electrocardiogram (ECG), from which cardiac decelerations/accelerations were derived. These measures were used to investigate where and when in the brain and body intuitive information is processed. Results: The study's results are presented in two parts. The main findings in relation to the heart's role in intuitive perception presented here are: (1) surprisingly, the heart appears to receive and respond to intuitive information; (2) a significantly greater heart rate deceleration occurred prior to future emotional stimuli compared to calm Stimuli; (3) there were significant gender differences in the processing of prestimulus information. Part 2 will present results indicating where in the brain intuitive information is processed and data showing that prestimulus information from the heart is Communicated to the brain. It also presents evidence that females are more attuned to intuitive information from the heart. Conclusions: Overall, we have independently replicated and extended previous research documenting prestimulus responses. It appears that the heart is involved in the processing and decoding of intuitive information. Once the prestimulus information is received in the psychophysiologic systems, it appears to be processed in the same way as conventional sensory input. This Study presents compelling evidence that the body's perceptual apparatus is continuously scanning the future. To account for the results presented in Parts 1 and 2, Part 3 will develop a theory based on holographic principles explaining how intuitive perception accesses a field of energy into which information about future events is spectrally enfolded.

J	Grigorenko, EL				Grigorenko, EL			Developmental dyslexia: An update on genes, brains, and environments	JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Review						brain mapping; complex phenotypes; developmental dyslexia; environment; generics; reading ability and disability	ATTENTION-DEFICIT DISORDER; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; PHONOLOGICAL PROCESSING ABILITIES; MULTIPLE-REGRESSION ANALYSIS; QUANTITATIVE-TRAIT LOCUS; CHROMOSOME 6P INFLUENCES; EEG POWER SPECTRA; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; READING-DISABILITY; LEARNING-DISABILITIES	The science of reading and developmental dyslexia has experienced spectacular advances during the last few years. Five aspects of this research are discussed in the article. (1) The holistic phenomenon of reading is complex. Many lower-level psychological processes (e.g., phonemic awareness, phonological decoding, ability to process stimuli rapidly and automatize this process, memory, ability to recognize words) contribute to a single act of reading. Conceptualizing the complex process of reading through its partly overlapping but partly independent components-which contribute to, but do not fully explain, the holistic process of reading-provides an excellent model for understanding complex hierarchies of higher mental functions. Those who master reading skills successfully and those who have difficulties doing so differ in a wide range of reading-related processes. The central deficit experienced by poor readers appears to be related to phonological processing (a complex hierarchy of functions related to processing phonemes), whereas characteristics of automatization processes seem to moderate the reading outcome for people whose phonological skills are weak. (2) There are new data addressing models of dyslexia in languages other than English. The most fascinating finding is that the model implicating phonological deficit as central to dyslexia, and the lack of ability to automatize as leading to troubled reading, appears to be universal, regardless of the specific language. However, there is an interaction effect between the characteristics of a particular language and the developmental model of dyslexia. In phonologically more difficult languages (e.g., English): the most pronounced weakness appears to occur in phonological processing, whereas in phonologically easier languages (e.g., German), the crucial role in the manifestation of dyslexia is played by the lack of the skills needed to achieve automatization. (3) There is abundant evidence that reading (i.e., any single act of reading as well as reading as a holistic process) is "cooked" by the brain. Although no unified brain map of reading has been developed, some specific areas of the brain have been implicated in different reading-related cognitive processes by different laboratories and on different samples. (4) Indisputable evidence has been accumulated suggesting the involvement of the genome in developmental dyslexia. As of now, specific regions of the genome have been identified as being intimately involved with a number of different reading-related processes. Today the field of developmental dyslexia is the only area of genetic studies of human abilities and disabilities in which linkages to the genome have been robustly replicated in independent laboratories. (5) Finally, evidence suggests that developmental dyslexia might be only one of the manifestations of a deep, underlying, anatomical syndrome. The comorbidity of developmental dyslexia with both internalizing and externalizing behavioral disturbances, as well as with other learning disabilities, underscores the need for wide-ranging cognitive and behavioral approaches in the remediation programs offered to dyslexic children.
