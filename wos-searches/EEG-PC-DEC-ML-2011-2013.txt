EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces for Real-Time Decoding of Mental States	KLINISCHE NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE			German	Article						brain-computer interface (BCI); machine learning; readiness potential; neuro-feedback; prosthesis control	CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; MOVEMENT	Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) employ algorithmic procedures of machine learning in order to extract user-specific patterns of high-dimensional EEG features. These patterns are optimised to decode intention-related brain states in real-time. Characteristic BCI applications for paralysed patients are control of active prostheses or speller software. To recognise a user's motor intention a BCI system utilises individual EEG activation indices, such as the readiness potential or the modulation of regional EEG rhythms. Also beyond the borders of rehabilitation, this neurotechnology enables a growing set of novel application scenarios, e. g., BCIs can serve as optimised feedback tools for the stabilisation of mental states such as vigilance or attention.

However, previous works suggest that a great improvement on the classification accuracy of valence and arousal levels is still needed. To address this, we propose a novel emotional EEG feature extraction method: kernel Eigen-emotion pattern (KEEP). An adaptive SVM is also proposed to deal with the problem of learning from imbalanced emotional EEG data sets. In this study, a set of pictures from IAPS are used for emotion induction. Results based on seven participants show that KEEP gives much better classification results than the widely-used EEG frequency band power features. Also, the adaptive SVM greatly improves classification performance of commonly-adopted SVM classifier. Combined use of KEEP and adaptive SVM can achieve high average valence and arousal classification rates of 73.42% and 73.57%. The highest classification rates for valence and arousal are 80% and 79%, respectively. The results are very promising.

In this paper, the classical CSP-SVM schema is improved and a feature learning method based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is utilized for depicting patients' imagery EEG distribution features. We apply the proposed modeling program in two different modules of our online BCI-FES rehabilitation platform and achieve a relatively higher discrimination accuracy. Sufficient observations and test cases on patients' MI data sets have been implemented for validating the GMM model. The results also reveal some working mechanisms and recovery appearances of impaired cortex during the rehabilitation training period.

The vigilance states are usually categorized in at least three states, including slow wave sleep (SWS), rapid eye movement sleep (REM), and awakening. To identify different vigilance states, even a well-trained expert must spend a lot of time analyzing a mass of physiological recording data. This study proposes an automatic vigilance stages classification method for analyzing EEG signals in rats. The EEG signals were transferred by fast Fourier transform before extracting features. These extracted features were then used as training patterns to construct the proposed classification system. The proposed classification system contains two functional units. The first unit is principle component analysis (PCA) method, which is used to project the high dimensional features into the lower dimensional subspace. The second unit is the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) method, which identifies the physiological state in each EEG signal epoch. Based on the results of analyzing 810 epochs of EEG signal, the proposed classification method achieves satisfactory classification accuracy for vigilance states. Based on machine-learning algorithms, the classifier learns to approach the configuration that best fits the categorization task. Therefore, additional training in searching best parameters and thresholds can be avoided. Moreover, the PCA algorithm projects data instances into a 3-D space, making it possible to visualize state-changing dynamics. Experimental results show that the proposed machine-learning based classifier performs better than conventional vigilance state classification algorithms. The results also suggest that it is possible to identify the vigilance states with only EEG signals using the proposed pattern recognition technique.

This frequency-temporal-spatial pattern is the key of motor intention decoding which is the basis of brain-computer interfaces by motor imagery. We present a new method for motor-related electroencephalography recognition which comprehensively optimizes the frequency-time-space features in a user-specific way. The recognition work focuses on three points: proper time and frequency domain segmentation, spatial optimization based on common spatial pattern filters and feature importance evaluation. We show that by combining the advantages of these optimizational methods, the proposed algorithm effectively improves motor task classification, and the recognized signal chanracteristics can be used to visualize the motor related electroencephalography patterns under different conditions.

In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive framework for decoding ERPs, elaborating on linear concepts, namely spatio-temporal patterns and filters as well as linear ERP classification. However, the bottleneck of these techniques is that they require an accurate covariance matrix estimation in high dimensional sensor spaces which is a highly intricate problem. As a remedy, we propose to use shrinkage estimators and show that appropriate regularization of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) by shrinkage yields excellent results for single-trial ERP classification that are far superior to classical LDA classification. Furthermore, we give practical hints on the interpretation of what classifiers learned from the data and demonstrate in particular that the trade-off between goodness-of-fit and model complexity in regularized LDA relates to a morphing between a difference pattern of ERPs and a spatial filter which cancels non task-related brain activity.

They provide the means to decode and characterize task relevant brain states and to distinguish them from non-informative brain signals. While undoubtedly this machinery has helped to gain novel biological insights, it also holds the danger of potential unintentional abuse. Ideally machine learning techniques should be usable for any non-expert, however, unfortunately they are typically not. Overfitting and other pitfalls may occur and lead to spurious and nonsensical interpretation. The goal of this review is therefore to provide an accessible and clear introduction to the strengths and also the inherent dangers of machine learning usage in the neurosciences.

Different individuals perceive the very same painful event largely differently. Here, we aimed to predict the individual pain sensitivity from brain activity. We repeatedly applied identical painful stimuli to healthy human subjects and recorded brain activity by using electroencephalography (EEG). We applied a multivariate pattern analysis to the time-frequency transformed single-trial EEG responses. Our results show that a classifier trained on a group of healthy individuals can predict another individual's pain sensitivity with an accuracy of 83%. Classification accuracy depended on pain-evoked responses at about 8 Hz and pain-induced gamma oscillations at about 80 Hz. These results reveal that the temporal-spectral pattern of pain-related neuronal responses provides valuable information about the perception of pain. Beyond, our approach may help to establish an objective neuronal marker of pain sensitivity which can potentially be recorded from a single EEG electrode.

EEG plays an outstanding role particularly in diagnostic and classification of epilepsy syndromes, in presurgical evaluation of focal epilepsies and in differential diagnosis of obtunded patients. Beside the technical and physiological basis of EEG, this review includes the interpretation of normal and pathological EEG activity. Because of the high clinical relevance, EEG-patterns of status epilepticus and encephalopathies were particularly considered.	[Graf, W.; Hamer, H.

This work shows significant improvement in a movement based self-paced BCI by applying a new sparse learning classification algorithm, probabilistic classification vector machines (PCVMs) to classify EEG signal. Constant-Q filters instead of constant bandwidth filters for frequency decomposition are also shown to enhance the discrimination of movement related patterns from EEG patterns associated with idle state. Analysis of the data recorded from seven subjects executing foot movement using the constant-Q filters and PCVMs shows a statistically significant 17% (p<0.03) average improvement in true positive rate (TPR) and a 2% (p<0.03) reduction in false positive rate (FPR) compared with applying constant bandwidth filters and SVM classifier.

The SoC integrates 8 high-dynamic range Analog Front-End (AFE) channels, a machine-learning seizure classification processor and a 64 KB SRAM. The classification processor exploits the Distributed Quad-LUT filter architecture to minimize the area while also minimizing the overhead in power x delay. The AFE employs a Chopper-Stabilized Capacitive Coupled Instrumentation Amplifier to show NEF of 5.1 and noise RTI of 0.91 mu V-rms for 0.5-100 Hz bandwidth. The classification processor adopts a support-vector machine as a classifier, with a GBW controller that gives real-time gain and bandwidth feedback to AFE to maintain accuracy. The SoC is verified with the Children's Hospital Boston-MIT EEG database as well as with rapid eye blink pattern detection test. The SoC is implemented in 0.18 mu m 1P6M CMOS process occupying 25 mm(2), and it shows an accuracy of 84.4% in eye blink classification test, at 2.03 mu J/classification energy efficiency. The 64 KB on chip memory can store up to 120 seconds of raw EEG data.

Its diagnosis should be based upon clinical history, neuropsychological and laboratory tests, neuroimaging and electroencephalography (EEG). Therefore, new approaches are necessary to enable earlier and more accurate diagnosis and to follow treatment results. In this study we used a Machine Learning (ML) technique, named Support Vector Machine (SVM), to search patterns in EEG epochs to differentiate AD patients from controls. As a result, we developed a quantitative EEG (qEEG) processing method for automatic differentiation of patients with AD from normal individuals, as a complement to the diagnosis of probable dementia. We studied EEGs from 19 normal subjects (14 females/5 males, mean age 71.6 years) and 16 probable mild to moderate symptoms AD patients (14 females/2 males, mean age 73.4 years. The results obtained from analysis of EEG epochs were accuracy 79.9% and sensitivity 83.2%. The analysis considering the diagnosis of each individual patient reached 87.0% accuracy and 91.7% sensitivity.	[Kanda, Paulo A.

It is evident that progress towards this goal will greatly benefit from multivariate pattern classification (MVPC) techniques that can decode representations in brain activity with high temporal resolution. Recently, progress along these lines has been achieved by applying MVPC to neural oscillations recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). We highlight two examples of methodological approaches for MVPC of EEG and MEG data that can be used to study memory function. The first example aims at understanding the dynamic neural mechanisms that enable reactivation of memory representations, i.e., memory replay; we discuss how MVPC can help uncover the physiological mechanisms underlying memory replay during working memory maintenance and episodic memory. The second example aims at understanding representational differences between various types of memory, such as perceptual priming and conscious recognition memory. We also highlight the conceptual and methodological differences between these two examples. Finally, we discuss potential future applications for MVPC of EEG/MEG data in studies of memory. We conclude that despite its infancy and existing methodological challenges, MVPC of EEG and MEG data is a powerful tool with which to assess mechanistic models of memory.

J	Liu, NH; Chiang, CY; Chu, HC				Liu, Ning-Han; Chiang, Cheng-Yu; Chu, Hsuan-Chin			Recognizing the Degree of Human Attention Using EEG Signals from Mobile Sensors	SENSORS			English	Article						electroencephalogram; attention status; electroencephalography (EEG) classification; support vector machine		During the learning process, whether students remain attentive throughout instruction generally influences their learning efficacy. If teachers can instantly identify whether students are attentive they can be suitably reminded to remain focused, thereby improving their learning effects. Traditional teaching methods generally require that teachers observe students' expressions to determine whether they are attentively learning. However, this method is often inaccurate and increases the burden on teachers. With the development of electroencephalography (EEG) detection tools, mobile brainwave sensors have become mature and affordable equipment. Therefore, in this study, whether students are attentive or inattentive during instruction is determined by observing their EEG signals. Because distinguishing between attentiveness and inattentiveness is challenging, two scenarios were developed for this study to measure the subjects' EEG signals when attentive and inattentive. After collecting EEG data using mobile sensors, various common features were extracted from the raw data. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to calculate and analyze these features to identify the combination of features that best indicates whether students are attentive. Based on the experiment results, the method proposed in this study provides a classification accuracy of up to 76.82%. The study results can be used as a reference for learning system designs in the future.

Traditionally, time locking, or perfect timing, information between stimulus and EEG recordings have been crucial in locating the region of possible neural response. In reality, the stimulus' time information is usually unavailable and the latency of test subjects may not be constant (due to fatigue, concentration, interference, etc.). Therefore, new classification approaches that do not depend on stimulus' time information are needed. To tackle this problem, we firstly characterized the brain response pattern of the target event using the EEG data, in which the timing information is available. Then, based on the pattern, a sliding window was applied to the EEG recordings to detect possible target image response started from each individual location. Finally, the probability of a target image event appeared during an entire EEG recording epoch is estimated by summarizing all the possible locations. The results show that, for classification of EEG epochs of 5s, the approach we proposed can obtain a median area under ROC 0.96, a result that comparable to that with perfect stimulus time information.

Fast and precise pattern matching of acquired signals represents one of the most important challenges. In this article, a method for signal pattern matching based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization is proposed. We also utilize short-time Fourier transform to preprocess EEG data and Cosine Similarity Measure to perform query-based classification. The recognition algorithm shows promising results in execution speed and is suitable for implementation on graphics processors to achieve real-time processing, making the proposed method suitable for real-world, real-time applications. In terms of recognition accuracy, our experiments show that accuracy greatly depends on the choice of input parameters.

The spontaneous seizure onset influences the daily life of epilepsy patients. The studies on feature extraction and feature classification from Electroencephalography(EEG) signal in seizure prediction methods have shown great improvement these years. However, the variation issue of EEG signal (being awake, being asleep, severity of epilepsy, etc.) poses a fundamental difficulty in seizure prediction problem. The traditional off-line training method trains the model using a fixed training set, and expects the performance of the model to remain stable even after a long period of time, and thus suffers from variation issue. In this paper, we propose an on-line retraining method to leverage the recent input data by gradually enlarging the training set and retraining the model. Also, a simple post-processing scheme is incorporated to reduce false alarms. We develop our method based on the state of the art machine learning based classification of bivariate patterns method. The performance of the method is evaluated on Electrocorticogram(ECoG) recording from Freiburg database as well as long-term scalp EEG recording from CHB-MIT EEG Database and National Taiwan University Hospital. The proposed method achieves 74.2% sensitivity on ECoG database and 52.2% sensitivity on scalp EEG database, while improving the sensitivity of off-line training method by 29.0% and 17.4% in ECoG database and EEG database respectively. The experimental result suggests that on-line retraining can greatly improve the reliability and is promising for future seizure prediction method development.

These algorithms exploit information contained in temporal, spatial, or spatio-temporal patterns of independent variables (features) to detect subtle but reliable differences between brain responses to external stimuli or internal brain states. When applied to the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, a choice needs to be made on how the input features to the algorithm are obtained from the signal amplitudes measured at the various channels. In this article, we consider six types of pattern analyses deriving from the combination of three types of feature selection in the temporal domain (predefined windows, shifting window, whole trial) with two approaches to handle the channel dimension (channel wise, multi-channel). We combined these different types of analyses with a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier and analyzed a multi-subject EEG data set from a study aimed at understanding the task dependence of the cortical mechanisms for encoding speaker's identity and speech content (vowels) from short speech utterances (Bonte, Valente, & Formisano, 2009). Outcomes of the analyses showed that different grouping of available features helps highlighting complementary (i.e. temporal, topographic) aspects of information content in the data. A shifting window/multi-channel approach proved especially valuable in tracing both the early build up of neural information reflecting speaker or vowel identity and the late and task-dependent maintenance of relevant information reflecting the performance of a working memory task. Because it exploits the high temporal resolution of EEG (and MEG), such a shifting window approach with sequential multi-channel classifications seems the most appropriate choice for tracing the temporal profile of neural information processing.

Our goal is to correctly predict, given a short EEG segment, whether the participant was imagining a positive respectively negative-valence emotional scenario during the given segment using a predictive model learned via machine learning. The challenge lies in generalizing to novel (i.e., previously unseen) emotion episodes from a wide variety of scenarios including love, awe, frustration, anger, etc. based purely on spontaneous oscillatory EEG activity without stimulus event-locked responses. Using a variant of the Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern algorithm, we achieve an average accuracy of 71.3% correct classification of binary valence rating across 12 different emotional imagery scenarios under rigorous block-wise cross-validation.

In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian framework for discriminative feature extraction for motor imagery classification in an EEG-based BCI in which the class-discriminative frequency bands and the corresponding spatial filters are optimized by means of the probabilistic and information-theoretic approaches. In our framework, the problem of simultaneous spatiospectral filter optimization is formulated as the estimation of an unknown posterior probability density function (pdf) that represents the probability that a single-trial EEG of predefined mental tasks can be discriminated in a state. In order to estimate the posterior pdf, we propose a particle-based approximation method by extending a factored-sampling technique with a diffusion process. An information-theoretic observation model is also devised to measure discriminative power of features between classes. From the viewpoint of classifier design, the proposed method naturally allows us to construct a spectrally weighted label decision rule by linearly combining the outputs from multiple classifiers. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method by analyzing the results and its success on three public databases.

The proposed method using support vectors machine (SVM) with the structure risk minimization provides us an effective way of learning machine and modeling. The problem of solving the quadratic programming becomes a bottle-neck of training the SVM due to the long time of SVM training. In this paper, a local-SVM algorithm is proposed for modeling EEG time series. The local model is developed for improving the prediction of EEG signals. Furthermore, the presented model is used to detect the epilepsy from EEG signals in which dynamical characteristics are difference between normal and epilepsy EEG signals. Several experimental results were given to show that the training of the local-SVM provides a good behavior. Finally, the local SVM approach significantly improves the prediction and detection precision.

In particular, decoding trajectory of upper limb with motor imagery (MI) can support motor rehabilitation using a wearable robotic arm. Recent research shows the possibility of decoding hand movement trajectory from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, such studies are insufficient to apply motor rehabilitation, which are only considered hand movement trajectory. Although disabilities patients take correct hand movement, sometimes wrong elbow movement can be taken in motor rehabilitation. In this study, we explore to decode velocity of both hand and elbow at the same time from EEG signals when subjects move upper limb. The result shows feasibility toward controlling robotic arm.

Part of this evidence encompasses studies, including our previous work, demonstrating that gait kinematics and limb coordination during treadmill walking can be inferred from the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) with reasonably high decoding accuracies. These results provide impetus for development of non-invasive brain-machine-interface (BMI) systems for use in restoration and/or augmentation of gait-a primary goal of rehabilitation research. To date, studies examining EEG decoding of activity during gait have been limited to treadmill walking in a controlled environment. However, to be practically viable a BMI system must be applicable for use in everyday locomotor tasks such as over ground walking and turning. Here, we present a novel protocol for non-invasive collection of brain activity (EEG), muscle activity (electromyography (EMG)), and whole-body kinematic data (head, torso, and limb trajectories) during both treadmill and over ground walking tasks. By collecting these data in the uncontrolled environment insight can be gained regarding the feasibility of decoding unconstrained gait and surface EMG from scalp EEG.

J	Lee, TJ; Park, SM; Sim, KB				Lee, Tae-Ju; Park, Seung-Min; Sim, Kwee-Bo			Electroencephalography Signal Grouping and Feature Classification Using Harmony Search for BCI	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article							ALGORITHM; REAL; OPTIMIZATION	This paper presents a heuristic method for electroencephalography (EEG) grouping and feature classification using harmony search (HS) for improving the accuracy of the brain-computer interface (BCI) system. EEG, a noninvasive BCI method, uses many electrodes on the scalp, and a large number of electrodes make the resulting analysis difficult. In addition, traditional EEG analysis cannot handle multiple stimuli. On the other hand, the classification method using the EEG signal has a low accuracy. To solve these problems, we use a heuristic approach to reduce the complexities in multichannel problems and classification. In this study, we build a group of stimuli using the HS algorithm. Then, the features from common spatial patterns are classified by the HS classifier. To confirm the proposed method, we perform experiments using 64-channel EEG equipment. The subjects are subjected to three kinds of stimuli: audio, visual, and motion. Each stimulus is applied alone or in combination with the others. The acquired signals are processed by the proposed method. The classification results in an accuracy of approximately 63%. We conclude that the heuristic approach using the HS algorithm on the BCI is beneficial for EEG signal analysis.

Neural activity was recorded while participants silently named images of mammals and tools, and category could be detected in single trials with an accuracy well above chance, both when considering data from single participants, and when group-training across participants. By aggregating across all trials, single concepts could be correctly assigned to their category with an accuracy of 98%. The pattern of classifications made by the algorithm confirmed that the neural patterns identified are due to conceptual category, and not any of a series of processing-related confounds. The time intervals, frequency bands and scalp locations that proved most informative for prediction permit physiological interpretation: the widespread activation shortly after appearance of the stimulus (from 100 ms) is consistent both with accounts of multi-pass processing, and distributed representations of categories. These methods provide an alternative to fMRI for fine-grained, large-scale investigations of the conceptual lexicon. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Education of a Child Neurologist: Epilepsy and Electroencephalography	SEMINARS IN PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Review							UNPROVOKED SEIZURES	Epilepsy is one of the most common disorders encountered in pediatric neurology. A well-trained child neurologist should have an understanding of the neurobiological causes of seizures, classification of seizures and epilepsy, etiologic evaluation, and treatment of both seizures and associated comorbid conditions. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important diagnostic test in epilepsy, and child neurologists should be knowledgeable in the physiological basis of EEG and how to identify normal and abnormal patterns in neonates and children.

Assessing speech quality perception is a challenge typically addressed in behavioral and opinion-seeking experiments. Only recently, neuroimaging methods were introduced, which were used to study the neural processing of quality at group level. However, our electroencephalography (EEG) studies show that the neural correlates of quality perception are highly individual. Therefore, it became necessary to establish dedicated machine learning methods for decoding subject-specific effects. Approach. The effectiveness of our methods is shown by the data of an EEG study that investigates how the quality of spoken vowels is processed neurally. Participants were asked to indicate whether they had perceived a degradation of quality (signal-correlated noise) in vowels, presented in an oddball paradigm. Main results. We find that the P3 amplitude is attenuated with increasing noise. Single-trial analysis allows one to show that this is partly due to an increasing jitter of the P3 component. A novel classification approach helps to detect trials with presumably non-conscious processing at the threshold of perception. We show that this approach uncovers a non-trivial confounder between neural hits and neural misses. Significance. The combined use of EEG signals and machine learning methods results in a significant 'neural' gain in sensitivity (in processing quality loss) when compared to standard behavioral evaluation; averaged over 11 subjects, this amounts to a relative improvement in sensitivity of 35%.

Modeling electroencephalography waveforms with semi-supervised deep belief nets: fast classification and anomaly measurement	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SEIZURE ONSET; AUTOMATED DETECTION; EPILEPTIC ACTIVITY; SPIKE DETECTION; CRITICALLY-ILL; EEG PATTERNS; ALGORITHM; RECOGNITION; FEATURES	Clinical electroencephalography (EEG) records vast amounts of human complex data yet is still reviewed primarily by human readers. Deep belief nets (DBNs) are a relatively new type of multi-layer neural network commonly tested on two-dimensional image data but are rarely applied to times-series data such as EEG. We apply DBNs in a semi-supervised paradigm to model EEG waveforms for classification and anomaly detection. DBN performance was comparable to standard classifiers on our EEG dataset, and classification time was found to be 1.7-103.7 times faster than the other high-performing classifiers. We demonstrate how the unsupervised step of DBN learning produces an autoencoder that can naturally be used in anomaly measurement. We compare the use of raw, unprocessed data-a rarity in automated physiological waveform analysis-with hand-chosen features and find that raw data produce comparable classification and better anomaly measurement performance. These results indicate that DBNs and raw data inputs may be more effective for online automated EEG waveform recognition than other common techniques.	[Wulsin, D. F.; Gupta, J. R.; Blanco, J.

The method using support vectors machine (SVM) based on the structure risk minimization provides us an effective way of learning machine. But solving the quadratic programming problem for training SVM becomes a bottle-neck of using SVM because of the long time of SVM training. In this paper, a local-SVM method is proposed for modeling EEG signals. The local method is presented for improving the speed of the prediction of EEG signals. Furthermore, this proposed model is used to detect epilepsy from EEG signals in which dynamical characteristics are difference between normal and epilepsy EEG signals. The experimental results show that the training of the local-SVM obtains a good behavior. In addition, the local SVM method significantly improves the prediction and detection precision.

The aim of this article is to discuss the use of machine learning and discrimination methods and their possible application to the analysis of infant event-related potential (ERP) data. The usefulness of two methods, regularized discriminant function analyses and support vector machines, will be demonstrated by reanalyzing an ERP dataset from infants (Elsabbagh et al., 2009). Using cross-validation, both methods successfully discriminated above chance between groups of infants at high and low risk of a later diagnosis of autism. The suitability of machine learning methods for the use of single trial or averaged ERP data is discussed.

Efficient automatic classifiers for the detection of A phases of the cyclic alternating pattern in sleep	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Sleep; Cyclic alternating pattern; Neural networks; Support vector machines; Machine learning	GATE-CONTROL; CAP; CLASSIFICATION; VALIDATION	This study aims to develop an automatic detector of the A phases of the cyclic alternating pattern, periodic activity that generally occurs during non-REM (NREM) sleep. Eight polysomnographic recordings from healthy subjects were examined. From EEG recordings, five band descriptors, an activity descriptor and a variance descriptor were extracted and used to train different machine-learning algorithms. A visual scoring provided by an expert clinician was used as golden standard. Four alternative mathematical machine-learning techniques were implemented: (1) discriminant classifier, (2) support vector machines, (3) adaptive boosting, and (4) supervised artificial neural network. The results of the classification, compared with the visual analysis, showed average accuracies equal to 84.9 and 81.5% for the linear discriminant and the neural network, respectively, while AdaBoost had a slightly lower accuracy, equal to 79.4%. The SVM leads to accuracy of 81.9%. The performance achieved by the automatic classification is encouraging, since an efficient automatic classifier would benefit the practice in everyday clinics, preventing the physician from the time-consuming activity of the visually scoring of the sleep microstructure over whole 8-h sleep recordings. Finally, the classification based on learning algorithms would provide an objective criterion, overcoming the problems of inter-scorer disagreement.

The proposed BCI system implements decoding the brain state by using a non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals, in combination with machine learning, artificial intelligence and automatic content and similarity analysis of images. The user can spell search queries using a mental typewriter (Hex-O-Speller), and the resulting images from the web search are shown to the user as a Rapid Serial Visual Presentations (RSVP). For each image shown, the EEG response is used by the system to recognize the user's interests and narrow down the search results. In addition, it also adds more descriptive terms to the search query, and retrieves more specific image search results and repeats the process. As a proof of concept, a prototype system was designed to test the navigation through the interface and the Hex-o-Speller using an event-related potential(ERP) detection and classification system.The results and challenges faced were noted and analyzed.

The electroencephalography (EEG) signal is the most commonly used inputs for BCI applications but EEG is often contaminated with noise. To overcome such drawbacks, in this paper we use the common spatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction from EEG and the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for motor imagery classification. In this study, CSP and LDA have been used to reduce the artifact and classify MI-based EEG signal. We have used two-level cross validation scheme to determine the subject specific best time window and number of CSP features. We have compared the performance of our system with BCI competition results. We have also experimented with MI data generated in our lab. The proposed system is found to produce good results. In particular, using our EEG data for MI movements, we have obtained an average classification accuracy of 80% for two subjects using only 9 channels, without any feature selection. This proposed MI-based BCI system may be used in real life applications.

Identification of Time-Frequency EEG Features Modulated by Force Direction in Arm Isometric Exertions	2011 5TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS) Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	APR 27-MAY 01, 2011	Cancun, MEXICO	Natl Sci Fdn (NSF), Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS), IEEE			BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE; MOVEMENT	Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity associated with human motor tasks has been studied in time domain and time-frequency representations. Various classification and decoding techniques have been used to extract movement or motor task parameters from EEG such as direction of an isometrically exerted force. Identification of time and time-frequency regions that contain the highest directional information can considerably enhance the efficiency of decoding and classification algorithms. In this paper we have addressed this issue for directional arm isometric exertions to 4 different directions in horizontal plane. We have used the non-parametric Permutational ANOVA to identify time-frequency regions capturing the highest level of inter-group variance as a measure of directional information. There are information-rich regions in delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands after corresponding visual cues. Parietal regions show higher directional information during planning compared to execution. The results can be used for pattern classification and decoding of motor parameters in Brain-Computer-Interfacing (BCI) and BCI-rehabilitation.

In this study, we utilized an analysis approach for single-trial electroencephalography (EEG) to analyze the spatio-temporal activation patterns of visual objects processing in human brains, and attempted to apply it to discriminate different visual objects. The spatial patterns were respectively extracted from scalp EEG and the reconstructed cortical sources, while the experiment participants were perceiving 4 different categories of visual objects (faces, buildings, cats and cars). By classifying the patterns extracted from single-trial EEG, the presented visual objects could be discriminated by a computer, and the classification accuracies may provide a quantitative index to evaluate the spatial differences of the brain activations related to different visual objects. Our results demonstrated that the spatial patterns on both the scalp and the sources levels resulted in higher classification accuracies than chance rate. We also examined the classification results using temporally non-overlapping time intervals of different event-related potential (ERP) components. The temporal changes of classification accuracies may reflect the temporal distribution of the discriminative information in the EEG responses. The present pattern extraction and classification methods may compose a computational model for single-trial EEG data analysis in investigations of the spatio-temporal activation patterns for object recognition. These spatio-temporal patterns in EEG may be useful to identifying the discriminative spatial areas and time stages to improve the accuracies and efficiencies of object discrimination. In addition, investigating and utilizing humans' cognitive mechanisms of object recognition may improve computers' processing efficiency of visual information.

The results of the work can be applied in real applications, for example in market survey or neuro-marketing. This interesting problem requires to recognize naturally human emotions which come from our mind but ignore the external expressions fully controlled by a subject. A popular approach uses key information from electroencephalography (EEG) signals to identify human emotions. In this paper, we proposed an emotion recognition model based on the Russell's circumplex model, Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD) algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. Moreover, we also proposed a method to determine an emotion label of a series of EEG signals. Our model includes two main approaches in machine learning step. In a first approach, machine learning was utilized for all EEG signals from numerous subjects while another used machine learning for each particular subject. We extensively implemented our model in several test data. The experimental results showed that the first approach is impossible to apply in practical applications because EEG signal of each subject has individual characteristic. In addition, in the second, our model can recognize five basic states of human emotion in real-time with average accuracy 70.5%.

The lack of a unified EEG terminology, and of evidence-based EEG criteria, leads to varying criteria for and ability to diagnose NCSE. We propose a unified terminology and classification system for NCSE, using, as a template, the Standardised Computer-based Organised Reporting of EEG (SCORE). This approach integrates the terminology recently proposed for the rhythmic and periodic patterns in critically ill patients, the electroclinical classification of NCSE (type of NCSE) and the context for the pathologic conditions and age-related epilepsy syndromes. We propose flexible EEG criteria that employ the SCORE system to assemble a database for determining evidence-based EEG criteria for NCSE.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive, inexpensive and useful tool for investigating the neurobiology of schizophrenia and its subtypes. EEG studies elucidate the neurophysiological mechanisms potentially underlying clinical symptomatology. In this review article recent advances in applying EEG to study pathophysiology, phenomenology, and treatment response in schizophrenia are discussed. Investigative strategies employed include: analyzing quantitative EEG (QEEG) spectral power during the resting state and cognitive tasks; applying machine learning methods to identify QEEG indicators of diagnosis and treatment response; and using the event-related brain potential (ERP) technique to characterize the neurocognitive processes underlying clinical symptoms. Studies attempting to validate potential EEG biomarkers of schizophrenia and its symptoms, which could be useful in assessing familial risk and treatment response, are also reviewed.

Decoding word and category-specific spatiotemporal representations from MEG and EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Language; Semantic category; Machine learning; Decoding; MEG; EEG	CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE; BRAIN POTENTIALS; DISTRIBUTED ACCOUNT; NEURAL BASIS; LANGUAGE; DYNAMICS; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; ORGANIZATION; RECOGNITION	The organization and localization of lexico-semantic information in the brain has been debated for many years. Specifically, lesion and imaging studies have attempted to map the brain areas representing living versus nonliving objects, however, results remain variable. This may be due, in part, to the fact that the univariate statistical mapping analyses used to detect these brain areas are typically insensitive to subtle, but widespread, effects. Decoding techniques, on the other hand, allow for a powerful multivariate analysis of multichannel neural data. In this study, we utilize machine-learning algorithms to first demonstrate that semantic category, as well as individual words, can be decoded from EEG and MEG recordings of subjects performing a language task. Mean accuracies of 76% (chance = 50%) and 83% (chance = 20%) were obtained for the decoding of living vs. nonliving category or individual words respectively. Furthermore, we utilize this decoding analysis to demonstrate that the representations of words and semantic category are highly distributed both spatially and temporally. In particular, bilateral anterior temporal, bilateral inferior frontal, and left inferior temporal-occipital sensors are most important for discrimination. Successful intersubject and intermodality decoding shows that semantic representations between stimulus modalities and individuals are reasonably consistent. These results suggest that both word and category-specific information are present in extracranially recorded neural activity and that these representations may be more distributed, both spatially and temporally, than previous studies suggest.

Models in CSP or PCSP are trained on a subject-by-subject basis so that inter-subject information is not used. In the case of multi-subject EEG classification where brain waves recorded from multiple subjects who undergo the same mental task are available, it is desirable to capture inter-subject relatedness in learning a model. In this paper we present a nonparametric Bayesian model for a multi-subject extension of CSP where subject relatedness is captured by assuming that spatial patterns across subjects share a latent subspace. Spatial patterns and the shared latent subspace are jointly learned by variational inference. We use an infinite latent feature model to automatically infer the dimension of the shared latent subspace, placing Indian Buffet process (IBP) priors on our model. Numerical experiments on BCI competition IV 2a dataset demonstrate the high performance of our method, compared to PCSP and existing Bayesian multi-task CSP models.

Neuromuscular electrical stimulation induced brain patterns to decode motor imagery	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Motor imagery; Neuromuscular electrical stimulation; Afferent patterns; Efferent pattern classification; BCI-inefficency	COMPUTER INTERFACE; SPATIAL FILTERS; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE	Objective: Regardless of the paradigm used to implement a brain-computer interface (BCI), all systems suffer from BCI-inefficiency. In the case of patients the inefficiency can be high. Some solutions have been proposed to overcome this problem, however they have not been completely successful yet. Methods: EEG from 10 healthy users was recorded during neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of hands and feet and during motor imagery (MI) of the same limbs. Features and classifiers were computed using part of these data to decode MI. Results: Offline analyses showed that it was possible to decode MI using a classifier based on afferent patterns induced by NMES and even infer a better model than with MI data. Conclusion: Afferent NMES motor patterns can support the calibration of BCI systems and be used to decode MI. Significance: This finding might be a new way to train sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) based BCI systems for healthy users having difficulties to attain BCI control.

J	Song, YD; Zhang, JX				Song, Yuedong; Zhang, Jiaxiang			Automatic recognition of epileptic EEG patterns via Extreme Learning Machine and multiresolution feature extraction	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Epilepsy diagnosis; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Multiresolution analysis; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithm (GA); Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)	PERMUTATION ENTROPY; CLASSIFICATION; SEIZURES; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SIGNALS; SYSTEM; ENERGY	Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders- approximately one in every 100 people worldwide are suffering from it. In this paper, a novel pattern recognition model is presented for automatic epilepsy diagnosis. Wavelet transform is investigated to decompose EEG into five EEG frequency bands which approximate to delta (delta), theta (theta), alpha (alpha), beta (beta) and gamma (gamma) bands. Complexity based features such as permutation entropy (PE), sample entropy (SampEn), and the Hurst exponent (HE) are extracted from both the original EEG signals and each of the frequency bands. The wavelet-based methodology separates the alterations in PE, SampEn, and HE in specific frequency bands of the EEG. The effectiveness of these complexity based measures in discriminating between normal brain state and brain state during the absence of seizures is evaluated using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). It is discovered that although there exists no significant differences in the feature values extracted from the original EEG signals, differences can be recognized when the features are examined within specific EEG frequency bands. A genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to choose feature subsets that are effective for enhancing the recognition performance. The GA is also examined for weight alteration for both sensitivity and specificity. The results show that the abnormal EEG diagnosis rate of the model without the involvement of the genetic algorithm is 85.9%. However, the diagnosis rate of the model increases to 94.2% when the genetic algorithm is integrated as a feature selector. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We also propose the Waveformlength Optimal Spatial Filter (WOSF), an optimal spatial filter to classify EEG signals based on WL features. Evaluations on 15 subjects suggested that WOSF with WL features provide performances that are competitive with that of Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) with Band Power (BP) features, CSP being the optimal spatial filter for BP features. More interestingly, our results suggested that combining WOSF with CSP features leads to classification performances that are significantly better than that of CSP alone (80% versus 77% average accuracy respectively).

We evaluated the accuracy of a tailored automated spike quantification algorithm. The automated quantification was compared with the quantification by two board-certified clinical neurophysiologists (gold-standard) in five steps: 1) accuracy in a single EEG channel (5 EEG samples), 2) accuracy in multiple EEG channels and across different stages of the sleep-wake cycles (75 EEG samples), 3) capacity to detect lateralization of spikes (6 EEG samples), 4) accuracy after application of a machine-learning mechanism (11 EEG samples), and 5) accuracy during wakefulness only (8 EEG samples). Our method was accurate during all stages of the sleep-wake cycle and improved after the application of the machine-learning mechanism. Spikes were correctly lateralized in all cases. Our automated method was accurate in quantifying and detecting the lateralization of interictal spikes in raw unprocessed EEG samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we show that it is possible to train linear classifiers to decode hand movement direction to eight 3D spatial targets, in both planning and movement windows, using only the fluctuations in the amplitude of smoothed low-frequency signals from high-density scalp EEG. Taken together these results support the design of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) based on non-invasive scalp EEG signals and suggest that the current perception of the limits of EEG as a source signal for BCI applications merits further examination.

Although EEG-based neurofeedback has been long employed both in experimental and clinical investigation, functional MRI (fMRI)-based neurofeedback emerged as a promising method, given its superior spatial resolution and ability to gauge deep cortical and subcortical brain regions. In combination with improved computational approaches, such as pattern recognition analysis (e. g., Support Vector Machines, SVM), fMRI neurofeedback and brain decoding represent key innovations in the field of neuromodulation and functional plasticity. Expansion in this field and its applications critically depend on the existence of freely available, integrated and user-friendly tools for the neuroimaging research community. Here, we introduce FRIEND, a graphic-oriented user-friendly interface package for fMRI neurofeedback and real-time multivoxel pattern decoding. The package integrates routines for image preprocessing in real-time, ROI-based feedback (single-ROI BOLD level and functional connectivity) and brain decoding-based feedback using SVM. FRIEND delivers an intuitive graphic interface with flexible processing pipelines involving optimized procedures embedding widely validated packages, such as FSL and libSVM. In addition, a user-defined visual neurofeedback module allows users to easily design and run fMRI neurofeedback experiments using ROI-based or multivariate classification approaches. FRIEND is open-source and free for non-commercial use. Processing tutorials and extensive documentation are available.

It was previously shown that the distribution of interburst interval durations predicts clinical outcome, but in previous work the information within the bursts has been neglected. In this paper, we perform exploratory analysis of feature extraction of burst characteristics and use machine learning techniques to show that such features could be used for outcome prediction. The results are promising, but further verification in larger datasets is needed to obtain conclusive results.

Single trial decoding of belief decision making from EEG and fMRI data using independent components features	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						machine learning; decoding; EEG; fMRI; ICA; decision making; decision tree; interpretation	BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION; ICA; OPTIMIZATION; IMPACT	The complex task of assessing the veracity of a statement is thought to activate uniquely distributed brain regions based on whether a subject believes or disbelieves a given assertion. In the current work, we present parallel machine learning methods for predicting a subject's decision response to a given propositional statement based on independent component (IC) features derived from EEG and fMRI data. Our results demonstrate that IC features outperformed features derived from event related spectral perturbations derived from any single spectral band, yet were similar to accuracy across all spectral bands combined. We compared our diagnostic IC spatial maps with our conventional general linear model (GLM) results, and found that informative ICs had significant spatial overlap with our GLM results, yet also revealed unique regions like amygdala that were not statistically significant in GLM analyses. Overall, these results suggest that ICs may yield a parsimonious feature set that can be used along with a decision tree structure for interpretation of features used in classifying complex cognitive processes such as belief and disbelief across both fMRI and EEG neuroimaging modalities.

The effects of day-to-day variability of physiological data on operator functional state classification	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG; Pattern classification; Interday variability; Workload	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; EEG INDEXES; FMRI; COMMUNICATION; SELECTION	The application of pattern classification techniques to physiological data has undergone rapid expansion. Tasks as varied as the diagnosis of disease from magnetic resonance images, brain-computer interfaces for the disabled, and the decoding of brain functioning based on electrical activity have been accomplished quite successfully with pattern classification. These classifiers have been further applied in complex cognitive tasks to improve performance, in one example as an input to adaptive automation. In order to produce generalizable results and facilitate the development of practical systems, these techniques should be stable across repeated sessions. This paper describes the application of three popular pattern classification techniques to EEG data obtained from asymptotically trained subjects performing a complex multitask across five days in one month. All three classifiers performed well above chance levels. The performance of all three was significantly negatively impacted by classifying across days; however two modifications are presented that substantially reduce misclassifications. The results demonstrate that with proper methods, pattern classification is stable enough across days and weeks to be a valid, useful approach. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Several neuroimaging techniques including Electroencephalography (EEG) have been employed to capture and visualize the underlying dynamics of emotional neurophysiology. However, the existing EEG techniques are complex and require specific assumptions. Hence, in this project, a self-organized topographic brain mapping model is proposed to automate the process of the dynamic visualization of brain activation during a specific emotional experiences. Such approach employs Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) machine learning algorithm to interpolate and visualize the distribution of activated region during cognitive activities as captured at the scalp. Experimental results show that CMAC can be an alternative approach to construct topographic brain maps for EEG inputs. It is envisaged the proposed approach will be used in the near future to provide explicit interpretations of emotional dynamic that can be used by medical practitioners, psychologists and general users.

Here, we present a new technique that preserves the statistical richness of EEG data to classify movement state from time-embedded low frequency EEG signals. We tested this new classifier, using cross-validation procedures, during sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit activity in 10 subjects and found decoding accuracy of greater than 95% on average. These results suggest that this classification technique could be used in a BMI system that, when combined with a robotic exoskeleton, can restore functional movement to individuals with paralysis.

For motor-imagery based brain computer interface (MI-BCI), a method called common spatial pattern (CSP), which finds spatial weights for electrodes, is effective, however CSP needs bandpass filtering as preprocessing. This paper addresses the problem to find parameters of the filter as well as the spatial weights. The filter is parameterize as weights for frequency spectra. Finding the optimal parameters is formulated as a constraint minimum variance problem. Then, the spatial and frequency weights are sought by alternately solving the generalized eigenvalue problem, and the cost function monotonically decreases by the alternative optimization. In our experiment of MI-BCI, the proposed method achieved maximum improvement by 6% in the classification accuracy over conventional methods.

In this work, we use an Electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI to decode directional information from the brain data collected during an actual hand movement experiment. The objective is to find the discriminative features of movement related potential that can classify any two directions out of the four orthogonal directions in which subject performs right hand movement. The performance using Wavelet-Common Spatial Pattern (W-CSP) algorithm and its variations in terms of spatial regularization is studied and compared. The work further analyzes the involvement of frontal, parietal and motor regions in carrying movement kinematics information with the help of spatial plots given by CSP. The performance variability for different directions in various subjects is another important observation in our results. The work aims to provide a more refined movement control command set for BCIs by developing efficient techniques to decode the direction of movement.	[Robinson, Neethu; Vinod, A.

However, its effectiveness depends on the subject-specific time segment relative to the visual cue and on the temporal frequency band that is often selected manually or heuristically. This paper presents a novel statistical method to automatically select the optimal subject-specific time segment and temporal frequency band based on the mutual information between the spatial-temporal patterns from the EEG signals and the corresponding neuronal activities. The proposed method comprises four progressive stages: multi-time segment and temporal frequency band-pass filtering, CSP spatial filtering, mutual information-based feature selection and nave Bayesian classification. The proposed mutual information-based selection of optimal spatial-temporal patterns and its one-versus-rest multi-class extension were evaluated on single-trial EEG from the BCI Competition IV Datasets IIb and IIa respectively. The results showed that the proposed method yielded relatively better session-to-session classification results compared against the best submission. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A specific challenge for non-invasive recording methods are activations confined to small spatial areas on the cortex such as the finger representation of one hand. Here we study the information content of single trial brain activity in non-invasive MEG and EEG recordings elicited by finger movements of one hand. We investigate the feasibility of decoding which of four fingers of one hand performed a slight button press. With MEG we demonstrate reliable discrimination of single button presses performed with the thumb, the index, the middle or the little finger (average over all subjects and fingers 57%, best subject 70%, empirical guessing level: 25.1%). EEG decoding performance was less robust (average over all subjects and fingers 43%, best subject 54%, empirical guessing level 25.1%). Spatiotemporal patterns of amplitude variations in the time series provided best information for discriminating finger movements. Non-phase-locked changes of mu and beta oscillations were less predictive. Movement related high gamma oscillations were observed in average induced oscillation amplitudes in the MEG but did not provide sufficient information about the finger's identity in single trials. Importantly, pre-movement neuronal activity provided information about the preparation of the movement of a specific finger. Our study demonstrates the potential of non-invasive MEG to provide informative features for individual finger control in a Brain-Machine Interface neuroprosthesis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The American Clinical Neurophysiology Society has attempted to create well-defined, objective rules for naming these patterns in order to allow scientific investigation into their significance. After many revisions, clarifications in definitions, and Web-based training modules, interrater reliability has improved. A perfect system for describing complex wave forms with words will never be perfect; scalp EEG itself has substantial limitations, as intracranial recordings in neurocritical care patients have shown.

While excluding music with vocals, we classified the perception of seven different musical fragments of about three seconds, both individually and cross-participants, using only time domain information (the event-related potential, ERP). The best individual results are 70% correct in a seven-class problem while using single trials, and when using multiple trials we achieve 100% correct after six presentations of the stimulus. When classifying across participants, a maximum rate of 53% was reached, supporting a general representation of each musical fragment over participants. While for some music stimuli the amplitude envelope correlated well with the ERP, this was not true for all stimuli. Aspects of the stimulus that may contribute to the differences between the EEG responses to the pieces of music are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

If changes in the mental state of the user are reflected in the brain signals used for control, the behavior of a BCI is directly influenced by these states. We investigate the influence of a state of loss of control in a variant of Pacman on the performance of BCIs based on motor control. To study the effect a temporal loss of control has on the BCI performance, BCI classifiers were trained on electroencephalography (EEG) recorded during the normal control condition, and the classification performance on segments of EEG from the normal and loss of control condition was compared. Classifiers based on event-related desynchronization unexpectedly performed significantly better during the loss of control condition; for the event-related potential classifiers there was no significant difference in performance.

Shared mechanisms in perception and imagery of auditory accents	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Auditory imagery; Subjective rhythmization; Single-trial classification; Electroencephalography; Perception and imagery; Cross-condition classification; Rhythm processing	MUSICAL IMAGERY; MOTOR IMAGERY; THERAPY; STROKE; EEG; TOPOGRAPHIES; FACILITATION; DYNAMICS; CORTEX; SOUND	Objective: An auditory rhythm can be perceived as a sequence of accented (loud) and non-accented (soft) beats or it can be imagined. Subjective rhythmization refers to the induction of accenting patterns during the presentation of identical auditory pulses at an isochronous rate. It can be an automatic process, but it can also be voluntarily controlled. We investigated whether imagined accents can be decoded from brain signals on a single-trial basis, and if there is information shared between perception and imagery in the contrast of accents and non-accents. Methods: Ten subjects perceived and imagined three different metric patterns (two-, three-, and four-beat) superimposed on a steady metronome while electroencephalography (EEG) measurements were made. Shared information between perception and imagery EEG is investigated by means of principal component analysis and by means of single-trial classification. Results: Classification of accented from non-accented beats was possible with an average accuracy of 70% for perception and 61% for imagery data. Cross-condition classification yielded significant performance above chance level for a classifier trained on perception and tested on imagery data (up to 66%), and vice versa (up to 60%). Conclusions: Results show that detection of imagined accents is possible and reveal similarity in brain signatures relevant to distinction of accents from non-accents in perception and imagery. Significance: Our results support the idea of shared mechanisms in perception and imagery for auditory processing. This is relevant for a number of clinical settings, most notably by elucidating the basic mechanisms of rhythmic auditory cuing paradigms, e. g. as used in motor rehabilitation or therapy for Parkinson's disease. As a novel Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) paradigm, our results imply a reduction of the necessary BCI training in healthy subjects and in patients.

Revealing the Neural Response to Imperceptible Peripheral Flicker with Machine Learning	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			EEG	Lighting in modern-day devices is often discrete. The sharp onsets and offsets of light are known to induce a steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) at low frequencies. However, it is not well-known how the brain processes visual flicker at the threshold of conscious perception and beyond. To shed more light on this, we ran an EEG study in which we asked participants (N=6) to discriminate on a behavioral level between visual stimuli in which they perceived flicker and those that they perceived as constant wave light. We found that high frequency flicker which is not perceived consciously anymore still elicits a neural response in the corresponding frequency band of EEG, contralateral to the stimulated hemifield. The main contribution of this paper is to show the benefit of machine learning techniques for investigating this effect of subconscious processing: Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) filtering in combination with classification based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) could be used to reveal the effect for additional participants and stimuli, with high statistical significance. We conclude that machine learning techniques are a valuable extension of conventional neurophysiological analysis that can substantially boost the sensitivity to subconscious effects, such as the processing of imperceptible flicker.

A novel evolving probabilistic spiking neural network reservoir (epSNNr) architecture is used for the purpose of learning and classifying the EEG signals after the BSA transformation. Experiments are conducted with EEG data measuring a cognitive state of a single individual under 4 different stimuli. A comparison is drawn between using traditional machine learning algorithms and using BSA plus epSNNr, when different probabilistic models of neurons are utilised. The comparison demonstrates that: (1) The BSA is a suitable transformation for EEG data into spike trains; (2) The performance of the epSNNr improves when a probabilistic model of a neuron is used, compared to the use of a deterministic LIF model of a neuron; (3) The classification accuracy of the EEG data in an epSNNr depends on the type of the probabilistic neuronal model used. The results suggest that an epSNNr can be optimised in terms of neuronal models used and parameters that would better match the noise and the dynamics of EEG data. Potential applications of the proposed method for BCI and medical studies are briefly discussed.

Most BCI systems are based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and within this group, systems using motor imagery (MI) are amongst the most flexible. However, for stroke patients, the motor areas of the brain are not always available for use in these types of devices. The aim of this work was to evaluate a set of imagery-based cognitive tasks (right-hand MI versus music imagery, with rest or "blank" periods in between), using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and EEG. Eleven healthy subjects (control group) and four stroke patients were evaluated with fMRI, and nine of the healthy subjects also underwent an EEG test. The fMRI results for the control group showed specific and statistically differentiable activation patterns for motor versus music imagery (t-test, p < 0.001). For stroke patients the fMRI results showed a very large variability, with no common activation pattern for either of the imagery tasks. Corroborating this fact, EEG results concerning feature selection for minimizing the classification error (using the Davies-Bouldin index) have also found no common activation pattern, although a well-defined set of meaningful electrodes and frequencies was found for some subjects. In terms of classification performance using EEG data, this work has detected a group of subjects with classifier rate of success up to 60%, which is promising in view of the cognitive complexity of the adopted tasks.

We propose to implement corticomuscular coherence analysis on electroencephalography (EEG) and EMG signals on Extensor Digitorum to extract their intention involved in hand opening. EEG and EMG signals of 8 subjects are simultaneously collected when executing 4 hand movement tasks (finger extension, thumb adduction, finger flexion, and rest). We explore the spatial and temporal distribution of the coherence and observe statistically significant corticomuscular coherence appearing at left motor cortical area and different patterns within beta frequency range for 4 movement tasks. Linear discriminate analysis is applied on the coherence pattern to distinguish finger extension from thumb adduction, finger flexion, and rest. The classification results are greater than those by EEG only. The results indicate the possibility to detect voluntary hand opening based on coherence analysis between single muscle EMG signal and single EEG channel located in motor cortical area, which potentially helps active hand rehabilitation for stroke patients.

One of the issues in BCI research is the presence of redundant data in the features of a given dataset, which not only increases the dimensions but also reduces the accuracy of the classifiers. In this paper, we aim to reduce the redundant features of a dataset to improve the accuracy of classification. For this, we have employed Differential Evolution with Temporal Difference Q-Learning (DE-TDQL)-based clustering algorithm to reduce the features and have acquired their corresponding accuracy. Experiments with synthetic and real-world data provide evidence that such an approach leads to improved classification performance. Superiority of the new method is demonstrated by comparing it with three classification methods including Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine-Radial Basis Function. Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution, Differential Evolution/current-to-best/1, Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm-based clustering approaches have also been used here to study the relative performance of the proposed adaptive memetic algorithm-based clustering technique with respect to runtime and classification accuracy.

This method combines the kernel fisher and SVM. Its detailed process is as follows: First, the CSP (Common Spatial Patterns) is used to obtain features, and then the within-class scatter is calculated based on these features. The scatter is added into the RBF (Radical Basis Function) kernel function to construct a new kernel function. The obtained new kernel is integrated into the support vector machine to get a new classification model. The KF-SVM may overcome the following defects of the SVM: 1) the SVM maximizes the classification margin without considering within-class scatter. 2) The classification surface of the SVM between two types of EEG data only depends on boundary samples and misclassified samples. To evaluate effectiveness of the proposed KF-SVM method, the data from the 2008 international BCI competition and experiments of our laboratory are processed. The experimental result shows that the proposed KF-SVM classification algorithm can well classify EEG data and improve the correct rate of EEG recognition in BCIs.

Electroencephalographic criteria for nonconvulsive status epilepticus: Synopsis and comprehensive survey	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy; Nonconvulsive status epilepticus; Electroencephalographic criteria; Diagnosis criteria; Clinical syndromes; Electroencephalographic patterns; Neonatal; Infants; Childhood; Adults; Late life	AUTONOMIC STATUS EPILEPTICUS; ELECTRICAL STATUS EPILEPTICUS; ABSENCE STATUS EPILEPTICUS; SEVERE MYOCLONIC EPILEPSY; LIMBIC ENCEPHALITIS; SUPPRESSION-BURSTS; RING CHROMOSOME-20; CRITICALLY-ILL; SLOW-WAVE; EEG	There have been many attempts at defining the electroencephalography (EEG) characteristics of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) without a universally accepted definition. This lack of consensus arises because the EEG expression of NCSE does not exist in isolation, but reflects status epilepticus under the variety of pathologic conditions that occur with age, cerebral development, encephalopathy, and epilepsy syndrome. Current NCSE definitions include boundary conditions, in which electroencephalographic seizure activity occurs without apparent clinical seizures. Furthermore, what appears to one interpreter as status epilepticus, is not to another reader, reflecting the art of EEG interpretation. Seizures and epilepsy syndromes have undergone an evolution that has moved beyond a classification of focal or generalized conditions into a syndromic approach. It seems appropriate to make similar changes in the EEG analysis of the syndromes of NCSE. In effect, the literature on epilepsy classification has progressed to incorporate the different NCSE types with clinical descriptions, but the specific EEG evidence for these types is found largely in individual reports, and often by description only. NCSE classification of EEG patterns should derive from the aggregate of published EEG patterns in the respective clinical subtype, supported by an analysis of these EEG studies. The analysis that follows presents clinical descriptions and EEG patterns of NCSE in the neonatal period, infancy, childhood, adulthood, and late adulthood from a syndromic perspective based on age, encephalopathy, cerebral development, etiology, and syndrome. Proceeding from the proposed classification of status epilepticus syndromes in Status epilepticus: its clinical features and treatment in children and adults (published in 1994 by Cambridge University Press, New York), we have performed a systematic search for reports presenting EEG patterns of NCSE using the online medical search engine PubMed for 22 different search strategies. EEG patterns were reviewed by two board-certified epileptologists who reached consensus regarding presence of NCSE. From a total of 4,328 search results, 123 cases with corresponding EEG patterns could be allocated to underlying epilepsy syndromes. Typical characteristic, prominent electrographic patterns, and sequential arrangements are elucidated for the different NCSE syndromes. This compendium of patterns by NCSE syndrome classification with illustration of EEGs, and delineation of electroencephalographic features helps define the characteristics and semiologic borderlines among the types of NCSE.

We introduce a BMI system using electroencephalography (EEG) and the reinforcement learning method, in which event-related potential (ERP) represents a reward reflecting failure or success of BMI operations. In experiments, the P300 speller task was conducted with adding the evaluation process where subjects counted the number of times the speller estimated a wrong character. Results showed that ERPs were evoked in the subjects observing wrong output. Those were estimated by using a support vector machine (SVM) which classified data into two categories. The overall accuracy of classification was approximately 58%. Also, a simulation using the reinforcement learning method was conducted. The result indicated that discriminant accuracy of SVM may improve with the learning process in a way that optimizes the constituent parameters.

Common spatial patterns (CSP) or probabilistic CSP (PCSP) are widely used for extracting discriminative features from EEG, although they are trained on a subject-by-subject basis and inter-subject information is neglected. Moreover, the performance is degraded when only a few training samples are available for each subject. In this paper, we present a method for Bayesian CSP with Dirichlet process (DP) priors, where spatial patterns (corresponding to basis vectors) are simultaneously learned and clustered across subjects using variational Bayesian inference, which facilitates a flexible mixture model where the number of components are also learned. Spatial patterns in the same cluster share the hyperparameters of their prior distributions, which means information transfer is facilitated among subjects with similar spatial patterns. Numerical experiments using the BCI competition IV 2a dataset demonstrated the high performance of our method, compared with existing PCSP and Bayesian CSP methods with a single prior distribution.

Deriving the regularization is begun defining a distance between the sensors. Under the distance, the proposed regularization works so that the spatial weights extracts similar signals in the nearby sensors. The proposed regularization is applied to the well known common spatial pattern (CSP) method that finds spatial weights for EEG based brain machine interface. In the classification experiment using a dataset of EEG signals during motor imagery, the proposed method achieved maximum improvement by 28% in the classification accuracy over the standard CSP in a setting of even when only five samples are used.

Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis of Human EEG: Preliminary Investigation and Comparison with the Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima Technique	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEURONAL AVALANCHES; HUMAN BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL-STATE; SLEEP-APNEA; SIGNALS; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; CORTEX; SERIES	Recently, many lines of investigation in neuroscience and statistical physics have converged to raise the hypothesis that the underlying pattern of neuronal activation which results in electroencephalography (EEG) signals is nonlinear, with self-affine dynamics, while scalp-recorded EEG signals themselves are nonstationary. Therefore, traditional methods of EEG analysis may miss many properties inherent in such signals. Similarly, fractal analysis of EEG signals has shown scaling behaviors that may not be consistent with pure monofractal processes. In this study, we hypothesized that scalp-recorded human EEG signals may be better modeled as an underlying multifractal process. We utilized the Physionet online database, a publicly available database of human EEG signals as a standardized reference database for this study. Herein, we report the use of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis on human EEG signals derived from waking and different sleep stages, and show evidence that supports the use of multifractal methods. Next, we compare multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis to a previously published multifractal technique, wavelet transform modulus maxima, using EEG signals from waking and sleep, and demonstrate that multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis has lower indices of variability. Finally, we report a preliminary investigation into the use of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis as a pattern classification technique on human EEG signals from waking and different sleep stages, and demonstrate its potential utility for automatic classification of different states of consciousness. Therefore, multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis may be a useful pattern classification technique to distinguish among different states of brain function.

Models for CSP or PCSP are trained on a subject-by-subject basis, so inter-subject information, which might be available when brain waves are measured from multiple subjects who undergo the same mental task, is neglected. In this paper we present a brief overview of our recent work on how Bayesian multi-task learning is applied to multi-subject EEG classification, treating subjects as tasks to capture inter-subject relatedness in Bayesian treatment of PCSP.

A neonatal electrographic seizure is defined as a sudden, repetitive, evolving, and stereotyped event of abnormal electrographic pattern with amplitude of at least 2 mu V and a minimum duration of 10 seconds. The diagnosis of neonatal seizures relies heavily on the neurophysiologist's interpretation of EEG. Consideration of specific criteria for the definition of a neonatal seizure, including seizure duration, location, morphology, evolution, semiology, and overall seizure burden, has utility for both the clinician and the researcher. The importance of EEG in the diagnosis and management of neonatal seizures, the electrographic characteristics of neonatal seizures, the impact of neonatal seizures on outcome, and tools to aid in the identification of neonatal seizures are reviewed.

Commonly used in literature are invasive techniques to acquire brain signals and decode user's attempted motions to drive these systems (e.g. a robotic manipulator). In this work we use a lower-body exoskeleton and measure the users brain activity using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG). The main focus of this study is to decode a paraplegic subject's motion intentions and provide him with the ability of walking with a lower-body exoskeleton accordingly. We present our novel method of decoding with high offline evaluation accuracies (around 98%), our closed loop implementation structure with considerably short on-site training time (around 38 sec), and preliminary results from the real-time closed loop implementation (NeuroRex) with a paraplegic test subject.

J	Alomari, MH; Samaha, A; AlKamha, K				Alomari, Mohammad H.; Samaha, Aya; AlKamha, Khaled			Automated Classification of L/R Hand Movement EEG Signals using Advanced Feature Extraction and Machine Learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						EEG; BCI; ICA; MRCP; ERD/ERS; machine learning; NN; SVM	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES	In this paper, we propose an automated computer platform for the purpose of classifying Electroencephalography (EEG) signals associated with left and right hand movements using a hybrid system that uses advanced feature extraction techniques and machine learning algorithms. It is known that EEG represents the brain activity by the electrical voltage fluctuations along the scalp, and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a device that enables the use of the brain's neural activity to communicate with others or to control machines, artificial limbs, or robots without direct physical movements. In our research work, we aspired to find the best feature extraction method that enables the differentiation between left and right executed fist movements through various classification algorithms. The EEG dataset used in this research was created and contributed to PhysioNet by the developers of the BCI2000 instrumentation system. Data was preprocessed using the EEGLAB MATLAB toolbox and artifacts removal was done using AAR. Data was epoched on the basis of Event-Related (De) Synchronization (ERD/ERS) and movement-related cortical potentials ( MRCP) features. Mu/beta rhythms were isolated for the ERD/ERS analysis and delta rhythms were isolated for the MRCP analysis. The Independent Component Analysis (ICA) spatial filter was applied on related channels for noise reduction and isolation of both artifactually and neutrally generated EEG sources. The final feature vector included the ERD, ERS, and MRCP features in addition to the mean, power and energy of the activations of the resulting Independent Components (ICs) of the epoched feature datasets. The datasets were inputted into two machine-learning algorithms: Neural Networks (NNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Intensive experiments were carried out and optimum classification performances of 89.8 and 97.1 were obtained using NN and SVM, respectively. This research shows that this method of feature extraction holds some promise for the classification of various pairs of motor movements, which can be used in a BCI context to mentally control a computer or machine.

To increase classification accuracy, it is thus crucial to identify discriminant spatio-temporal features. This paper presents a method for analyzing the spatio-temporal characteristics associated with Event related Potentials (ERPs). First, a resampling procedure based on Global Field Power (GFP) extracts temporal features. Second, a spatially weighted SVM (sw-SVM) is used to learn a spatial filter optimizing the classification performance for each temporal feature. Third, the so-obtained ensemble of sw-SVM classifiers are combined using a weighted combination of all sw-SVM outputs. Results indicate that the inclusion of temporal features provides useful insight regarding classification performance and physiological understanding. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To find these parameters, we develop a data-driven criterion that is a natural extension of the so-called common spatial patterns (CSP) that are known to be effective features in BMI. We show that the proposed criterion can be optimized by an alternating procedure to achieve fast convergence. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively extract discriminative features for a motor imagery-based BMI.

This paper proposes a novel framework that can optimally select dyadic filter bank common spatial pattern (CSP) features in low-frequency band (0-8 Hz) for multi-class classification of four orthogonal hand movement directions. The proposed framework encompasses EEG signal enhancement, dyadic filter bank CSP feature extraction, fuzzy mutual information (FMI)-based feature selection, and one-versus-rest Fisher's linear discriminant analysis. Experimental results on data collected from seven human subjects show that (1) signal enhancement can boost accuracy by at least 4%; (2) low-frequency band (0-8 Hz) can adequately and effectively discriminate hand movement directions; and (3) dyadic filter bank CSP feature extraction and FMI-based feature selection are indispensable for analyzing hand movement directions, increasing accuracy by 6.06%, from 60.02% to 66.08%.

This study explores electroencephalography (EEG) correlated with stressful circumstances by using the task-switching paradigm with feedback information. According to the behavioral and physiological evidence, acute stress created by this paradigm affected the performance of participants. Under stress, the participants responded quickly and inaccurately. The EEG results correlated with acute stress were found in the frontal midline cortex, especially on the theta and alpha bands. These specific factors are considered importance features for detecting the influence of stress by applying various machine-learning methods and neuro-fuzzy systems.

Therefore, many assistive devices have been developed in order to improve the quality of life of those people in which they may not depend on others. Especially upper-limb power-assist exoskeletons have been developed since the upper limb motions are very important for the daily activities. Electromyography (EMG) signals and/or force sensor based control methods have been identified as the promising methods to control such exoskeleton devices. However, if the user cannot generate sufficient muscle signals or movements, the EMG or force sensor based methods could not be useful to the user. On the other hand, electroencephalography (EEG) signals are also important biological signals to extract the user's motion intention. In this study, the user's elbow joint motion is estimated based on the EEG signals. The measured EEG signals are pre-processed and input to a time-embedded linear model, which is assumed to decode the elbow joint angular velocities. The genetic algorithm (GA) is used to train the model. A six fold cross validation process was performed for each motion segment of each subject. The experimental results suggest that EEG signals with the tested decoding model can be used to continuously decode the elbow joint velocity.

Decoding the evolving grasping gesture from electroencephalographic (EEG) activity	2013 35TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 03-07, 2013	Osaka, JAPAN	IEEE Engn Med Biol Soc, Japanese Soc Med & Biol Engn				Shared control is emerging as a likely strategy for controlling neuroprosthetic devices, in which users specify high level goals but the low-level implementation is carried out by the machine. In this context, predicting the discrete goal is necessary. Although grasping various objects is critical in determining independence in daily life of amputees, decoding of different grasp types from noninvasively recorded brain activity has not been investigated. Here we show results suggesting electroencephalography (EEG) is a feasible modality to extract information on grasp types from the user's brain activity. We found that the information about the intended grasp increases over the grasping movement, and is significantly greater than chance up to 200 ms before movement onset.

J	Logar, V; Belic, A				Logar, Vito; Belic, Ales			A possible use of EEG signals in a brain-computer interface	ZDRAVNISKI VESTNIK-SLOVENIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL			Slovene	Article						brain-computer interface; electroencephalography; fuzzy logic; information decoding; wrist-movement prediction	CODING SCHEME; PHASE CODE; SYNCHRONIZATION; FORCE; IDENTIFICATION	Background: Newest insights in the field of brain-information coding suggest that the information is transferred between the active regions of the brain as a phase-coded content. Considering the informational richness of the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, we can assume that by using appropriate methods of signal processing it is possible to decode some of this information. The authors would like to show that using a phase-demodulation approach it is possible to successfully decode the information about the wrist movements of a complex dynamic visuo-motor task (dVM). Since the causality of the methodology is assured, it is also usable for the development of a brain-computer interface (BCI). Methods: In this study we measured the EEG signals from four subjects while performing a dynamic visuo-motor task. For decoding the information, which is supposedly carried by the EEG signals we used brain-rhythm filtering, phase demodulation and principal component analysis approach. As a prediction model for wrist movements, fuzzy inference model was used. Results: The presented results show that the EEG signals measured during the performance of dVM tasks carry enough information about the current action for satisfactory decoding and prediction of the wrist movements. Successful estimation of the motor action is proved also by obtaining reasonably high values of the correlation coefficients. Conclusions: The study has shown that using the proposed methodology it is possible to decode the EEG information of the wrist movements during dVM tasks. The study has also shown that these relatively simple methods of signal processing and a fuzzy model are applicable to the development of a closed-loop, non-invasive BCI.

J	Wang, SY; Lin, CJ; Wu, CX; Chaovalitwongse, WA				Wang, Shouyi; Lin, Cheng-Jhe; Wu, Changxu; Chaovalitwongse, Wanpracha Art			Early Detection of Numerical Typing Errors Using Data Mining Techniques	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS			English	Article						Early detection; electroencephalography (EEG) classification; mental state monitoring; typing errors	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; POTENTIALS	This paper studies the applications of data mining techniques in early detection of numerical typing errors by human operators through a quantitative analysis of multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Three feature extraction techniques were developed to capture temporal, morphological, and time-frequency (wavelet) characteristics of EEG data. Two most commonly used data mining techniques, namely, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM), were employed to classify EEG samples associated with correct and erroneous keystrokes. The leave-one-error-pattern-out and leave-one-subject-out cross-validation methods were designed to evaluate the in-and cross-subject classification performances, respectively. For the in-subject classification, the best testing performance had a sensitivity of 62.20% and a specificity of 51.68%, which were achieved by SVM using morphological features. For the cross-subject classification, the best testing performance was achieved by LDA using temporal features, based on which it had a sensitivity of 68.72% and a specificity of 49.45%. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that the averaged values of the area under ROC curves of LDA and SVM for the in- and cross-subject classifications were both greater than 0.60 using the EEG 300 ms prior to the keystrokes. The classification results of this study indicated that the EEG patterns of erroneous keystrokes might be different from those of the correct ones. As a result, it may be possible to predict erroneous keystrokes prior to error occurrence. The classification problem addressed in this study is extremely challenging due to the very limited number of erroneous keystrokes made by each subject and the complex spatiotemporal characteristics of the EEG data. However, the outcome of this study is quite encouraging, and it is promising to develop a prospective early detection system for erroneous keystrokes based on brain-wave signals.

A hierarchical Bayesian approach for learning sparse spatio-temporal decompositions of multichannel EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Hierarchical Bayesian; Variational Bayesian; Common spatial patterns; Spatio-temporal decomposition; Inter-trial variability; Sparse learning; Brain-computer interface	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; BLIND SEPARATION; BRAIN RESPONSES; SCALE MIXTURES; FILTERS; ALPHA; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; DYNAMICS; MODEL	Multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive tool to explore spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity. With EEG recordings consisting of multiple trials, traditional signal processing approaches that ignore inter-trial variability in the data may fail to accurately estimate the underlying spatio-temporal brain patterns. Moreover, precise characterization of such inter-trial variability per se can be of high scientific value in establishing the relationship between brain activity and behavior. In this paper, a statistical modeling framework is introduced for learning spatio-temporal decompositions of multiple-trial EEG data recorded under two contrasting experimental conditions. By modeling the variance of source signals as random variables varying across trials, the proposed two-stage hierarchical Bayesian model is able to capture intertrial amplitude variability in the data in a sparse way where a parsimonious representation of the data can be obtained. A variational Bayesian (VB) algorithm is developed for statistical inference of the hierarchical model. The efficacy of the proposed modeling framework is validated with the analysis of both synthetic and real EEG data. In the simulation study we show that even at low signal-to-noise ratios our approach is able to recover with high precision the underlying spatio-temporal patterns and the dynamics of source amplitude across trials; on two brain-computer interface (BCI) data sets we show that our VB algorithm can extract physiologically meaningful spatio-temporal patterns and make more accurate predictions than other two widely used algorithms: the common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm and the Infomax algorithm for independent component analysis (ICA). The results demonstrate that our statistical modeling framework can serve as a powerful tool for extracting brain patterns, characterizing trial-to-trial brain dynamics, and decoding brain states by exploiting useful structures in the data.

EEG-Based Classification of Fast and Slow Hand Movements Using Wavelet-CSP Algorithm	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs); common spatial patterns (CSPs); discrete wavelet transform (DWT); electroencephalography (EEG); movement-related parameters; multiple linear regression	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MEG	A brain-computer interface (BCI) acquires brain signals, extracts informative features, and translates these features to commands to control an external device. This paper investigates the application of a noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI to identify brain signal features in regard to actual hand movement speed. This provides a more refined control for a BCI system in terms of movement parameters. An experiment was performed to collect EEG data from subjects while they performed right-hand movement at two different speeds, namely fast and slow, in four different directions. The informative features from the data were obtained using the Wavelet-Common Spatial Pattern (W-CSP) algorithm that provided high-temporal-spatial-spectral resolution. The applicability of these features to classify the two speeds and to reconstruct the speed profile was studied. The results for classifying speed across seven subjects yielded a mean accuracy of 83.71% using a Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) classifier. The speed components were reconstructed using multiple linear regression and significant correlation of 0.52 (Pearson's linear correlation coefficient) was obtained between recorded and reconstructed velocities on an average. The spatial patterns of the W-CSP features obtained showed activations in parietal and motor areas of the brain. The results achieved promises to provide a more refined control in BCI by including control of movement speed.	[Robinson, Neethu; Vinod, A.

Sequenced subjective accents for brain-computer interfaces	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							TOP	Subjective accenting is a cognitive process in which identical auditory pulses at an isochronous rate turn into the percept of an accenting pattern. This process can be voluntarily controlled, making it a candidate for communication from human user to machine in a brain-computer interface (BCI) system. In this study we investigated whether subjective accenting is a feasible paradigm for BCI and how its time-structured nature can be exploited for optimal decoding from non-invasive EEG data. Ten subjects perceived and imagined different metric patterns (two-, three-and four-beat) superimposed on a steady metronome. With an offline classification paradigm, we classified imagined accented from non-accented beats on a single trial (0.5 s) level with an average accuracy of 60.4% over all subjects. We show that decoding of imagined accents is also possible with a classifier trained on perception data. Cyclic patterns of accents and non-accents were successfully decoded with a sequence classification algorithm. Classification performances were compared by means of bit rate. Performance in the best scenario translates into an average bit rate of 4.4 bits min(-1) over subjects, which makes subjective accenting a promising paradigm for an online auditory BCI.	[Vlek, R.

J	Lin, CT; Tsai, SF; Ko, LW				Lin, Chin-Teng; Tsai, Shu-Fang; Ko, Li-Wei			EEG-Based Learning System for Online Motion Sickness Level Estimation in a Dynamic Vehicle Environment	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Driving cognition; electroencephalography (EEG); learning system; motion sickness; online estimation	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; AUTOMATIC RECOGNITION; VESTIBULAR CORTEX; ALERTNESS LEVEL; NETWORK	Motion sickness is a common experience for many people. Several previous researches indicated that motion sickness has a negative effect on driving performance and sometimes leads to serious traffic accidents because of a decline in a person's ability to maintain self-control. This safety issue has motivated us to find a way to prevent vehicle accidents. Our target was to determine a set of valid motion sickness indicators that would predict the occurrence of a person's motion sickness as soon as possible. A successful method for the early detection of motion sickness will help us to construct a cognitive monitoring system. Such a monitoring system can alert people before they become sick and prevent them from being distracted by various motion sickness symptoms while driving or riding in a car. In our past researches, we investigated the physiological changes that occur during the transition of a passenger's cognitive state using electroencephalography (EEG) power spectrum analysis, and we found that the EEG power responses in the left and right motors, parietal, lateral occipital, and occipital midline brain areas were more highly correlated to subjective sickness levels than other brain areas. In this paper, we propose the use of a self-organizing neural fuzzy inference network (SONFIN) to estimate a driver's/passenger's sickness level based on EEG features that have been extracted online from five motion sickness-related brain areas, while either in real or virtual vehicle environments. The results show that our proposed learning system is capable of extracting a set of valid motion sickness indicators that originated from EEG dynamics, and through SONFIN, a neuro-fuzzy prediction model, we successfully translated the set of motion sickness indicators into motion sickness levels. The overall performance of this proposed EEG-based learning system can achieve an average prediction accuracy of similar to 82%.

The study group includes 11 subjects with normal sleep and 10 subjects with diagnosed primary insomnia. Differences between normal sleepers and insomniacs are investigated, in terms of dynamics and content of CAP events. The overall rate of CAP and of different phases is considered. The dynamic in the structure and alternation of CAP events is further studied in different scales by use of wavelet analysis, and calculation of energy/entropy features. The content of CAP events is studied in terms of electroencephalography (EEG) complexity analysis for the different types of events. Statistically significant differences are highlighted, both in structure and content. Besides confirming the increase in CAP rate, main findings regarding the microstructure difference in insomnia include: 1) as regards the deep sleep building phases, more irregular activation-deactivation patterns, with bigger deactivation time, i.e., distance between consecutive activation events, and appearing with higher EEG complexity in deactivation, and 2) a bigger duration of desynchronisation phases, with increased EEG complexity and more irregular patterns. This analysis extends previous findings on the relation between CAPrate increase and sleep instability mechanisms, proposing specific features of CAP that seem to play a role in insomnia (as consistently presented via classification analysis). This opens new perspectives for the understanding of the role of CAP in the quantitative characterization of sleep and its disorders.

The predominant method for content-based tagging is through slow, labor-intensive manual annotation. Consequently, automatic tagging is currently a subject of intensive research. However, it is clear that the process will not be fully automated in the foreseeable future. We propose to involve the user and investigate methods for implicit tagging, wherein users' responses to the interaction with the multimedia content are analyzed in order to generate descriptive tags. Here, we present a multi-modal approach that analyses both facial expressions and electroencephalography (EEG) signals for the generation of affective tags. We perform classification and regression in the valence-arousal space and present results for both feature-level and decision-level fusion. We demonstrate improvement in the results when using both modalities, suggesting the modalities contain complementary information. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, due to technical limitations of the EEG decoding, the brain-computer interface (BCI) protocol is often complex, and the mapping between the EEG signal and the practical instructions lack of logic associated, which restrict the user's actual use. This paper presents a strategy that can be used to control a quadruped locomotion robot by user's instinctive action, based on five kinds of movement related neurophysiological signal. In actual use, the user drives or imagines the limbs/wrists action to generate EEG signal to adjust the real movement of the robot according to his/her own motor reflex of the robot locomotion. This method is easy for real use, as the user generates the brain-control signal through the instinctive reaction. By adopting the behavioral control of learning and evolution based on the proposed strategy, complex movement task may be realized by instinctive brain-control.

The multifractal cumulants feature measures the signal regularity, while the predictive complexity measures the difficulty to predict the future of the signal based on its past, hence a degree of how complex it is. We have conducted an evaluation of the performance of these two novel features on EEG data corresponding to motor-imagery. We also compared them to the gold standard features used in the BC! field, namely the band-power features. We evaluated these three kinds of features and their combinations on EEG signals from 13 subjects. Results obtained show that our novel features can lead to BCI designs with improved classification performance, notably when using and combining the three kinds of feature (band-power, multifractal cumulants, predictive complexity) together.

The role and significance of the KC include its engagement in information processing, sleep protection, and memory consolidation [ 1]. The method applies a two-step methodology in which first all the candidate KC waves are extracted based on fundamental morphological features imitating visual criteria. Subsequently each candidate wave is classified as KC or outlier according to its similarity to a set of different patterns (clusters) of annotated KCs. The different clusters are constructed by applying graph partitioning on the training set based on spectral clustering and exhibit temporal similarities in both signal and frequency content. The method was applied in whole-night sleep activity recorded using multiple EEG electrodes. Cross-validation was performed against visual scoring of singular generalized KCs during all sleep cycles and showed high sensitivity in KC detection.

The CSP method is a supervised algorithm and therefore needs subject-specific training data for calibration, which is very time consuming to collect. In order to reduce the amount of calibration data that is needed for a new subject, one can apply multitask (from now on called multisubject) machine learning techniques to the preprocessing phase. Here, the goal of multisubject learning is to learn a spatial filter for a new subject based on its own data and that of other subjects. This paper outlines the details of the multitask CSP algorithm and shows results on two data sets. In certain subjects a clear improvement can be seen, especially when the number of training trials is relatively low.

Using this method, we could convert classification problem into finding the smallest sum of Euclidean distances between vectors belonging to each class. Therefore the performance of proposed method was influenced by the performance of optimization algorithm. In this paper, to compare efficiency and performance of various heuristic algorithm for this method, we applied three different heuristic optimization algorithm, HS, PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization), and DS (Differential Search). For the simulation, we used EEG signal data from BCI Competition IV Dataset I. Two class data from two subject with 100 Hz sampling rate were used. For feature extraction, common spatial pattern algorithm was used. In conclusion, the fastest algorithm was HS algorithm with about 4. 4 seconds of an average computational time, the algorithm with best classification rate was also HS algorithm and the average classification rates of subject 'f' and 'g' were 84.08 % and 81.95 %. The slowest heuristic algorithm was PSO algorithm with about 7.5 second in an average computational time, and the worst average classification rate was 57.27 % from subject 'g' with PSO algorithm. We could draw a conclusion that the best algorithm for proposed classification method was HS algorithm.

Automated diagnosis of epilepsy using EEG power spectrum	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy; Machine learning; Prediction; Nonepileptic seizure; Computer-aided diagnostics	SEIZURES	Interictal electroencephalography (EEG) has clinically meaningful limitations in its sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of epilepsy because of its dependence on the occurrence of epileptiform discharges. We have developed a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) tool that operates on the absolute spectral energy of the routine EEG and has both substantially higher sensitivity and negative predictive value than the identification of interictal epileptiform discharges. Our approach used a multilayer perceptron to classify 156 patients admitted for video-EEG monitoring. The patient population was diagnostically diverse; 87 were diagnosed with either generalized or focal seizures. The remainder of the patients were diagnosed with nonepileptic seizures.

Such methods provide a framework for interpreting measurements made at the single-trial level with respect to a set of two or more distinct mental states. Here, we define an approach in which the output of a binary classifier trained on data from an auditory mismatch paradigm can be used for online tracking of perception and as a neurofeedback signal. The auditory mismatch paradigm is known to induce distinct perceptual states related to the presentation of high- and low-probability stimuli, which are reflected in event-related potential (ERR) components such as the mismatch negativity (MMN). The first part of this paper illustrates how pattern classification methods can be applied to data collected in an MMN paradigm, including discussion of the optimization of preprocessing steps, the interpretation of features and how the performance of these methods generalizes across individual participants and measurement sessions. We then go on to show that the output of these decoding methods can be used in online settings as a continuous index of single-trial brain activation underlying perceptual discrimination. We conclude by discussing several potential domains of application, including neurofeedback, cognitive monitoring and passive brain-computer interfaces.

Multiresolution analysis over simple graphs for brain computer interfaces	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							SINGLE TRIAL EEG; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; WAVELET-PACKET; LIFTING SCHEME	Objective. Multiresolution analysis (MRA) offers a useful framework for signal analysis in the temporal and spectral domains, although commonly employed MRA methods may not be the best approach for brain computer interface (BCI) applications. This study aims to develop a new MRA system for extracting tempo-spatial-spectral features for BCI applications based on wavelet lifting over graphs. Approach. This paper proposes a new graph-based transform for wavelet lifting and a tailored simple graph representation for electroencephalography (EEG) data, which results in an MRA system where temporal, spectral and spatial characteristics are used to extract motor imagery features from EEG data. The transformed data is processed within a simple experimental framework to test the classification performance of the new method. Main Results. The proposed method can significantly improve the classification results obtained by various wavelet families using the same methodology. Preliminary results using common spatial patterns as feature extraction method show that we can achieve comparable classification accuracy to more sophisticated methodologies. From the analysis of the results we can obtain insights into the pattern development in the EEG data, which provide useful information for feature basis selection and thus for improving classification performance. Significance. Applying wavelet lifting over graphs is a new approach for handling BCI data. The inherent flexibility of the lifting scheme could lead to new approaches based on the hereby proposed method for further classification performance improvement.	[Asensio-Cubero, J.; Gan, J.

EEG source reconstruction offers principled ways to estimate the cortical activities from EEG signals. But to what extent it can enhance informative brain signals in single trial has not been addressed in a general setting. We tested this using the minimum norm estimate solution (MNE) to estimate spectral power and coherence features at the cortical level. With a fast implementation, we computed a support vector machine (SVM) classifier output from these quantities in real-time, without prior on the relevant functional networks. We applied this approach to single trial decoding of ongoing mental imagery tasks using EEG data recorded in 5 subjects. Our results show that reconstructing the underlying cortical network dynamics significantly outperforms a usual electrode level approach in terms of information transfer and also reduces redundancy between coherence and power features, supporting a decrease of volume conduction effects. Additionally, the classifier coefficients reflect the most informative features of network activity, showing an important contribution of localized motor and sensory brain areas, and of coherence between areas up to 6 cm distance. This study provides a computationally efficient and interpretable strategy to extract information from functional networks at the cortical level in single trial. Moreover, this sets a general framework to evaluate the performance of EEG source reconstruction methods by their decoding abilities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

An algorithm for seizure onset detection using intracranial EEG	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Seizure detection; Intracranial electroencephalography; Patient specific	EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; PREDICTION	This article addresses the problem of real-time seizure detection from intracranial EEG (IEEG). One difficulty in creating an approach that can be used for many patients is the heterogeneity of seizure IEEG patterns across different patients and even within a patient. In addition, simultaneously maximizing sensitivity and minimizing latency and false detection rates has been challenging as these are competing objectives. Automated machine learning systems provide a mechanism for dealing with these hurdles. Here we present and evaluate an algorithm for real-time seizure onset detection from IEEG using a machine-learning approach that permits a patient-specific solution. We extract temporal and spectral features across all intracranial EEG channels. A pattern recognition component is trained using these feature vectors and tested against unseen continuous data from the same patient. When tested on more than 875 hours of IEEG data from 10 patients, the algorithm detected 97% of 67 test seizures of several types with a median detection delay of 5 seconds and a median false alarm rate of 0.6 false alarms per 24-hour period. The sensitivity was 100% for 8 of 10 patients. These results indicate that a sensitive, specific, and relatively short-latency detection system based on machine learning can be employed for seizure detection from EEG using a full set of intracranial electrodes to individual patients. This article is part of a Supplemental Special Issue entitled The Future of Automated Seizure Detection and Prediction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, existing BCIs lack a natural control and need a considerable amount of training time or use invasively recorded biosignals. We show that it is possible to decode velocities and positions of executed arm movements from electroencephalography signals using a new paradigm without external targets. This is a step towards a non-invasive BCI which uses natural MI. Furthermore, training time will be reduced, because it is not necessary to learn new mental strategies.

Despite its known efficiency and widespread use, CSP is also known to be very sensitive to noise and prone to overfitting. To address this issue, it has been recently proposed to regularize CSP. In this paper, we present a simple and unifying theoretical framework to design such a regularized CSP (RCSP). We then present a review of existing RCSP algorithms and describe how to cast them in this framework. We also propose four new RCSP algorithms. Finally, we compare the performances of 11 different RCSP (including the four new ones and the original CSP), on electroencephalography data from 17 subjects, from BCI competition datasets. Results showed that the best RCSP methods can outperform CSP by nearly 10% in median classification accuracy and lead to more neurophysiologically relevant spatial filters. They also enable us to perform efficient subject-to-subject transfer. Overall, the best RCSP algorithms were CSP with Tikhonov regularization and weighted Tikhonov regularization, both proposed in this paper.

Sometimes normal electroencephalographic activity simulates epileptiform activity. This activity does not have pathological value and is considered a variant of normal brain activity. The main groups based on the classification proposed by Blum and Cervone are: rhythmic patterns; epileptiform patterns; lambda waves, and age dependent changes. These changes are frequently seen during drowsiness, sleep and during activation maneuvers and more common in children and adolescents. The aim of this review is to present the most important characteristics of each of these variants, in order to prevent them being confused with abnormal brain activity.

Because of this, many research groups develop new algorithms for both feature extraction and classification. However, until now, no large-scale comparison of these algorithms has been accomplished due to the fact that little EEG data is publicly available. Therefore, we at Team PhyPA recorded 32-channel EEGs, electromyograms and electrooculograms of 36 participants during a simple finger movement task. The data are published on our website www.phypa.org and are freely available for downloading. We encourage BCI researchers to test their algorithms on these data and share their results. This work also presents exemplary benchmarking procedures of common feature extraction methods for slow cortical potentials and event-related desynchronization as well as for classification algorithms based on these features.

Towards a non-invasive brain-machine interface system to restore gait function in humans	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			PERFORMANCE; WALKING; EEG	Before 2009, the feasibility of applying brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) to control prosthetic devices had been limited to upper limb prosthetics such as the DARPA modular prosthetic limb. Until recently, it was believed that the control of bipedal locomotion involved central pattern generators with little supraspinal control. Analysis of cortical dynamics with electroencephalography (EEG) was also prevented by the lack of analysis tools to deal with excessive signal artifacts associated with walking. Recently, Nicolelis and colleagues paved the way for the decoding of locomotion showing that chronic recordings from ensembles of cortical neurons in primary motor (M1) and primary somatosensory (S1) cortices can be used to decode bipedal kinematics in rhesus monkeys. However, neural decoding of bipedal locomotion in humans has not yet been demonstrated. This study uses non-invasive EEG signals to decode human walking in six nondisabled adults. Participants were asked to walk on a treadmill at their self-selected comfortable speed while receiving visual feedback of their lower limbs, to repeatedly avoid stepping on a strip drawn on the treadmill belt. Angular kinematics of the left and right hip, knee and ankle joints and EEG were recorded concurrently. Our results support the possibility of decoding human bipedal locomotion with EEG. The average of the correlation values (r) between predicted and recorded kinematics for the six subjects was 0.7 (+/- 0.12) for the right leg and 0.66 (+/- 0.11) for the left leg. The average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values for the predicted parameters were 3.36 (+/- 1.89) dB for the right leg and 2.79 (+/- 1.33) dB for the left leg. These results show the feasibility of developing non-invasive neural interfaces for volitional control of devices aimed at restoring human gait function.

J	Wang, HX; Xu, J				Wang, Haixian; Xu, Jiang			Local discriminative spatial patterns for movement-related potentials-based EEG classification	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); Discriminative spatial patterns (DSP); Electroencephalogram (EEG) classification; Local information	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; FACE RECOGNITION; DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; COMMUNICATION; FILTERS; BCI	A novel discriminant method, termed local discriminative spatial patterns (LDSP), is proposed for movement-related potentials (MRPs)-based single-trial electroencephalogram (EEG) classification. Different from conventional discriminative spatial patterns (DSP), LDSP explicitly considers local structure of EEG trials in the construction of scatter matrices in the Fisher-like criterion. The underlying manifold structure of two-dimensional spatio-temporal EEG signals contains more discriminative information. LDSP is an extension to DSP in the sense that DSP can be formulated as a special case of LDSP. By constructing an adjacency matrix, LDSP is calculated as a generalized eigenvalue problem, and so is computationally straightforward. Experiments on MRPs-based single-trial EEG classification show the effectiveness of the proposed LDSP method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

P.; Ang, Kai Keng; Tee, Keng Peng			Multi-class EEG classification of voluntary hand movement directions	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; MOTOR	Objective. Studies have shown that low frequency components of brain recordings provide information on voluntary hand movement directions. However, non-invasive techniques face more challenges compared to invasive techniques. Approach. This study presents a novel signal processing technique to extract features from non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) recordings for classifying voluntary hand movement directions. The proposed technique comprises the regularized wavelet-common spatial pattern algorithm to extract the features, mutual information-based feature selection, and multi-class classification using the Fisher linear discriminant. EEG data from seven healthy human subjects were collected while they performed voluntary right hand center-out movement in four orthogonal directions. In this study, the movement direction dependent signal-to-noise ratio is used as a parameter to denote the effectiveness of each temporal frequency bin in the classification of movement directions. Main results. Significant (p < 0.005) movement direction dependent modulation in the EEG data was identified largely towards the end of movement at low frequencies (<= 6 Hz) from the midline parietal and contralateral motor areas. Experimental results on single trial classification of the EEG data collected yielded an average accuracy of (80.24 +/- 9.41)% in discriminating the four different directions using the proposed technique on features extracted from low frequency components. Significance. The proposed feature extraction strategy provides very high multi-class classification accuracies, and the results are proven to be more statistically significant than existing methods. The results obtained suggest the possibility of multi-directional movement classification from single-trial EEG recordings using the proposed technique in low frequency components.

A dynamic Hidden Markov Model-based (HMM) classifier specifically designed to capture EEG temporal behavior was used. Surprisingly, HMM classifiers are rarely used for BCI design despite of their advantages. Because of this we also experimented with Learning Vector Quantization, Perceptron, and Support Vector Machine classifiers using a feature space which captures the temporal dynamics of the data. The results presented in this work show that HMM achieves the best performance due to an a priori information on physiological behavior of EEG inserted to the HMM classifier. Feature extraction process and problems with classification were analyzed as well. Classification scores of 66.7% - 94.7% were achieved in our experiments.

When only a few training samples are available for each subject, the performance is degraded. In this paper we present a method for Bayesian CSP with Pitman-Yor process (PYP) priors, in which spatial patterns (corresponding to basis vectors) are simultaneously learned and clustered across subjects using variational inference, allowing for a flexible mixture model where the number of components are also learned. Spatial patterns in the same cluster share the hyperparameters of their prior distributions, so that the information transfer is encouraged between subjects involving similar spatial patterns. Numerical experiments on BCI competition IV 2a dataset demonstrate the high performance of our method, compared to existing PCSP and Bayesian CSP with a single prior distribution.

The most commonly used signals in BCI investigations is electroencephalography(EEG) recordings. EEG has restricted tenacity and needs extensive training and has restricted stability. Over the past ten years, an expanding number of studies has discovered the use of electrocorticography (ECoG) activity extracting signals from the surface of the mind. ECoG has attracted considerable and expanding interest, because its mechanical characteristics should readily support robust and chronic implementations of BCI systems in humans. In this paper, we suggest a hybrid algorithm to advance the classification achievement rate of MI-based electrocorticography (ECoG) in BCls. To verify the effectiveness of the suggested classifier, we restore the SVM classifier with the identical features extracted from the cross-correlation method for the classification. The performances of those procedures are assessed with classification correctness through a to-fold cross-validation procedure. We furthermore consider the performance of the suggested procedure by comparing it with existing system.

An increased understanding of the brain has combined with advances in hardware and software to allow us to decode brain activity in real time. This mind reading can be used to provide assistive technologies to restore motor function that has been lost, or even to augment the healthy. There are many different techniques to read brain activity, and this article will discuss the potential of electroencephalography (EEG) BCIs to move out of the lab and into the real world. The EEG signal is very noisy and difficult to analyse but many advances have recently been made in this area. Before the first devices can enter the homes of the disabled, many hardware and software limitations must be overcome via interdisciplinary collaboration. At the University of Auckland, EEG based BCIs have been under development for the past few years. Our laboratory has produced excellent results including an EEG controlled video game, and an EEG phone dialling system. Research is ongoing in this area, with new projects starting for control of prostheses or rehabilitation robots.

In this study, we proposed a mean-sensitive spatial filtering (MSF) method for linear transformation of event-related potentials (ERP) that is sensitive to mean differences between stimuli conditions and applied it to N170 component to extract category-specific spatio-temporal features contained in EEG. MSF method estimated a set of optimal projecting vectors according to the spatial distribution patterns of N170 means. Then, we applied these spatial filters to single-trial ERP data and performed classification on the extracted features. In this way, the presence of a larger negative component in EEG time courses evoked by faces can be detected robustly in single trial EEG, and hereby we can infer the category of every presented stimulus from faces and objects. Furthermore, we also successfully extracted the unobvious distinct spatial patterns between cars and cats with MSF and separated them correctly. Our remarkable and robust classification performances suggest that MSF works well in extracting stable spatial patterns from N170. Therefore, MSF provides a promising solution for decoding presented visual information basing on single-trial N170 component.

The validity of this approach was first tested by analyzing the questionnaire responses, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, and peripheral signals of the players playing a Tetris game at three difficulty levels. This analysis confirms that the different difficulty levels correspond to distinguishable emotions, and that, playing several times at the same difficulty level gives rise to boredom. The next step was to train several classifiers to automatically detect the three emotional classes from EEG and peripheral signals in a player-independent framework. By using either type of signals, the emotional classes were successfully recovered, with EEG having a better accuracy than peripheral signals on short periods of time. After the fusion of the two signal categories, the accuracy raised up to 63%.

Information regarding its mechanism of action may offer clues to the pathophysiology of the disease and to improved treatment. In this study we employ a machine learning (ML) analysis of P300 evoked potentials obtained from quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) data to identify changes in the brain induced by CLZ treatment. We employ brain source localization (BSL) on the EEG signals to extract source waveforms from specified regions of the brain. A subset of 8 features is selected from a large set of candidate features (consisting of spectral coherences between all identified source waveforms at multiple frequencies) that discriminate (by means of a classifier) between the pre- and post-treatment data for the schizophrenics (SCZ) most responsive to CLZ. We show these same selected features also discriminate between pre-treatment most responsive SCZ and healthy volunteers (HV), but not after treatment. Of note, these same features discriminate the least responsive SCZ from HV both pre- and post-treatment. This analysis suggests that the net beneficial effects of CLZ in SCZ are reflected in a normalization of P300 brain-source generators.

Trial pruning based on genetic algorithm for single-trial EEG classification	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								We consider the problem of artifacts in electroencephalography (EEG) data. In a practical motor imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI) system, EEG signals are usually contaminated by misleading trials caused by artifacts, measurement inaccuracies, or improper imagination of a movement. As a result, the performance of a BCI system can be degraded. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm combining Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and genetic algorithm (GA) to detect the abnormal EEG samples. In addition, this algorithm can be also integrated with other data-driven feature exaction method (e.g., common spatial pattern (CSP)) so that a more reliable analysis can be obtained by pruning the potential outliers and noisy samples, and consequently the performance of a BCI system can be improved. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in comparison with the conventional mixture model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Gutierrez, D; Salazar-Varas, R				Gutierrez, David; Salazar-Varas, Rocio			Using eigenstructure decompositions of time-varying autoregressions in common spatial patterns-based EEG signal classification	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Brain-computer interface; Time-varying autoregressions; Common spatial patterns	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; FILTERS; MODELS	Brain-computer interfaces based on common spatial patterns (CSP) depend on the operational frequency bands of the events to be discriminated. This problem has been addressed through sub-band decompositions of the electroencephalographic signals using filter banks, then the performance relies on the number of filters that are stacked and the criteria to select their bandwidths. Here, we propose an alternative approach based on an eigenstructure decomposition of the signals' time-varying autoregressions (WAR). The eigen-based decomposition of the WAR allows for subject-specific estimation of the principal time-varying frequencies, then such principal eigencomponents can be used in the traditional CSP-based classification. We show through a series of numerical experiments that the proposed classification scheme can achieve a performance which is comparable with the one obtained through the filter bank-based approach. However, our method does not rely on a preliminary selection of a frequency band, yet good performance is achieved under realistic conditions (such as reduced number of sensors and small amount of training data) independently of the time interval selected.

The system explores the feasibility of speeding up image analysis by tapping into split-second perceptual judgments of humans. We present an incremental learning system with less memory storage and computational cost for single-trial event-related potential (ERP) detection, which is trained using cross-session data. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method on the task of target image detection. We apply linear and nonlinear support vector machines (SVMs) and a linear logistic classifier (LLC) for single-trial ERP detection using data collected from image analysts and naive subjects. For our data the detection performance of the nonlinear SVM is better than the linear SVM and the LLC. We also show that our ERP-based target detection system is five-fold faster than the traditional image viewing paradigm. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The systems reads the human brain which consists of left or right imaginary movement and decide the actual movement. It is useful especially for the disable people to help their daily life. But the signals include the unwanted signals and other features together with the actual signal. The challenges are to remove the unwanted signals and extract the accurate feature and classify the signal accurately by using the best classification method. This paper applied the Kalman filter to the BCI's signal processing methods to improve the accuracy and the reliability of the systems. The Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) is used to extract the feature and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) as the classification method. We also compared other classification method which is Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) to show the RBF gives better result. The simulation result shows improvement by using the proposed method compared to the other method.

Recording conventional and amplitude-integrated EEG in neonatal intensive care unit	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Review						Neonates; Standards and technical aspects of EEG; Conventional EEG; Amplitude-integrated EEG; Neurophysiology technician; NICU recordings	ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; SEIZURES; INFANTS; CLASSIFICATION; NEWBORN; BIRTH; BORN; AGE	Neonatal electroencephalography (EEG) presents a challenge due to its difficult interpretation that differs significantly from interpretation in older children and adolescents. Also, from the technological point of view, it is more difficult to perform and is not a standard procedure in all neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). During recent years, long-term cerebral function monitoring by the means of amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) has become popular in NICUs because it is easy to apply, allows real-time interpretation by the neonatologist treating the newborn, and has predictive value for outcome. On the other side, to record conventional EEG (cEEG), which is still considered the gold standard of neonatal EEG, the EEG technician should not only be well trained in performing neonatal EEG but also has to adapt to suboptimal working conditions. These issues need to be understood when approaching the neonatal cEEG in NICU and the main structure of the article is dedicated to this technique. The authors discuss the benefits of the digitalization and its positive effects on the improvement of NICU recording. The technical aspects as well as the standards for cEEG recording are described, and a section is dedicated to possible artifacts. Thereafter, alternative and concomitant use of aEEG and its benefits are briefly discussed. At the end there is a section that presents a review of our own cEEG and aEEG recordings that were chosen as the most frequently encountered patterns according to Consensus statement on the use of EEG in the intensive care unit.

This paper presents a new EEG classification approach based on the extreme learning machine (ELM) and nonlinear dynamical features. The theory of nonlinear dynamics has been a powerful tool for understanding brain electrical activities. Nonlinear features extracted from EEG signals such as approximate entropy (ApEn), Hurst exponent and scaling exponent obtained with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) are employed to characterize interictal and ictal EEGs. The statistics indicate that the differences of those nonlinear features between interictal and ictal EEGs are statistically significant. The ELM algorithm is employed to train a single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) with EEG nonlinear features. The experiments demonstrate that compared with the backpropagation (BP) algorithm and support vector machine (SVM), the performance of the ELM is better in terms of training time and classification accuracy which achieves a satisfying recognition accuracy of 96.5% for interictal and ictal EEG signals.

Integration through EEG-fMRI trial-by-trial coupling has been proposed as a method to combine the different data sets and achieve temporal expansion of the fMRI data (Eichele et al., 2005). To fully benefit of this type of analysis simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions are necessary (Debener et al., 2006). Here we address the issue of predicting the signal in one modality using information from the other modality. We use multivariate Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) regression to "learn" the relation between fMRI activation patterns and simultaneously acquired EEG responses in the context of a complex cognitive task entailing an auditory cue, visual mental imagery and a control visual target. We show that multivariate regression is a valuable approach for predicting evoked and induced oscillatory EEG responses from fMRI time series. Prediction of EEG from fMRI is largely influenced by the overall filtering effects of the hemodynamic response function. However, a detailed analysis of the auditory evoked responses shows that there is a small but significant contribution of single trial modulations that can be exploited for linking spatially-distributed patterns of fMRI activation to specific components of the simultaneously-recorded EEG signal.

The research is in the preliminary stage (two subjects thus far), but early results are promising. Also discussed in the paper is information regarding commercialization of the invention which is of interest to many universities. A provisional patent application was filed and a critique was gathered from executives from a famous advertising agency regarding commercialization of the invention for Neuromarketing.

However, in terms of designing a motor imagery-based BCI system, a lot of research in the literature either uses a frequency band of interest selected manually based on the visual analysis of EEG data or is set to a general broad band, causing performance degradation in classification. In this article, we propose a novel method of selecting subject and class specific frequency bands based on the analysis of a channel-frequency matrix, which we call a channel-frequency map. We operate the classification process for each frequency band individually, i.e., spatial filtering, feature extraction, and classification, and determine a class label for an input EEG by considering the outputs from multiple classifiers together at the end. From our experiments on a public dataset of BCI Competition IV (2008) II-a that includes four motor imagery tasks from nine subjects, the proposed algorithm outperformed the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm in a broad band and a filter bank CSP algorithm on average in terms of cross-validation and session-to-session transfer rate. Furthermore, a considerable increase of classification accuracy has been achieved for certain subjects. We also would like to note that the proposed data-driven frequency bands selection method is applicable to other kinds of single-trial EEG classifications that are based on modulations of brain rhythms, by no means limited to motor imagery-based BCI applications.

However, one factor that has limited practical applications for EEG-based BCI so far is the difficulty to decode brain signals in a reliable and efficient way. This paper proposes a new robust processing framework for decoding of multi-class motor imagery (MI) that is based on five main processing steps. (i) Raw EEG segmentation without the need of visual artifact inspection. (ii) Considering that EEG recordings are often contaminated not just by electrooculography (EOG) but also other types of artifacts, we propose to first implement an automatic artifact correction method that combines regression analysis with independent component analysis for recovering the original source signals. (iii) The significant difference between frequency components based on event-related (de-) synchronization and sample entropy is then used to find noncontiguous discriminating rhythms. After spectral filtering using the discriminating rhythms, a channel selection algorithm is used to select only relevant channels. (iv) Feature vectors are extracted based on the inter-class diversity and time-varying dynamic characteristics of the signals. (v) Finally, a support vector machine is employed for four-class classification. We tested our proposed algorithm on experimental data that was obtained from dataset 2a of BCI competition IV (2008). The overall four-class kappa values (between 0.41 and 0.80) were comparable to other models but without requiring any artifact-contaminated trial removal. The performance showed that multi-class MI tasks can be reliably discriminated using artifact-contaminated EEG recordings from a few channels. This may be a promising avenue for online robust EEG-based BCI applications.

FASTER: an unsupervised fully automated sleep staging method for mice	GENES TO CELLS			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK; REM-SLEEP; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM; RELIABILITY; VALIDATION; FREQUENCY; MODEL	Identifying the stages of sleep, or sleep staging, is an unavoidable step in sleep research and typically requires visual inspection of electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) data. Currently, scoring is slow, biased and prone to error by humans and thus is the most important bottleneck for large-scale sleep research in animals. We have developed an unsupervised, fully automated sleep staging method for mice that allows less subjective and high-throughput evaluation of sleep. Fully Automated Sleep sTaging method via EEG/EMG Recordings (FASTER) is based on nonparametric density estimation clustering of comprehensive EEG/EMG power spectra. FASTER can accurately identify sleep patterns in mice that have been perturbed by drugs or by genetic modification of a clock gene. The overall accuracy is over 90% in every group. 24-h data are staged by a laptop computer in 10min, which is faster than an experienced human rater. Dramatically improving the sleep staging process in both quality and throughput FASTER will open the door to quantitative and comprehensive animal sleep research.

Advances in Automated Neonatal Seizure Detection	NEW ADVANCES IN INTELLIGENT SIGNAL PROCESSING	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	6th IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing	AUG 26-28, 2009	Budapest, HUNGARY	IEEE Hungary Sect, IEEE Hungary I&M Soc Joint Chapter, IEEE Hungary CIS Chapter, IEEE Instrumentat & Measurement Soc (IMS)		Neonatal EEG analysis; biomedical signal classification	FEATURE-SELECTION; EEG; SYSTEM; FEATURES; MODELS	This chapter highlights the current approaches in automated neonatal seizure detection and in particular focuses on classifier based methods. Automated detection of neonatal seizures has the potential to greatly improve the outcome of patients in the neonatal intensive care unit. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is the only signal on which 100% of electrographic seizures are visible and thus is considered the gold standard for neonatal seizure detection. Although a number of methods and algorithms have been proposed previously to automatically detect neonatal seizures, to date their transition to clinical use has been limited due to poor performances mainly attributed to large inter and intra-patient variability of seizure patterns and the presence of artifacts. Here, a novel detector is proposed based on time-domain, frequency-domain and information theory analysis of the signal combined with pattern recognition using machine learning principles. The proposed methodology is based on a classifier with a large and diverse feature set and includes a post-processing stage to incorporate contextual information of the signal. It is shown that this methodology achieves high classification accuracy for both classifiers and allows for the use of soft decisions, such as the probability of seizure over time, to be displayed.

Thus, efficient techniques for temporal pattern mining and temporal pattern-based classification of time series data are imperative. In this paper, we focus on temporal pattern mining for interval-based event data and temporal pattern-based classification for the multivariate time series datasets. Temporal pattern mining has not been applied extensively for epileptic seizure detection. Therefore, we test our algorithm using intracranial electroencephalography data generated during epileptic seizure recording. First, we demonstrate the ambiguities in existing temporal pattern representation schemes such as Time Series Knowledge Representation, TPrefixSpan, and IEMiner. Second, we address the deficiencies of these temporal pattern representation schemes by proposing a new temporal pattern representation scheme for interval-based event data and developing an apriori-like algorithm for temporal pattern generation. Furthermore, we define temporal rules for the proposed temporal rule-based classifier. For our experiments, we apply temporal pattern mining on epileptic seizure intracranial electroencephalography data to determine the seizure and non-seizure conditions for epileptic seizure detection. The proposed classifier exploits multivariate temporal patterns extracted from multivariate time series intracranial electroencephalography (IEEG) data to classify events as seizure or non-seizure occurrences.

Decoding Speech Perception by Native and Non-Native Speakers Using Single-Trial Electrophysiological Data	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CATEGORICAL PERCEPTION; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; LANGUAGE; REORGANIZATION; NEUROFEEDBACK; COMPONENTS; STIMULI; VOICE; P300; FMRI	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are systems that use real-time analysis of neuroimaging data to determine the mental state of their user for purposes such as providing neurofeedback. Here, we investigate the feasibility of a BCI based on speech perception. Multivariate pattern classification methods were applied to single-trial EEG data collected during speech perception by native and non-native speakers. Two principal questions were asked: 1) Can differences in the perceived categories of pairs of phonemes be decoded at the single-trial level? 2) Can these same categorical differences be decoded across participants, within or between native-language groups? Results indicated that classification performance progressively increased with respect to the categorical status (within, boundary or across) of the stimulus contrast, and was also influenced by the native language of individual participants. Classifier performance showed strong relationships with traditional event-related potential measures and behavioral responses. The results of the cross-participant analysis indicated an overall increase in average classifier performance when trained on data from all participants (native and non-native). A second cross-participant classifier trained only on data from native speakers led to an overall improvement in performance for native speakers, but a reduction in performance for non-native speakers. We also found that the native language of a given participant could be decoded on the basis of EEG data with accuracy above 80%. These results indicate that electrophysiological responses underlying speech perception can be decoded at the single-trial level, and that decoding performance systematically reflects graded changes in the responses related to the phonological status of the stimuli. This approach could be used in extensions of the BCI paradigm to support perceptual learning during second language acquisition.	[Brandmeyer, Alex; Farquhar, Jason D.

However, remaining challenges include the non-stationarity and the low signal-to-noise ratio of the EEG, which limit the bandwidth and hence the available applications. Optimization of both individual components of BCIs and the interrelationship between them is crucial to enhance bandwidth. In other words, neuroscientific knowledge and machine learning need to be optimized by considering concepts from human-computer interaction research and usability. In this paper, we present results of ongoing relevant research in our lab that addresses several important issues for BCIs based on the detection of transient changes in oscillatory EEG activity. First, we report on the long-term stability and robustness of detection of oscillatory EEG components modulated by distinct mental tasks, and show that the use of mental task pairs "mental subtraction versus motor imagery" achieves robust and reliable performance (Cohen's kappa > 0.6) in seven out of nine subjects over a period of 4 days. Second, we report on restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) as promising tools for the recognition of oscillatory EEG patterns. In an off-line BCI simulation we computed average peak accuracies, averaged over ten subjects, of 80.8 +/- A 7.2 %. Third, we present the basic framework of the context-aware hybrid Graz-BCI that allows interacting with the massive multiplayer online role playing game World of Warcraft. We show how a more integrated design approach that considers all components of BCIs, their interrelationships, other input signals and contextual information can increase interaction efficacy.

One window into the nature of the aberrant temporal dynamics in the cerebral cortex of PD patients can come from analysis of the patients electroencephalography (EEG). Rather than using spectral-based methods, we used data models based on delay differential equations (DDE) as non-linear time-domain classification tools to analyze EEG recordings from PD patients on and off dopaminergic therapy and healthy individuals. Two sets of 50 1-s segments of 64-channel EEG activity were recorded from nine PD patients on and off medication and nine age matched controls. The 64 EEG channels were grouped into 10 clusters covering frontal, central, parietal, and occipital brain regions for analysis. DDE models were fitted to individual trials, and model coefficients and error were used as features for classification. The best models were selected using repeated random sub-sampling validation and classification performance was measured using the area under the ROC curve A'. In a companion paper, we show that DDEs can uncover hidden dynamical structure from short segments of simulated time series of known dynamical systems in high noise regimes. Using the same method for finding the best models, we found here that even short segments of EEG data in PD patients and controls contained dynamical structure, and moreover, that PD patients exhibited a greater dynamic range than controls. DDE model output on the means from one set of 50 trials provided nearly complete separation of PD patients off medication from controls: across brain regions, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves, A', varied from 0.95 to 1.0. For distinguishing PD patients on vs. off medication, classification performance A' ranged from 0.86 to 1.0 across brain regions. Moreover, the generalizability of the model to the second set of 50 trials was excellent, with A' ranging from 0.81 to 0.94 across brain regions for controls vs. PD off medication, and from 0.62 to 0.82 for PD on medication vs. off. Finally, model features significantly predicted individual patients' motor severity, as assessed with standard clinical rating scales.

Like other diagnostic modalities, technological advances have opened new avenues for assessment of data, and hold great promise to improve interpretive capabilities. However, proper overall interpretation and application of electroencephalographic findings relies on valid correlations of associated clinical semiology.

A square root ensemble Kalman filter application to a motor-imagery brain-computer interface	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			CLASSIFICATION	We here investigated a non-linear ensemble Kalman filter (SPKF) application to a motor imagery brain computer interface (BCI). A square root central difference Kalman filter (SR-CDKF) was used as an approach for brain state estimation in motor imagery task performance, using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Healthy human subjects imagined left vs. right hand movements and tongue vs. bilateral toe movements while scalp EEG signals were recorded. Offline data analysis was conducted for training the model as well as for decoding the imagery movements. Preliminary results indicate the feasibility of this approach with a decoding accuracy of 78%-90% for the hand movements and 70%-90% for the tongue-toes movements. Ongoing research includes online BCI applications of this approach as well as combined state and parameter estimation using this algorithm with different system dynamic models.

First published July 13, 2011; doi: 10.1152/jn.00104.2011.-Chronic recordings from ensembles of cortical neurons in primary motor and somatosensory areas in rhesus macaques provide accurate information about bipedal locomotion (Fitzsimmons NA, Lebedev MA, Peikon ID, Nicolelis MA. Front Integr Neurosci 3: 3, 2009). Here we show that the linear and angular kinematics of the ankle, knee, and hip joints during both normal and precision (attentive) human treadmill walking can be inferred from noninvasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) with decoding accuracies comparable to those from neural decoders based on multiple single-unit activities (SUAs) recorded in nonhuman primates. Six healthy adults were recorded. Participants were asked to walk on a treadmill at their self-selected comfortable speed while receiving visual feedback of their lower limbs (i.e., precision walking), to repeatedly avoid stepping on a strip drawn on the treadmill belt. Angular and linear kinematics of the left and right hip, knee, and ankle joints and EEG were recorded, and neural decoders were designed and optimized with cross-validation procedures. Of note, the optimal set of electrodes of these decoders were also used to accurately infer gait trajectories in a normal walking task that did not require subjects to control and monitor their foot placement. Our results indicate a high involvement of a fronto-posterior cortical network in the control of both precision and normal walking and suggest that EEG signals can be used to study in real time the cortical dynamics of walking and to develop brain-machine interfaces aimed at restoring human gait function.

J	Lotte, F; Larrue, F; Muhl, C				Lotte, Fabien; Larrue, Florian; Muehl, Christian			Flaws in current human training protocols for spontaneous Brain-Computer Interfaces: lessons learned from instructional design	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Brain-Computer Interface; instructional design; electroencephalography; training protocols; feedback	MOTOR IMAGERY; VIRTUAL-REALITY; COMMUNICATION; EEG; FEEDBACK; BCI; PERFORMANCE; POTENTIALS; ATTENTION; DEVICE	While recent research on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) has highlighted their potential for many applications, they remain barely used outside laboratories. The main reason is their lack of robustness. Indeed, with current BCI, mental state recognition is usually slow and often incorrect. Spontaneous BCI (i.e., mental imagery-based BCI) often rely on mutual learning efforts by the user and the machine, with BCI users learning to produce stable ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) patterns (spontaneous BCI control being widely acknowledged as a skill) while the computer learns to automatically recognize these EEG patterns, using signal processing. Most research so far was focused on signal processing, mostly neglecting the human in the loop. However, how well the user masters the BCI skill is also a key element explaining BCI robustness. Indeed, if the user is not able to produce stable and distinct EEG patterns, then no signal processing algorithm would be able to recognize them. Unfortunately, despite the importance of BCI training protocols, they have been scarcely studied so far, and used mostly unchanged for years. In this paper, we advocate that current human training approaches for spontaneous BCI are most likely inappropriate. We notably study instructional design literature in order to identify the key requirements and guidelines for a successful training procedure that promotes a good and efficient skill learning. This literature study highlights that current spontaneous BCI user training procedures satisfy very few of these requirements and hence are likely to be suboptimal. We therefore identify the flaws in BCI training protocols according to instructional design principles, at several levels: in the instructions provided to the user, in the tasks he/she has to perform, and in the feedback provided. For each level, we propose new research directions that are theoretically expected to address some of these flaws and to help users learn the BCI skill more efficiently.

Standardized database development for EEG epileptiform transient detection: EEGnet scoring system and machine learning analysis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Spike detection; Epileptiform transient; Automated interpretation; Computerized interpretation	SPIKE DETECTION; DETECTION ALGORITHM; AUTOMATIC DETECTION; PERFORMANCE; SEIZURES	The routine scalp electroencephalogram (rsEEG) is the most common clinical neurophysiology procedure. The most important role of rsEEG is to detect evidence of epilepsy, in the form of epileptiform transients (ETs), also known as spike or sharp wave discharges. Due to the wide variety of morphologies of ETs and their similarity to artifacts and waves that are part of the normal background activity, the task of ET detection is difficult and mistakes are frequently made. The development of reliable computerized detection of ETs in the EEG could assist physicians in interpreting rsEEGs. We report progress in developing a standardized database for testing and training ET detection algorithms. We describe a new version of our EEGnet software system for collecting expert opinion on EEG datasets, a completely web-browser based system. We report results of EEG scoring from a group of 11 board-certified academic clinical neurophysiologists who annotated 30-s excepts from rsEEG recordings from 100 different patients. The scorers had moderate inter-scorer reliability and low to moderate intra-scorer reliability. In order to measure the optimal size of this standardized rsEEG database, we used machine learning models to classify paroxysmal EEG activity in our database into ET and non-ET classes. Based on our results, it appears that our database will need to be larger than its current size. Also, our non-parametric classifier, an artificial neural network, performed better than our parametric Bayesian classifier. Of our feature sets, the wavelet feature set proved most useful for classification. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Li, Y; Koike, Y				Li, Yan; Koike, Yasuharu			A real-time BCI with a small number of channels based on CSP	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Common spatial patterns; 5 Channels; Optimizing parameters	COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERN; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; BRAIN; FILTERS; CLASSIFICATION	For implementations of electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain computer interfaces (BCIs), common spatial pattern (CSP) is one of the most popular methods. Although many variations of CSP have been introduced, the original form is still quite effective and efficient. However, its application is usually based on multi-channels, which requires a relatively long time for electrode installation. The aim of this study is to build a BCI with CSP in a simple and practical way, with a few electrodes and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) as the classifier. Two experiments were carried out to compare effects of different numbers of channels and overlap of sliding windows. By optimizing these basic parameters, it is possible to build an easy-to-setup and effective BCI. The results showed that for four subjects with either 15/10 channels, the online trial accuracy could reach 83.9% on average. Comparable results could be obtained with only 5 channels.

Inferring hand movement kinematics from MEG, EEG and intracranial EEG: From brain-machine interfaces to motor rehabilitation	IRBM			English	Review						Hand velocity; Movement decoding; Brain-computer interface (BCI); Brain-machine interface (BMI); Non-invasive BMI: EEG; MEG; ECoG; SEEG; Motor rehabilitation; Neural prosthesis	ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; COMPUTER INTERFACES; GAMMA-SYNCHRONIZATION; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; CELL DISCHARGE; BCI SYSTEM; DIRECTION	The ability to use electrophysiological brain signals to decode various parameters of voluntary movement is a central question in Brain Machine Interface (BMI) research. Invasive BM I systems can successfully decode movement trajectories from the spiking activity of neurons in primary motor cortex and posterior parietal cortex. It has long been assumed that non-invasive techniques do not provide sufficient signal resolution to decode the kinematics of complex time-varying movements. This view stems from the hypothesis that movement parameters such as direction. position, velocity, or acceleration are primarily encoded by neuronal firing in motor cortex. Consequently, the fact that such signals cannot be detected using non-invasive techniques such as Electroencephalography (EEG) or Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has led to the claim that fine movement properties cannot be decoded with non-invasive methods. However, this view has been proven wrong by numerous studies in recent years. First, a growing body of research over the last decade has shown that the local field potential (LFP) signal, which represents the summed activity of a neuronal population, can encode movement parameters at a level comparable to unit recordings. These findings were confirmed in humans by the successful use of electrocorticography (ECoG) to achieve continuous movement decoding via invasive human BMI approaches. Very recently, a number of non-invasive studies were able to provide striking evidence that even surface-level MEG or EEG data can contain sufficient information on hand movement in order to infer movement direction and hand kinematics from brain signals recorded using non-invasive methods. Here we provide a brief review of this recent literature and discuss its importance on the future of BMI research and its implications on the development of novel motor rehabilitation strategies.

For accurate classification, it is important to analyze the period of time when a BCI user performs a mental task. We address this problem by optimizing the CSP cost with a time sparsification that removes unnecessary samples from the classification. We design a cost function that has CSP spatial weights and time window as optimization parameters. To find these parameters, we use alternating optimization. In an experiment on classification of motor-imagery EEG signals, the proposed method increased classification accuracy by 6% averaged over five subjects.

The integrity of auditory functions evaluated using mismatch negativity paradigms has been associated with their chances of survival. However, because auditory discrimination is assessed at various delays after coma onset, it is still unclear whether this impairment depends on the time of the recording. We hypothesized that impairment in auditory discrimination capabilities is indicative of coma progression, rather than of the comatose state itself and that rudimentary auditory discrimination remains intact during acute stages of coma. We studied 30 post-anoxic comatose patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest and five healthy, age-matched controls. Using a mismatch negativity paradigm, we performed two electroencephalography recordings with a standard 19-channel clinical montage: the first within 24 h after coma onset and under mild therapeutic hypothermia, and the second after 1 day and under normothermic conditions. We analysed electroencephalography responses based on a multivariate decoding algorithm that automatically quantifies neural discrimination at the single patient level. Results showed high average decoding accuracy in discriminating sounds both for control subjects and comatose patients. Importantly, accurate decoding was largely independent of patients' chance of survival. However, the progression of auditory discrimination between the first and second recordings was informative of a patient's chance of survival. A deterioration of auditory discrimination was observed in all non-survivors (equivalent to 100% positive predictive value for survivors). We show, for the first time, evidence of intact auditory processing even in comatose patients who do not survive and that progression of sound discrimination over time is informative of a patient's chance of survival. Tracking auditory discrimination in comatose patients could provide new insight to the chance of awakening in a quantitative and automatic fashion during early stages of coma.

To improve this, predictive human-machine interfaces (HMIs) can be applied to better support future interaction between human and machine. To infer upcoming context-based behavior relevant brain states of the human have to be detected. This is achieved by brain reading (BR), a passive approach for single trial EEG analysis that makes use of supervised machine learning (ML) methods. In this work we propose that BR is able to detect concrete states of the interacting human. To support this, we show that BR detects patterns in the electroencephalogram (EEG) that can be related to event-related activity in the EEG like the P300, which are indicators of concrete states or brain processes like target recognition processes. Further, we improve the robustness and applicability of BR in application-oriented scenarios by identifying and combining most relevant training data for single trial classification and by applying classifier transfer. We show that training and testing, i.e., application of the classifier, can be carried out on different classes, if the samples of both classes miss a relevant pattern. Classifier transfer is important for the usage of BR in application scenarios, where only small amounts of training examples are available. Finally, we demonstrate a dual BR application in an experimental setup that requires similar behavior as performed during the teleoperation of a robotic arm. Here, target recognition processes and movement preparation processes are detected simultaneously. In summary, our findings contribute to the development of robust and stable predictive HMIs that enable the simultaneous support of different interaction behaviors.

Subjects viewed 8-s video clips while their brain activity was registered using EEG. The video signal was either uncompressed at full length or changed from uncompressed to a lower quality level at a random time point. The distortions were introduced by a hybrid video codec. Subjects had to indicate whether they had perceived a quality change. In response to a quality change, a positive voltage change in EEG (the so-called P3 component) was observed at latency of about 400-600 ms for all subjects. The voltage change positively correlated with the magnitude of the video quality change, substantiating the P3 component as a graded neural index of the perception of video quality change within the presented paradigm. By applying machine learning techniques, we could classify on a single-trial basis whether a subject perceived a quality change. Interestingly, some video clips wherein changes were missed (i.e., not reported) by the subject were classified as quality changes, suggesting that the brain detected a change, although the subject did not press a button. In conclusion, abrupt changes of video quality give rise to specific components in the EEG that can be detected on a single-trial basis. Potentially, a neurotechnological approach to video assessment could lead to a more objective quantification of quality change detection, overcoming the limitations of subjective approaches (such as subjective bias and the requirement of an overt response). Furthermore, it allows for real-time applications wherein the brain response to a video clip is monitored while it is being viewed.

Wavelet Common Spatial Pattern in asynchronous offline brain computer interfaces	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Asynchronous brain computer interface; Common spatial pattern; Wavelet analysis		Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) is the most popular technique used in the brain computer interfacing (BCI) context. It aims to decorrelate electroencephalography (EEG) signals obtained from different electrodes. This increases the accuracy of synchronous systems wherein users are only able to send signals during certain predefined window lengths. However CSP has poor performance and accuracy in true asynchronous BCI systems wherein users send commands at any time during the interaction with various durations of imaginations. This is more desirable and flexible compared to the synchronous version. CSP's poor performance is mainly due to the nonstationary properties of EEG signals and the need to incorporate flexible control timing. A new Wavelet Common Spatial Pattern (WCSP) technique is introduced in this paper in which EEG signals are decomposed using wavelet packets. For each packet discriminatory features are extracted and discriminative packets are selected for each subject using fuzzy logic. Classification results indicate WCSP outperforms CSP for the true asynchronous BCI system with an average Kappa increase of 0.4. The apparent poor performance of CSP in this study compared to other published articles was a consequence of using a true asynchronous system, i.e. having variable imagination durations.

Single-trial classification of gait and point movement preparation from human EEG	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; gait intent; point intent; brain-computer interface	MOTOR IMAGERY; TREADMILL WALKING; INITIATION; MU; LOCOMOTION; RHYTHMS	Neuroimaging studies provide evidence of cortical involvement immediately before and during gait and during gait-related behaviors such as stepping in place or motor imagery of gait. Here we attempt to perform single trial classification of gait intent from another movement plan (point intent) or from standing in place. Subjects walked naturally from a starting position to a designated ending position, pointed at a designated position from the starting position, or remained standing at the starting position. The 700 ms of recorded electroencephalography (EEG) before movement onset was used for single trial classification of trials based on action type and direction (left walk, forward walk, right walk, left point, right point, and stand) as well as action type regardless of direction (stand, walk, point). Classification using regularized LDA was performed on a principal components analysis (RCA) reduced feature space composed of coefficients from levels 1 to 9 of a discrete wavelet decomposition using the Daubechies 4 wavelet. We achieved significant classification for all conditions, with errors as low as 17% when averaged across nine subjects. LDA and RCA highly weighted frequency ranges that included movement related potentials (MRPs), with smaller contributions from frequency ranges that included mu and beta idle motor rhythms. Additionally, error patterns suggested a spatial structure to the EEG signal. Future applications of the cortical gait intent signal may include an additional dimension of control for prosthetics, preemptive corrective feedback for gait disturbances, or human computer interfaces (HCl).

This paper presents a multivariate statistical model of ERPs by exploiting the existing knowledge about their spatio-temporal properties. In particular, a computationally efficient algorithm is derived for fast model estimation. The algorithm, termed SIM, can be intuitively interpreted as maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio in the source space. Using both simulated and real EEG data, we show that the algorithm achieves excellent estimation performance and substantially outperforms a state-of-the-arts algorithm in classification accuracies in a P300 target detection task. The results demonstrate that the proposed modeling framework offers a powerful tool for exploring the spatio-temporal patterns of ERPs as well as learning spatial filters for decoding brain states.

The purpose of the study is to add a penalty term using distances between sensors as the geometric information for finding spatial weights. The regularization term is derived under the definition of neighbors of sensors. We evaluate the proposed regularization in common spatial pattern (CSP) which is a well-known feature extraction method for EEG based brain computer interface (BCI). We have demonstrated the CSP procedure with the regularization by simulation for artificial signals. The results show that the proposed method works better than standard CSP in extracting of a component generated in a certain brain spot. Moreover, the classification experimental results using dataset of motor imagery based BCI suggest that the proposed method achieved maximum improvement by 27% in the classification accuracy over the standard CSP in a setting of even when we use only five samples.

J	Wang, HX				Wang, Haixian			Optimizing spatial filters for single-trial EEG classification via a discriminant extension to CSP: the Fisher criterion	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Common spatial patterns; Brain-computer interfaces; Fisher criterion; Single-trial EEG classification	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; BCI COMPETITION 2003; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; FINGER MOVEMENT; TASK	In this article, a new spatial filtering approach, called discriminant common spatial patterns (dCSP), is proposed for single-trial EEG classification. Unlike the conventional common spatial patterns (CSP) that is substantially a subspace decomposition technique, dCSP is intently designed for discriminant purpose. The basic idea of dCSP is to construct a Fisher-like criterion that extracts both between-class and within-class discriminant information. The classical CSP only considers separating class means, i.e., between-class scatter, as well as possible. In contrast, dCSP aims to maximize between-class scatter and meanwhile minimize within-class scatter. Computationally, dCSP is formulated as a generalized eigenvalue problem. Experiments on real EEG classification show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

A QUANTITATIVE EEG METHOD FOR DETECTING POST CLAMP CHANGES DURING CAROTID ENDARTERECTOMY	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MONITORING AND COMPUTING			English	Article						carotid endarterectomy; brain symmetry index; intraoperative monitoring; pattern recognition; hypoperfusion; ischemia; quantitative electroencephalography	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; BLOOD-FLOW; SELECTION; ALGORITHMS; BSI	Objective. To apply univariate and multivariate analyses of EEG spectral features in order to detect subtle post-clamp changes during carotid endarterectomy, and to devise a data-driven, multivariate classification method for rapid, real-time detection of small post-clamp EEG changes. Methods. We used intraoperative EEG records of 27 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and did not undergo a shunt per surgeon's and technologist's visual inspection of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Furthermore, these records could not be flagged with r-sBSI (revised spatial brain symmetry index) or r-tBSI (revised temporal brain symmetry index) qEEG (quantitative EEG) metrics. Spectral energies of 10 s EEG snippets were recorded at 5 min intervals from 10 min pre-clamp to 20 min post-clamp. Using receiver operating characteristic curves, the power of standard EEG spectral bands in detection of post-clamp changes was determined. Next, we employed Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis for classifier-guided multivariate feature selection and classification. Results. In univariate analysis, delta waves in non-frontal areas, irrespective of the laterality of the affected hemisphere, were found to be generally more powerful indicators of clamp-induced EEG changes. In multivariate analysis, cross-validation results for Fisher LDA produced subject-independent equal error rates as low as 32% when separating post-clamp signals from pre-clamp controls. Within our subject group, the intricate clamp-induced EEG signatures were predominantly anterior, bilateral, and had a strong delta rhythm presence. The overall post-clamp saliencies, both in univariate and multivariate analyses, were time-dependent. Conclusion. By applying automatic data-driven feature extraction and classification to short EEG records, it is possible to construct subject-independent computational models that can detect subtle post clamp changes possibly caused by small perturbations in cerebral blood flow. These subtle changes are missed by visual inspection of the EEG and by other quantitative EEG techniques such as r-sBSI and r-tBSI. Within our subject group, the intricate post-clamp EEG signatures were predominantly anterior, bilateral, and had a strong delta rhythm presence.

The problem is much harder in neonatal EEG, where the background EEG contains spikes, waves, and rapid fluctuations in amplitude and frequency. Existing artifact detection methods are mostly limited to detect only a subset of artifacts such as ocular, muscle or power line artifacts. Few methods integrate different modules, each for detection of one specific category of artifact. Furthermore, most of the reference approaches are implemented and tested on adult EEG recordings. Direct application of those methods on neonatal EEG causes performance deterioration, due to greater pattern variation and inherent complexity. A method for detection of a wide range of artifact categories in neonatal EEG is thus required. At the same time, the method should be specific enough to preserve the background EEG information. The current study describes a feature based classification approach to detect both repetitive (generated from ECG, EMG, pulse, respiration, etc.) and transient (generated from eye blinking, eye movement, patient movement, etc.) artifacts. It focuses on artifact detection within high energy burst patterns, instead of detecting artifacts within the complete background EEG with wide pattern variation. The objective is to find true burst patterns, which can later be used to identify the Burst-Suppression (BS) pattern, which is commonly observed during newborn seizure. Such selective artifact detection is proven to be more sensitive to artifacts and specific to bursts, compared to the existing artifact detection approaches applied on the complete background EEG. Several time domain, frequency domain, statistical features, and features generated by wavelet decomposition are analyzed to model the proposed bi-classification between burst and artifact segments. A feature selection method is also applied to select the feature subset producing highest classification accuracy. The suggested feature based classification method is executed using our recorded neonatal EEG dataset, consisting of burst and artifact segments. We obtain 78% sensitivity and 72% specificity as the accuracy measures. The accuracy obtained using the proposed method is found to be about 20% higher than that of the reference approaches. Joint use of the proposed method with our previous work on burst detection outperforms reference methods on simultaneous burst and artifact detection. As the proposed method supports detection of a wide range of artifact patterns, it can be improved to incorporate the detection of artifacts within other seizure patterns and background EEG information as well.

First, the WT is used to extract useful features when certain scales cover abnormal components of the EEG. Second, the ELM algorithm is used to train a single hidden layer of feedforward neural network (SLFN) features. Finally, the SLFN is tested with interictal and ictal EEGs. The experiments demonstrated that the proposed approach achieved a satisfactory classification rate of 99.25% for interictal and ictal EEGs.

Recordings were obtained using a novel implantable device wirelessly linked to an external, portable real-time processing unit. We demonstrate previously uncharacterized intracranial seizure onset patterns in these animals that are strikingly similar in appearance to human partial onset epilepsy. We propose: (1) canine epilepsy as an appropriate model for testing human antiepileptic devices and new approaches to epilepsy surgery, and (2) this new technology as a versatile platform for evaluating seizures and response to therapy in the natural, ambulatory setting.

Methods: 30 individuals with spinal cord injury and chronic pain were given an EEG and administered measures of pain before and after five procedures (hypnosis, meditation, transcranial direct current stimulation [tDCS], neurofeedback, and a control sham tDCS procedure). Results: Each procedure was associated with a different pattern of changes in brain activity, and all active procedures were significantly different from the control procedure in at least three bandwidths. Very weak and mostly non-significant associations were found between changes in EEG-assessed brain activity and pain. Conclusions: Different non-pharmacological pain treatments have distinctive effects on brain oscillation patterns. However, changes in EEG-assessed brain oscillations are not significantly associated with changes in pain, and therefore such changes do not appear useful for explaining the benefits of these treatments. Significance: The results provide new findings regarding the unique effects of four non-pharmacological treatments on pain and brain activity.

These tools include machine learning techniques and information theory. They are currently used both in basic neuroscience and challenging applications such as brain computer interfaces. We review here how these methods have been used at the Laboratoire d'Electroencephalographie Cl de Neurophysiologie Appliquee (LENA) to develop a general tool for the real time analysis of functional brain signals.

Seizure prediction using EEG spatiotemporal correlation structure	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Epilepsy; Seizure prediction; Multivariate features; Electroencephalogram; Correlation structure; Machine learning; Eigenvalues; Principal components; Support vector machines	FREQUENCY FLOW; DYNAMICS; SYNCHRONIZATION	A seizure prediction algorithm is proposed that combines novel multivariate EEG features with patient-specific machine learning. The algorithm computes the eigenspectra of space-delay correlation and covariance matrices from 15-s blocks of EEG data at multiple delay scales. The principal components of these features are used to classify the patient's preictal or interictal state. This is done using a support vector machine (SVM), whose outputs are averaged using a running 15-minute window to obtain a final prediction score. The algorithm was tested on 19 of 21 patients in the Freiburg EEG data set who had three or more seizures, predicting 71 of 83 seizures, with 15 false predictions and 13.8 h in seizure warning during 448.3 h of interictal data. The proposed algorithm scales with the number of available EEG signals by discovering the variations in correlation structure among any given set of signals that correlate with seizure risk.

The experiments were performed using two EEG headsets: BrainProducts ActiCap and Emotiv EPOC. The Emotiv headset becomes widely used in consumer BCI application allowing for conducting large-scale EEG experiments in the future. Since classification accuracy significantly exceeded the level of random classification during the first three days of the experiment with EPOC headset, a control experiment was performed on the fourth day using ActiCap. The control experiment has shown that utilization of high-quality research equipment can enhance classification accuracy (up to 68% in some subjects) and that the accuracy is independent of the presence of EEG artifacts related to blinking and eye movement. This study also shows that computationally-inexpensive Bayesian classifier based on covariance matrix analysis yields similar classification accuracy in this problem as a more sophisticated Multi-class Common Spatial Patterns (MCSP) classifier.

The proposed system is based on an EEG-based dynamic neuroimaging system, which is capable of monitoring spatiotemporal changes of cortical rhythmic activity at a specific frequency band by conducting real-time cortical source imaging. To verify the implemented system, we performed three test experiments in which we monitored temporal changes in cortical functional connectivity patterns in various frequency bands during structural face processing, finger movements, and working memory task. We also traced the changes in the number of connections between all possible pairs of ROIs whose correlations exceeded a predetermined threshold. The quantitative analysis results were consistent with those of previous off-line studies, thereby demonstrating the possibility of imaging cortical functional connectivity in real-time. We expect our system to be applicable to various potential applications, including real-time diagnosis of psychiatric diseases and EEG neurofeedback.

This paper thus compares performances of different technologies when predicting targets of human reaching motions: electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography, camera-based eye tracking, electromyography (EMG), hand position, and the user's preferences. Supervised machine learning is used to make predictions at different points in time (before and during limb motion) with each individual sensing modality. Different modalities are then combined using an algorithm that takes into account the different times at which modalities provide useful information. Results show that EEG can make predictions before limb motion onset, but requires subject-specific training and exhibits decreased performance as the number of possible targets increases. EMG and hand position give high accuracy, but only once the motion has begun. Eye tracking is robust and exhibits high accuracy at the very onset of limb motion. Several advantages of combining different modalities are also shown, including advantages of combining measurements with contextual data. Finally, some recommendations are given for sensing modalities with regard to different criteria and applications. The information could aid human-computer interaction designers in selecting and evaluating appropriate equipment for their applications.

This paper proposes a novel sparse common spatial pattern (SCSP) algorithm for EEG channel selection. The proposed SCSP algorithm is formulated as an optimization problem to select the least number of channels within a constraint of classification accuracy. As such, the proposed approach can be customized to yield the best classification accuracy by removing the noisy and irrelevant channels, or retain the least number of channels without compromising the classification accuracy obtained by using all the channels. The proposed SCSP algorithm is evaluated using two motor imagery datasets, one with a moderate number of channels and another with a large number of channels. In both datasets, the proposed SCSP channel selection significantly reduced the number of channels, and outperformed existing channel selection methods based on Fisher criterion, mutual information, support vector machine, common spatial pattern, and regularized common spatial pattern in classification accuracy. The proposed SCSP algorithm also yielded an average improvement of 10% in classification accuracy compared to the use of three channels (C3, C4, and Cz).

Here, we take advantage of this rich information at a single-trial level to decode stimulus-related signals in two event-related potential (ERP) studies. Our method models the statistical distribution of the voltage topographies with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), which reduces the dataset to a number of representative voltage topographies. The degree of presence of these topographies across trials at specific latencies is then used to classify experimental conditions. We tested the algorithm using a cross-validation procedure in two independent EEG datasets. In the first ERP study, we classified left- versus right-hemifield checkerboard stimuli for upper and lower visual hemifields. In a second ERP study, when functional differences cannot be assumed, we classified initial versus repeated presentations of visual objects. With minimal a priori information, the GMM model provides neurophysiologically interpretable features - vis a vis voltage topographies - as well as dynamic information about brain function. This method can in principle be applied to any ERP dataset testing the functional relevance of specific time periods for stimulus processing, the predictability of subject's behavior and cognitive states, and the discrimination between healthy and clinical populations.

Although the CSP usually provides good discriminant features for classification, it is also known to be sensitive to overfitting and noise. This study introduces a shrinkage technique to regularize estimation of the covariance matrices in the CSP and hence a novel shrinkage CSP (SCSP) method, which could effectively alleviate the effects of small training sample size and unbalanced data on classification. The proposed SCSP is validated on feature extraction of P300 that has been widely adopted for BCI development. Classification accuracies are evaluated by using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with experimental EEG data from seven subjects. The results indicate that the proposed SCSP extracts more effective features that yield higher classification accuracy than that by the traditional CSP.

Adaptive Fuzzy Inference Neural Network System for EEG and Stabilometry Signals Classification	NEXT GENERATION DATA TECHNOLOGIES FOR COLLECTIVE COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Article; Book Chapter							ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY; IDENTIFICATION	The focus of this chapter is to study feature extraction and pattern classification methods from two medical areas. Stabilometry and Electroencephalography (EEG). Stabilometry is the branch of medicine responsible for examining balance in human beings. Balance and dizziness disorders are probably two of the most common illnesses that physicians have to deal with. In Stabilometry, the key nuggets of information in a time series signal are concentrated within definite time periods are known as events. In this chapter, two feature extraction schemes have been developed to identify and characterise the events in Stabilometry and EEG signals. Based on these extracted features, an Adaptive Fuzzy Inference Neural network has been applied for classification of Stabilometry and EEG signals. The model constructs its initial rules by a hybrid supervised/unsupervised clustering scheme while its final fuzzy rule base is optimised through competitive learning. A two-stage learning methodology is applied to this Neuro-Fuzzy structure, by incorporating gradient descent and recursive least squares estimations. The proposed modelling scheme is characterised by its high performance accuracy, high training speed and provides an efficient solution to the "curse of dimensionality'. problem inherited in traditional neuro-fuzzy schemes. In order to classify Stabilometric time series, a set of balance-related features have been extracted according to the expert's criteria. The proposed Stabilometric medical diagnostic system is based on a method for generating reference models from a set of time series. The experimental results validated the proposed methodology.

The classifiers are designed to distinguish EEG patterns corresponding to performance of several mental tasks. The first one is the basic Bayesian classifier (BC) which exploits only interchannel covariance matrices corresponding to different mental tasks. The second classifier is also based on Bayesian approach but it takes into account EEG frequency structure by exploiting interchannel covariance matrices estimated separately for several frequency bands (Multiband Bayesian Classifier, MBBC). The third one is based on the method of Multiclass Common Spatial Patterns (MSCP) exploiting only interchannel covariance matrices as BC. The fourth one is based on the Common Tensor Discriminant Analysis (CTDA), which is a generalization of MCSP, taking EEG frequency structure into account. The MBBC and CTDA classifiers are shown to perform significantly better than the two other methods. Computational complexity of the four methods is estimated. It is shown that for all classifiers the increase in the classifying quality is always accompanied by a significant increase of computational complexity.

The learning procedure involves the extraction of a large number of candidate features from EEG data, from which a very small subset of most statistically relevant features is selected for further processing. A statistical prediction model based on mixture of factor analysis (MFA) model is constructed from a training set that classifies the respective subject into responder and non-responder classes. A leave-2-out (L2O) cross-validation procedure is used to evaluate the prediction performance. This pilot study involves 27 subjects who received either left high-frequency (HF) active rTMS therapy or simultaneous left HF and right low-frequency active rTMS therapy. Our results indicate that it is possible to predict rTMS treatment efficacy of either treatment modality with a specificity of 83% and a sensitivity of 78%, for a combined accuracy of 80%.

For the first time, there will be sufficient data to support the application of state of the art machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we present pilot results of experiments in which we attempted to predict some basic attributes of an EEG from the raw EEG data using a pilot database of 100 EEGs. Standard machine learning approaches are shown to be capable of predicting commonly occurring events from simple features with high accuracy on closed-loop testing, and can deliver error rates slightly below 50% on a 12-way open set classification problem.

In order to ensure traffic safety, various methods based on electroencephalogram (EEG) are proposed. But most of them, either regression or classification, are focused on the relationship between feature space and observation values, so the changing patterns of features are ignored or discarded. In this paper, we propose a new fatigue classification method by using parallel hidden-Markov-model and pattern classifier combination techniques, where each model represents a particular fatigue-high-related feature. In the experiment, subjects are asked to accomplish some simple tasks, and both their fatigue states and their EEG signals are recorded simultaneously. Experimental results indicate that the mean error rate obtained by using our new method are 11.15% for classifying 3 states and 16.91% for classifying 4 states, respectively, while the existing approach can only reach 16.45% and 23.55% under the same condition.

We consider the primary neurophysiologic phenomenon of motor imagery, termed event-related desynchronization, and formulate the learning task for feature extraction as maximizing the mutual information between the spatio-spectral filtering parameters and the class labels. After introducing a nonparametric estimate of mutual information, a gradient-based learning algorithm is devised to efficiently optimize the spatial filters in conjunction with a band-pass filter. The proposed method is compared with two existing methods on real data: a BCI Competition IV dataset as well as our data collected from seven human subjects. The results indicate the superior performance of the method for motor imagery classification, as it produced higher classification accuracy with statistical significance (>= 95% confidence level) in most cases.

Systematic approach to EEG review in epilepsy	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR EPILEPTOLOGIE			German	Review						Brain waves; Seizures; Hyperventilation; Sleep; Sleep deprivation		Although EEG is a specific method for the diagnosis of epilepsy, the borders between normal and abnormal patterns are somewhat imprecise, which makes interpretation difficult and leads to high interrater variability. A systematic approach to EEG reading and interpretation is, therefore, mandatory. A clinically oriented EEG classification of typical EEG patterns in epilepsy is discussed in this review. Hereby, the importance of the diagnostic clues are emphasized. Activation methods to increase the amount of information available from the EEG, especially concerning epileptiform discharges (IED), are presented. Typical ictal and interictal EEG patterns are associated with the corresponding epilepsy syndromes and the results are illustrated with respect to epilepsy surgery options.

This paper presents a new seizure detection method for multi-channel long-term EEG. The fractal intercept derived from fractal geometry is extracted as a novel nonlinear feature of EEG signals, and the relative fluctuation index is calculated as a linear feature. The feature vector, consisting of the two EEG descriptors, is fed into a single-layer neural network for classification. Extreme learning machine ( ELM) algorithm is adopted to train the neural network. Finally, post-processing including smoothing, channel fusion, and collar technique is employed to obtain more accurate and stable results. Both the segment-based and event-based assessments are used for the performance evaluation of this method on the 21-patient Freiburg dataset. The segment-based sensitivity of 91.72% and specificity of 94.89% were achieved. For the event-based assessment, this method yielded a sensitivity of 93.85% with a false detection rate of 0.35/h.

The large screen refers to a 40-inch display used in the experiment. Electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded from the scalp while subjects played video games. A total of 14 male subjects participated in this study. EEG data was recorded for five minutes while the subjects did not play any game and this was served as baseline. Then, while video game play, EEG was recorded for 20 minutes. Analysis was made based on comparison between activation EEG data during game play and the baseline. EEG data was acquired using 19-channel EEG machine. The data was pre-processed to remove artifacts like eye blinking, eye movement and drowsiness. We used three EEG measures: absolute power, coherence and phase lag to analyse further analysed the data. The data were divided into four frequency bands. In general, beta band is associated with learning and making responses. In beta band (12-25 Hz), it was found that the absolute power was higher in occipital, parietal frontal and motor regions while playing video game as compared to sitting idly. For coherence, it was seen that the above mentioned regions were highly coherent in beta indicating connectivity between the regions. Phase lag indicated faster communication between the occipital, parietal, frontal and motor regions of the brain.	[Malik, Aamir Saeed; Osman, Duaa Amin; Pauzi, Ahmad Alif; Khairuddin, R. N.

The algorithm provides selection of patients with their further classification into main and control groups based on the already existing database of EEG indicators; requests to it; generation of mono-indicator candidates for EEG-patterns on the basis of a 4-dipole table for selecting and verifying sensitive and specific EEG patterns and outlining the best ones. Our material included 368 patients with basal-diencephalic tumors. Algorithmic methods revealed new EEG patterns in patients with different anatomical and topographical variants of neuroepithelial tumors in the Ill ventricle. We think it reasonable to use the revealed syndromes to improve diagnosis and identify pathophysiological basis of clinical syndromes.	[Voronina, I. A.; Voronov, V. G.; Shchekutiev, G.

To classify these EEG patterns, we propose an algorithm that specifies the learning area for SOM based on sub-attribute information (SOMSA) related to the individual differences of EEG data. The individual differences are quantified by analysing human personality because we believe that an individual's personality is responsible for individual differences. In the preprocessing phase, we extract the EEG feature vectors by calculating the time average in each of three frequency bands: 0, alpha and beta. The personality is analysed through ego analysis based on psychological testing. The device for recording EEG is a band-type device with a small number of electrodes. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conducted experiments using real EEG data. Our experimental results show that the accuracy rate of the EEG pattern classification using SOMSA is significantly improved compared with that using standard SOM.

This framework involves the concept of Riemannian geometry in the manifold of covariance matrices. The main idea is to use spatial covariance matrices as EEG signal descriptors and to rely on Riemannian geometry to directly classify these matrices using the topology of the manifold of symmetric and positive definite (SPD) matrices. This framework allows to extract the spatial information contained in EEG signals without using spatial filtering. Two methods are proposed and compared with a reference method [multiclass Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)] on the multiclass dataset IIa from the BCI Competition IV. The first method, named minimum distance to Riemannian mean (MDRM), is an implementation of the minimum distance to mean (MDM) classification algorithm using Riemannian distance and Riemannian mean. This simple method shows comparable results with the reference method. The second method, named tangent space LDA (TSLDA), maps the covariance matrices onto the Riemannian tangent space where matrices can be vectorized and treated as Euclidean objects. Then, a variable selection procedure is applied in order to decrease dimensionality and a classification by LDA is performed. This latter method outperforms the reference method increasing the mean classification accuracy from 65.1% to 70.2%.

Traditional approaches to BCIs require the user to train for weeks or even months to learn to control the BCI. In contrast, BCIs based on machine learning only require a calibration session of less than an hour before the system can be used, since the machine adapts to the user's existing brain signals. However, this calibration session has to be repeated before each use of the BCI due to inter-session variability, which makes using a BCI still a time-consuming and an error-prone enterprise. In this work, we present a second-order baselining procedure that reduces these variations, and enables the creation of a BCI that can be applied to new subjects without such a calibration session. The method was validated with a motor-imagery classification task performed by 109 subjects. Results showed that our subject-independent BCI without calibration performs as well as the popular common spatial patterns (CSP)-based BCI that does use a calibration session.

Spatial characteristics of EEG have been used to distinguish left from right hand motor imagery and motor action. We used independent component analysis (ICA) of EEG to distinguish right knee action from right ankle action. We recorded 264-channel EEG while 5 subjects performed a variety of knee and ankle exercises. An adaptive mixture independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm generated two distinct mixture models from a merged set of EEG signals (including both knee and ankle actions) without prior knowledge of the underlying exercise. The ICA mixture models parsed EEG signals into maximally independent component (IC) processes representing electrocortical sources, muscle sources, and artifacts. We calculated a spatially fixed equivalent current dipole for each IC using an inverse modeling approach. The fit of the models to the single trial EEG signals distinguished knee exercises from ankle exercise with 90% accuracy. For 3 of 5 subjects, accuracy was 100%. Electrocortical current dipole locations revealed significant differences in the knee and ankle mixture models that were consistent with the somatotopy of the tasks. These data demonstrate that EEG mixture models can distinguish motor tasks that have different somatotopic arrangements, even within the same brain hemisphere.

Methods: A dataset of 16 polysomnographic recordings from healthy subjects was employed, and the EEG traces underwent first an automatic isolation of NREM sleep portions by means of an Artificial Neural Network and then a segmentation process based on the Spectral Error Measure. The information content of the descriptors was evaluated by means of ROC curves and compared with that of descriptors obtained without the use of segmentation. Finally, the descriptors were used to train a discriminant function for the automatic classification of CAP phases A. Results: A significant improvement with respect to previous scoring methods in terms of both information content carried by the descriptors and accuracy of the classification was obtained. Conclusions: EEG segmentation proves to be a useful step in the computation of descriptors for CAP scoring. Significance: This study provides a complete method for CAP analysis, which is entirely automatic and allows the recognition of A phases with a high accuracy thanks to EEG segmentation.

Keeping a minimal number of channels (electrodes) is essential for developing portable BCIs. Unlike existing methods choosing channels without optimization of time segment for classification, this work proposes a novel subject-specific channel selection method based on a criterion derived from Fisher's discriminant analysis to realize the parametrization of both time segment and channel positions. The experimental results show that the method can efficiently reduce the number of channels (from 118 channels to no more than 11), and shorten the training time, without a significant decrease of classification accuracy on a standard dataset.

By the application of advanced signal processing tools, statistics and machine learning, this BCI system offers: 1) asynchronous mode of operation, 2) automatic selection of user-dependent parameters based on an initial calibration, 3) incremental update of the classifier parameters from feedback data. The signal classification uses spatially filtered signals and is based on spectral power estimation computed in individualized frequency bands, which are automatically identified by a specially tailored AR-based model. Relevant features are chosen by a criterion based on Mutual Information. Final recognition of motor imagery is effectuated by a multinomial logistic regression classifier. This BCI system was evaluated in two studies. In the first study, five participants trained the ability to imagine movements of the right hand, left hand and feet in response to visual cues. The accuracy of the classifier was evaluated across four training sessions with feedback. The second study assessed the information transfer rate (ITR) of the BCI in an asynchronous application. The subjects' task was to navigate a cursor along a computer rendered 2-D maze. A peak information transfer rate of 8.0 bit/min was achieved. Five subjects performed with a mean ITR of 4.5 bit/min and an accuracy of 74.84%. These results demonstrate that the use of automated interfaces to reduce complexity for the intended operator (outside the laboratory) is indeed possible. The signal processing and classifier source code embedded in BCI2000 is available from https://www.brain-project.org/downloads.html.

J	Wang, HX				Wang, Haixian			Multiclass Filters by a Weighted Pairwise Criterion for EEG Single-Trial Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bayesian classification error; brain-computer interfaces (BCI); common spatial patterns (CSP); multiclass filters; weighted pairwise criterion (WPC)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERNS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; MOVEMENT; REDUCTION	The filtering technique for dimensionality reduction of multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, modeled using common spatial patterns and its variants, is commonly used in two-class brain-computer interfaces (BCI). For a multiclass problem, the optimization of certain separability criteria in the output space is not directly related to the classification error of EEG single-trial segments. In this paper, we derive a new discriminant criterion, termed weighted pairwise criterion (WPC), for optimizing multiclass filters by minimizing the upper bound of the Bayesian error that is intentionally formulated for classifying EEG single-trial segments. The WPC approach pays more attention to close class pairs that are more likely to be misclassified than far away class pairs that are already well separated. Moreover, we extend WPC by integrating temporal information of EEG series. Computationally, we employ the rank-one update and power iteration technique to optimize the proposed discriminant criterion. The experiments of multiclass classification on the datasets of BCI competitions demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

By identifying neural features underlying movement parameters, a detailed and well defined control command set can be provided to the BCI output device. A continuous control to the output device is better suited for practical BCI systems, and can be achieved by continuous reconstruction of movement trajectory than discrete brain activity classifications. In this study, we attempt to reconstruct/estimate various parameters of hand movement trajectory from multi channel EEG recordings. The data for analysis is collected by performing an experiment that involved centre-out right hand movement tasks in four different directions at two different speeds in random order. Multiple linear regression (MLR) strategy that fits the recorded movement parameters to a set of spatial, spectral and temporal localized neural data set is adopted. We propose a method to define the predictor set for MLR, using wavelet analysis, to decompose the signal into various subbands. The correlation between recorded and estimated parameters are calculated and an average correlation coefficient of (0.56 +/- 0.16) is obtained over estimating six movement parameters. The promising results achieved using the proposed algorithm, which are better than that of the existing algorithms, indicate the applicability of EEG for continuous motor control.

It is significant to use optimal classification algorithm and fewer features to implement a fast and accurate brain computer interface system. In this paper, we evaluate the performances of five classical classifiers in different aspects including classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Kappa and computational time in low-dimensional feature vectors extracted from EEG signals. For our experiments we used BCI Competition 2003 Data Set III and Data Set Ia. Classifiers were compared on 61 different datasets which were created with a combination of extracted features. When classifiers were ranked based on the average values of performance metrics, we conclude that the NB and the SVM classifiers are shown to be good candidates for pattern classification for low dimensional feature vectors. On the other hand, it can obviously mention that decision tree classifier provides the worst performance. We believe that this paper has a significant contribution in the field of classifier for brain computer interface applications.

The performance of CSP highly depends on the selection of frequency band in the preprocess. However, the most discriminative frequency band features varies slightly with subjects and mental tasks. In order to provide high resolution in frequency domain, we propose an common spatial frequency patterns method to learn most discriminative spatial and frequency filters simultaneously for specific mental task. The results on EEG data during motor imagery (MI) tasks demonstrate the good performance of our method with decreased number of EEG channels.

To be usable by the target group, i.e. minimally conscious individuals, such a brain-computer interface (BCI) has to be very simple and robust. This leads to the concept of a single-switch BCI (ssBCI). With an ssBCI it is possible to reliably detect one certain, individually trained, brain pattern of the individual, and use it to control all kinds of applications using yes/no responses. A total of 10 healthy volunteers (20-27 years) participated in an initial cue-based session with a motor imagery (MI) task after brisk passive feet/hand movement. Four of them reached MI classification accuracies above 70% and, thus, fulfilled the inclusion criterion for participation in the 2nd session. In the 2nd session, MI was used to communicate yes/no answers to a series of questions in an auditory scanning mode. Two of the three participants of the 2nd session were able to reliably communicate their intent with 90% or above correct and 0% false responses. This work showed, for the 1st time, the use of a ssBCI based on passive and imagined movements for communication in auditory scanning mode.

Decoding Intra-Limb and Inter-Limb Kinematics During Treadmill Walking From Scalp Electroencephalographic (EEG) Signals	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Biological system modeling; brain-computer interfaces (BMIs); decoding; neural prosthesis	BRAIN ACTIVATION; GAIT; PHASE; PARAMETERS; MOVEMENTS; EXERCISE; SPEED; TIME	Brain-machine interface (BMI) research has largely been focused on the upper limb. Although restoration of gait function has been a long-standing focus of rehabilitation research, surprisingly very little has been done to decode the cortical neural networks involved in the guidance and control of bipedal locomotion. A notable exception is the work by Nicolelis' group at Duke University that decoded gait kinematics from chronic recordings from ensembles of neurons in primary sensorimotor areas in rhesus monkeys. Recently, we showed that gait kinematics from the ankle, knee, and hip joints during human treadmill walking can be inferred from the electroencephalogram (EEG) with decoding accuracies comparable to those using intracortical recordings. Here we show that both intra- and inter-limb kinematics from human treadmill walking can be achieved with high accuracy from as few as 12 electrodes using scalp EEG. Interestingly, forward and backward predictors from EEG signals lagging or leading the kinematics, respectively, showed different spatial distributions suggesting distinct neural networks for feedforward and feedback control of gait. Of interest is that average decoding accuracy across subjects and decoding modes was similar to 0.68 +/- 0.08, supporting the feasibility of EEG-based BMI systems for restoration of walking in patients with paralysis.

Emotional states usually affect one's brain activity, so use of such emotional states can enhance BCI performance. Emotional data may implicitly have specific informative patterns depending on stimuli such as facial expression, objects, or scenery. In this work, we analyzed 28 emotional datasets and focused particularly on the effect of the perceptual complexity of stimuli. To classify valence (emotional) states and perceptual complexity, we used multidimensional features consisting of the temporal, spatial, and spectral domains. Among them, significantly informative features were extracted by multivariate and univariate analyses. We found that, although the multivariate feature extraction performed valence classification comparable to the univariate one, it was notably more accurate in the classification of perceptual complexity.

Math. Organ. Theory 16(3):217-219, 2010; 17(3):225-228, 2011) in that it includes articles based on the award winning conference papers of the, here, 2011 BRiMS Annual Conference. These articles were reviewed by the editors, extended to journal article length, and then peer-reviewed and revised before being accepted. The articles include a new way to evaluate designs of interfaces for safety critical systems (Bolton in Comput. Math. Organ. Theory, 2012), an article that extends our understanding of how to model situation awareness (SA) in a cognitive architecture (Rodgers et al. in Comput. Math. Organ. Theory, 2012), an article that presents electroencephalography (EEG) data used to derive dynamic neurophysiologic models of engagement in teamwork (Stevens et al. in Comput. Math. Organ. Theory, 2012), and an article that demonstrates using machine learning to generate models and an example application of that tool (Best in Comput. Math. Organ. Theory, 2012). After presenting a brief summary of each paper we will see some recurrent themes of task analysis, team and individual models, spatial reasoning, usability issues, and particularly that they are models that interact with each other or systems.

Up to now, various signals are studied for vigilance analysis. Among them, electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most commonly used signal. In this paper, extreme learning machine (ELM) and its modifications with L-1 norm and L-2 norm penalties are adopted for EEG-based vigilance estimation. A comparative study on system performance is conducted among ordinary ELM, its modifications, and support vector machines (SVMs). Experimental results show that, compared with SVMs, the ordinary ELM and its modifications can all dramatically speed up the training process while still achieving similar or better vigilance estimation accuracy. In addition, the following three observations have been made from the experiment results: (a) the ordinary ELM and the ELM with L-1 norm penalty (LARS-ELM) are sensitive on the number of hidden nodes; (b) the ELM with L-2 norm penalty (regularized-ELM) and the ELMs with both L-1 norm and L-2 norm penalties (LARS-EN-ELM, TROP-ELM) are stable and insensitive on the number of hidden nodes; and (c) regularized-ELM has a much faster training speed, while LARS-EN-ELM can achieve better vigilance estimation accuracy.

While pre-stimulus activity in the parieto-occipital area has been exhaustively investigated with congruent results, less is known about the sensorimotor areas, for which studies reported inconsistent findings. In this work, the topic is addressed in a brain-computer interface (BCI) setting based on modulations of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR). The goal is to assess whether and how pre-stimulus SMR activity influences the successive task execution quality and consequently the classification performance. Grand average data of 23 participants performing right and left hand motor imagery were analyzed. Trials were separated into two groups depending on the SMR amplitude in the 1000 ms interval preceding the cue, and classification by common spatial patterns (CSPs) preprocessing and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was carried out in the post-stimulus time interval, i.e., during the task execution. The correlation between trial group and classification performance was assessed by an analysis of variance. As a result of this analysis, trials with higher SMR amplitude in the 1000 ms interval preceding the cue yielded significantly better classification performance than trials with lower amplitude. A further investigation of brain activity patterns revealed that this increase in accuracy is mainly due to the persistence of a higher SMR amplitude over the ipsilateral hemisphere. Our findings support the idea that exploiting information about the ongoing SMR might be the key to boosting performance in future SMR-BCI experiments and motor related tasks in general.

Category-Specific Neural Oscillations Predict Recall Organization During Memory Search	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						category clustering; episodic memory; free recall; neural integration; pattern classification	PERCEPTUAL DECISION-MAKING; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; TEMPORAL CONTEXT; FMRI DATA; EEG; REPRESENTATION; HUMANS	Retrieved-context models of human memory propose that as material is studied, retrieval cues are constructed that allow one to target particular aspects of past experience. We examined the neural predictions of these models by using electrocorticographic/ depth recordings and scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to characterize category-specific oscillatory activity, while participants studied and recalled items from distinct, neurally discriminable categories. During study, these category-specific patterns predict whether a studied item will be recalled. In the scalp EEG experiment, category-specific activity during study also predicts whether a given item will be recalled adjacent to other same-category items, consistent with the proposal that a category-specific retrieval cue is used to guide memory search. Retrieved-context models suggest that integrative neural circuitry is involved in the construction and maintenance of the retrieval cue. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observe category-specific patterns that rise in strength as multiple same-category items are studied sequentially, and find that individual differences in this category-specific neural integration during study predict the degree to which a participant will use category information to organize memory search. Finally, we track the deployment of this retrieval cue during memory search: Category-specific patterns are stronger when participants organize their responses according to the category of the studied material.

J	Nussbaum, PA; Hargraves, RH				Nussbaum, Paul Alton; Hargraves, Rosalyn Hobson			,X Pilot Study: The Use of Electroencephalogram to Measure Attentiveness towards Short Training Videos	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; EEG; Signal Analysis; Machine Learning; Attentiveness; Training; Videos	EEG; ALERTNESS	Universities, schools, and training centers are seeking to improve their computer-based [3] and distance learning classes through the addition of short training videos, often referred to as podcasts [4]. As distance learning and computer based training become more popular, it is of great interest to measure if students are attentive to recorded lessons and short training videos. The proposed research presents a novel approach to this issue. Signal processing of electroencephalogram (EEG) has proven useful in measuring attentiveness in a variety of applications such as vehicle operation and listening to sonar [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]. Additionally, studies have shown that EEG data can be correlated to the ability of participants to remember television commercials days after they have seen them [16]. Electrical engineering presents a possible solution with recent advances in the use of biometric signal analysis for the detection of affective (emotional) response [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27]. Despite the wealth of literature on the use of EEG to determine attentiveness in a variety of applications, the use of EEG for the detection of attentiveness towards short training videos has not been studied, nor is there a great deal of consistency with regard to specific methods that would imply a single method for this new application. Indeed, there is great variety in EEG signal processing and machine learning methods described in the literature cited above and in other literature [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34]. This paper presents a novel method which uses EEG as an input to an automated system that measures a participant's attentiveness while watching a short training video. This paper provides the results of a pilot study, including a structured comparison of signal processing and machine learning methods to find optimal solutions which can be extended to other applications.

An efficacy of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) based on the proposed classifier is evaluated. Bayesian classifier is shown to be competitive with the MCSP (Multiclass Common Spatial Patterns) classifier known from the literature as one of the efficient variant for BCI implementation. The influence of eye movement and blinking artifacts on the BCI performance is investigated. It is shown that the presence of such artifacts does not affect the classification accuracy.	[Bobrov, P.

However, due to inter-and intra-subject variations in EEG signal, intermittent training/calibration is often unavoidable. In this paper, we present an online semi-supervised P300 BCI speller system. After a short initial training (around or less than 1 min in our experiments), the system is switched to a mode where the user can input characters through selective attention. In this mode, a self-training least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier is gradually enhanced in back end with the unlabeled EEG data collected online after every character input. In this way, the classifier is gradually enhanced. Even though the user may experience some errors in input at the beginning due to the small initial training dataset, the accuracy approaches that of fully supervised method in a few minutes. The algorithm based on LS-SVM and its sequential update has low computational complexity; thus, it is suitable for online applications. The effectiveness of the algorithm has been validated through data analysis on BCI Competition III dataset II (P300 speller BCI data). The performance of the online system was evaluated through experimental results on eight healthy subjects, where all of them achieved the spelling accuracy of 85% or above within an average online semi-supervised learning time of around 3 min.

They are commonly classified as periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs), bilateral independent PLEDs or BIPLEDs, generalized epileptiform discharges (GPEDs) and triphasic waves. Stimulus-induced rhythmic, periodic or ictal discharges (SIRPIDs) are peculiar EEG patterns, which may be present as periodic discharges. The aim of this study is to make a review of the periodic EEG patterns, emphasizing the importance of their recognition and clinical significance. The clinical significance of the periodic EEG patterns is uncertain, it is related to a variety of etiologies, and many authors suggest that these patterns are unequivocally epileptogenic in some cases. Their recognition and classification are important to establish an accurate correlation between clinical, neurological, laboratorial and neuroimaging data with the EEG results.

These activities can be decoded by signal processing techniques, however, they are typically influenced by extraneous interference, like muscle movements, eye blinks, eye movements, background noise, etc. Therefore, a preprocessing step to remove artifacts is extremely important. This paper presents an effective artifact removal algorithm, based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Hierarchical Clustering. Our technique utilizes general temporal and spectral features and particular information about target Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) (e.g. the timing of N200 and P300 on inhibition task or the specific electrodes contributing to the ERPs) to separate ERPs and artifact activities. Our method considers templates for desired ERPs to select event-related components for signal reconstruction. In our experimental study, we show that our proposed method can effectively enhance the ERPs for all fifteen subjects in the study, even for those that barely display ERPs in the raw recordings.

However, we do not have a detailed understanding of how the brain represents individual stimuli within a category. Here we used direct human brain recordings and machine-learning algorithms to characterize the distributed patterns that distinguish specific cognitive states. Epilepsy patients with surgically implanted electrodes performed a working-memory task and we used machine-learning algorithms to predict the identity of each viewed stimulus. We found that the brain's representation of stimulus-specific information is distributed across neural activity at multiple frequencies, electrodes, and timepoints. Stimulus-specific neuronal activity was most prominent in the high-gamma (65-128 Hz) and theta/alpha (4-16 Hz) bands, but the properties of these signals differed significantly between individuals and for novel stimuli compared to common ones. Our findings are helpful for understanding the neural basis of memory and developing brain-computer interfaces by showing that the brain distinguishes specific cognitive states by diverse spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal.

CSP and its variants need a pair of covariance matrices of two different tasks, which are obtained as the average over trials. This trial average can affect the accurate estimation of covariance matrices and cause the decrease of classification accuracy in brain machine interfaces (BMIs) due to the non-stationarity of EEG or experimental environments. We focus on the fact that finding CSP is equivalent to joint diagonalization of a pair of covariance matrices, and extend it to joint diagonalization of data tensor at each trial to determine importance of each trial. Numerical experiment of motor imagery (MI) classification supports the proposed algorithm is effective.

We propose a method to find the spatial amplitude patterns of a time-limited waveform across multiple EEG channels. It consists of a single iteration of multichannel matching pursuit where the base waveform is obtained via the Hilbert transform of a time-limited tone. The vector of extracted amplitudes across channels is used for classification, and we analyze the effect of deviation in temporal alignment of the waveform on classification performance. Results for a previously published dataset of 6 subjects show comparable results versus a more complicated criteria-based method.

A hypothesis was tested that similar patterns could be found in the scalp EEG of human subjects during visual stimulation. Signals were continuously recorded from scalp electrodes and band-pass filtered. The Fast Fourier transform provides the phase, which is used to obtain directional phase information relating to cognitive tasks. Spatial patterns of EEG phase modulation were identified and classified with respect to stimulus. The obtained results suggest that the scalp EEG can yield information about the timing of episodically synchronized brain activity in higher cognitive function, so as to support mechanisms of brain-computer interfacing.

Considering a heteroscedastic binary classification setup, this method extracts the spatio-spectral features whose variance is maximized for one brain task and minimized for the other task. Therefore, our method can be considered as a spatio-spectral generalization of the conventional common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm. In comparison to the similar solutions in the literature, such as filter-bank CSP (FBCSP) method, the proposed method benefits from joint processing of both spatial and spectral features, which improves the overall performance of the BCI while reducing its computational cost. Furthermore, our algorithm provides a simple measure that allows for ranking the discriminant power of extracted spatio-spectral features, which is not possible in FBCSP method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms FBCSP for both raw EEG and preprocessed EEG data.

The algorithm is based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that captures spatio-temporal properties of the iEEG at the level of single trials. Continuous intracranial iEEG was acquired during two sessions (one before and one after a night of sleep) in two patients with depth electrodes implanted in several brain areas. They performed a visuomotor sequence (serial reaction time task, SRTT) using the fingers of their non-dominant hand. Our results show that the decoding algorithm correctly classified single iEEG trials from the trained sequence as belonging to either the initial training phase (day 1, before sleep) or a later consolidated phase (day 2, after sleep), whereas it failed to do so for trials belonging to a control condition (pseudo-random sequence). Accurate single-trial classification was achieved by taking advantage of the distributed pattern of neural activity. However, across all the contacts the hippocampus contributed most significantly to the classification accuracy for both patients, and one fronto-striatal contact for one patient. Together, these human intracranial findings demonstrate that a multivariate decoding approach can detect learning-related changes at the level of single-trial iEEG. Because it allows an unbiased identification of brain sites contributing to a behavioral effect (or experimental condition) at the level of single subject, this approach could be usefully applied to assess the neural correlates of other complex cognitive functions in patients implanted with multiple electrodes.

This paper builds a basic framework using classification and an optimization model based on this framework for estimating event-related potentials. Then the SingleTrialEM algorithm is derived by introducing a logistic regression model, which could be obtained by training before SingleTrialEM is used, to instantiate the optimization model. The simulation tests demonstrate that the proposed method is correct and solid. The advantage of this method is verified by the comparison between this method and the Woody filter in simulation tests. Also, the cognitive test results are consistent with the conclusions of cognitive science.

As an emerging technology, brain-computer interface(BCI) can convert electroencephalogram(EEG) to the control signal to try repairing function for patients. So the study of BCI can improve the life quality of the patients with severe neuromuscular damage. This paper introduces the EEG data acquisition system capable of detecting the visual evoked EEG of an answer to "yes/no" question. EEG signal processing includes preprocessing, common spatial pattern (CSP)-based feature extraction algorithm and support vector machine (SVM)-based feature classification method. Finally classification accuracy can achieves 81% in the experimental data of healthy subjects. The experimental results show that the EEG analysis method makes the patients with neuromuscular system damage simply communicate with external world, and provides the basis for study of further BCI.

A standard step in a BCI system is to project the EEG signals to a low-dimensional subspace using Common Spatial Patterns (CSP). However, non-stationarities in the data can negatively affect the performance of CSP, i.e. variation of the signal properties within and across experimental sessions coming from electrode artefacts, alpha or muscular activity, or fatigue may result in suboptimal projection directions. We alleviate this problem by regularizing CSP towards stationary subspaces and show that this especially increases classification accuracy of people who are not able to control a BCI i.e. have more than 30% of error. These users very often show non-stationarities in their EEG signals.

This paper introduces Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) as a step-by-step filter optimization algorithm, and then proposes a generalized type of the CSP which is not limited in a specific optimization constraint. Moreover, it is shown that how this generalization can be extended to a spatio-spectral filter estimation scheme. Then, two specific versions of the generalized CSP are proposed, where a specific target function and optimization constraint are used for estimating the spatial and spectral filters. Unlike the traditional CSP which is not very closely linked to the classification accuracy, the proposed algorithms are able to be more directly aimed at achieving better accuracy and stability. Experimental results obtained from applying the introduced methods on the recorded imagery signals from two datasets, demonstrate considerable improvement in the classification accuracy and stability compared to the standard CSP and other similar methods.

J	Xiao, R; Ding, L				Xiao, Ran; Ding, Lei			Evaluation of EEG Features in Decoding Individual Finger Movements from One Hand	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; CLASSIFICATION; MEG; DISCRIMINATION; SIGNALS; BCI	With the advancements in modern signal processing techniques, the field of brain-computer interface (BCI) is progressing fast towards noninvasiveness. One challenge still impeding these developments is the limited number of features, especially movement-related features, available to generate control signals for noninvasive BCIs. A few recent studies investigated several movement-related features, such as spectral features in electrocorticography (ECoG) data obtained through a spectral principal component analysis (PCA) and direct use of EEG temporal data, and demonstrated the decoding of individual fingers. The present paper evaluated multiple movement-related features under the same task, that is, discriminating individual fingers from one hand using noninvasive EEG. The present results demonstrate the existence of a broadband feature in EEG to discriminate individual fingers, which has only been identified previously in ECoG. It further shows that multiple spectral features obtained from the spectral PCA yield an average decoding accuracy of 45.2%, which is significantly higher than the guess level (P < 0.05) and other features investigated (P < 0.05), including EEG spectral power changes in alpha and beta bands and EEG temporal data. The decoding of individual fingers using noninvasive EEG is promising to improve number of features for control, which can facilitate the development of noninvasive BCI applications with rich complexity.

It is a supervised technique that needs subject specific training data. Due to the non-stationary nature of EEG, EEG signal may exhibit significant inter-and intra-subject variation. Consequently, spatial filters learned from one subject may not perform well for EEG data acquired from another subject performing a same task, or even from the same subject at a different time. Various methods have been developed to improve CSP's multisubject performance by adding regularizing terms into the learning process. Most of these methods include target subjects' training data in the CSP learning, and the trained spatial filters are fixed when applied to classification. In this work, an adaptive CSP method was proposed to classify single trial EEG data from multiple subjects. The method does not require training data from target subjects, and updates spatial filters based on target subjects' data during the classification. Three different methods were proposed to adapt the CSP learning to target subjects. Experimental results on motor imagery data indicate that the proposed method can efficiently integrate target subjects' information into the CSP learning, and provide better discrimination performance (about 20% increase in overall classification accuracy) than the standard CSP method for multisubject BCI.

To properly and efficiently decode brain signals into computer commands the application of machine-learning techniques is required. Evolutionary algorithms have been increasingly applied in different steps of BCI implementations. In this paper we introduce the use of the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) for BCI systems based on motor imagery.

In this paper, feature extraction and classification for P300, a kind of EEG characteristic potential, was conducted. After preprocessing EEG signals, we used autoregressive(AR) model for feature extraction, segmenting the selected EEG channel data and building AR model for each segment respectively. AR model coefficients were estimated by using least square method, and the estimated coefficient sequence constituted the feature vector. We applied support vector machine(SVM) for classification and experimented on real EEG dataset. The experimental results showed the proposed method had a good recognition accuracy, being worth researching in the field of BCI.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most common source of information used to monitor, diagnose and manage neurological disorders related to epilepsy. Large amounts of data are produced by EEG monitoring devices, and analysis by visual inspection of long recordings of EEG in order to find traces of epilepsy is not routinely possible. Therefore, automated detection of epilepsy has been a goal of many researchers for a long time. This paper presents a novel method for automatic epileptic seizure detection. An optimized sample entropy (O-SampEn) algorithm is proposed and combined with extreme learning machine (ELM) to identify the EEG signals regarding the existence of seizure or not. To the knowledge of the authors, there exists no similar work in the literature. A public dataset was utilized for evaluating the proposed method. Results show that the proposed epilepsy detection approach achieves not only high detection accuracy but also a very fast computation speed, which demonstrates its huge potential for the real-time detection of epileptic seizures.

To investigate how noninvasive electroencephalographic (EEG) signals correlate with intended movement directions in the PPC, this study recorded whole-head EEG during a delayed saccade-or-reach task and found direction-related changes in both event-related potentials (ERPs) and the EEG power in the theta and alpha bands in the PPC. Single-trial (left versus right) classification using ERP and EEG spectral features prior to motor execution obtained an average accuracy of 65.4% and 65.6% respectively on 10 subjects. By combining the two types of features, the classification accuracy increased to 69.7%. These results show that ERP and EEG spectral power modulations contribute complementary information to decoding intended movement directions in the PPC. The proposed paradigm might lead to a practical brain-computer interface (BCI) for decoding movement intention of individuals.

Electroencephalograph (EEG) based BCI research aims to decode the various movement related data generated from the motor areas of the brain. One of the issues in BCI research is the presence of redundant data in the features of a given dataset, which not only increases the dimensions but also reduces the accuracy of the classifiers. In this paper, we aim to reduce the redundant features of a dataset to improve the accuracy of classification. For this, we have employed Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) cluster algorithm to reduce the features and have acquired their corresponding accuracy. It is seen that for a reduced features of 200, the highest accuracy of 64.29%. The results in this paper validate our claim.

A machine learning approach using EEG data to predict response to SSRI treatment for major depressive disorder	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Prediction; Machine learning; Mood disorders; Major depressive disorder; EEG; Antidepressants; Personalized medicine; Biomarkers	STAR-ASTERISK-D; ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENT; SYMPTOMATIC RESPONSE; MUTUAL INFORMATION; ERROR ESTIMATION; NEURAL-NETWORK; OUTCOMES; CONNECTIVITY; COHERENCE; HEALTH	Objective: The problem of identifying, in advance, the most effective treatment agent for various psychiatric conditions remains an elusive goal. To address this challenge, we investigate the performance of the proposed machine learning (ML) methodology (based on the pre-treatment electroencephalogram (EEG)) for prediction of response to treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication in subjects suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: A relatively small number of most discriminating features are selected from a large group of candidate features extracted from the subject's pre-treatment EEG, using a machine learning procedure for feature selection. The selected features are fed into a classifier, which was realized as a mixture of factor analysis (MFA) model, whose output is the predicted response in the form of a likelihood value. This likelihood indicates the extent to which the subject belongs to the responder vs. non-responder classes. The overall method was evaluated using a "leave-n-out'' randomized permutation cross-validation procedure. Results: A list of discriminating EEG biomarkers (features) was found. The specificity of the proposed method is 80.9% while sensitivity is 94.9%, for an overall prediction accuracy of 87.9%. There is a 98.76% confidence that the estimated prediction rate is within the interval [75%, 100%]. Conclusions: These results indicate that the proposed ML method holds considerable promise in predicting the efficacy of SSRI antidepressant therapy for MDD, based on a simple and cost-effective pre-treatment EEG. Significance: The proposed approach offers the potential to improve the treatment of major depression and to reduce health care costs. (C) 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

MethodsTwenty-two patients with ring chromosome 14 were enrolled in the study. We examined age at onset, seizure semiology and frequency at onset and at follow-up, drug responsiveness/resistance, and interictal/ictal EEG data. The degree of severity of the epileptic phenotype negatively influences child cognitive development. Key FindingsThe incidence of epilepsy in patients with r(14) syndrome is virtually 100%, characterized by early onset, polymorphic seizures, and drug-resistant seizures. In addition, we ascertained focal secondarily generalized epilepsy, seizure cluster tendency, frequent status epilepticus, and a rather typical epilepsy evolution. EEG abnormalities consisted of slow background activity with pseudoperiodic bursts of generalized slow waves in the early stage, focal frontotemporal or temporoposterior slow waves with multifocal spikes interposed, and unusual rhythmic fast recruiting posterior spikes followed by secondary generalization. The degree of severity of the epileptic phenotype negatively influences child cognitive development. SignificanceThis study provides a more precise definition of seizure types, natural history, and drug responsiveness of r(14) syndrome, a highly epileptogenic chromosomal condition.

However, there exists a large variability in the morphology of seizure and background patterns, both across patients and over time. This has resulted in relatively poor performance from systems which have been tested over large datasets. Here, the benefits of employing a pattern recognition approach are discussed. Such a system may use numerous features paired with nonlinear classifiers. In particular, two types of nonlinear classifiers are contrasted for the task. Additionally, it is shown that the proposed architecture allows for efficient classifier combination which improves the performance of the algorithm. The resulting automated detector is shown to achieve field leading performance. A particular strength of the proposed algorithm is the performance of the algorithm when very low false detections are required, at 0.25 false detections per hour, the system is able to detect 75.4% of the seizure events.

However, we consider that the prediction for refractory status epilepticus (RSE) after SE initial treatment is more significant than long-term prognosis of SE. The objective of this study is to detect some predictive EEG patterns for RSE. Methods: Pooled data derived from two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were prospectively analyzed in adult generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) patients. Results: Etiology, GCSE duration and EEG patterns are three factors which were statistically different between non-RSE and RSE groups. However, when we introduced these factors into multivariable logistic regression model, only EEG pattern was an independent risk factor for. RSE prediction. Comparing with rhythmic fast activities background (RFAB) pattern, there were positive correlations between interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), periodic epileptic discharges/subtle status epilepticus (PEDs/subtle SE) patterns and RSE incidence respectively. Conclusions: There was an increased risk of RSE incidence accompanied with IEDs and PEDs/subtle SE patterns appearance. Clinicians should adjust anti-epileptic strategies with the aid of these EEG patterns in order to reduce RSE incidence. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

CSP is a supervised learning technique depending on only labeled trials. Its generalization performance deteriorates due to overfitting occurred when the number of training trials is small. On the other hand, a large number of unlabeled trials are relatively easy to obtain. In this paper, we contribute a comprehensive learning scheme of CSP (cCSP) that learns on both labeled and unlabeled trials. cCSP regularizes the objective function of CSP by preserving the temporal relationship among samples of unlabeled trials in terms of linear representation. The intrinsically temporal structure is characterized by an l(1) graph. As a result, the temporal correlation information of unlabeled trials is incorporated into CSP, yielding enhanced generalization capacity. Interestingly, the regularizer of cCSP can be interpreted as minimizing a nontask related EEG component, which helps cCSP alleviate nonstationarities. Experiment results of single-trial EEG classification on publicly available EEG datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Optimal channel selection for analysis of EEG-sleep patterns of neonates	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						EEG sleep; Neonates; Brain maturation; Dismaturity; Sleep stage separation; Optimal channel selection; Multivariate analysis	HEALTHY FULL-TERM; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT; AUTOMATED DETECTION; BRAIN-FUNCTION; MATURATION; STATE; SEGMENTATION	This paper extends our previous work on automated detection and classification of neonate EEG sleep stages. In [19] we adapted and integrated a range of computational, mathematical and statistical tools for the analysis of neonatal electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep recordings with the aim of facilitating the assessment of neonatal brain maturation and dismaturity by studying the structure and temporal patterns of their sleep. That work relied on algorithms using a single channel of EEG. The present paper builds on our previous work by incorporating a larger selection of EEG channels that capture both the spatial distribution and temporal patterns of EEG during sleep. Using a multivariate analysis approach, we obtain the "optimal" selection of the EEG channels and characteristics that are most suitable for EEG sleep state separation.

Effect of Movie Clips on Human Brain	2012 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT AND ADVANCED SYSTEMS (ICIAS), VOLS 1-2			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced Systems (ICIAS) and A Conference of World Engineering, Science and Technology Congress (ESTCON)	JUN 12-14, 2012	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA	Univ Teknologi PETRONAS		EEG; movie clips; absolute power; coherence; phase lag		In this paper, we investigated the changes in brain activation with respect to watching movie clips in order to understand its effect on human brain. Electroencephalography (EEG) data was recorded using 24-channel EEG machine while subjects watched the movie clips. 14 male subjects were recruited for this research project. Two conditions were used in collecting EEG data; i) under eyes open condition while subjects looking at a white screen for five minutes and ii) while subjects watched selected movie clips for 20 minutes. Hence, the eyes open condition at resting state was considered as baseline and the brain activation signal due to movie clips was compared with the baseline for analysis. After data acquisition, data were cleaned to remove artifacts like eye blinking, eye movement and drowsiness. Three features were used in this research to analyze the EEG data, i. e., absolute power, coherence and phase lag. Each of the features was analyzed in four frequency bands, i. e., delta, theta, alpha and beta. It was found that the absolute power for beta and alpha bands was higher in occipital, parietal, frontal and motor regions while watching movie clips as compared to baseline. Beta band was associated with learning and making responses. The frontal and the central brain lobes were highly coherent in beta and alpha bands indicating connectivity between the frontal and central regions. Faster communication between the occipital, parietal, frontal and motor areas was also observed in the phase lag analysis.	[Malik, Aamir Saeed; Fawzy, Samar Mohammad; Osman, Duaa Amin; Khairuddin, R.

EEG Signal Classification Using Time-Varying Autoregressive Models and Common Spatial Patterns	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; FILTERS	The performance of EEG signal classification methods based on Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) depends on the operational frequency bands of the events to be discriminated. This problem has been recently addressed by using a sub-band decomposition of the EEG signals through filter banks. Even though this approach has proven effective, the performance still depends on the number of filters that are stacked and the criteria used to determine their cutoff frequencies. Therefore, we propose an alternative approach based on an eigenstructure decomposition of the signals' time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) models. The eigen-based decomposition of the TVAR representation allows for subject-specific estimation of the principal time-varying frequencies, then such principal eigencomponents can be used in the traditional CSP-based classification. A series of simulations show that the proposed classification scheme can achieve high classification rates under realistic conditions, such as low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a reduced number of training experiments, and a reduced number of sensors used in the measurements.

This involves machine learning techniques and feature extraction methods such as applied in brain computer interfaces. In this study, we try to answer the question if features/classification methods which show advantages in healthy participants are also accurate when applied to data of patients with disorders of consciousness. A sample of healthy participants (N = 22), patients in a minimally conscious state (MCS; N = 5), and with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS; N = 9) was examined with a motor imagery task which involved imagery of moving both hands and an instruction to hold both hands firm. We extracted a set of 20 features from the electroencephalogram and used linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbor classification, and support vector machines (SVM) as classification methods. In healthy participants, the best classification accuracies were seen with coherences (mean = .79; range = .53-.94) and power spectra (mean = .69; range =.40-.85). The coherence patterns in healthy participants did not match the expectation of central modulated m-rhythm. Instead, coherence involved mainly frontal regions. In healthy participants, the best classification tool was SVM. Five patients had at least one feature-classifier outcome with p<0.05 (none of which were coherence or power spectra), though none remained significant after false-discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons. The present work suggests the use of coherences in patients with disorders of consciousness because they show high reliability among healthy subjects and patient groups. However, feature extraction and classification is a challenging task in unresponsive patients because there is no ground truth to validate the results.

To identify individual source contribution into electroencephalogram recorded during the training Independent Component Analysis was used. Then those independent components for which the BCI system classification accuracy was at maximum were treated as relevant to performing the motor imagery tasks, since they demonstrated well exposed event related de-synchronization and event related synchronization of the sensorimotor it-rhythm during imagining of command ipsilateral hand movements. To reveal neurophysiological nature of these components we have solved the inverse EEG problem to locate the sources of brain activity causing these components to appear in EEG. The sources were located in hand representation areas of the primary sensorimotor cortex. Their positions practically coincide with the regions of brain activity during the motor imagination obtained in fMRI study. Individual geometry of brain and its covers provided by anatomical MR images was taken into account when localizing the sources.

Here we employed a center-out task paradigm to study the decoding of hand velocity in the EEG recording. We tested the hypothesis using a linear regression model and found a significant correlation between velocity and the low-pass filtered EEG signal (<2 Hz). The low-pass filtered EEG was not only tuned to the direction but also phase-locked to the amplitude of velocity. This suggests an EEG form of the neuronal population vector theory, which is considered to encode limb kinematic information, and provides a new method of BCI implementation.

Pattern- and Network-Based Classification Techniques for Multichannel Medical Data Signals to Improve Brain Diagnosis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG) classification; epilepsy diagnosis; multidimensional time series; optimization; pattern recognition	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES	There is an urgent need for a quick screening process that could help neurologists diagnose and determine whether a patient is epileptic versus simply demonstrating symptoms linked to epilepsy but actually stemming from a different illness. An inaccurate diagnosis could have fatal consequences, particularly in operating rooms and intensive care units. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been traditionally used, as a gold standard, to diagnose patients by evaluating those brain functions thatmight correspond to epilepsy and other brain disorders. This research therefore focuses on developing new classification techniques for multichannel EEG recordings. Two time-series classification techniques, namely, Support Feature Machine (SFM) and Network-Based Support Vector Machine (SVM) (NSVM), are proposed in this paper to predict from EEG readings whether a person is epileptic or nonepileptic. The SFM approach is an optimization model that maximizes classification accuracy by selecting a group of electrodes (features) that has strong class separability based on time-series similarity measures and correctly classifies EEG samples in the training phase. The NSVM approach integrates a new network-based model for multidimensional time-series data with traditional SVMs to exploit both the spatial and temporal characteristics of EEG data. The proposed techniques are tested on two EEG data sets acquired from ten and five patients, respectively. Compared with other commonly used classification techniques such as SVMand decision trees, the proposed SFM and NSVM techniques provide very promising and practical results and require much less time and memory resources than traditional techniques. This study is a necessary application of data mining to advance the diagnosis and treatment of human epilepsy.

In this study, we investigated EEG patterns that were induced by seven different mental tasks (i.e. mental rotation, word association, auditory imagery, mental subtraction, spatial navigation, imagery of familiar faces and motor imagery) and evaluated the binary classification performance. The aim was to provide a broad range of reliable and user-appropriate tasks to make individual optimization of BCI control strategies possible. Nine users participated in four sessions of multi-channel EEG recordings. Mental tasks resulting most frequently in good binary classification performance include mental subtraction, word association, motor imagery and mental rotation. Our results indicate that a combination of 'brain-teasers' - tasks that require problem specific mental work (e.g. mental subtraction, word association) - and dynamic imagery tasks (e.g. motor imagery) result in highly distinguishable brain patterns that lead to an increased performance.

One of the most well-known algorithms to extract the discriminative patterns is Common Spatial Patterns (CSP). It finds an optimal spatial filter considering the spatial distribution of the ERD/ERS patterns. The CSP algorithm, however, does not consider temporal information of the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals even though EEG signals are naturally non-stationary. In order to circumvent the limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel method, Time-Dependent Common Spatial Patterns (TDCSP) to classify multi-class motor imagery tasks. We optimize CSP filters in multiple local time ranges of EEG signals individually based on statistical analysis to effectively reflect changes of discriminative spatial distributions over time. We evaluated the proposed method by experiments on BCI Competition IV dataset 2-a, which resulted in high performance outperforming the previous methods in the literature.

J	Wang, HX				Wang, Haixian			Harmonic Mean of Kullback-Leibler Divergences for Optimizing Multi-Class EEG Spatio-Temporal Filters	NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Common spatial patterns; Kullback-Leibler divergence; Multi-class filters	COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERNS; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION	The common spatial patterns (CSP) is a classical approach to spatial filtering of electroencephalogram (EEG) used in brain-computer interfaces. The local temporal common spatial patterns (LTCSP) method is a temporal generalization of CSP. Both CSP and LTCSP, however, are only suitable for the two-class paradigm. In this paper, we address this limitation under the framework of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We show that CSP is equivalent to maximizing the symmetric KL divergence of two class-conditional probability density functions under the Gaussian assumption. This analysis establishes a probabilistic interpretation for CSP, as well as LTCSP. Based on the KL formulation, we propose a new multi-class extension to optimizing the spatio-temporal filters by maximizing the harmonic mean of all pairs of symmetric KL divergences between the filtered class-conditional densities. Experiments of classification of multiple EEG classes on the data sets of BCI competition show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Due to the diversity of seizure EEG patterns between different individuals, multiple features are necessary for high accuracy since a single feature could hardly encode all types of epileptiform discharges. However, a large feature set inevitably causes the increase of the computational cost. This paper proposes a boosted cascade chain to obtain both high detection performance and high computational efficiency. Sixteen features that are widely used in seizure detection are implemented. Considering the sequential characteristics of EEG signals, the features are extracted on each 1-second segment and its former three segments. Thus, a total of 64 features are used to construct a feature pool. Based on the feature pool, Real Ada Boost is used to select a group of effective features, on which weak classifiers are learned to assemble a strong classifier. The strong classifier is transformed to a cascade classifier by reordering the weak classifiers and learning a threshold for each weak classifier. The cascade classifier still has the similar classification strength to the original strong classifier. More importantly, it is able to reject easy non-seizure samples by the first a few weak classifiers in the cascade, thus high computational efficiency can be obtained. To evaluate our method, 90.6-hour EEG signals from four patients are tested. The experimental results show that our method can achieve an average accuracy of 95.31% and an average detection rate of 91.29% with the false positive rate of 4.68%. On average, only about 4 features are used. Compared with support vector machine (SVM), our method is much more efficient with the similar detection performance.

Classification of visual stimuli with different spatial patterns for single-frequency, multi-class SSVEP BCI	ELECTRONICS LETTERS			English	Article								A new approach for a multi-class steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is proposed. It was demonstrated through preliminary experiments that spatial patterns of SSVEP responses recorded using high-density electroencephalography while presenting pattern reversal checkerboard stimuli with different spatial patterns can be classified with fairly high accuracy. The average classification accuracies in two of the three subjects were 91.7% (12-class) and 93.3% (15-class), suggesting that the proposed visual stimulation can potentially be used for multi-class SSVEP-based BCI.

J	Lederman, D; Tabrikian, J				Lederman, Dror; Tabrikian, Joseph			Classification of multichannel EEG patterns using parallel hidden Markov models	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Classification; Event-related potentials; Parallel hidden Markov model	BCI COMPETITION 2003; BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; COMMUNICATION; POTENTIALS	In this paper, a parallel hidden-Markov-model (PHMM)-based approach is proposed for the problem of multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns classification. The approach is based on multi-channel representation of the EEG signals using a parallel combination of HMMs, where each model represents a particular channel. The performance of the proposed algorithm is studied using an artificial EEG database, and two real EEG databases: a database of two classes of EEGs elicited during a task of imagery of hand upward and downward movements of a computer screen cursor (db Ia), and a database of two classes of sensorimotor EEGs elicited during a feedback-regulated left-right motor imagery task (db III). The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other commonly used methods with classification rate improvement of 2 and 10% for db Ia and db III, respectively. In addition, the proposed method outperforms a support vector machine classifier with a linear kernel, when both classifiers utilize the same feature set. The results also show that a model architecture which includes a left-to-right scheme with no skips, five states and three Gaussians, outperforms the other tested architectures due to the fact that it allows a better modeling of the temporal sequencing of the EEG components.

Presence of burst suppression pattern in neonate EEG is a clear indication of epilepsy. Visual identification of burst patterns from recorded continuous raw EEG data is time consuming. On the other hand, automatic burst detection techniques mentioned in the standard literature mostly rely on comparison with respect to predefined static voltage or energy thresholds, thus becoming too specific. Burst detection using ratio information of quantitative feature values between burst segment and neighborhood background EEG segment is proposed in this paper. Features like ratio of mean nonlinear energy, power spectral density, variance and absolute voltage, when applied as an input to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, provides high degree of separability between burst and normal (nonburst) EEG segments. Exhaustive simulation using various literature specified features and proposed feature combinations shows that the proposed feature set provides best classification accuracy compared to other reported burst detection methods. The results documented in this paper can be used as a reference of optimum quantitative EEG feature sets for distinguishing between burst and normal (nonburst) EEG segments.

However, such a feature is often deteriorated by redundant electrode channels which may result in low classification accuracy, extra subsequent computational load and difficulty in understanding which part of the brain relates to classification-relevant activity. In this paper, we present a channel selection method to deal with these problems, in which an improved genetic algorithm based on the Rayleigh coefficient feature is conducted to determine the optimal subset of channels. Experiment results on two motor imagery EEG datasets verify that our method is effective in channel selection for classifying motor imagery EEG signals. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper proposes a novel method to design these filters. We use a similarity of the covariance matrices of narrow band observed signals over frequency bins. The similarity is defined based on the common spatial pattern method. This proposed method enables us to design the multiple bandpass filters. The experimental results of classification of EEG signals during motor imagery show that the proposed method achieves higher classification accuracy than well-known conventional methods.

J	Siuly; Li, Y; Wen, P				Siuly; Li, Yan; Wen, Peng (Paul)			Clustering technique-based least square support vector machine for EEG signal classification	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM); Clustering technique (CT); Simple random sampling (SRS); Feature extraction	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; SELECTION; ENSEMBLE; PATTERN	This paper presents a new approach called clustering technique-based least square support vector machine (CT-LS-SVM) for the classification of EEG signals. Decision making is performed in two stages. In the first stage, clustering technique (CT) has been used to extract representative features of EEG data. In the second stage, least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) is applied to the extracted features to classify two-class EEG signals. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, several experiments have been conducted on three publicly available benchmark databases, one for epileptic EEG data, one for mental imagery tasks EEG data and another one for motor imagery EEG data. Our proposed approach achieves an average sensitivity, specificity and classification accuracy of 94.92%, 93.44% and 94.18%, respectively, for the epileptic EEG data; 83.98%, 84.37% and 84.17% respectively, for the motor imagery EEG data; and 64.61%, 58.77% and 61.69%, respectively, for the mental imagery tasks EEG data. The performance of the CT-LS-SVM algorithm is compared in terms of classification accuracy and execution (running) time with our previous study where simple random sampling with a least square support vector machine (SRS-LS-SVM) was employed for EEG signal classification. We also compare the proposed method with other existing methods in the literature for the three databases. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can produce a better classification rate than the previous reported methods and takes much less execution time compared to the SRS-LS-SVM technique. The research findings in this paper indicate that the proposed approach is very efficient for classification of two-class EEG signals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The development of BCI consisted of several steps. First, spline Laplacian analysis was performed. Next, time-frequency analysis was applied to determine the optimal frequency range and latencies of the electroencephalograms (EEGs). Finally, trials were classified as right or left based on P-band event-related synchronization using the cumulative distribution function of pretrigger EEG noise. To test the performance of the BCI, EEGs during the execution and imagination of right/left wrist-bending movements were measured from 63 locations over the entire scalp using eight healthy subjects. The highest classification accuracies were 84.4% and 77.8% for real movements and their imageries, respectively. The accuracy is significantly higher than that of previously reported machine-learning-based BCIs in the movement imagery task (paired t-test, p < 0.05). It has also been demonstrated that the highest accuracy was achieved even though subjects had never participated in movement imageries.

Auditory perceptual decision-making based on semantic categorization of environmental sounds	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Perceptual decision-making; Single-trial electroencephalography; Decoding	DISCRIMINATION; BRAIN; NEUROSCIENCE; SYSTEMS; MOTION; CORTEX	Discriminating complex sounds relies on multiple stages of differential brain activity. The specific roles of these stages and their links to perception were the focus of the present study. We presented 250 ms duration sounds of living and man-made objects while recording 160-channel electroencephalography (EEG). Subjects categorized each sound as that of a living, man-made or unknown item. We tested whether/when the brain discriminates between sound categories even when not transpiring behaviorally. We applied a single-trial classifier that identified voltage topographies and latencies at which brain responses are most discriminative. For sounds that the subjects could not categorize, we could successfully decode the semantic category based on differences in voltage topographies during the 116-174 ms post-stimulus period. Sounds that were correctly categorized as that of a living or man-made item by the same subjects exhibited two periods of differences in voltage topographies at the single-trial level. Subjects exhibited differential activity before the sound ended (starting at 112 ms) and on a separate period at similar to 270 ms post-stimulus onset. Because each of these periods could be used to reliably decode semantic categories, we interpreted the first as being related to an implicit tuning for sound representations and the second as being linked to perceptual decision-making processes. Collectively, our results show that the brain discriminates environmental sounds during early stages and independently of behavioral proficiency and that explicit sound categorization requires a subsequent processing stage.

J	Gwin, JT; Ferris, DP				Gwin, Joseph T.; Ferris, Daniel P.			An EEG-based study of discrete isometric and isotonic human lower limb muscle contractions	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; ARTIFACTS; FOOT; CLASSIFICATION; SPECTROSCOPY; POTENTIALS; ACTIVATION; SEPARATION	Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) combined with independent component analysis enables functional neuroimaging in dynamic environments including during human locomotion. This type of functional neuroimaging could be a powerful tool for neurological rehabilitation. It could enable clinicians to monitor changes in motor control related cortical dynamics associated with a therapeutic intervention, and it could facilitate noninvasive electrocortical control of devices for assisting limb movement to stimulate activity dependent plasticity. Understanding the relationship between electrocortical dynamics and muscle activity will be helpful for incorporating EEG-based functional neuroimaging into clinical practice. The goal of this study was to use independent component analysis of high-density EEG to test whether we could relate electrocortical dynamics to lower limb muscle activation in a constrained motor task. A secondary goal was to assess the trial-by-trial consistency of the electrocortical dynamics by decoding the type of muscle action. Methods: We recorded 264-channel EEG while 8 neurologically intact subjects performed isometric and isotonic, knee and ankle exercises at two different effort levels. Adaptive mixture independent component analysis (AMICA) parsed EEG into models of underlying source signals. We generated spectrograms for all electrocortical source signals and used a nave Bayesian classifier to decode exercise type from trial-by-trial time-frequency data. Results: AMICA captured different electrocortical source distributions for ankle and knee tasks. The fit of single-trial EEG to these models distinguished knee from ankle tasks with 80% accuracy. Electrocortical spectral modulations in the supplementary motor area were significantly different for isometric and isotonic tasks (p < 0.05). Isometric contractions elicited an event related desynchronization (ERD) in the alpha-band (8-12 Hz) and beta-band (12-30 Hz) at joint torque onset and offset. Isotonic contractions elicited a sustained alpha- and beta-band ERD throughout the trial. Classifiers based on supplementary motor area sources achieved a 4-way classification accuracy of 69% while classifiers based on electrocortical sources in multiple brain regions achieved a 4-way classification accuracy of 87%. Conclusions: Independent component analysis of EEG reveals unique spatial and spectro-temporal electrocortical properties for different lower limb motor tasks. Using a broad distribution of electrocortical signals may improve classification of human lower limb movements from single-trial EEG.

This traditional approach represents sleep architecture in a static way, but it cannot reflect variations in sleep across time and across the cortex. To investigate these dynamic aspects of sleep, we analyzed sleep recordings in 14 healthy volunteers with a novel, frequency-based EEG analysis. This approach enabled comparison of sleep patterns with low inter-individual variability. We then implemented a new probability dependent, automatic classification of sleep states that agreed closely with conventional manual scoring during consolidated sleep. Furthermore, this analysis revealed a previously unrecognized, interhemispheric oscillation during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This quantitative approach provides a new way of examining the dynamic aspects of sleep, shedding new light on the physiology of human sleep.

Non-linear Granger causality and its frequency decomposition in decoding human upper limb movement intentions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Granger causality; brain computer interface; motor intention; electroencephalogram		Non-linear Granger Causality (GC) can detect directional influence of signals between multiple locations through a non-linear predictive approach using Radial Basis Functions (RBF). However, the directional relations in frequency domain are often lost. In this paper, we investigate how the non-linear causal relationship at different frequency bands can be extracted by the proper linearisation process. The difference between the non-linearly and linearly fitted signals was used to determine if the frequency components can be approximated. This strategy was implemented and evaluated on a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) application to decode the intended directions of an imagined arm reaching movement (left, right and forward) using 128 surface electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes. The causal influence of the active recording sites was found to be unique with respect to the direction of the intended movement. Particularly, the left and right reaching directions were found to be highly separable in the theta rhythm (3-8 Hz).

The aim of this study was to identify preoperative prognostic factors associated with the chance of achieving long-term seizure freedom. Methods We retrospectively reviewed seizure outcomes and clinical, electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histopathology, and surgical variables from 99 epilepsy surgery patients with at least one year of postoperative follow-up. Seizure outcomes were categorized based on the modified classification by the International League Against Epilepsy. Results We found that the seizure-free rate was 27.9% after one year, and that it stabilized at about 20.0% between two and six years after surgery. Univariate analysis showed that medial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis, MRI with visible focal lesions concordant with EEG, and regional ictal EEG and electrocorticography patterns were associated with a favorable surgical outcome. On the other hand, seizure recurrence within six months, incomplete focus resection, and surgical complications were associated with a poor outcome. Multivariate analysis showed that medial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis and MRI with visible focal lesions were independent presurgical predictors of a favorable outcome (P < 0.01). Seizure recurrence within six months was the only significant independent predictor associated with a poor outcome (P < 0.01). Conclusion Hippocampal sclerosis and abnormal MRI findings are strongly associated with a favorable surgical outcome, whereas seizure recurrence within six months is associated with a poor outcome.

The hypothesis for this investigation is that the frontal EEG signal contains sufficient information on the mental state of a subject for discriminating the preference of music of the subject. An experiment is performed to collect 2-channel frontal EEG data from 12 subjects by playing various types of music pieces and asking whether they like or dislike the music in order to obtain the true labels of their music preferences. We then propose a frequency band optimization method called common frequency pattern (CFP) for feature extraction and Linear SVM for classification to identify the music preference of the subjects from the 2-channel frontal EEG. The results of using the proposed method yield an average classification accuracy of 74.77% for a trial length of 30 s over the 12 subjects. Hence the experimental results show evidence that frontal EEG signal contains sufficient information to discriminate preference of music. Furthermore, the frequency band optimization results indicate that gamma band is essential for EEG-based music preference identification.

EEG-based neonatal seizure detection with Support Vector Machines	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Neonatal EEG; Automated seizure detection; Machine learning; Support Vector Machines	CEREBRAL FUNCTION MONITOR	Objective: The study presents a multi-channel patient-independent neonatal seizure detection system based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Methods: A machine learning algorithm (SVM) is used as a classifier to discriminate between seizure and non-seizure EEG epochs. Two post-processing steps are proposed to increase both the temporal precision and the robustness of the system. The resulting system is validated on a large clinical dataset of 267 h of EEG data from 17 full-term newborns with seizures. Results: The performance of the system using event-based metrics is reported. The system showed the best up-to-date performance of a neonatal seizure detection system. The system was able to achieve an average good detection rate of similar to 89% with one false seizure detection per hour, similar to 96% with two false detections per hour, or similar to 100% with four false detections per hour. An analysis of errors revealed sources of misclassification in terms of both missed seizures and false detections. Conclusions: The results obtained with the proposed SVM-based seizure detection system allow for its practical application in neonatal intensive care units. Significance: The proposed SVM-based seizure detection system can greatly assist clinical staff, in a neonatal intensive care unit, to interpret the EEG. The system allows control of the final decision by choosing different confidence levels which makes it flexible for clinical needs. The obtained results may provide a reference for future seizure detection systems. (c) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Automatic Feature Selection for BCI: an Analysis using the Davies-Bouldin Index and Extreme Learning Machines	2012 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	JUN 10-15, 2012	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA			Feature Selection; Brain Computer Interfaces; Davies-Bouldin Index; Extreme Learning Machines; Artificial Immune Systems		In this work, we present a novel framework for automatic feature selection in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The proposal, which manipulates features generated in the frequency domain by an estimate of the power spectral density of the EEG signals, is based on feature optimization (with both binary and real coding) using a state-of-the-art artificial immune network, the cob-aiNet. In order to analyze the performance of the proposed framework, two approaches are adopted: a direct use of the Davies-Bouldin index and the use of metrics associated with the operation of an extreme learning machine (ELM) in the role of a classifier. The results reveal that the proposal has the potential of improving the performance of a BCI system, and also provide elements for an analysis of the spectral content of EEG signals and of the performance of ELMs in motor imagery paradigms.

Statistical Threshold for Nonlinear Granger Causality in Motor Intention Analysis	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			EEG	Directed influence between multiple channel signal measurements is important for the understanding of large dynamic systems. This research investigates a method to analyze large, complex multi-variable systems using directional flow measure to extract relevant information related to the functional connectivity between different units in the system. The directional flow measure was completed through nonlinear Granger Causality (GC) which is based on the nonlinear predictive models using radial basis functions (RBF). In order to extract relevant information from the causality map, we propose a threshold method that can be set up through a spatial statistical process where only the top 20% of causality pathways is shown. We applied this approach to a brain computer interface (BCI) application to decode the different intended arm reaching movement (left, right and forward) using 128 surface electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes. We also evaluated the importance of selecting the appropriate radius in the region of interest and found that the directions of causal influence of active brain regions were unique with respect to the intended direction.

J	Higashi, H; Tanaka, T				Higashi, Hiroshi; Tanaka, Toshihisa			Simultaneous Design of FIR Filter Banks and Spatial Patterns for EEG Signal Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); common spatial pattern (CSP); feature extraction; filter bank	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MOTOR IMAGERY	The spatial weights for electrodes called common spatial pattern (CSP) are known to be effective in EEG signal classification for motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). To achieve accurate classification in CSP, it is necessary to find frequency bands that relate to brain activities associated with BCI tasks. Several methods that determine such a set of frequency bands have been proposed. However, the existing methods cannot find the multiple frequency bands by using only learning data. To address this problem, we propose discriminative filter bank CSP (DFBCSP) that designs finite impulse response filters and the associated spatial weights by optimizing an objective function which is a natural extension of that of CSP. The optimization is conducted by sequentially and alternatively solving subproblems into which the original problem is divided. By experiments, it is shown that DFBCSP can effectively extract discriminative features for MI-BCI. Moreover, experimental results exhibit that DFBCSP can detect and extract the bands related to brain activities of motor imagery.

Various spatial filtering solutions have been developed. Most current methods estimate an instantaneous demixing with the assumption of uncorrelatedness of the source signals. However, recent evidence in neuroscience suggests that multiple brain regions cooperate, especially during motor imagery, a major modality of brain activity for brain-computer interface. In this sense, methods that assume uncorrelatedness of the sources become inaccurate. Therefore, we are promoting a new methodology that considers both volume conduction effect and signal propagation between multiple brain regions. Specifically, we propose a novel discriminative algorithm for joint learning of propagation and spatial pattern with an iterative optimization solution. To validate the new methodology, we conduct experiments involving 16 healthy subjects and perform numerical analysis of the proposed algorithm for EEG classification in motor imagery brain-computer interface. Results from extensive analysis validate the effectiveness of the new methodology with high statistical significance.

Progress has been made recently by the realization that cortical population activity tracks the amplitude envelope of speech stimuli. This has led to studies using linear regression methods which allow the presentation of continuous speech. One such method, known as stimulus reconstruction, has so far only been utilized in multi-electrode cortical surface recordings and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Here, in two studies, we show that such an approach is also possible with EEG, despite the poorer signal-to-noise ratio of the data. In the first study, we show that it is possible to decode attention in a naturalistic cocktail party scenario on a single trial (approximate to 60 s) basis. In the second, we show that the representation of the envelope of auditory speech in the cortex is more robust when accompanied by visual speech. The sensitivity of this inexpensive, widely-accessible technology for the online monitoring of natural stimuli has implications for the design of future studies of the cocktail party problem and for the implementation of EEG-based brain-computer interfaces.

Considering that the large amounts of labeled samples are difficult to get in the actual application, we also propose a novel unsupervised scheme based the adaptive classifier to solve this problem. Sufficient experiments are conducted on the datasets from previous Brain-Computer Interface Competitions and the actual on-line EEG data in adaptive scheme. The results demonstrate that the new algorithm is efficiency and robust compared with non-adaptive classifiers. Besides, a couple of analyses are made on the selection of parameters in the adaptive BPR, and some advice has been come up with about their selections. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, both the ordinary CSP and PCA algorithms face a loading problem, i.e., their weights in linear combinations are non-zero. This problem makes a BCI system easy to be over-fitted during training process, because not all of the information from EEG data are relevant to the given tasks. To deal with the loading problem, this paper proposes a spare CSP algorithm and introduces a sparse PCA algorithm to BCIs. The performance of BCIs using the proposed sparse CSP and sparse PCA techniques is evaluated on a motor imagery classification task and a vigilance estimation task. Experimental results demonstrate that the BCI system with sparse PCA and sparse CSP techniques are superior to that using the ordinary PCA and CSP algorithms.

Analysis of amplitude topography also revealed left-hemispheric dominance and many significant differences in activity distribution patterns over parasagittal chains of electrodes (meridians) depending on sleep stages and frequency domains. The combination of EEG synchrony estimates with the amplitude spectral estimates made it possible to perform a reliable discriminant recognition of five sleep stages with errors in the range of 3-20%.

We recorded experimental data of five subjects during mimicking the natural task of filling a glass of water. The proposed system uses filter bank common spatial patterns and linear regression to estimate the speed of hand movements from artifact cleaned EEG signals. Average Pearson correlations between the speed trajectories predicted from EEG and the speed trajectories measured using a high-precision motion tracking system are r=0.41 for the x-axis, r=0.36 for the y-axis, r=0.48 for the z-axis, and r=0.17 for absolute speed in 3D space.

The neural processes underlying exploratory decision-making have been mainly studied by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging, overlooking any information about the time when decisions are made. Here, we carried out an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment, in order to detect the time when the brain generators responsible for these decisions have been sufficiently activated to lead to the next decision. Our analyses, based on a classification scheme, extract time-unlocked voltage topographies during reward presentation and use them to predict the type of decisions made on the subsequent trial. Classification accuracy, measured as the area under the Receiver Operator's Characteristic curve was on average 0.65 across 7 subjects. Classification accuracy was above chance levels already after 516 ms on average, across subjects. We :;peculate that decisions were already made before this critical period, as confirmed by a positive correlation with reaction times across subjects. On an individual subject basis, distributed source estimations were performed on the extracted topographies to statistically evaluate the neural correlates of decision-making. For trials leading to exploration, there was significantly higher activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right supramarginal gyrus; areas responsible for modulating behavior under risk and deduction. No area was more active during exploitation. We show for the first time the temporal evolution of differential patterns of brain activation in an exploratory decision-making task on a single-trial basis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

New spectral and spatial features related to different MIs were extracted using principal component analysis (PCA) and squared cross correlation (R-2). Extracted features were evaluated using a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier, resulting in an average decoding accuracy about 50%, which is significantly higher than the guess level and the 95% confidence level of guess. The preliminary results demonstrate the great potential of extracting features from different MIs from same hands to generate control signals with more degrees of freedom (DOF) for non-invasive brain-computer interface applications. In addition, for movement related applications, especially for neuroprosthesis, the present study may facilitate the development of a non-invasive BCI, which is highly intuitive and based on users' spontaneous intentions.

Classification of EEG During Imagined Mental Tasks by Forecasting with Elman Recurrent Neural Networks	2011 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	JUL 31-AUG 05, 2011	San Jose, CA	Int Neural Network Soc (INNS), IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc (CIS), Natl Sci Fdn (NSF), Cognimem Technol, Inc, Univ Cincinnati Coll Engn & Appl Sci, Toyota Res Inst N Amer, Univ Cincinnati, Sch Elect & Compu Syst			ALGORITHM	The ability to classify EEG recorded while a subject performs varying imagined mental tasks may lay the foundation for building usable Brain-Computer Interfaces as well as improve the performance of EEG analysis software used in clinical settings. Although a number of research groups have produced EEG classifiers, these methods have not yet reached a level of performance that is acceptable for use in many practical applications. We assert that current approaches are limited by their ability to capture the temporal and spatial patterns contained within EEG. In order to address these problems, we propose a new generative technique for EEG classification that uses Elman Recurrent Neural Networks. EEG recorded while a subject performs one of several imagined mental tasks is first modeled by training a network to forecast the signal a single step ahead in time. We show that these models are able to forecast EEG well with an RMSE as low as 0.110. A separate model is then trained over EEG belonging to each class. Classification of previously unseen data is performed by applying each model and assigning the class label associated with the network that produced the lowest forecasting error. This approach is tested on EEG collected from two able-bodied subjects and one subject with a high-level spinal cord injury. Classification rates as high as 93.3% are achieved for a two-task problem with decisions made every second yielding a bitrate of 38.7 bits per minute.

Electroencephalogram signals classification for sleep-state decision - a Riemannian geometry approach	IET SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK; STAGE; EEG	In this work,(1) the authors study the classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for the determination of the state of sleep of a patient. They employ the power spectral density (PSD) matrices as the feature for the distinction between different classes of EEG signals. This not only allows us to examine the power spectrum contents of each signal as well as the correlation between the multi-channel signals, but also complies with what clinical experts use in their visual judgement of EEG signals. To establish a metric facilitating the classification, the authors exploit the specific geometric properties, and develop, with the aid of fibre bundle theory, an appropriate metric in the Riemannian manifold described by the PSD matrices. To use this new metric effectively for the EEG signal classification, the authors further need to find a weighting for the PSD matrices so that the distances of similar features are minimised whereas those for dissimilar features are maximised. A closed form of this weighting matrix is obtained by solving an equivalent convex optimisation problem. The effectiveness of using these new metrics is examined by applying them to a collection of recorded EEG signals for sleep pattern classification based on the k-nearest neighbour decision algorithm with excellent outcome.

The mean Power of the signal, segmented in 8 EEG frequency bands, was used as the features for the classifier and the effect of spatial feature selection was also investigated. A non-conventional potential difference based on an 8-electrode clinical transversal setup was used in the acquisition of EEG signal during arm and hand movements, which were segmented in Movement Planning, Movement Execution and Steady Position. The results showed that the Movement Planning subset achieved the best classification accuracy, suggesting that the speed for a BCI can be improved by using pre-movement information. Spatial feature selection showed that non-motor areas should be considered as an information source. Best classification accuracy of right and left limbs was 67.95%, hands versus arms achieved 82.69%, and 49.36% of classification was the best result for the 4-class set up. Results are promising, however further experiments are required to obtain better classification accuracy and to generalize these conclusions.

However, conventional CSP is sensitive to outliers and artifacts because it is based on variance using L2-norm. In this paper, we consider generalized L-p norm based CSP, called CSP-L-p, and verify which p is optimal for CSP-L, by maximizing the Lp norm ratio of filtered dispersion of one class to the other class. The spatial filters of CSP-L-p are obtained empirically. Simulation result on a toy example shows the robustness of CSP-L-p depending on Lp-norm.

Physiological signals such as the electroencephalogram (EEG) and peripheral physiological signals have been less considered for emotion recognition in comparison to other modalities such as facial expression and speech, although they have a potential interest as alternative or supplementary channels. This article presents our work on: (1) constructing a dataset containing EEG and peripheral physiological signals acquired during presentation of music video clips, which is made publicly available, and (2) conducting binary classification of induced positive/negative valence, high/low arousal, and like/dislike by using the aforementioned signals. The procedure for the dataset acquisition, including stimuli selection, signal acquisition, self-assessment, and signal processing is described in detail. Especially, we propose a novel asymmetry index based on relative wavelet entropy for measuring the asymmetry in the energy distribution of EEG signals, which is used for EEG feature extraction. Then, the classification systems based on EEG and peripheral physiological signals are presented. Single-trial and single-run classification results indicate that, on average, the performance of the EEG-based classification outperforms that of the peripheral physiological signals. However, the peripheral physiological signals can be considered as a good alternative to EEG signals in the case of assessing a user's preference for a given music video clip (like/dislike) since they have a comparable performance to EEG signals while being more easily measured.

J	Bosl, W; Tierney, A; Tager-Flusberg, H; Nelson, C				Bosl, William; Tierney, Adrienne; Tager-Flusberg, Helen; Nelson, Charles			EEG complexity as a biomarker for autism spectrum disorder risk	BMC MEDICINE			English	Article							NONLINEAR DYNAMICAL ANALYSIS; HEART-RATE; 1ST YEAR; TIME-SERIES; BRAIN; INFORMATION; CHILDREN; ENTROPY; NEURODEVELOPMENT	Background: Complex neurodevelopmental disorders may be characterized by subtle brain function signatures early in life before behavioral symptoms are apparent. Such endophenotypes may be measurable biomarkers for later cognitive impairments. The nonlinear complexity of electroencephalography (EEG) signals is believed to contain information about the architecture of the neural networks in the brain on many scales. Early detection of abnormalities in EEG signals may be an early biomarker for developmental cognitive disorders. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that the modified multiscale entropy (mMSE) computed on the basis of resting state EEG data can be used as a biomarker of normal brain development and distinguish typically developing children from a group of infants at high risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), defined on the basis of an older sibling with ASD. Methods: Using mMSE as a feature vector, a multiclass support vector machine algorithm was used to classify typically developing and high-risk groups. Classification was computed separately within each age group from 6 to 24 months. Results: Multiscale entropy appears to go through a different developmental trajectory in infants at high risk for autism (HRA) than it does in typically developing controls. Differences appear to be greatest at ages 9 to 12 months. Using several machine learning algorithms with mMSE as a feature vector, infants were classified with over 80% accuracy into control and HRA groups at age 9 months. Classification accuracy for boys was close to 100% at age 9 months and remains high (70% to 90%) at ages 12 and 18 months. For girls, classification accuracy was highest at age 6 months, but declines thereafter. Conclusions: This proof-of-principle study suggests that mMSE computed from resting state EEG signals may be a useful biomarker for early detection of risk for ASD and abnormalities in cognitive development in infants. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an information theoretic analysis of EEG data for biomarkers in infants at risk for a complex neurodevelopmental disorder.

This research study describes a new approach based on a fuzzy logic system implemented in the framework of a neural network for classification of EEG signals. In practical applications of pattern recognition, there are often diverse features extracted from raw data, which need recognising. Because of the importance of making the right decision, the present work is carried out for searching better classification procedures for the EEG signals. Decision making was performed in two stages: feature extraction using the wavelet transform and classification using the classifier trained on the extracted features. The proposed network constructs its initial rules by clustering, while the final fuzzy rule base is determined by competitive learning. Both error backpropagation and recursive least squares estimation, are applied to the learning scheme. The performance of the model was evaluated in terms of training performance and high classification accuracies and the results confirmed that the proposed scheme has potential in classifying the EEG signals.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) often leaves affected individuals unable to ambulate. Electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interface (BCI) controlled lower extremity prostheses may restore intuitive and able-body-like ambulation after SCI. To test its feasibility, the authors developed and tested a novel EEG-based, data-driven BCI system for intuitive and self-paced control of the ambulation of an avatar within a virtual reality environment (VRE). Approach. Eight able-bodied subjects and one with SCI underwent the following 10-min training session: subjects alternated between idling and walking kinaesthetic motor imageries (KMI) while their EEG were recorded and analysed to generate subject-specific decoding models. Subjects then performed a goal-oriented online task, repeated over five sessions, in which they utilized the KMI to control the linear ambulation of an avatar and make ten sequential stops at designated points within the VRE. Main results. The average offline training performance across subjects was 77.2 +/- 11.0%, ranging from 64.3% (p = 0.001 76) to 94.5% (p = 6.26 x 10(-23)), with chance performance being 50%. The average online performance was 8.5 +/- 1.1 (out of 10) successful stops and 303 +/- 53 s completion time (perfect = 211 s). All subjects achieved performances significantly different than those of random walk (p < 0.05) in 44 of the 45 online sessions. Significance. By using a data-driven machine learning approach to decode users' KMI, this BCI-VRE system enabled intuitive and purposeful self-paced control of ambulation after only 10 minutes training. The ability to achieve such BCI control with minimal training indicates that the implementation of future BCI-lower extremity prosthesis systems may be feasible.

Previous studies have shown that task-related information contained in event-related potential (ERP) components could discriminate two or three categories of object images. In this study, we investigated whether four categories of objects (human faces, buildings, cats and cars) could be mutually discriminated using single-trial EEG data. Here, the EEG waveforms acquired while subjects were viewing four categories of object images were segmented into several ERP components (P1, N1, P2a and P2b), and then Fisher linear discriminant analysis (Fisher-LDA) was used to classify EEG features extracted from ERP components. Firstly, we compared the classification results using features from single ERP components, and identified that the N1 component achieved the highest classification accuracies. Secondly, we discriminated four categories of objects using combining features from multiple ERP components, and showed that combination of ERP components improved four-category classification accuracies by utilizing the complementarity of discriminative information in ERP components. These findings confirmed that four categories of object images could be discriminated with single-trial EEG and could direct us to select effective EEG features for classifying visual objects.

J	Lee, KY; Kim, S				Lee, Kyeong-Yeon; Kim, Sun			Designing discriminative spatial filter vectors in motor imagery brain-computer interface	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGING SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						braincomputer interface; common spatial pattern; feature selection; motor imagery classification; electroencephalography	MUTUAL INFORMATION; FEATURE-SELECTION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; PATTERNS; BCI	The problem of a volume conduction effect in electroencephalography is considered one of the challenging issues in braincomputer interface (BCI) community. In this article, we propose a novel method of designing a class-discriminative spatial filter assuming that a combination of spatial pattern vectors, irrespective of the eigenvalues of the common spatial pattern (CSP), can produce better performance in terms of classification accuracy. We select discriminative spatial filter vectors that determine features in a pairwise manner, that is, eigenvectors of the K largest eigenvalue and the K smallest eigenvalue. Although the pair of the eigenvectors of the K largest and the K smallest eigenvalues helps extract discriminative features, we believe that a different set of eigenvector pairs is more appropriate to extract class-discriminative features. In our experimental results using the publicly available dataset of BCI Competition IV, we show that the proposed method outperformed the conventional CSP methods and a filter-bank CSP.

METHOD We conducted a retrospective evaluation of 63 individuals (29 females; 34 males) affected by PNMEs at the National Neurological Institute 'C. Besta' between 2006 and 2008. Individuals were included in the study if they had PNMEs documented by a video-electroencephalography-polymyographic study and were aged between 1 month and 18 years (mean age at the time of video-electroencephalography-polymyography: 5y 10mo). RESULTS In 45 of the 63 participants (71%), PNMEs were associated with other neurological conditions (secondary) including epilepsy, whereas in 18 participants PNME was the only neurological symptom(primary). Clinical features allowed classification of the motor disturbance into usual movement disorder categories in 31 individuals (49%); in the remaining 32 (51%), the movement disorder was characterized on the basis of polymyographic pattern of 'jerks' or 'sustained contraction'. The most frequent PNMEs were paroxysmal dyskinesias, followed by startle, stereotypies, shuddering, sleep myoclonus, psychogenic movement disorders, and benign myoclonus of early infancy; the last syndrome was also observed in children with neurological impairment. In eight participants, PNMEs remained unclassified. INTERPRETATION PNMEs may occur in both healthy and children with neurological impairment and are caused by a wide range of static and progressive conditions. In the majority of children with neurological impairment with associated epilepsy, the PNMEs do not fit into the usual movement disorders categories. A video-electroencephalography-polymyography is therefore useful for characterizing them.

Since the EEG signal acquired on the scalp is a nonlinear composition of multiple signal and noise sources, in order to characterize the nonlinear data structure, nonlinear CSP methods have been proposed by using the kernel technique. Most kernel CSP methods calculate temporal covariance structure in a kernel feature space that leads to a large kernel matrix with each dimension equal to the number of time points multiplied by the number of classes. In this work, a kernel CSP method exploiting spatial covariance structure in the feature space is developed where the size of kernel matrix is the number of EEG channels, which is usually much less than that of time points. The proposed method was evaluated using motor imagery EEG data. Results indicate that the kernel CSP using spatial analysis can provide comparable performance to the existing methods using temporal analysis with less computational load.

By analyzing the EEG, we attempt to make the evaluation method clear how users feel when he/she touches objects. We measure the EEG while subjects touch objects by using portable electroencephalograph.

In this paper, a new two-stage approach is proposed for epileptic spike detection. First, the k-point nonlinear energy operator (k-NEO) is adopted to detect all possible spike candidates, then a newly proposed spike model with slow wave features is applied to these candidates for spike classification. Experimental results show that the proposed system, using the AdaBoost classifier, outperforms the conventional method in both two- and three-class EEG pattern classification problems. The proposed system not only achieves better accuracy for spike detection, but also provides new ability to differentiate between spikes and spikes with slow waves. Though spikes with slow waves occur frequently in epileptic EEGs, they are not used in conventional spike detection. Identifying spikes with slow waves allows the proposed system to have better capability for assisting clinical neurologists in routine EEG examinations and epileptic diagnosis.

Methods: We quantified a dynamic repertoire of EEG oscillations in resting condition with eyes closed in patients in VS and MCS. The exact composition of EEG oscillations was assessed by analysing the probability-classification of short-term EEG spectral patterns. Results: Results demonstrated that (a) the diversity and the variability of EEG for Non-Survivors were significantly lower than for Survivors; and (b) a higher probability of mostly delta and slow-theta oscillations occurring either alone or in combination were found during the first assessment for patients with a bad outcome (i.e., those who died) within six months of an injury compared to patients who survived. At the same time, patients with a good outcome (i.e., those who survived) after six months post-injury had a higher probability of mostly fast-theta and alpha oscillations occurring either alone or in combination during the first assessment when compared to patients who died within six months of an injury. Conclusions: Resting state EEGs properly analysed may have a potentially prognostic value with regards to the outcome from VS or MCS in terms of survival six months after a brain injury. Significance: This work may have implications for clinical care, rehabilitative programmes and medical-legal decisions for patients with impaired consciousness states after being in a coma due to acute brain injuries.

K-complex is an indicator for the sleep stage 2. However, due to the ambiguity of the translation of the medical standards into a computer-based procedure, reliability of automated K-complex detection from the EEG wave is still far from expectation. More specifically, there are some significant barriers to the research of automatic K-complex detection. First, there is no adequate description of K-complex that makes it difficult to develop automatic detection algorithm. Second, human experts only provided the label for whether a whole EEG segment contains K-complex or not, rather than individual labels for each subsegment. These barriers render most pattern recognition algorithms inapplicable in detecting K-complex. In this paper, we attempt to address these two challenges, by designing a new feature extraction method that can transform visual features of the EEG wave with any length into mathematical representation and proposing a hybrid-synergic machine learning method to build a K-complex classifier. The tenfold cross-validation results indicate that both the accuracy and the precision of this proposed model are at least as good as a human expert in K-complex detection.

EEG and neuroimaging correlations in children with lissencephaly	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						Lissencephaly; EEG patterns; Interictal; Cortical activity; Sleep spindles	FOCAL CORTICAL DYSPLASIA; PEDIATRIC EPILEPSY; INFANTILE SPASMS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MALFORMATIONS; CLASSIFICATION; SUBTYPES; UPDATE	Purpose: To study the usefulness of EEG in the diagnosis of lissencephaly, a rare cortical developmental disorder associated with abnormal cellular proliferation. Currently, the clinical emphasis is placed on the radiological and genetic aspects for the diagnosis of lissencephaly. Methods: This is a retrospective review of consecutive EEG recordings and imaging data from 14 children, with the diagnosis of lissencephaly, who were admitted from January 1998 to January 2010. All EEG recordings were performed with the 10-20 system of electrode placement, in both awake and sleep states. All EEG recordings were reviewed using anterior-posterior bipolar and transverse montages and then they were interpreted blindly, with respect to the imaging and genetic investigations for each patient. Results: All children showed one of the three characteristic EEG patterns reported in the literature of lissencephaly. The EEG pattern I, showed an anterior posterior gradient that corresponded to the severity of the imaging study abnormality. All patients were on two or more AEDs and reported to continue having active epilepsy. Conclusion: In a child with clinical characteristics of lissencephaly, one of these three reported EEG patterns can prove useful in making the diagnosis very probable, preceding imaging and genetic testing.

Single-trial linear correlation analysis: application to characterization of stimulus modality effects	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; single-trial analysis; neuroimaging; correlated components; machine learning		A key objective in systems and cognitive neuroscience is to establish associations between behavioral measures and concurrent neuronal activity. Single-trial analysis has been proposed as a novel method for characterizing such correlates by first extracting neural components that maximally discriminate trials on a categorical variable, (e.g., hard vs. easy, correct vs. incorrect etc.), and then correlate those components to a continues dependent variable of interest, e. g., reaction time, difficulty Index, etc. However, often times in experiment design it is difficult to either define meaningful categorical variables, or to record enough trials for the method to extract the discriminant components. Experiments designed for the study of the effects of stimulus presentation modality in working memory provide such a scenario, as will be exemplified. In this paper, we proposed a new approach to single trial analysis in which we directly extract neural activity that maximally correlates to single-trial manual response times; eliminating the need to define an arbitrary categorical variable. We demonstrate our method on real electroencephalography (EEG) data recordings from the study of stimulus presentation modality effect (SPME).

The performance of the algorithm, however, depends largely on the operational frequency bands. To address the problem, a filter bank was applied to find optimal frequency bands. In filter bank, CSP was applied in all sub-band signals for feature extraction. The feature selection is the key of filter bank method for increasing classification performance. In this study, coefficient decimation (CD) technique was used to devise filter bank, while Fisher score and Laplacian score were proposed as feature selection criterion. In off-line analysis, the proposed method yielded relatively better cross-validation classification accuracies.

In particular, partial directed coherence and directed transfer function measurements are applied to multi-channel EEG data to find out event related connectivity pattern with the direction and strength. The t-test is applied to these connectivity measurements to compare the network between motor imagery and the rest state. The possible relationship between this connectivity pattern and subjects performances are discussed. Based on the Granger causality analysis, a feature extraction method is proposed to compensate for non-stationarity in data. By attenuating the time-lagged correlation, this feature extraction method based on the multi-variate auto-regression model is proposed to reduce the effects of noises caused by time propagation. The validity of the proposed method is verified through experimental studies with a two-class dataset, and significant improvement in term of classification accuracy is achieved.

The sparse representation classification (SRC) method has been studied for classifying EEG signals of the motor imagery based BCI. The dictionary used in the SRC method is the simple combination of feature vectors which are extracted from the EEG signal-trials by common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm. In this paper, we propose a method to learn a new dictionary with smaller size and more discriminative ability for the classification. The proposed method, discriminative dictionary learning (DDL), is based on minimizing an objective function containing a reconstructive term and a discriminative term. We apply an iterative scheme to the optimization and transform it to a series of mixed l(1)-l(2) optimizations, which are solved based on separable surrogate functions (SSF) technique. We evaluate the proposed method using the dataset from BCI competition III. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the SRC method.

Our method arranges the spatial filters and Fisher classifiers in the form of a binary tree whereby N-1 spatial filters and N-1 Fisher classifiers are calculated for N class recognition. This is fewer than must be calculated in other methods (e. g. one-versus-rest, OVR). This makes the overall classification procedure less redundant. Simulation results show that BCSP has better performance than the OVR scheme and outperforms the three best teams in the 2008 BCI-competition.

Therefore, studying emotion is indispensable. This paper aims at finding the relationships between EEG signals and human emotions based on emotion recognition experiments that are conducted using the commercial Emotiv EPOC headset to record EEG signals while participants are watching emotional movies. Alpha, beta, delta and theta bands filtered from the recorded EEG signals are used to train and evaluate classifiers with different learning techniques including Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbour, Naive Bayes and AdaBoost.

J	Falzon, O; Camilleri, KP; Muscat, J				Falzon, Owen; Camilleri, Kenneth P.; Muscat, Joseph			The analytic common spatial patterns method for EEG-based BCI data	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT; BRAIN; FILTERS; CLASSIFICATION; REVEAL	One of the most important stages in a brain-computer interface (BCI) system is that of extracting features that can reliably discriminate data recorded during different user states. A popular technique used for feature extraction in BCIs is the common spatial patterns (CSP) method, which provides a set of spatial filters that optimally discriminate between two classes of data in the least-squares sense. The method also yields a set of spatial patterns that are associated with the most relevant activity for distinguishing between the two classes. The high recognition rates that have been achieved with the method have led to its widespread adoption in the field. Here, a variant of the CSP method that considers EEG data in its complex form is described. By explicitly considering the amplitude and phase information in the data, the analytic CSP (ACSP) technique can provide a more comprehensive picture of the underlying activity, resulting in improved classification accuracies and more informative spatial patterns than the conventional CSP method. In this paper, we elaborate on the theoretical aspects of the ACSP algorithm and demonstrate the advantages of the method through a number of simulations and through tests on EEG data.

COMBINATION OF HETEROGENEOUS EEG FEATURE EXTRACTION METHODS AND STACKED SEQUENTIAL LEARNING FOR SLEEP STAGE CLASSIFICATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Sleep stage classification; EEG; feature extraction; feature selection; support vector machines	AUTOMATIC DETECTION; MUTUAL INFORMATION; COHERENCE; DIAGNOSIS; SELECTION; NETWORKS; EPILEPSY; SEIZURE	This work proposes a methodology for sleep stage classification based on two main approaches: the combination of features extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG) signal by different extraction methods, and the use of stacked sequential learning to incorporate predicted information from nearby sleep stages in the final classifier. The feature extraction methods used in this work include three representative ways of extracting information from EEG signals: Hjorth features, wavelet transformation and symbolic representation. Feature selection was then used to evaluate the relevance of individual features from this set of methods. Stacked sequential learning uses a second-layer classifier to improve the classification by using previous and posterior first-layer predicted stages as additional features providing information to the model. Results show that both approaches enhance the sleep stage classification accuracy rate, thus leading to a closer approximation to the experts' opinion.	[Fernandes, C.

Four subthreshold acoustic frequency stimulus patterns are presented to the subjects in an oddball paradigm allowing for "aharesponses" generation to the attended targets. This allows for successful implementation of the bone-conduction based brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm. The concept is confirmed with seven subjects in online bone-conducted auditory Morse-code patterns spelling BCI paradigm. We report also brain electrophysiological signal processing and classification steps taken to achieve the successful BCI paradigm. We also present a finding of the response latency variability in a function of stimulus difficulty.

Methods: The proposed method consisted in the k-NN classification with a reference set obtained using expert knowledge, the morphology of the EEG patterns and the condition for their synchronization. The decision rules were constructed and evaluated using 24 h EEG records in ten patients. Results: The sensitivity, specificity and selectivity of the method were 0.88 +/- 0.10, 0.81 +/- 0.13 and 0.42 +/- 0.16, respectively. SWSW patterns' recruitment was strictly dependent on anesthetic concentration. SWSW patterns evoked by different types of anesthetics expressed different characteristics. Conclusions: Synchronization criterion and adequately selected morphological features of "slow wave" were sufficient to achieve the high sensitivity and specificity of the method. Significance: The monitoring of SWSW patterns is important in view of possible side effects of volatile anesthetics. The analysis of SWSW patterns' recruitment and morphology could be helpful in the diagnosis of the anesthesia effects on the CNS. (C) 2012 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Results are evaluated for preterm infants with normal neurological follow-up at 2 years. The detection algorithm (MATLABR (R)) for burst, IBI and continuous pattern is based on selection by amplitude, time span, number of channels and numbers of active electrodes. Annotations of two neurophysiologists were used to determine threshold values. The training set consisted of EEG recordings of four preterm infants with postmenstrual age (PMA, gestational age + postnatal age) of 29-34 weeks. Optimal threshold values were based on overall highest sensitivity. For evaluation, both observers verified detections in an independent dataset of four EEG recordings with comparable PMA. Algorithm performance was assessed by calculation of sensitivity and positive predictive value. The results of algorithm evaluation are as follows: sensitivity values of 90% +/- 6%, 80% +/- 9% and 97% +/- 5% for burst, IBI and continuous patterns, respectively. Corresponding positive predictive values were 88% +/- 8%, 96% +/- 3% and 85% +/- 15%, respectively. In conclusion, the algorithm showed high sensitivity and positive predictive values for bursts, IBIs and continuous patterns in preterm EEG. Computer-assisted analysis of EEG may allow objective and reproducible analysis for clinical treatment.	[Jennekens, Ward; Wijn, Pieter F.

To investigate whether musical engagement can be monitored, we developed an experimental protocol using the mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) paradigm in which participants make expressive rhythmic arm gestures to encourage and/or index musical engagement. Participants communicate the feeling pulse of music they are hearing via simple rhythmic U-shaped back-and-forth hand/arm 'conducting' gesture cycles that animate, in real time, the mirroring movement of a spot of light on a video display in front of them. Participants are asked to imagine that this display is also being viewed remotely by a deaf friend to whom they are attempting to communicate the feeling of the music they are hearing. In an Engaged condition, listeners are encouraged to fully engage themselves in this musical/emotional communication task. In a Not Engaged condition, a concurrent internal arithmetic distractor task is introduced to induce less fully engaged listening. Here, we report results of training a classifier using a frequency-based common spatial patterns (FBCSP) approach to correctly distinguish Engaged and Not Engaged conditions from concurrently recorded EEG data. Here the approach gave 67% classification accuracy across subjects (versus 50% chance), and 85% accuracy within subjects, cross-validated using a blockwise paradigm.

Neonatal seizures are particularly difficult to identify on the basis of clinical observation alone; diagnosis is greatly facilitated by CEEG monitoring. There is building evidence to suggest which neonates are at highest risk for seizures, and how CEEG can aid diagnosis. For the neurophysiologist, the unique features of neonatal seizures can distinguish them from nonictal patterns. These features include duration, location, morphology, and evolution. At the extreme, very frequent or prolonged neonatal seizures constitute status epilepticus. There is no consensus definition for neonatal status epilepticus, although the proposed criteria share some features. This article reviews available evidence to guide the application and interpretation of CEEG in the diagnosis of neonatal seizures and status epilepticus.

The main purpose for BCIs is to enable communication for people with severe disabilities. Spelling is one of the first BCI application, it corresponds to the main communication mean for people who are unable to speak. While spelling can be the most basic application it remains a benchmark for communication applications and one challenge in the BCI community for some patients. This paper proposes a review of the current main strategies, and their limitations, for spelling words. It includes recent BCIs based on P300, steady-state visual evoked potentials and motor imagery. By considering some challenges in BCI spellers and virtual keyboards, some pragmatic issues are pointed out to eliminate false hopes about BCI for both disabled and healthy people.

Here we have developed a wavelet decomposition to reduce a little bit the dimensionality to reduce a little bit the dimensionality and PCA(Principal Components Analysis) to accurate the result in a better way(only two features representation). After that the EEG signals, with their respective characteristics and representation has been able to train and test some linear and non-linear and non-linear classifiers such as (Parzen, k-NN, Radial Basis Neural Network, linear and non-linear perceptron and so on.) This evaluation is an analysis of general EEG's behavior signals with this kind of characterization and classification processes repectively.

Learning to Make Feelings: Expressive Performance as a Part of a Machine Learning Tool for Sound-Based Emotion Control	FROM SOUNDS TO MUSIC AND EMOTIONS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Symposium on Computer Music Modeling and Retrieval (CMMR) - Music and Emotions	JUN 19-22, 2012	Queen Mary Univ, London, ENGLAND	Ctr Digital Mus, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Lab Mecanique & Acoustique	Queen Mary Univ	Music; Emotion; Bio-signals; Affective Computing; Music Therapy; Medicine; Machine Learning; Algorithmic Composition; Computer Expressive Performance	MUSIC; SYNCHRONIZATION	We propose to significantly extend our work in EEG-based emotion detection for automated expressive performances of algorithmically composed music for affective communication and induction. This new system involves music composed and expressively performed in real-time to induce specific affective states, based on the detection of affective state in a human listener. Machine learning algorithms will learn: (1) how to use biosensors such as EEG to detect the user's current emotional state; and (2) how to use algorithmic performance and composition to induce certain trajectories through affective states. In other words the system will attempt to adapt so that it can - in real-time - turn a certain user from depressed to happy, or from stressed to relaxed, or (if they like horror movies!) from relaxed to fearful. Expressive performance is key to this process as it has been shown to increase the emotional impact of affectively-based algorithmic composition. In other words if a piece is composed by computer rules to communicate an emotion of happiness, applying expressive performance rules to humanize the piece will increase the likelihood it is perceived as happy. As well as giving a project overview, a first step of this research is presented here: a machine learning system using case-based reasoning which attempts to learn from a user how themes of different affective types combine sequentially to communicate emotions.

EXTRACT; RHODIOLA-ROSEA; BRAIN ACTIVITY; GINKGO-BILOBA; DOUBLE-BLIND; RADIOELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; FINGERPRINTS; REFLECTION	Herbal extracts targeting at the brain remain a continuous challenge to pharmacology. Usually, a number of different animal tests have to be performed in order to find a potential clinical use. Due to manifold possibly active ingredients biochemical approaches are difficult. A more holistic approach using a neurophysiological technique has been developed earlier in order to characterise synthetic drugs. Stereotactic implantation of four semi-microelectrodes into frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and reticular formation of rats allowed continuous wireless monitoring of field potentials (EEG) before and after drug intake. After frequency analysis (Fast Fourier Transformation) electric power was calculated for 6 ranges (delta, theta, alphal, alpha2, betal and beta2). Data from 14 synthetic drugs - tested earlier and representative for different clinical indications - were taken for construction of discriminant functions showing the projection of the frequency patterns in a six-dimensional graph. Quantitative analysis of the EEG frequency pattern from the depth of the brain succeeded in discrimination of drug effects according to their known clinical indication (Dimpfel and Schober, 2003). Extracts from Valerian root, Ginkgo leaves, Paullinia seed, Hop strobile, Rhodiola rosea root and Sideritis scardica herb were tested now under identical conditions. Classification of these extracts based on the matrix from synthetic drugs revealed that Valerian root and hop induced a pattern reminiscent of physiological sleep. Ginkgo and Paullinia appeared in close neighbourhood of stimulatory drugs like caffeine or to an analgesic profile (tramadol). Rhodiola and Sideritis developed similar frequency patterns comparable to a psychostimulant drug (methylphenidate) as well to an antidepressive drug (paroxetine). (C) 2013 The Author.

Methods: Fourteen able-bodied users participated in 10 sessions, plus a follow-up session. Users were trained to control an EEG-based 4-class BCI with the mental tasks, word association, mental subtraction, spatial navigation, and motor imagery. Results: Eight users reached mean accuracies of 61-72% and managed to control all 4 classes above chance in single-sessions. Performance and brain patterns stayed stable over 10 weeks without training. Motor imagery showed the best performance and most distinct brain patterns. Participants' fear of incompetence decreased while the quality of their imagery and task ease increased over sessions. The evaluation of feedback differed between tasks and correlated with performance. Conclusion: Users can control a real-time 4-class BCI, driven by distinct mental tasks, with stable performance over months. However, general performance was rather low for effective BCI control in daily life. Possibilities for future optimizations to increase performance are discussed. Significance: The evaluation of alternatives to motor imagery, long-term BCI use, and psychological variables is important to improve usability for mental imagery-based BCIs.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) and peripheral physiological signals of 32 participants were recorded as each watched 40 one-minute long excerpts of music videos. Participants rated each video in terms of the levels of arousal, valence, like/dislike, dominance, and familiarity. For 22 of the 32 participants, frontal face video was also recorded. A novel method for stimuli selection is proposed using retrieval by affective tags from the last.fm website, video highlight detection, and an online assessment tool. An extensive analysis of the participants' ratings during the experiment is presented. Correlates between the EEG signal frequencies and the participants' ratings are investigated. Methods and results are presented for single-trial classification of arousal, valence, and like/ dislike ratings using the modalities of EEG, peripheral physiological signals, and multimedia content analysis. Finally, decision fusion of the classification results from different modalities is performed. The data set is made publicly available and we encourage other researchers to use it for testing their own affective state estimation methods.

Therefore, we aim at developing electroencephalogram (EEG) based learning environments adapting to learners individual WL online. To achieve this goal efficient classification methods are necessary. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can accurately classify WL using within-task classification, but within-task classification is not feasible in complex learning environments. Therefore, the present study examined cross-task classification accuracies for SVMs trained on EEG-signals, recorded while participants (N=21) had to solve three working memory tasks. While within-task classification accuracies were high for WM tasks (average: 95% - 97 %), cross-task classification performances were not significant over chance level. Since cross-task classification is a necessary step towards developing generalized classifiers, we will discuss the benefits and drawbacks as well as possible enhancements in the course of this paper to use it as an effective approach for learning environments.

The common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm tackles this problem as feature extractor in binary BMI setups in which a number of spatial projections are computed while maximizing the variance of one class and minimizing of the other. Recent advances in data acquisition systems and sensor design now make recording the neural activity of the brain with dense electrode grids a possibility. However, high density recordings also pose new challenges such as overfitting to data as the number of recording channels increases dramatically compared to the number of training trials. In this study, we tackle this problem by constructing a sparse CSP algorithm through recursive weight elimination (CSP RWE), in which the spatial projections are computed using a subset of the recording channels. The sparse projections are expected to yield increased robustness and eliminate overfitting. We show promising results towards the classification of multichannel Electrocorticogram (ECoG) and Electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets with CSP RWE for a BMI.

This paper presents the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) algorithm to optimize the subject-specific frequency band for CSP on Datasets 2a and 2b of the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Competition IV. Dataset 2a comprised 4 classes of 22 channels EEG data from 9 subjects, and Dataset 2b comprised 2 classes of 3 bipolar channels EEG data from 9 subjects. Multi-class extensions to FBCSP are also presented to handle the 4-class EEG data in Dataset 2a, namely, Divide-and-Conquer (DC), Pair-Wise (PW), and One-Versus-Rest (OVR) approaches. Two feature selection algorithms are also presented to select discriminative CSP features on Dataset 2b, namely, the Mutual Information-based Best Individual Feature (MIBIF) algorithm, and the Mutual Information-based Rough Set Reduction (MIRSR) algorithm. The single-trial classification accuracies were presented using 10 x 10-fold cross-validations on the training data and session-to-session transfer on the evaluation data from both datasets. Disclosure of the test data labels after the BCI Competition IV showed that the FBCSP algorithm performed relatively the best among the other submitted algorithms and yielded a mean kappa value of 0.569 and 0.600 across all subjects in Datasets 2a and 2b respectively.

However, it is known that the nature of motor imagery-related electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is non-stationary and highly variable over time and frequency. In this paper, we propose a novel method of finding a discriminative time- and frequency-dependent spatial filter, which we call 'non-homogeneous filter.' We adaptively select bases of spatial filters over time and frequency. By taking both temporal and spectral features of EEGs in finding a spatial filter into account it is beneficial to be able to consider non-stationarity of EEG signals. In order to consider changes of ERD/ERS patterns over the time-frequency domain, we devise a spectrally and temporally weighted classification method via statistical analysis.

Among methods proposed to address non-stationarity, adaptation is a promising method. In this study, an adaptive extreme learning machine (AELM) is proposed to update the initial classifier from the calibration session by using chunks of EEG data from the evaluation session whereby the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is used to extract the most discriminative features. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is on motor imagery data collected from 12 healthy subjects during a calibration session and an evaluation session on a separate day. The results from the proposed AELM were compared with non-adaptive ELM and SVM classifiers. The results showed that AELM was significantly better (p= 0.03). Moreover, the results also showed that accumulating the evaluation session data and useing them for adapting the classifier will significantly improve the performance (p= 0.001). Hence, the proposed AELM is effective in addressing the non-stationarity of EEG signal for online BCI systems.

Machine learning based seizure prediction method shows great performance by doing pattern recognition on high-dimensional bivariate synchronization features. However, the computation loading of the machine learning based method may be too high to meet wearable or implantable devices with the power and area constraints. In this work, channel selection is proposed to reduce the channel number from 22 to less than 6 channels and therefore more than 93.73% of the computation loading is saved through the method. The best result shows successful rate of 60.6% in 3-channel cases of ECoG database and successful rate of 70% in 3-channel cases of EEG database.

When represented in the frequency domain, the multichannel EEG signal can be considered as a two-directional spatio-spectral data of high dimensionality. Extraction of salient features using feature extractors such as the commonly used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is an essential step for the classification of these signals. However, multichannel EEG is naturally in matrix-variate format, while LDA and other traditional feature extractors are designed for vector-variate input. Consequently, these methods require a prior vectorization of the EEG signals, which ignores the inherent matrix-variate structure in the data and leads to high computational complexity. A matrix-variate formulation of LDA have previously been proposed. However, this heuristic formulation does not provide the Bayes optimality benefits of LDA. The current paper proposes a Bayes optimal matrix-variate formulation of LDA based on a matrix-variate model for the spatio-spectral EEG patterns. The proposed formulation also provides a strategy to select the most significant features among the different rows and columns.

The detection of the preictal state is difficult due to its similarity to the ictal state. We present a framework for using principal components analysis (PCA) and a classification method for improving the detection rate of epileptic classes. To unearth the nonlinearity and high dimensionality in epileptic signals, we extract principal component features using PCA on the 15 high-order spectra (HOS) features extracted from the EEG data. We evaluate eight classifiers in the framework using true positive (TP) rate and area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC). We show that a simple logistic regression model achieves the highest TP rate for class "preictal" at 97.5% and the TP rate on average at 96.8% with PCA variance percentages selected at 100%, which also achieves the most AUC at 99.5%.

The proposed framework closely integrates spatial feature selection and weighting within the classification task itself. Spatial weights are considered as hyper-parameters to be learned by a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The resulting spatially weighted SVM (sw-SVM) is then designed to maximize the margin between classes whilst minimizing the generalization error.

Some patients suffering from severe neuromuscular diseases have difficulty controlling not only their bodies but also their eyes. Since these patients have difficulty gazing at specific visual stimuli or keeping their eyes open for a long time, they are unable to use the typical steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. In this study, we introduce a new paradigm for SSVEP-based BCI, which can be potentially suitable for disabled individuals with impaired oculomotor function. Approach. The proposed electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI system allows users to express their binary intentions without needing to open their eyes. A pair of glasses with two light emitting diodes flickering at different frequencies was used to present visual stimuli to participants with their eyes closed, and we classified the recorded EEG patterns in the online experiments conducted with five healthy participants and one patient with severe amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Main results. Through offline experiments performed with 11 participants, we confirmed that human SSVEP could be modulated by visual selective attention to a specific light stimulus penetrating through the eyelids. Furthermore, the recorded EEG patterns could be classified with accuracy high enough for use in a practical BCI system. After customizing the parameters of the proposed SSVEP-based BCI paradigm based on the offline analysis results, binary intentions of five healthy participants were classified in real time. The average information transfer rate of our online experiments reached 10.83 bits min(-1). A preliminary online experiment conducted with an ALS patient showed a classification accuracy of 80%. Significance. The results of our offline and online experiments demonstrated the feasibility of our proposed SSVEP-based BCI paradigm. It is expected that our 'eyes-closed' SSVEP-based BCI system can be potentially used for communication of disabled individuals with impaired oculomotor function.

J	Feess, D; Krell, MM; Metzen, JH				Feess, David; Krell, Mario M.; Metzen, Jan H.			Comparison of Sensor Selection Mechanisms for an ERP-Based Brain-Computer Interface	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CHANNEL SELECTION; BCI	A major barrier for a broad applicability of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) is the large number of EEG sensor electrodes typically used. The necessity for this results from the fact that the relevant information for the BCI is often spread over the scalp in complex patterns that differ depending on subjects and application scenarios. Recently, a number of methods have been proposed to determine an individual optimal sensor selection. These methods have, however, rarely been compared against each other or against any type of baseline. In this paper, we review several selection approaches and propose one additional selection criterion based on the evaluation of the performance of a BCI system using a reduced set of sensors. We evaluate the methods in the context of a passive BCI system that is designed to detect a P300 event-related potential and compare the performance of the methods against randomly generated sensor constellations. For a realistic estimation of the reduced system's performance we transfer sensor constellations found on one experimental session to a different session for evaluation. We identified notable (and unanticipated) differences among the methods and could demonstrate that the best method in our setup is able to reduce the required number of sensors considerably. Though our application focuses on EEG data, all presented algorithms and evaluation schemes can be transferred to any binary classification task on sensor arrays.

Greedy solutions for the construction of sparse spatial and spatio-spectral filters in brain computer interface applications	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Brain computer interface; Common spatial pattern; Sparse; Greedy search	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SINGLE TRIAL EEG; CLASSIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION; BCI	In the original formulation of common spatial pattern (CSP), all recording channels are combined when extracting the variance as input features for a brain computer interface (BCI). This results in overfitting and robustness problems of the constructed system. Here, we introduce a sparse CSP method in which only a subset of all available channels is linearly combined when extracting the features, resulting in improved generalization in classification. We propose a greedy search based generalized eigenvalue decomposition approach for identifying multiple sparse eigenvectors to compute the spatial projections. We evaluate the performance of the proposed sparse CSP method in binary classification problems using electrocorticogram (ECoG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets of brain computer interface competition 2005. We show that the results obtained by sparse CSP outperform those obtained by traditional (non-sparse) CSP. When averaged over five subjects in the EEG dataset, the classification error is 12.3% with average sparseness level of 11.6 compared to 18.4% error obtained by the traditional CSP with 118 channels. The classification error is 10% with sparseness level of 7 compared to that of 13% obtained by the traditional CSP using 64 channels in the ECoG dataset. Furthermore, we explored the effectiveness of the proposed sparse methods for extracting sparse common spatio-spectral patterns (CSSP). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Technological advances have resulted in significant amounts of such data in high-throughput disciplines, including EEG and iEEG data for effective and efficient healthcare informatics, and decision support. Most data analytics and data-mining algorithms are effective in capturing global trends, but fail to capture localized behavioral changes in large temporal data sets. We present a two-step algorithmic methodology to uncover temporal patterns and exploiting them for an efficient and accurate decision support system. This methodology aids the discovery of previously unknown, nontrivial, and potentially useful temporal patterns for enhanced patient-specific clinical decision support with high degrees of sensitivity and specificity. Classification results on multivariate time series iEEG data for epileptic seizure detection also demonstrate the efficacy and accuracy of the technique to uncover interesting and effective domain class-specific temporal patterns.

A human-machine system that could benefit from brain-based task support is the driver-car interaction system. To investigate the feasibility of such a system to detect changes in visuomotor workload, 34 drivers were exposed to several levels of driving demand in a driving simulator. Driving demand was manipulated by varying driving speed and by asking the drivers to comply to individually set lane keeping performance targets. Differences in the individual driver's workload levels were classified by applying the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis to frequency filtered electroencephalogram (EEG) data during an off line classification study. Several frequency ranges, EEG cap configurations, and condition pairs were explored. It was found that classifications were most accurate when based on high frequencies, larger electrode sets, and the frontal electrodes. Depending on these factors, classification accuracies across participants reached about 95% on average. The association between high accuracies and high frequencies suggests that part of the underlying information did not originate directly from neuronal activity. Nonetheless, average classification accuracies up to 75-80% were obtained from the lower EEG ranges that are likely to reflect neuronal activity. For a system designer, this implies that a passive BCI system may use several frequency ranges for workload classifications.	[Dijksterhuis, Chris; de Waard, Dick; Brookhuis, Karel A.; Mulder, Ben L.

Cognitive or Mental State detection has its advantages in asynchronous BCI where the subjects are involved to the interface in response to some external stimulation. But the main problem is feature extraction and classification for different Cognitive State. In this research work, four Cognitive States Resting State (RS), Thought (TH), Memory (MR) and Emotion (EM) have been detected by collecting, processing and classifying Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from six subjects. EEG signals were analyzed to find out the features such as spectral Power, frequency band combination ratios and linear combination of power of EEG frequency bands. A three layer BP neural network was structured to use as classifier for pattern recognition. Results indicate that different Cognitive States were perfectly identified with higher classification performance and classification performance remains approximately invariant to the number of NN hidden layer units.

In general, the self-regulated neural activation patterns are used in the current BCI systems involving the repetitive trainings with feedback for an attempt to achieve a high-quality control performance. With the limitation posed by the training procedure in most BCI studies, the present work aims to investigate whether directly modulating the neural activity by using an external method could facilitate the BCI control. We designed an experimental paradigm that combines anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with a motor imagery (MI)-based feedback EEG BCI system. Thirty-two young and healthy human subjects were randomly assigned to the real and sham stimulation groups to evaluate the effect of tDCS-induced EEG pattern changes on BCI classification accuracy. Results showed that the anodal tDCS obviously induces sensorimotor rhythm (SMR)-related event-related desynchronization (ERD) pattern changes in the upper-mu (10-14 Hz) and beta (14-26 Hz) rhythm components. Both the online and offline BCI classification results demonstrate that the enhancing ERD patterns could conditionally improve BCI performance. This pilot study suggests that the tDCS is a promising method to help the users to develop reliable BCI control strategy in a relatively short time.

However, interrater agreement (IRA) of the revised terminology has not been investigated. Methods: After a brief tutorial, investigators of ICU EEG research centers (n = 16) took an 82-question EEG certification test comprising 10-second EEG samples, which assessed the use of main term 1 (pattern location), main term 2 (pattern type), and modifiers from the most recently revised terminology. Results: Kappa values for main terms 1 and 2 were 0.87 and 0.92, respectively. Agreement was 93% for determination of amplitude and 80% for determination of frequency. Kappa values for each of the "plus" modifiers (fast, rhythmic, and sharp/spike activity) were 0.54, 0.62, and 0.16 respectively. Conclusions: Main terms 1 and 2 have high IRA and are reasonable for use in multicenter research. There is a suggestion that assessment of amplitude has good reliability, while assessment of frequency may have less reliability. The fast and rhythmic "plus" modifiers have moderate IRA, while sharp/spike modifier has only slight IRA implying that further refinement and assessment of terminology modifiers may be necessary.

In the method, EEG and EMG are adaptively decomposed into product functions (PFs), and the PFs in different characteristic frequency bands are quantitatively described by the multiscale entropy to consist a multiple features information space (MFIS). Then, a fusion model based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is established to realize the mapping from the EEG-EMG IMFS to human movement intention (HIM) by analyzing the MFIS. The HMI can be identified by the proposed model. 20 patients with perceptual-motor dysfunction of lower limbs (including 10 stroke patients in chronic phase (stroke) and 10 patients with peripheral nerve injury (PNI)) and 10 healthy people (HP) are enrolled. All subjects performed a knee extension and flexion task in which EEG and EMG of the quadriceps femoris and gastrocnemius muscle are synchronously recorded. Applying the above method, the feature of EEG-EMG are extracted and training in three groups (group 1: only EEG as input; group 2: only EMG as input; group 3: EEG-EMG as input) are performed. The results illustrate that the identification accuracy for group 1 can arrive 69.2% (stroke), 75.4% (PNI), 85.3% (HP); the identification accuracy for group 2 can arrive 80.5% (stroke), 79.6% (PNI), 93.4% (HP); the identification accuracy for group 3 can arrive 84.4% (stroke), 85.3% (PNI), 98.9% (HP). Conclusion is obtained that the human movement intention is reflected complementarily by EEG and EMG features. Especially for the perceptual-motor dysfunction patients, the algorithm can improve the identification accuracy on the human movement intention, and can be helpful in rehabilitation training process based on biological feedback control.

Three sets of physiological time series are examined, EEG and ECG recordings together with measurements of neck movement. Comparisons of reliability estimates from test-retest studies with measures of feature importance from classification tasks suggest that low reliability can be used to exclude irrelevant features prior to classifier training. By removing features with low reliability an unnecessary degradation of the classifier accuracy may be avoided. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sampled sinusoidal stimulation profile and multichannel fuzzy logic classification for monitor-based phase-coded SSVEP brain-computer interfacing	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							VISUAL-EVOKED POTENTIALS; BCI; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES; SELECTION; SYSTEMS	Objective. The performance and usability of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can be improved by new paradigms, stimulation methods, decoding strategies, sensor technology etc. In this study we introduce new stimulation and decoding methods for electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCIs that have targets flickering at the same frequency but with different phases. Approach. The phase information is estimated from the EEG data, and used for target command decoding. All visual stimulation is done on a conventional (60-Hz) LCD screen. Instead of the 'on/off' visual stimulation, commonly used in phase-coded BCI, we propose one based on a sampled sinusoidal intensity profile. In order to fully exploit the circular nature of the evoked phase response, we introduce a filter feature selection procedure based on circular statistics and propose a fuzzy logic classifier designed to cope with circular information from multiple channels jointly. Main results. We show that the proposed visual stimulation enables us not only to encode more commands under the same conditions, but also to obtain EEG responses with a more stable phase. We also demonstrate that the proposed decoding approach outperforms existing ones, especially for the short time windows used. Significance. The work presented here shows how to overcome some of the limitations of screen-based visual stimulation. The superiority of the proposed decoding approach demonstrates the importance of preserving the circularity of the data during the decoding stage.

Single-trial decoding of auditory novelty responses facilitates the detection of residual consciousness	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Vegetative state; Unresponsive wakefulness syndrome; Minimally conscious state; Multivariate pattern classifier; Decoding; EEG; MEG	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CORTICAL EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; VEGETATIVE STATE; UNRESPONSIVE WAKEFULNESS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; REM-SLEEP; COMA; RECOVERY; DISORDERS	Detecting residual consciousness in unresponsive patients is a major clinical concern and a challenge for theoretical neuroscience. To tackle this issue, we recently designed a paradigm that dissociates two electro-encephalographic (EEG) responses to auditory novelty. Whereas a local change in pitch automatically elicits a mismatch negativity (MMN), a change in global sound sequence leads to a late P300b response. The latter component is thought to be present only when subjects consciously perceive the global novelty. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to detect because individual variability is high, especially in clinical recordings. Here, we show that multivariate pattern classifiers can extract subject-specific EEG patterns and predict single-trial local or global novelty responses. We first validate our method with 38 high-density EEG, MEG and intracranial EEG recordings. We empirically demonstrate that our approach circumvents the issues associated with multiple comparisons and individual variability while improving the statistics. Moreover, we confirm in control subjects that local responses are robust to distraction whereas global responses depend on attention. We then investigate 104 vegetative state (VS), minimally conscious state (MCS) and conscious state (CS) patients recorded with high-density EEG. For the local response, the proportion of significant decoding scores (M = 60%) does not vary with the state of consciousness. By contrast, for the global response, only 14% of the VS patients' EEG recordings presented a significant effect, compared to 31% in MCS patients' and 52% in CS patients'. In conclusion, single-trial multivariate decoding of novelty responses provides valuable information in non-communicating patients and paves the way towards real-time monitoring of the state of consciousness.

As ICA needs physiological knowledge about the potential changes of task-related EEG signals to select filters manually, this paper proposes to acquire filter information from the spatial filters constructed by CSP, then the improved ICA is compared with CSP from several aspects on BCI competition III dataset IVa as well as dataset of left and right hand motor imagery from our independent experiment. Experimental results suggest the proposed ICA has good classification performance and is better on robustness and flexibility, while CSP is simpler and more suitable for multi-channel EEG.

Of the one-hundred-sixty enrolled patients (2006-2010), 115 had complete data (58 boys, median age 3.6 years). Distinct EEG findings were intermittent rhythmic delta waves (83.5%), interictal epileptiform discharges (74.2%), intermittent rhythmic theta waves (43.5%), and posterior rhythm slowing (43.5%). Centro-occipital and centro-temporal delta waves decreased with age (p=0.01, p=0.03). There were no specific correlations between EEG patterns and genotypes. A classification tree allowed the prediction of deletions class-1 (5.9 Mb) in patients with intermittent theta waves in < 50% of EEG and interictal epileptiform abnormalities; UPD, UBE3A mutation or imprinting defects in patients with intermittent theta in < 50% of EEG without interictal epileptiform abnormalities; deletions class-2 (5.0 Mb) in patients with > 50% theta and normal posterior rhythm; atypical deletions in patients with > 50% theta but abnormal posterior rhythm. EEG patterns are important biomarkers in Angelman syndrome and may suggest the underlying genetic etiology. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

From extracted EEG features and audio features, we estimate segments including vocals based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) by separately utilizing these two features. Furthermore, the final classification results are obtained by integrating these estimation results based on supervised learning from multiple experts. Therefore, our method realizes multimodal estimation of segments including vocals in music pieces. Experimental results show the improvement of our method over the methods utilizing only EEG or audio features.

For the BMI rehabilitation, we construct a Electroencephalogram(EEG)-Exoskeleton robot system, where the exoskeleton robot is connected to the EEG system so that the users can control the exoskeleton robot by using their brain activities. We use a classification method which considers covariance matrices of measured EEG signals as inputs to decode brain activities. The decoded brain activities are used to control exoskeleton movements. In this study, we consider assisting the stand-up movement which is one of the most frequently appeared movements in daily life and also a standard movement as a rehabilitation training. To assist the stand-up movement, we develop a force control model which takes dynamics of tendon string into account for the pneumatic-electric hybrid actuation system used in our exoskeleton robot. The results show that the exoskeleton robot successfully assisted user stand-up movements, where the assist system was activated by the decoded brain activities.

Adaptive estimation of EEG for subject-specific reactive band identification and improved ERD detection	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						BMFLC; EEG; Subject reactive band; ERD detection; Adaptive filtering; BCI	COMPUTER INTERFACE BCI; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION; PATTERNS; ERD/ERS	The event-related desynchronization (ERD) is a magnitude decrease phenomenon which can be found in electroencephalogram (EEG) mu-rhythm in a certain narrow frequency band (reactive band) during different sensorimotor tasks and stimuli. The success of ERD detection depends on proper identification of subject specific reactive band. An adaptive algorithm band limited multiple Fourier linear combiner (BMFLC) is employed in this paper for identification of subject specific reactive band for real-time ERD detection. With the time-frequency mapping obtained with BMFLC, a procedure is formulated for reactive band identification. Improved classification is obtained by applying this method to a standard BCI data set compared to traditional ERD detection methods. Study conducted with 8 subjects drawn from BCI Competition IV data set show a 22% increase in ERD and 10% improvement in classification with the proposed method compared to standard ERD based classification.

One of the techniques of feature selection often used by BCI researches are genetic algorithms (GA). This approach, in its classic form, allows obtaining a feature set which gives the high classification precision, however, the dimension of this set is often still too large to create a reliable classifier. The paper presents a modified version of genetic algorithm, which is capable of choosing feature sets of a slightly lower classification precision but significantly smaller number of features. The practical application of the proposed algorithm will be presented via a benchmark EEG set submitted to the second BCI Competition (data set III - motor imaginary).

Unsupervised learning encompasses many other techniques that seek to summarize and explain key features of the data. One form of unsupervised learning is blind source separation (BSS). BSS is a class of computational data analysis techniques for revealing hidden factors that underlie sets of measurements or signals. BSS assumes a statistical model whereby the observed multivariate data, typically given as a large database of samples, are assumed to be linear or nonlinear mixtures of some unknown latent variables. The mixing coefficients are also unknown. Sometimes more prior information about the sources is available or is induced into the model, such as the form of their probability densities, their spectral contents, etc. Then the term blind is often replaced by semiblind. This chapter reports the semi BSS machine learning applications on audio and bio signal processing.

To reduce this unnecessary information in EEG signal processing, we applied an extension version of common spatial pattern (CSP). The original CSP has been widely used to extract relevant spatial features from EEG signals. However, one of the CSP limitations is occurred when it concentrated on artifacts and variances sources, which exceeded the variance of endogenous component of the brain, instead of extracting the sources that provide subject's intention. Therefore, we proposed to add more parameter for separating invariance and variance in EEGs. To reduce the variant parts of signal in EEGs, we applied invariant common spatial pattern (iCSP) to maximize one class in the same time minimize other class and invariant sources. Based on neurophysiological knowledge, we made some strong weights to special electrodes related to our experimental paradigm. The raw EEG signals were recorded by auditory stimuli with 3 different frequencies cued for real hand movement and ignored noise. The right or left actual hand movements-based EEG signal states were classified by using linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

A new processing algorithm based on filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) is presented. Analytic common spatial pattern (ACSP) and adaptive classification are introduced to investigate whether they can improve the performance. Four versions of FBCSP, namely, common spatial pattern (CSP) and ACSP with static or adaptive classification are studied. The session-to-session performances of the proposed approaches are evaluated on a 4-class problem posed in the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in comparison to the winner of the BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a as well as other more recent studies using this dataset. Adaptive classification yields a higher kappa value of 0.61 compared to 0.57 for multiclass FBCSP algorithm. ACSP further improves the performance achieving a mean kappa of 0.63.

Recent advances in neuroscience indicate that multiple brain regions can be activated during motor imagery. The signal propagation among the regions can give rise to spurious effects in identifying event-related desynchronization/synchronization for discriminative motor imagery detection in conventional feature extraction methods. Particularly, we propose that computational models which account for both signal propagation and volume conduction effects of the source neuronal activities can more accurately describe EEG during the specific brain activities and lead to more effective feature extraction. To this end, we devise a unified model for joint learning of signal propagation and spatial patterns. The preliminary results obtained with real-world motor imagery EEG data sets confirm that the new methodology can improve classification accuracy with statistical significance.

In this paper, we compared classification performance among the various combinations of motor imagery tasks, toward the multi-dimensional control of motor imagery BCI. We used EEG motor imagery dataset of 99 subjects. Common spatial patterns (CSP) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were applied to extract features and to classify motor imagery tasks. 10x10 fold cross validation was used to evaluate classification accuracies through large dataset. For two-class discrimination, we compared the classification accuracy of the results between combinations: both feet and one hand, and both hand and one hand. From these results, using both feet motor imagery task showed 3% higher accuracy than using both hand motor imagery task (p<0.01). For four-class discrimination, the compared result of classification between left/right/both hand/rest and left/right/both feet/rest showed that there was no significant difference between above combinations.

J	Jakaite, L; Schetinin, V; Maple, C				Jakaite, Livija; Schetinin, Vitaly; Maple, Carsten			Bayesian Assessment of Newborn Brain Maturity from Two-Channel Sleep Electroencephalograms	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							HIGH-RISK INFANTS; PREMATURE-INFANTS; FEATURE-SELECTION; MATURATION; EEG; CLASSIFICATION	Newborn brain maturity can be assessed by expert analysis of maturity-related patterns recognizable in polysomnograms. Since 36 weeks most of these patterns become recognizable in EEG exclusively, particularly, in EEG recorded via the two central-temporal channels. The use of such EEG recordings enables experts to minimize the disturbance of sleep, preparation time as well as the movement artifacts. We assume that the brain maturity of newborns aged 36 weeks and older can be automatically assessed from the 2-channel sleep EEG as accurately as by expert analysis of the full polysomnographic information. We use Bayesian inference to test this assumption and assist experts to obtain the full probabilistic information on the EEG assessments. The Bayesian methodology is feasibly implemented with Monte Carlo integration over areas of high posterior probability density, however the existing techniques tend to provide biased assessments in the absence of prior information required to explore a model space in detail within a reasonable time. In this paper we aim to use the posterior information about EEG features to reduce possible bias in the assessments. The performance of the proposed method is tested on a set of EEG recordings.

However, identifying spectral power modulations suitable for single-trial analysis for non-invasive approaches remains a challenge. We recorded non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) during a self-paced center-out and center-in arm movement task, resulting in eight reaching movement classes (four center-out, four center-in). We found distinct slow (<= 5 Hz), mu (7.5-10 Hz), beta (12.5-25 Hz), low-gamma (approximately 275-50 Hz), and high-gamma (above 50 Hz) movement onset- and end-related responses. Movement class-specific spectral power modulations were restricted to the beta band at approximately 1 s after movement end and could be explained by the sensitivity of this response to different static, post-movement electromyography (EMG) levels. Based on the beta band, significant single-trial inference of reaching movement endpoints was possible. The findings of the present study support the idea that single-trial decoding of different reaching movements from non-invasive EEG spectral power modulations is possible, but also suggest that the informative time window is after movement end and that the informative frequency range is restricted to the beta band.

Based on the received signals, epileptic seizure and sleep patterns can be monitored and diagnosed. This paper proposes a distributed sensing method using cooperative communication and networking between a pair of sensors for wireless sleep EEG signal collection. The proposed scheme is applied to mitigate signal degradation attributed to the clock synchronization problem and wireless channel effects such that good wireless signal quality for stage classification can be achieved. The wireless measurement performance is investigated through 40 real epoch cases. The results show that the segmentation accuracy is 47.5% (without the proposed scheme) and 72.5% (with the proposed scheme) in McNemar test with the value p = 0.013, which suggest that the proposed approach may provide a sensible way to collect more precise EEG measurements for signal segmentation in the wireless environment.

We investigated the correlation between the extent of removal of ictal HGO generating areas and postoperative seizure outcome in neocortical epilepsy (NE). Methods: Twenty three patients with medically intractable NE underwent chronic intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) using subdural electrodes. Ictal HGOs and superimposed undersampled ripples within +/- 3 s of video-iEEG ictal onset were extracted by wavelet clustering and thresholding. Cluster epileptogenicity indices (CEIs) were calculated. The temporal analysis window was locked to the timing of the maximum CEI wavecluster. Root mean square amplitudes, cross-correlation synchronies and the local focus indices within the temporal window were calculated. Results: Percentages of resected maximum CEI waveclusters and HGO zones with high standardised amplitudes (>3), high cross-correlation synchronies (>0.9) and high local focus indices (>2) were significantly higher in the seizure-free group compared to the not seizure-free group (p = 0.036, p = 0.018, and p = 0.026, respectively). Conclusions: The automatic quantitative ictal HGO analysis may be effective in delineating the epileptogenic zone. Significance: HGO analysis may be helpful for improving post-resection seizure outcome in NE in the future. (C) 2012 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

J	Zhou, ZX; Wan, BK				Zhou, Zhongxing; Wan, Baikun			Wavelet packet-based independent component analysis for feature extraction from motor imagery EEG of complex movements	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Event-related desynchronisation/synchronisation; Complex mental task; Brain-computer interface; Wavelet packet; Independent component analysis	BRAIN; DESYNCHRONIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; INITIATION; ARTIFACT; REMOVAL; POWER; GAIT; ICA	Objective: The main goal of this study was to develop a novel spatial filtering method for better extracting the feature information underlying the event-related de-synchronisation and synchronisation (ERD/ERS) during complex motor imagery of lower limb action. Methods: The algorithm used a wavelet packet-based independent component analysis (WPICA) method to extract the ERD/ERS patterns in different frequency bands. Time-frequency decomposition in the wavelet packet domain was designed to avoid the statistical correlation between different electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms. The subband-specific principal components were extracted after independent component analysis and projected back to the time-frequency domain of corresponding electrodes for better fitting the varying EEG spatial distributions. Results: The present method was tested with the EEG data from 10 human subjects performing three complex mental tasks (i.e., imagery standing up, imagery left/right foot movement combined with homolateral hand movement). A classification rate of about 80% was achieved using the WPICA-based technique, which is better than the traditional ICA method with the rate of 72.30% and the non-spatial filtering condition of 68.34%. Conclusions: We developed a novel spatial filtering method based on WPICA to extract the ERD/ERS patterns in different frequency bands. The overall performance of this algorithm was better than that of the conventional methods. Significance: The current method promised to provide an effective way for ERD/ERS patterns recognition and thus could improve the pattern classification performance of complex mental tasks from scalp EEGs.

To evaluate the requirements of such a system in terms of sensors and signal processing we compare two designs. The first one uses only one scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) electrode and the power in the alpha frequency band. The second one uses sixteen scalp EEG electrodes and machine-learning methods. The role of muscular activity is also evaluated using five electrodes positioned on the face and the neck. Results show that the first design enabled 70% of the participants to successfully control the game, whereas 100% of the participants managed to do it with the second design based on machine learning. Subjective questionnaires confirm these results: users globally felt to have control in both designs, with an increased feeling of control in the second one. Offline analysis of face and neck muscle activity shows that this activity could also be used to distinguish between relaxation and concentration tasks. Results suggest that the combination of muscular and brain activity could improve performance of this kind of system. They also suggest that muscular activity has probably been recorded by EEG electrodes.

Correlated components of ongoing EEG point to emotionally laden attention - a possible marker of engagement?	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; engagement; attention; canonical correlation analysis; brain reading	DEFAULT MODE; BRAIN; ALPHA; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; CORTEX	Recent evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging suggests that cortical hemodynamic responses coincide in different subjects experiencing a common naturalistic stimulus. Here we utilize neural responses in the electroencephalogram( EEG) evoked by multiple presentations of short film clips to index brain states marked by high levels of correlation within and across subjects. We formulate a novel signal decomposition method which extracts maximally correlated signal components from multiple EEG records. The resulting components capture correlations down to a one-second time resolution, thus revealing that peak correlations of neural activity across viewings can occur in remarkable correspondence with arousing moments of the film. Moreover, a significant reduction in neural correlation occurs upon a second viewing of the film or when the narrative is disrupted by presenting its scenes scrambled in time. We also probe oscillatory brain activity during periods of heightened correlation, and observe during such times a significant increase in the theta band for a frontal component and reductions in the alpha and beta frequency bands for parietal and occipital components. Low-resolution EEG tomography of these components suggests that the correlated neural activity is consistent with sources in the cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices. Put together, these results suggest that the observed synchrony reflects attention and emotion-modulated cortical processing which may be decoded with high temporal resolution by extracting maximally correlated components of neural activity.

The focus is placed on the three-class problem, left-hand movement imagination, right movement imagination and word generation. The algorithm allows a supervised classification of temporal patterns improving the classification rates of the BCI Competition III (Data Set V: multiclass problem, continuous EEG). Using the precomputed data supplied for the competition and following the rules established there, a new method based on S-dFasArt, along with rule prune and voting strategy is proposed.

Auto-regression (AR) model is one of the popular methods to describe motor imagery patterns, which is widely used by researchers to resolve subject's motor intention. In this paper, we use joint regression (JR) model and propose an algorithm by combining the coefficients of JR model and spectral powers at two specific frequencies to classify different MI patterns. The algorithm produces a classification accuracy of 90 % on the training data of one subject from BCI2003 Data set III and 80 % on the test data. The results are better than that by using AR model. We also apply the algorithm to MI tasks of one subject in our laboratory, and the classification accuracy can reach 97.86 % on the test data. The results demonstrate that the combination of JR model and spectral powers can achieve much higher accuracy for classification of MI tasks.

More controversially, some studies report that neural activity preceding the stimulus also affects the decision process. We used a multivariate pattern classification approach for the analysis of the human electroencephalogram (EEG) to decode choice outcomes in a perceptual decision task from spatially and temporally distributed patterns of brain signals. When stimuli provided discriminative information, choice outcomes were predicted by neural activity following stimulus encoding; when stimuli provided no discriminative information, choice outcomes were predicted by neural activity preceding the stimulus. Moreover, in the absence of discriminative information, the recent choice history primed the choices on subsequent trials. A diffusion model fitted to the choice probabilities and response time distributions showed that the starting point of the evidence accumulation process was shifted toward the previous choice, consistent with the hypothesis that choice priming biases the accumulation process toward a decision boundary. This bias is reflected in prestimulus brain activity, which, in turn, becomes predictive of future decisions. Our results provide a model of how non-stimulus-driven decision making in humans could be accomplished on a neural level.

The main contribution of the paper lies in feature selection by an evolutionary algorithm and pattern classification by Differential Evolution induced Hopfield neural network. One additional merit of the work lies in data point reduction by Principal component analysis. Experiments undertaken on 25 subjects with 10 smell stimuli indicate that the proposed scheme of feature selection, data point reduction and classification outperforms the traditional approach by a wide margin. Experimental results confirm that the smell stimuli excites the pre frontal lobe of the human brain and is responsible for a special type of brain rhythms (EEG signal) in alpha-band, theta-band and delta-band.

However, its effectiveness is highly dependent on subject-specific time segment, channel configuration and frequency band. Hence, the preprocessing procedure of CSP algorithm is critical to enhance the performance of BCI system. This paper proposes a feature extraction and selection method based on common spatial and spectral pattern for motor imagery brain-computer interface (BCI). We formulate the optimization of spatial spectral patterns, channel configuration and time segment as maximizing the proposed criterions including mutual information algorithm, Fisher ratio algorithm and wrapper method. The proposed method is evaluated on single trial EEG from dataset IVa of BCI competition III. The results show that best features are selected by a wrapper method and these features in cross-validation yield better performance compared to most of the reported results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Constructing adaptive classifiers is a promising approach to deal with this problem. In this paper, Bayesian classifiers with Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are adopted to classify electroencephalogram (EEG) signals online. We propose to use the stochastic approximation method (SAM) as the specific gradient descent method for parameter update and systematically derive the instantaneous gradient formulas with respect to mean values and covariance matrices in the distributions of a GMM. With SAM, the parameters of mean values and covariance matrices embodied in the Bayesian classifiers can be simultaneously updated in a batch mode. The online simulation of EEG classification tasks in a BCI shows the effectiveness of the proposed SAM.

We exploited DL technique with input feature clusters to handle high dimensional features related to time - frequency events. The method was applied to EEG recordings of a RSVP experiment with multiple sessions and subjects. For classification of target and non-target images, a deep belief net (DBN) classifier was based on the uncorrelated features, which was constructed from original correlated features using clustering method. The performance of the proposed DBN was tested for different combinations of hidden units and hidden layers on multiple subjects. The results of DBN were compared with cluster Linear Discriminant Analysis (cLDA) and Support vector machine (SVM) and DBN demonstrated better performance in all tested cases. There was an improvement of 10 - 25% for certain cases. We also demonstrated how DBN is used to characterize brain activities.

Many research groups have devoted their efforts to either the frequency band selection or optimal spatial filters learning via the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm. However, since the spectral filtering and the spatial filtering are generally operated in order in a motor imagery classification system the optimization of the spatial filters and the spectral filters should be considered simultaneously in a unified framework. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic approach for the spatio-spectral filters optimization in an EEG-based BCI with a particle-filter algorithm and mutual information between feature vectors and class labels. There are two main contributions of the proposed method. The one is that it finds the optimal frequency bands that maximally discriminate the feature vectors of two classes in terms of an information theoretic approach. The other is that we construct a spectrally-weighted label decision rule by linearly combining the outputs from multiple SVMs, one for each frequency band, with the weight of the corresponding frequency band. From our experiments with two publicly available dataset, we confirm that the proposed method outperforms the other competing methods.

Being able to predict impending seizures could greatly improve the lives of patients with epilepsy. In this study, we propose a new adaptive learning approach for online seizure prediction based on analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. For each individual patient, we construct baseline patterns of normal and preseizure EEG samples, continuously monitor sliding windows of EEG recordings, and classify each window to normal or preseizure using a K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) method. A new reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to continuously update both normal and preseizure baseline patterns based on the feedback from prediction result of each window. The proposed approach was evaluated on EEG data from 10 patients with epilepsy. For each one of the 10 patients, the adaptive approach was trained using the recordings containing the first half of seizure occurrences, and tested prospectively on the subsequent recordings. Using a 150-minute prediction horizon, our approach achieved 73 percent sensitivity and 67 percent specificity on average over 10 patients. This result is shown to be far better than those of a nonupdate prediction scheme and two native prediction schemes.

Specifically, this work focuses on the P300 speller paradigm and assesses the classification accuracies for the identification of P300 trials. Previous work has shown that BSS methods such as independent component analysis (ICA) are useful in extracting the P300 source information from the background noise, increasing the classification rates. ICA will be compared with two other BSS methods, maximum noise fraction (MNF) and principal component analysis (PCA). In addition to this, we will analyze the effect of adding temporal information to the original data, which allows these BSS algorithms to find more complex spatio-temporal patterns.

J	Yi, WB; Qiu, S; Qi, HZ; Zhang, LX; Wan, BK; Ming, D				Yi, Weibo; Qiu, Shuang; Qi, Hongzhi; Zhang, Lixin; Wan, Baikun; Ming, Dong			EEG feature comparison and classification of simple and compound limb motor imagery	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						Compound limb motor imagery; Event-related desynchronization; Event-related spectral perturbation; Power spectral entropy; Spatial distribution coefficient; Common spatial patterns; Support vector machine	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; HAND ORTHOSIS; COMMUNICATION; ENTROPY; BCI; OPERATION; SELECTION	Background: Motor imagery can elicit brain oscillations in Rolandic mu rhythm and central beta rhythm, both originating in the sensorimotor cortex. In contrast with simple limb motor imagery, less work was reported about compound limb motor imagery which involves several parts of limbs. The goal of this study was to investigate the differences of the EEG patterns between simple limb motor imagery and compound limb motor imagery, and discuss the separability of multiple types of mental tasks. Methods: Ten subjects participated in the experiment involving three tasks of simple limb motor imagery (left hand, right hand, feet), three tasks of compound limb motor imagery (both hands, left hand combined with right foot, right hand combined with left foot) and rest state. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), power spectral entropy (PSE) and spatial distribution coefficient were adopted to analyze these seven EEG patterns. Then three algorithms of modified multi-class common spatial patterns (CSP) were used for feature extraction and classification was implemented by support vector machine (SVM). Results: The induced event-related desynchronization (ERD) affects more components within both alpha and beta bands resulting in more broad ERD bands at electrode positions C3, Cz and C4 during left/right hand combined with contralateral foot imagery, whose PSE values are significant higher than that of simple limb motor imagery. From the topographical distribution, simultaneous imagination of upper limb and contralateral lower limb certainly contributes to the activation of more areas on cerebral cortex. Classification result shows that multi-class stationary Tikhonov regularized CSP (Multi-sTRCSP) outperforms other two multi-class CSP methods, with the highest accuracy of 84% and mean accuracy of 70%. Conclusions: The work implies that there exist the separable differences between simple limb motor imagery and compound limb motor imagery, which can be utilized to build a multimodal classification paradigm in motor imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems.

On the prognostic value of ictal EEG patterns in temporal lobe epilepsy surgery: A cohort study	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						Epilepsy surgery; Temporal lobe epilepsy; Ictal EEG; Prognosis	INTERHEMISPHERIC PROPAGATION TIME; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPAL SEIZURES; SCALP EEG; INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY; PREDICTORS; ONSET	Purpose: To investigate the prognostic value of ictal scalp EEG patterns in drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy associated with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) prior to undergoing temporal lobectomy. Methods: Scalp EEGs of the first seizure recorded during presurgical long-term video-EEG monitoring of 284 patients were reviewed. Patients were divided according to seizure laterality as either unilateral, when the EEG was restricted to one cerebral hemisphere for the entire seizure, or bilateral, when there was involvement of both hemispheres during the seizure. In patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (HS), seizures were subdivided according to the side of initial ictal activity in relation to the side of the HS, as concordant, non-lateralising or contralateral. Postsurgical seizure outcome, according to Engel's classification, was verified at 1, 2, and 5 years after surgery. Results: There was no significant association between ictal EEG characteristics and postsurgical seizure outcome. An Engel I seizure outcome was observed in 87.1% of the patients with unilateral ictal EEGs and in 79.6% of those with bilateral ictal EEGs (p = 0.092). Conclusion: Analysis of the localisation, morphology, and lateralisation of ictal EEG patterns did not provide prognostic information regarding seizure-free status in patients with MTLE-HS undergoing temporal lobectomy.

In a previous study, we showed that abnormal sleep EEG and wake EEG patterns could predict the outcome of noninvasive ventilation in a group of patients treated for acute respiratory failure. Our aims were to assess the prevalence of these abnormal sleep/wake EEG patterns in a larger group and search for objective parameters to help their identification. Methods: We reviewed sleep studies previously performed with full polysomnography during 17-h in conscious nonsedated ICU patients receiving invasive ventilation during weaning or noninvasive ventilation for acute respiratory failure. Results: We included 57 patients. Sleep scoring using conventional rules was not feasible in 16 (28%) patients due to the absence of stage-2 markers. Wake EEG in these 16 patients, although recognizable, showed abnormal features, including decreased reactivity to eye opening and slower peak EEG frequency compared to patients with normal sleep wake EEGs. Conclusion: In almost one third of awake mechanically ventilated ICU patients, sleep cannot be classified with standard criteria. Two new states, atypical sleep and pathologic wakefulness, need to be added. We suggest rules for scoring these states. The origin and links with outcomes of these abnormal EEG patterns deserve investigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Noninvasively Decoding the Contents of Visual Working Memory in the Human Prefrontal Cortex within High-gamma Oscillatory Patterns	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PERSISTENT ACTIVITY; POSTERIOR PARIETAL; TIME-SERIES; BRAIN; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; DYNAMICS; NETWORK; PHASE; HIPPOCAMPUS	The temporal maintenance and subsequent retrieval of information that no longer exists in the environment is called working memory. It is believed that this type of memory is controlled by the persistent activity of neuronal populations, including the prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortex. For a long time, it has been controversially discussed whether, in working memory, the PFC stores past sensory events or, instead, its activation is an extramnemonic source of top-down control over posterior regions. Recent animal studies suggest that specific information about the contents of working memory can be decoded from population activity in prefrontal areas. However, it has not been shown whether the contents of working memory during the delay periods can be decoded from EEG recordings in the human brain. We show that by analyzing the nonlinear dynamics of EEG oscillatory patterns it is possible to noninvasively decode with high accuracy, during encoding and maintenance periods, the contents of visual working memory information within high-gamma oscillations in the human PFC. These results are thus in favor of an active storage function of the human PFC in working memory; this, without ruling out the role of PFC in top-down processes. The ability to noninvasively decode the contents of workingmemory is promising in applications such as brain computer interfaces, together with computation of value function during planning and decision making processes.

J	Logar, V; Belic, A				Logar, Vito; Belic, Ales			Brain-computer interface analysis of a dynamic visuo-motor task	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Dynamic visuo-motor task; Fuzzy logic; Brain-information decoding; Brain-computer interface; Wrist-movement prediction	CODING SCHEME; PHASE CODE; OSCILLATIONS; SYNCHRONIZATION; MOVEMENTS; COHERENCE; EEG; IDENTIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; CONNECTIVITY	Background: The area of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) represents one of the more interesting fields in neurophysiological research, since it investigates the development of the machines that perform different transformations of the brain's "thoughts" to certain pre-defined actions. Experimental studies have reported some successful implementations of BC's; however, much of the field still remains unexplored. According to some recent reports the phase coding of informational content is an important mechanism in the brain's function and cognition, and has the potential to explain various mechanisms of the brain's data transfer, but it has yet to be scrutinized in the context of brain-computer interface. Therefore, if the mechanism of phase coding is plausible, one should be able to extract the phase-coded content, carried by brain signals, using appropriate signal-processing methods. In our previous studies we have shown that by using a phase-demodulation-based signal-processing approach it is possible to decode some relevant information on the current motor action in the brain from electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Objective: In this paper the authors would like to present a continuation of their previous work on the brain-information-decoding analysis of visuo-motor (VM) tasks. The present study shows that EEG data measured during more complex, dynamic visuo-motor (dVM) tasks carries enough information about the currently performed motor action to be successfully extracted by using the appropriate signal-processing and identification methods. The aim of this paper is therefore to present a mathematical model, which by means of the EEG measurements as its inputs predicts the course of the wrist movements as applied by each subject during the task in simulated or real time (BCI analysis). However, several modifications to the existing methodology are needed to achieve optimal decoding results and a real-time, data-processing ability. The information extracted from the EEG could, therefore, be further used for the development of a closed-loop, non-invasive, brain-computer interface. Materials and methods: For the case of this study two types of measurements were performed, i.e., the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and the wrist movements were measured simultaneously, during the subject's performance of a dynamic visuo-motor task. Wrist-movement predictions were computed by using the EEG data-processing methodology of double brain-rhythm filtering, double phase demodulation and double principal component analyses (PCA), each with a separate set of parameters. For the movement-prediction model a fuzzy inference system was used. Results: The results have shown that the EEG signals measured during the dVM tasks carry enough information about the subjects' wrist movements for them to be successfully decoded using the presented methodology. Reasonably high values of the correlation coefficients suggest that the validation of the proposed approach is satisfactory. Moreover, since the causality of the rhythm filtering and the PCA transformation has been achieved, we have shown that these methods can also be used in a real-time, brain-computer interface. The study revealed that using non-causal, optimized methods yields better prediction results in comparison with the causal, non-optimized methodology; however, taking into account that the causality of these methods allows real-time processing, the minor decrease in prediction quality is acceptable. Conclusion: The study suggests that the methodology that was proposed in our previous studies is also valid for identifying the EEG-coded content during dVM tasks, albeit with various modifications, which allow better prediction results and real-time data processing. The results have shown that wrist movements can be predicted in simulated or real time; however, the results of the non-causal, optimized methodology (simulated) are slightly better. Nevertheless, the study has revealed that these methods should be suitable for use in the development of a non-invasive, brain-computer interface. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

C	Higashi, H; Tanaka, T			IEEE	Higashi, Hiroshi; Tanaka, Toshihisa			Optimal Design of a Bank of Spatio-Temporal Filters for EEG Signal Classification	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)				The spatial weights for electrodes called common spatial pattern (CSP) are known to be effective in EEG signal classification for motor imagery based brain computer interfaces (MI-BCI). To achieve accurate classification in CSP, the frequency filter should be properly designed. To this end, several methods for designing the filter have been proposed. However, the existing methods cannot consider plural brain activities described with different frequency bands and different spatial patterns such as activities of mu and beta rhythms. In order to efficiently extract these brain activities, we propose a method to design plural filters and spatial weights which extract desired brain activity. The proposed method designs finite impulse response (FIR) filters and the associated spatial weights by optimization of an objective function which is a natural extension of CSP. Moreover, we show by a classification experiment that the bank of FIR filters which are designed by introducing an orthogonality into the objective function can extract good discriminative features. Moreover, the experiment result suggests that the proposed method can automatically detect and extract brain activities related to motor imagery.

In this paper, we present an approach for adaptive artifact rejection from the electroencephalogram (EEG). The main aim of our work is to increase performance of classification algorithms which have a deal with the EEG and are used in cognitive games. We provide a method to separate the EEG into informative and noised parts, select informative one and rank its dimensions. The proposed approach is based on the theoretical relation between classification accuracy, mutual information and normalized graph cut (NC) value. The presented algorithm requires a priori known class labeled EEG dataset that are utilized for a calibration phase of the brain-computer interface (BCI). Experimental results on datasets from BCI competitions show its applicability for cognitive games.

The novelty of our system compared to other BMI applications is that our system gradually becomes autonomous by learning user actions (i.e. turning on/off window, lights, etc.) under certain environment conditions (temperature, illumination, etc.) and brain states (i.e. awake, sleepy, etc.). By providing learning capabilities to the system, patients are relieved from mental fatigue or stress caused by continuously controlling appliances using a BMI. We present an interface that allows the user to select and control appliances using electromyogram signals (EMG) generated by muscle contractions such as eyebrow movement. Our learning approach consists in two steps: 1) monitoring user actions, input data from sensors distributed around the room, and Electroencephalogram (EEG) data from the user, and 2) using an extended version of the Bayes Point Machine approach trained with Expectation Propagation to approximate a posterior probability from previously observed user actions under a similar combination of brain states and environmental conditions. Experimental results with volunteers demonstrate that our system provides satisfactory user experience and achieves over 85% overall learning performance after only a few trials.

Feasibility of Error-Related Potential Detection as Novelty Detection Problem in P300 Mind Spelling	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND SOFT COMPUTING, PT II	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing (ICAISC)	APR 29-MAY 03, 2012	Zakopane, POLAND	Polish Neural Network Soc, SWSPiZ Acad Management, Czestochowa Univ Technol, Dept Comp Engn, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Poland Chapter			BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE	In this paper, we report on the feasibility of the Error-Related Potential (ErrP) integration in a particular type of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) called the P300 Mind Speller. With the latter, the subject can type text only by means of his/her brain activity without having to rely on speech or muscular activity. Hereto, electroencephalography (EEG) signals are recorded from the subject's scalp. But, as with any BCI paradigm, decoding mistakes occur, and when they do, an EEG potential is evoked, known as the Error-Related Potential (ErrP), locked to the subject's realization of the mistake. When the BCI would be able to also detect the ErrP, the last typed character could be automatically corrected. However, since the P300 Mind Speller is optimized to correctly operate in the first place, we have much less ErrP's than responses to correctly typed characters. In fact, exactly because it is supposed to be a rare phenomenon, we advocate that ErrP detection can be treated as a novelty detection problem. We consider in this paper different one-class classification algorithms based on novelty detection together with a correction algorithm for the P300 Mind Speller.

The goal selection that provides fine accuracy but limited decodable information due to its susceptibility to noise is widely implemented in the current brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. The process control is mainly employed in the invasive electroencephalographic analysis methods, which offers continuous and diverse motor control information. The proposed method based on noninvasive electroencephalographic decoding provides an efficient way for limb movement analysis, which has a great potential value in neuromotor prosthesis control, motor rehabilitation, and others.

In other words, it is the mental process taking place to discriminate one thing from others, a common task performed by a person on a very regular basis. Making such differentiations, small or large, easy or hard, still requires a combination of cognitive processes to occur across various parts of the human brain. In this paper, an EEG-based BCI experiment was organized to study the detection of such cognitive processes. Utilizing a machine learning tool, Artificial Neural Networks, to aid in analyzing the acquired dataset, a high correct classification rate was achieved, confirming that it is possible to computationally detect these differentiation activities from EEG signals.

In this work, a sequential forward floating search technique (SFFS) was applied to the problem of classification of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and normal controls. The technique resulted in superior classification rates over statistical methods, as described in the paper.

Whether it is maintaining security at an airport or negotiating with locals in a foreign country, there is a need to maximize the effectiveness of training or real-time performance in this decoding process. This review considers the potential utility of neuroergonomic solutions, and in particular, of electroencephalographic (EEG) methods for augmenting action understanding. Focus is given to body movements and hand-object interactions, where there is a rapid growth in relevant science. The interpretation of EEG-based signals is reinforced by a consideration of functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments demonstrating underlying brain mechanisms that support goal oriented action. While no EEG method is currently implemented as a practical application for enhancing the understanding of unspoken intentions, there are a number of promising approaches that merit further development.

J	Zhang, C; Wang, H; Wang, H; Wu, MH				Zhang, Chi; Wang, Hong; Wang, Hong; Wu, Mian-Hong			EEG-based expert system using complexity measures and probability density function control in alpha sub-band	INTEGRATED COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING			English	Article						Expert system; EEG; sample entropy; Lempel-Ziv complexity; PDF control	STOCHASTIC-SYSTEMS; OUTPUT PDFS; BRAIN; DIAGNOSIS; DESIGN; OSCILLATIONS; METHODOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; LEVEL; TASK	This paper presents a novel expert system based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and demonstrates the process of knowledge acquisition and inference. As we known, the problem-solving mode of expert brains is: They judge the current situation (learn about the problem), and then generate operational decisions to solve problems. However, the experts have difficulty in explaining what they know and how they gain the knowledge. Their perfect performance may be difficult to replicate. The EEG signal may be one of the most predictive and reliable measurements to acquire the expert knowledge as it reflects directly human brain activity. It is supposed that EEG is a manifestation of the experts' thinking. By the analysis of EEG, we found the regularity of EEG features of the experts in a well-defined problem domain and used the features to reflect the learning and decision-making information of the expert brains to establish the EEG-based expert system. The knowledge base of the EEG-based expert system stores the features that reflect the learning and decision-making activities of the expert brains respectively. Based on the relationship between the two kinds of the EEG features, inference engine of the EEG-based expert system makes an inference to obtain the features that reflect the decisions of the experts. When we encounter the same problem, the brains make the same judgement (learning). After the EEG data acquisition, through the EEG-based expert system, we can get the expert decisions (operations). If we interpret the decisions into actual operations or control, we can solve the problem with the expert performance or control machines more intelligently. In this paper, game experiments have been designed. We used the solution to the operation problem of a game as the basis to establish the model of the EEG-based expert system. The inputs of the system are the collected EEG signals of the users. The outputs are the operations (decisions) of the experts. The results of the EEG analysis show that the activity appeared in the corresponding brain regions and the probability density function (PDF) of the EEG features is concentrated when the experts performed the task (playing the game). By using the sample entropy (SampEn) and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) algorithm, the EEG features of the experts' learning activities and operating activities were extracted respectively. Then, with applying the probability density functions of the features to output PDF control, the mathematical model of the EEG-based expert system was established. In the EEG-based expert system, inference means controlling the feature vectors which reflect the users' learning information from the current situation to get the feature vectors which reflect the operating information of the experts. Finally, the expert system model has been tested on a simulated example and encouraging results have been obtained. The EEG-based expert system can forecast the operating features of the experts. The output of the EEG-based expert system is in accord with the expert mode and the operating curve represented by the physiological signal features can reflect the actual operating information.

Interval feature extraction for classification of event-related potentials (ERP) in EEG data analysis	PROGRESS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Pattern recognition; EEG; Feature extraction; Event-related potentials (ERP); Interval features; Fast correlation-based filter (FCBF)	ENSEMBLE	Event-related potential data can be used to index perceptual and cognitive operations. However, they are typically high-dimensional and noisy. This study examines the original raw data and six feature-extraction methods as a pre-processing step before classification. Four traditionally used feature-extraction methods were considered: principal component analysis, independent component analysis, auto-regression, and wavelets. We add to these a less well-known method called interval feature extraction. It overproduces features from the ERP signal and then eliminates irrelevant and redundant features by the fast correlation-based filter. To make the comparisons fair, the other feature-extraction methods were also run with the filter. An experiment on two EEG datasets (four classification scenarios) was carried out to examine the classification accuracy of four classifiers on the extracted features: support vector machines with linear and perceptron kernel, the nearest neighbour classifier and the random forest ensemble method. The interval features led to the best classification accuracy in most of the configurations, specifically when used with the Random Forest classifier ensemble.

If the BCI decoding is performed by spectral features, stimulation after-effects such as artefacts and evoked activity present a challenge for a successful implementation of BSDS because they can impair the detection of targeted brain states. Therefore, efficient and robust methods are needed to minimize the influence of the stimulation-induced effects on spectral estimation without violating the real-time constraints of the BCI. In this work, we compared four methods for spectral estimation with autoregressive (AR) models in the presence of pulsed cortical stimulation. Using combined EEG-TMS (electroencephalography-transcranial magnetic stimulation) as well as combined electrocorticography (ECoG) and epidural electrical stimulation, three patients performed a motor task using a sensorimotor-rhythm BCI. Three stimulation paradigms were varied between sessions: (1) no stimulation, (2) single stimulation pulses applied independently (open-loop), or (3) coupled to the BCI output (closed-loop) such that stimulation was given only while an intention to move was detected using neural data. We found that removing the stimulation after-effects by linear interpolation can introduce a bias in the estimation of the spectral power of the sensorimotor rhythm, leading to an overestimation of decoding performance in the closed-loop setting. We propose the use of the Burg algorithm for segmented data to deal with stimulation after-effects. This work shows that the combination of BCIs controlled with spectral features and cortical stimulation in a closed-loop fashion is possible when the influence of stimulation after-effects on spectral estimation is minimized	[Walter, Armin; Rosenstiel, Wolfgang; Bogdan, Martin] Univ Tubingen, Wilhelm Schickard Inst, Dept Comp Engn, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany; [Murguialday, Ander R.] Univ Tubingen Hosp, Inst Med Psychol & Behav Neurobiol, Tubingen, Germany; [Murguialday, Ander R.] TECNALIA, Hlth Technol Dept, San Sebastian, Spain; [Birbaumer, Niels] IRCCS, Osped San Camillo, Venice, Italy; [Bogdan, Martin] Univ Leipzig, Dept Comp Engn, Leipzig, Germany		Walter, A (corresponding author), Univ Tubingen, Wilhelm Schickard Inst, Dept Comp Engn, Sand 14, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany.	armin.walter@uni-tuebingen.de		Naros, Georgios/0000-0003-4807-6234; Ramos-Murguialday, Dr. Ander/0000-0002-1549-4029; Birbaumer, Niels/0000-0002-6786-5127	European Research Council (ERC) [227632]; Reinhardt-Koselleck Award of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)	European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)); Reinhardt-Koselleck Award of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG))	This work was funded by the European Research Council (ERC) grant 227632 "BCCI-A Bidirectional Cortical Communication Interface" and the Reinhardt-Koselleck Award of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).

It aims at constructing a communication between the disabled persons and the auxiliary equipments in order to improve the patients' life. In motor imagery (MI) based BCI, one of the popular feature extraction strategies is Common Spatial Patterns (CSP). In practical BCI situation, scalp EEG inevitably has the outlier and artifacts introduced by ocular, head motion or the loose contact of electrodes in scalp EEG recordings. Because outlier and artifacts are usually observed with large amplitude, when CSP is solved in view of L2 norm, the effect of outlier and artifacts will be exaggerated due to the imposing of square to outliers, which will finally influence the MI based BCI performance. While, L1 norm will lower the outlier effects as proved in other application fields like EEG inverse problem, face recognition, etc. Methods: In this paper, we present a new CSP implementation using the L1 norm technique, instead of the L2 norm, to solve the eigen problem for spatial filter estimation with aim to improve the robustness of CSP to outliers. To evaluate the performance of our method, we applied our method as well as the standard CSP and the regularized CSP with Tikhonov regularization (TR-CSP), on both the peer BCI dataset with simulated outliers and the dataset from the MI BCI system developed in our group. The McNemar test is used to investigate whether the difference among the three CSPs is of statistical significance. Results: The results of both the simulation and real BCI datasets consistently reveal that the proposed method has much higher classification accuracies than the conventional CSP and the TR-CSP. Conclusions: By combining L1 norm based Eigen decomposition into Common Spatial Patterns, the proposed approach can effectively improve the robustness of BCI system to EEG outliers and thus be potential for the actual MI BCI application, where outliers are inevitably introduced into EEG recordings.

To give feedback on MI performance brain-computer interface (BCIs) can be used. This requires a fast and easy acquisition of a reliable classifier. Usually, for training a classifier, electroencephalogram (EEG) data of MI without feedback is used, but it would be advantageous if we could give feedback right from the beginning. The sensorimotor EEG changes of the motor cortex during active and passive movement (PM) and MI are similar. The aim of this study is to explore, whether it is possible to use EEG data from active or PM to set up a classifier for the detection of MI in a group of elderly persons. In addition, the activation patterns of the motor cortical areas of elderly persons were analyzed during different motor tasks. EEG was recorded from three Laplacian channels over the sensorimotor cortex in a sample of 19 healthy elderly volunteers. Participants performed three different tasks in consecutive order, passive, active hand movement, and hand MI. Classifiers were calculated with data of every task. These classifiers were then used to detect event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the MI data. ERD values, related to the different tasks, were calculated and analyzed statistically. The performance of classifiers calculated from passive and active hand movement data did not differ significantly regarding the classification accuracy for detecting MI. The EEG patterns of the motor cortical areas during the different tasks was similar to the patterns normally found in younger persons but more widespread regarding localization and frequency range of the ERD. In this study, we have shown that it is possible to use classifiers calculated with data from passive and active hand movement to detect MI. Hence, for working with stroke patients, a physiotherapy session could be used to obtain data for classifier set up and the BCI-rehabilitation training could start immediately.

Two different approaches aiming at including such structural information into the data representation are presented in this paper. Their performance is compared to the traditional approach both in a simulation study and a real-life example, showing that spatial and structural information facilitates precise classification.

However, it has yet to address the non-stationarity inherent in the EEG between the initial calibration session and subsequent online sessions. This paper presents the FBCSP that employs the NBPW classifier using online adaptive learning that augments the training data with available labeled data during online sessions. However, employing semi-supervised learning that simply augments the training data with available data using predicted labels can be detrimental to the classification accuracy. Hence, this paper presents the FBCSP using online semi-supervised learning that augments the training data with available data that matches the probabilistic model captured by the NBPW classifier using predicted labels. The performances of FBCSP using online adaptive and semi-supervised learning are evaluated on the BCI Competition IV datasets IIa and IIb and compared to the FBCSP using offline learning. The results showed that the FBCSP using online semi-supervised learning yielded relatively better session-to-session classification results compared against the FBCSP using offline learning. The FBCSP using online adaptive learning on true labels yielded the best results in both datasets, but the FBCSP using online semi-supervised learning on predicted labels is more practical in BCI applications where the true labels are not available.

Thirty-one features were extracted from the probe responses from these subjects. Then, a recently-developed classifier called extreme learning machine (ELM) was combined with F-score, a simple but effective feature selection method, to jointly optimize the number of the hidden nodes of ELM and the feature subset by a grid-searching training procedure. The method was compared to two classification models combining principal component analysis with back-propagation network and support vector machine classifiers. We thoroughly assessed the performance of these classification models including the training and testing time, sensitivity and specificity from the training and testing sets, as well as network size. The experimental results showed that the number of the hidden nodes can be effectively optimized by the proposed method. Also, F-score_ELM obtained the best classification accuracy and required the shortest training and testing time.

In this paper we developed a novel feature extraction algorithm for EEG-based emotion detection problem. The proposed algorithm is derived from viewing EEG signals as the activation/deactivation of sources specific to the brain activities of interest. For binary classification problem, to be more specific, we consider the EEG signals for the two types of brain activities as characterized by the activation/deactivation of two discriminatory sources in the brain, with one source activated and the other one deactivated for one particular type of brain activities. The proposed algorithm, termed Asymmetric Spatial Pattern (ASP), extracts pairs of spatial filters, with each filter corresponding to only one of the two sources. The idea of ASP is neurologically plausible for certain situations. For example, according to the valence hypothesis of emotion, the left hemisphere is more activated in positive emotions and the right hemisphere is more activated in negative emotions. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is confirmed by application to real data for two types of EEG-based emotion detection problems: arousal detection (strong v.s. calm), and valence detection (positive v.s. negative). Experimental results on the real data also show that some of the asymmetric spatial patterns by ASP are consistent with the current neurophysiological findings on brain emotion processing.				dhuang@i2r.a-star.edu.sg	Ang, Kai Keng/F-1626-2016; Guan, Cuntai/G-7835-2016	Ang, Kai Keng/0000-0002-3053-6311; Guan, Cuntai/0000-0002-0872-3276					25	6	6	0	3	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	2161-4393		978-1-4673-1490-9	IEEE IJCNN			2012														7	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science	BCA06					2022-08-02	WOS:000309341300028

Convulsive seizure detection using a wrist-worn electrodermal activity and accelerometry biosensor	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Seizure alarm; Electrodermal activity; Accelerometry; Wearable sensor; Epilepsy	EPILEPSY; BRAIN	The special requirements for a seizure detector suitable for everyday use in terms of cost, comfort, and social acceptance call for alternatives to electroencephalography (EEG)based methods. Therefore, we developed an algorithm for automatic detection of generalized tonicclonic (GTC) seizures based on sympathetically mediated electrodermal activity (EDA) and accelerometry measured using a novel wrist-worn biosensor. The problem of GTC seizure detection was posed as a supervised learning task in which the goal was to classify 10-s epochs as a seizure or nonseizure event based on 19 extracted features from EDA and accelerometry recordings using a Support Vector Machine. Performance was evaluated using a double cross-validation method. The new seizure detection algorithm was tested on >4,213 h of recordings from 80 patients and detected 15 (94%) of 16 of the GTC seizures from seven patients with 130 false alarms (0.74 per 24 h). This algorithm can potentially provide a convulsive seizure alarm system for caregivers and objective quantification of seizure frequency.

In this work we present a novel classification framework based on Regularized Linear Regression classifier constructed from time-frequency decomposition of an EEG (electro-encephalography) signal. The regression is then used to derive a model of frequency distributions that identifies brain states. The process of classifier construction, preprocessing and selection of optimal regularization parameter by means of cross-validation is presented and discussed. The framework and the feature selection technique are demonstrated on EEG data recorded from 10 healthy subjects while requested to open and close their eyes every 30 s. This paradigm is well known in inducing Alpha power modulations that differ from low power (during eyes opened) to high (during eyes closed). The classifier was trained to infer eyes opened or eyes closed states and achieved higher than 90% classification accuracy. Furthermore, our findings reveal interesting patterns of relations between experimental conditions, EEG frequencies, regularization parameters and classifier choice. This viable tool enables identification of the most contributing frequency bands to any given brain state and their optimal combination in inferring this state. These features allow for much greater detail than the standard Fourier Transform power analysis, making it an essential method for both BCI proposes and neuroimaging research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Extracting common spatial patterns from EEG time segments for classifying motor imagery classes in a Brain Computer Interface (BCI)	SCIENTIA IRANICA			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Brain Computer Interface (BCI); Motor imagery; Common Spatial Pattern (CSP); Temporal segmentation; One-Versus-the Rest (OVR) method	FILTERS; RATES	Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is a system which straightly converts the acquired brain signals such as Electroencephalogram (EEG) to commands for controlling external devices. One of the most successful methods in BCI applications based on Motor Imagery is Common Spatial Pattern (CSP). In the existing CSP methods, common spatial filters are applied on whole EEG signal as one time segment for feature extraction. The fact that ERD/ERS events are not steady over time motivated us to break down EEG signal into a number of sub-segments in this study. I combine this sentence with next one: "We believe the importance of EEG channels varies for different time segments in classification, therefore we extract features from each time segment using the analysis of CSP method. In order to classify Motor Imagery EEG signals, we apply a LDA classifier based on OVR (One-Versus-the Rest) scheme on the extracted CSP features. The considered Motor Imagery consists of four classes: left hand, right hand, foot and tongue. We used dataset 2a of BCI competition IV to evaluate our method. The result of experiment shows that this method outperforms both CSP and the best competitor of the BCI competition IV. (C) 2013 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.

Variations of the signal properties from intra and inter sessions often lead to deteriorated BCI performances, as features extracted by methods such as common spatial patterns (CSP) are not invariant against the changes. To extract features that are robust and invariant, this paper proposes a novel spatial filtering algorithm called Kullback-Leibler (KL) CSP. The CSP algorithm only considers the discrimination between the means of the classes, but does not consider within-class scatters information. In contrast, the proposed KLCSP algorithm simultaneously maximizes the discrimination between the class means, and minimizes the within-class dissimilarities measured by a loss function based on the KL divergence. The performance of the proposed KLCSP algorithm is compared against two existing algorithms, CSP and stationary CSP (sCSP), using the publicly available BCI competition III dataset IVa and a large dataset from stroke patients performing neuro-rehabilitation. The results show that the proposed KLCSP algorithm significantly outperforms both the CSP and the sCSP algorithms, in terms of classification accuracy, by reducing within-class variations. This results in more compact and separable features.

The feature extraction block comprises a bank of four band-pass filters followed by a wide dynamic range peak detector. The output of the peak detector is fed into a spiking neural network implementing the extreme learning machine (ELM) for classification. The advantage of ELM is that it has been shown to attain comparable performance to support vector machine (SVM) but with fewer computational nodes. We describe simulation results of each block designed in 0.35 um CMOS and demonstrate system level performance by using this to detect seizure onset in epileptic patients.

Data-driven techniques, based on supervised machine-learning methods provide powerful capabilities for potentially overcoming these, but the computational energy is typically too severe for low-power devices. We present a formulation for the kernel function of a support-vector machine classifier that can substantially reduce the real-time computations involved. The formulation applies to kernel functions employing polynomial transformations. Using two representative biomedical applications (EEG-based seizure detection and ECG-based arrhythmia detection) employing clinical patient data, we show that the polynomial transformation yields accuracy performance comparable to the most powerful available transformation (i.e., the radial-basis function), and the proposed formulation reduces the energy by over 2500x in the arrhythmia detector and 9.3-198x in the seizure detector (depending on the patient).

Given the vast amount of possible features from scalp recordings and the high variance between subjects, a major challenge is to select electrodes and features that separate classes well. In most cases, this decision is made based on neuro-scientific knowledge. We propose a statistically-motivated electrode/feature selection procedure, based on Cohen's effect size f(2). We compare inter- and intra-individual selection on a self-recorded database. Classification is evaluated using quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). We found both feature selection versions based on f(2) yield comparable results. While highest accuracies up to 57,5% (5 classes) are reached by applying intra-individual selection, inter-individual analysis successfully finds features that perform with lower variance in recognition rates across subjects than combinations of electrodes/features suggested in literature.

A new local discriminant bases (LDB) algorithm using common spatial patterns (CSP) projection as transform function is proposed for automatic trial segmentation. CSP is also used for feature extraction following trial segmentation. This new technique also allows to obtain a more accurate picture of the most relevant temporal-spatial points in the EEG during the MI.

We assessed the suitability, for real-time mental fatigue detection, of EEG, EOG and ECG measurements, taken separately or together. Thirteen subjects performed six blocks of switching tasks. For each participant, the block with the lowest error rate from the first two blocks and the block with the highest error rate from the last three blocks were discriminated with a machine learning algorithm (support vector machine). The classification scores obtained with ECG or EOG were greater than would be expected by chance (>50%) for time windows of at least 8s. EEG was the best single mode of detection, with classification scores ranging from 80 +/- 3% with a 4s time window to 94 +/- 2% with a 30s time window. The addition of ECG and EOG features to EEG features significantly increased classification scores for short time windows (e.g., to 86 +/- 3% with a 4s time window, p <0.001). For short time windows (up to 12 s), ECG significantly increased the discriminatory power of EEG, whereas EOG did not. These results demonstrate that mental state detection on the basis of extracerebral measurements is feasible and that a combination of EEG and ECG is particularly appropriate for the rapid detection of mental fatigue.

To reduce complexity stemming from the dimensionality problem, EEG signals are often reduced into a smaller set of discriminant features. The effectiveness of the detection techniques relies on the discriminant power of these features. However, since these features summarize the actual EEG signals, some valuable information can be lost. If unaddressed, this inherited incompleteness property can have a negative impact on the performance of the detection techniques, depending on the importance of the lost information. In this work, the evidence theory is utilized at two levels; (1) to enhance k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN) classifier, and (2) to combine decision collected from these enhanced-k-NNs. To effectively handle the incompleteness problem, the enhanced-k-NN has each feature pool k neighbors and consider each of these neighbors as a piece of evidence regarding its discriminant quality. Within the framework of evidence theory, these neighbors are combined together using the Dempster's rule to form a feature evidence structure. The feature evidence structures are then fused together to produce an overall pattern evidence structure which is used for the classification decision. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, five simple time domain features are obtained from EEG signals, and higher classification accuracy of 90% is achieved compared to other approaches which use more complex features.

It is widely used for two-class problem. In this paper, the CSP algorithm is expanded to realize the EEG feature extraction for three-class problem. Firstly, the 8 30 Hz frequency band is divided into eight cross frequency bands and original EEG signals are filtered according to the eight bands. Each filtered signal can be regarded as a new channel. Then the "one to one" strategy is applied to the CSP for three-class problem. Finally, the proposed method is used to analyze the data from BCI Competition IV and the experimental data from our laboratory. The obtained features are input to SVM (Support Vector Machine) for classification. Comparing the proposed method with simple CSP, the accuracy of the former is higher than the latter by 10%.

Kernel machines for epilepsy diagnosis via EEG signal classification: A comparative study	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Kernel machines; Feature extraction; EEG signal classification; Epilepsy	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; SELECTION; NETWORK	Objective: We carry out a systematic assessment on a suite of kernel-based learning machines while coping with the task of epilepsy diagnosis through automatic electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification. Methods and materials: The kernel machines investigated include the standard support vector machine (SVM), the least squares SVM, the Lagrangian SVM, the smooth SVM, the proximal SVM, and the relevance vector machine. An extensive series of experiments was conducted on publicly available data, whose clinical EEG recordings were obtained from five normal subjects and five epileptic patients. The performance levels delivered by the different kernel machines are contrasted in terms of the criteria of predictive accuracy, sensitivity to the kernel function/parameter value, and sensitivity to the type of features extracted from the signal. For this purpose, 26 values for the kernel parameter (radius) of two well-known kernel functions (namely. Gaussian and exponential radial basis functions) were considered as well as 21 types of features extracted from the EEG signal, including statistical values derived from the discrete wavelet transform, Lyapunov exponents, and combinations thereof. Results: We first quantitatively assess the impact of the choice of the wavelet basis on the quality of the features extracted. Four wavelet basis functions were considered in this study. Then, we provide the average accuracy (i.e., cross-validation error) values delivered by 252 kernel machine configurations; in particular, 40%/35% of the best-calibrated models of the standard and least squares SVMs reached 100% accuracy rate for the two kernel functions considered. Moreover, we show the sensitivity profiles exhibited by a large sample of the configurations whereby one can visually inspect their levels of sensitiveness to the type of feature and to the kernel function/parameter value. Conclusions: Overall, the results evidence that all kernel machines are competitive in terms of accuracy, with the standard and least squares SVMs prevailing more consistently. Moreover, the choice of the kernel function and parameter value as well as the choice of the feature extractor are critical decisions to be taken, albeit the choice of the wavelet family seems not to be so relevant. Also, the statistical values calculated over the Lyapunov exponents were good sources of signal representation, but not as informative as their wavelet counterparts. Finally, a typical sensitivity profile has emerged among all types of machines, involving some regions of stability separated by zones of sharp variation, with some kernel parameter values clearly associated with better accuracy rates (zones of optimality).

However, other important human communication channels may also be limited or unavailable for handicapped subjects - direct non-linguistic emotional communication by gesture, vocal prosody, facial expression, etc.. We report and examine a first demonstration of a musical 'emotion BCI' in which, as one element of a live musical performance, an able-bodied subject successfully engaged the electronic delivery of an ordered sequence of five music two-tone bass frequency drone sounds by imaginatively re-experiencing the human feeling he had spontaneously associated with the sound of each drone sound during training sessions. The EEG data included activities of both brain and non-brain sources (scalp muscles, eye movements). Common Spatial Pattern classification gave 84% correct pseudo-online performance and 5-of-5 correct classification in live performance. Re-analysis of the training session data including only the brain EEG sources found by multiple-mixture Arnica ICA decomposition achieved five-class classification accuracy of 59-70%, confirming that different voluntary emotion imagination experiences may be associated with distinguishable brain source EEG dynamics.

Performance assessment for EEG-based neonatal seizure detectors	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Performance assessment; Metrics; Neonatal EEG; Automated seizure detection; Machine learning; Support Vector Machines	INFANTS	Objective: This study discusses an appropriate framework to measure system performance for the task of neonatal seizure detection using EEG. The framework is used to present an extended overview of a multi-channel patient-independent neonatal seizure detection system based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Methods: The appropriate framework for performance assessment of neonatal seizure detectors is discussed in terms of metrics, experimental setups, and testing protocols. The neonatal seizure detection system is evaluated in this framework. Several epoch-based and event-based metrics are calculated and curves of performance are reported. A new metric to measure the average duration of a false detection is proposed to accompany the event-based metrics. A machine learning algorithm (SVM) is used as a classifier to discriminate between seizure and non-seizure EEG epochs. Two post-processing steps proposed to increase temporal precision and robustness of the system are investigated and their influence on various metrics is shown. The resulting system is validated on a large clinical dataset of 267 h. Results: In this paper, it is shown how a complete set of metrics and a specific testing protocol are necessary to extensively describe neonatal seizure detection systems, objectively assess their performance and enable comparison with existing alternatives. The developed system currently represents the best published performance to date with an ROC area of 96.3%. The sensitivity and specificity were similar to 90% at the equal error rate point. The system was able to achieve an average good detection rate of similar to 89% at a cost of 1 false detection per hour with an average false detection duration of 2.7 min. Conclusions: It is shown that to accurately assess the performance of EEG-based neonatal seizure detectors and to facilitate comparison with existing alternatives, several metrics should be reported and a specific testing protocol should be followed. It is also shown that reporting only event-based metrics can be misleading as they do not always reflect the true performance of the system. Significance: This is the first study to present a thorough method for performance assessment of EEG-based seizure detection systems. The evaluated SVM-based seizure detection system can greatly assist clinical staff, in a neonatal intensive care unit, to interpret the EEG.

Classification of Normal and Epileptic EEG Signal using Time & Frequency Domain Features through Artificial Neural Network	2012 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS (ICACC)			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Advances in Computing and Communications (ICACC)	AUG 09-11, 2012	Cochin, INDIA	IEEE Comp Soc, Rajagiri Sch Engn & Technol (RSET), ONGC, KSCSTE		Epilepsy; Electroencephalogram (EEG); seizure detection; Feedforward network; Artificial Neural Network		Epilepsy is one of the important brain disorders, characterized by sudden recurrent and transient disturbances of mental function and movements of body, which is caused from excessive neuronal activity due to highly frequent electrochemical impulses from the neurons. This excessive discharge is shown in EEG as epileptic spikes which are complementary source of information in diagnosis and localization of epilepsy. Currently there are many techniques for the diagnosis and monitoring of epilepsy. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have proved to be an effective approach for a broad spectrum of applications for EEG signals because of its self-adaptation and natural way to organize and implement the redundancy. This paper proposes a neural-network-based automated epileptic EEG detection system that uses Feedforward Artificial Neural Network incorporating sliding window technique for pattern recognition. This work utilizes 100 single channel EEG signals obtained from the database of Epilepsy Centre in Bonn, Germany. The algorithm was trained with 50 datasets and tested for 25 normal data and 25 epileptic data sets. The performance of classification using Feedforward Artificial Neural Network gave a high success rate of 93.37% for distinguishing normal signals and 95.5% for epileptic signals.	[Anusha, K.

Methods: The ERP responses of twenty-nine 6-month-olds, nineteen 12-month-olds and 10 adults to an auditory stimulus were derived from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. The most relevant wavelet coefficients corresponding to the first-and second-order moment sequences of the ERP signals were then identified using a feature selection scheme that made no a priori assumptions about the features of interest. These features are then fed into a classifier for determination of age group. Results: We verified that ERP data could yield features that discriminate the age group of individual subjects with high reliability. A low dimensional representation of the selected feature vectors show significant clustering behavior corresponding to the subject age group. The performance of the proposed age group prediction scheme was evaluated using the leave-one-out cross validation method and found to exceed 90% accuracy. Conclusions: This study indicates that ERP responses to an acoustic stimulus can be used to predict the age and consequently the state of brain development of infants. Significance: This study is of fundamental scientific significance in demonstrating that a machine classification algorithm with no a priori assumptions can classify ERP responses according to age and with further work, potentially provide useful clues in the understanding of the development of the human brain. A potential clinical use for the proposed methodology is the identification of developmental delay: an abnormal condition may be suspected if the age estimated by the proposed technique is significantly less than the chronological age of the subject.

We define a distributed representation of the EEG based on multichannel autoregressive models. In a subsequent step, we extend this multichannel modeling in a combinatoric setting, which is able to describe with a class of nonlinear combinatoric operators the embedded relationships that the EEG shows in the manifolds. The generality and the flexibility of the nonlinear combinatoric operators and their mathematical properties allow the design of an indefinite number of classification algorithms each displaying relevant properties, such as linearity with respect to the parameters, noise rejection, low computational complexity of the classification procedure. In such a way, we obtain an intuitive and rigorous way to design new BCI algorithms. As an example of this theoretical framework, we present a novel classification algorithm based on four properties of this nonlinear combinatoric operator. The method was validated on the classification of single-trial EEG signals recorded during motor imagination, and it was compared on two additional standard datasets obtained from the BCI competition, with other feature extraction and classification techniques based on common spatial pattern, common spatial subspace decomposition and Fisher discriminant analysis, linear discriminant analysis, Markov chains, and expectation maximization. In conclusion, the proposed framework is suited for a broad number of BCI applications.

Seizure generation: The role of nodes and networks	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Primary generalized epilepsy; Secondary generalized epilepsy; Focal epilepsy; Network mechanisms; Computational model	CLASSIFICATION; EPILEPSY	The longstanding dichotomy between the concepts of focal and primary generalized epilepsy has become increasingly blurred, raising fundamental questions about the nature of ictal onset in localized brain regions versus large-scale brain networks. We hypothesize that whether an EEG discharge appears focal or generalized is driven by the pattern of connections in brain networks, irrespective of the presence of focal brain abnormality. Using a computational model of a simple brain consisting of four regions and the connections between them, we explored the effects of altering connectivity structure versus the effects of introducing an abnormal brain region, and the interactions between these factors. Computer simulations demonstrated that electroencephalography (EEG) discharges representing either generalized or focal seizures arose purely as a consequence of subtle changes in network structure, without the requirement for any localized pathologic brain region. Furthermore we found that introducing a pathologic region gave rise to focal, secondary generalized, or primary generalized seizures depending on the network structure. Counterintuitively, we found that decreasing connectivity between regions of the brain increased the frequency of seizure-like activity. Our findings may enlighten current controversies surrounding the concepts of focal and generalized epilepsy, and help to explain recent observations in genetic animal models and human epilepsies, where loss of white matter pathways was associated with the occurrence of seizures.

Fast attainment of computer cursor control with noninvasively acquired brain signals	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SIGNALS; MOTOR CORTEX; HUMANS; TETRAPLEGIA; MEG; INTERFACE; VELOCITY; NEURONS; SYSTEM; EEG	Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are allowing humans and non-human primates to drive prosthetic devices such as computer cursors and artificial arms with just their thoughts. Invasive BCI systems acquire neural signals with intracranial or subdural electrodes, while noninvasive BCI systems typically acquire neural signals with scalp electroencephalography (EEG). Some drawbacks of invasive BCI systems are the inherent risks of surgery and gradual degradation of signal integrity. A limitation of noninvasive BCI systems for two-dimensional control of a cursor, in particular those based on sensorimotor rhythms, is the lengthy training time required by users to achieve satisfactory performance. Here we describe a novel approach to continuously decoding imagined movements from EEG signals in a BCI experiment with reduced training time. We demonstrate that, using our noninvasive BCI system and observational learning, subjects were able to accomplish two-dimensional control of a cursor with performance levels comparable to those of invasive BCI systems. Compared to other studies of noninvasive BCI systems, training time was substantially reduced, requiring only a single session of decoder calibration (similar to 20 min) and subject practice (similar to 20 min). In addition, we used standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography to reveal that the neural sources that encoded observed cursor movement may implicate a human mirror neuron system. These findings offer the potential to continuously control complex devices such as robotic arms with one's mind without lengthy training or surgery.

Previous feature extraction methods used power spectra density values dervied from Fourier Transform or sub-band energy and entropy derived from Wavelet Transform. These feature extracion methods eliminate temporal information which are essential for analyzing EEG signals. The DWT coefficients represent the degree of correlation between the analyzed signal and the wavelet function at different instances of time; therefore, DWT coefficients contain temporal information of the analyzed signal. The proposed feature extraction method fully utilizes the simultaneous time-frequency analysis of DWT by preserving the temporal information in the DWT coefficients. In this paper, we also study the effects of using different wavelet functions (Coiflets, Daubechies and Symlets) on the performance of the emotion recognition system. The input EEG signals were obtained from two electrodes according to 10-20 system: F-p1 and F-p2. Visual stimuli from International Affective Picture System (IAPS) were used to induce two emotions: happy and sad. Two classifiers were used: Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Experimental results confirmed that the proposed DWT coefficients method showed improvement of performance compared to previous methods.	[Yohanes, Rendi E.

An improved Hilbert-Huang transform method was applied to time-frequency analysis of non-stable EEG signals for the sleep staging in this paper. In order to settle the frequency overlapping problem of intrinsic mode function obtained from traditional HHT, wavelet package transform was introduced to bandwidth refinement of EEG before the empirical mode decomposition was conducted. This method improved the time-frequency resolution effectively. Then the intrinsic mode functions and their marginal spectrums would be calculated. Six common spectrum energies (or spectral energy ratios) were selected as characteristic parameters. Finally, a probabilistic nearest neighbor method for statistical pattern recognition was applied to optimal decision. The experiment data was from the Sleep-EDF database of MIT-BIH. The classification results showed that the automatic sleep staging decisions based on this method conformed roughly with the manual staging results and were better than those obtained from traditional HHT obviously. Therefore, the method in this paper could be applied to extract features of sleep stages and provided necessary dependence for automatic sleep staging.

Brain Computer Interface(BCI) based on ElectroEncephalo-Graph(EEG) is a relatively reliable and convenient mechanism to reflect one's psychological phenomena. In this paper we propose a new integrated approach to predict human vigilance level, which incorporate an automatically artifact removing pre-process, a novel vigilance quantification method and finally a hierarchical Gaussian Mixed Model(hGMM) to discover the underlying pattern of EEG signals. A reasonable high classification performance (88.46% over 12 data sets) is obtained using this integrated approach. The hGMM is proved to be more powerful against Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA) under complicated probability distributions.

For the new paradigm, we do not know which positions are activated or not. A simple approach is to use as many channels as possible. Using many channels cause other problems. When applying a common spatial pattern (CSP), which is an EEG extraction method, many channels cause an overfitting problem, in addition there is difficulty using this technique for medical analysis. To overcome these problems, we suggest a particle swarm optimization applied to CSP. This paper examines selecting optimal channels among all channels, and comparing the classification accuracy between CSP and CSP with PSO by linear discriminant analysis.

Current BMI technology allows us to control, with a high level of accuracy, the positioning of robotic hands in space. We have shown previously that it is possible to decode the dexterous movements of fingers during grasping, from noninvasively recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. Due to the absence of overt movement in clinical subjects with impaired hand function, however, it is not possible to construct decoder models directly by simultaneously recording brain activity and kinematics. The mirror neuron system is activated in a similar fashion during both overt movements and observing movements performed by other agents. Here, we investigate action-observation as a strategy to calibrate decoders for grasping in human subjects. Subjects observed while a robotic hand performed grasping movements, and decode models were calibrated using the EEG activity of the subjects and the kinematics of the robotic hand. Decoding accuracy was tested on unseen data, in an 8-fold cross validation scheme, as the correlation coefficient between the predicted and actual trajectories. High decoding accuracies were obtained (r = 0.70 +/- 0.07), demonstrating the feasibility of using action-observation as a calibration technique for decoding grasping movements.

However, the limitation in developing this system is lack of a major indicator which can be applied to a realistic application. In our past studies, we investigated the physiological changes in the transition of driver's cognitive state by using EEG power spectrum analysis and found that the features in the occipital area were highly correlated with the driver's driving performance. In this study, we construct an EEG-based self-constructed neural fuzzy system to estimate the driver's cognitive state by using the EEG features from the occipital area. Experimental results show that the proposed system had the better performance than other neural networks. Moreover, the proposed system can not only be limited to apply to individual subjects but also sufficiently works in between subjects.

SODA uses shrinkage regularization on empirical histograms to deal with the high dimensionality of multi-channel EEG signals and the small sizes of many real-world datasets. It is designed to make few a priori assumptions, and can handle both non-linear and non-Gaussian flows across electrode sites. The use of James-Stein shrinkage allows the SODA algorithm to achieve higher sensitivity to directed neural interactions for a given specificity. We augment this through a central limit theorem-based approach that can assess the statistical significance of each discovered interaction. When evaluated on brain computer interface EEG motor activity data the neural decoding obtained using SODA outperformed several state-of-the-art approaches including Granger causality, MI, unregularized directed information, and spatial coherence. Our results show that SODA localizes 30% more directed interactions in regions that are consistent with Brodmann functional areas of motor activity.

Measurement of cognitive load can enable real-time personalized content generation for distant learning, usability testing of applications on mobile devices and other areas related to human interactions. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can be used to analyze the brain-signals and measure the cognitive load. We have used a low cost and commercially available neuro-headset as the EEG device. A universal model, generated by supervised learning algorithms, for different levels of cognitive load cannot work for all individuals due to the issue of normalization. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach for measuring the level of cognitive load on an individual for a given stimulus. Results indicate that the unsupervised approach is comparable and sometimes better than supervised (e. g. support vector machine) method. Further, in the unsupervised domain, the Component based Fuzzy c-Means (CFCM) outperforms the traditional Fuzzy c-Means (FCM) in terms of the measurement accuracy of the cognitive load.

This BCI application is of particular interest to disabled patients who have lost all means of verbal and motor communication. Error-related Potentials (ErrPs) in the EEG are generated by the subject's perception of an error. We report on the possibility of using these ErrPs for improving the performance of a P300 Speller. Overall nine subjects were tested, allowing us to study their EEG responses to correct and incorrect performances of the BCI, compare our findings to previous studies, explore the possibility of detecting ErrPs and discuss the integration of ErrP classifiers into the P300 Speller system.

However, the CSP algorithm is known to be sensitive to noise and artifacts, and its performance greatly depends on the operational frequency band. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel Sparse Multi-Frequency Band CSP (SMFBCSP) algorithm optimized using a mutual information-based approach. Compared to the use of the cross-validation-based method which finds the regularization parameters by trial and error, the proposed mutual information-based approach directly computes the optimal regularization parameters such that the computational time is substantially reduced. The experimental results on 11 stroke patients showed that the proposed SMFBCSP significantly outperformed three existing algorithms based on CSP, sparse CSP and filter bank CSP in terms of classification accuracy.

In this study, we examined the clinical course and evolution of EEG findings associated with GPEDs in children with refractory convulsive SE. Methods: The EEG reports of 279 children with SE diagnosed between 2002 and 2010 were reviewed to detect GPEDs. Ten children were identified with GPEDs on continuous EEG recording. The entire EEG recording was available for review in only six children. In the clinical course, seizure characteristics and evolution of EEG findings were analyzed. Results: Six children (age, 5 to 17 years) were admitted to the intensive care unit with refractory convulsive SE. All had acute symptomatic SE except for one child with a history of epilepsy and developmental delay. Intravenous anesthetic agents were used to treat convulsive SE in five children. After tapering the intravenous anesthetic agents, GPEDs were seen on the continuous EEG recording, nonconvulsive seizures occurred in five, and nonconvulsive SE in four children. None of the children returned to baseline, and three children died. Conclusions: Generalized periodic epileptiform discharges are seen during the treatment course of convulsive SE in children and heralded seizure recurrence. We found a sequential evolution of the EEG patterns after the control of convulsive SE, with GPEDs occurring in a dynamic fashion in a continuum along with burst suppression and electrographic seizures. Recognizing that GPEDs represent a still active epileptic state after the control of convulsive SE with intravenous anesthetic agents and modifying the treatment regimen to control GPEDs may prevent immediate seizure recurrence.

We repeated ictal SPECT in patients with partial epilepsy whose first ictal SPECT was nonlocalized. We also performed subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (SISCOM) to test the localizability of ictal SPECT. Methods: We recruited 69 patients with partial epilepsy (33 male and 36 female, mean plus or minus standard deviation age 29.5 +/- 12.2 years), who had a repeated ictal SPECT. Ictal-interictal SPECT subtractions were performed, and the subtracted SPECTs were coregistered with their brain MRI studies. SISCOM results were considered to be localizing when the results were concordant with the final location of the epileptic focus, as determined by the presurgical evaluation. We compared seizure duration, tracer injection time, interictal and ictal scalp electroencephalography (EEG) patterns, presence and time of secondary generalization, and epilepsy classification between the localized and nonlocalized SISCOM groups. Key Findings: The SISCOM results of the second ictal SPECT were localized in 43 (62.3%) patients and nonlocalized in 26 (37.7%) patients. In the second ictal SPECT, the radiotracer injection time was significantly shorter in the localized group (25.1 +/- 8.9 s), as compared to the nonlocalized group (49.2 +/- 55.8 s) (p = 0.008). Furthermore, the radiotracer injection time of the second ictal SPECT was significantly shorter than the first ictal SPECT, only in the localized group (36.8 +/- 23.8 s in the first and 25.1 +/- 8.9 s in the second ictal SPECT in the localized group, p = 0.004). The percent injection time ([(tracer injection time) seizure onset time)/total seizure duration] x 100%) in the second SPECT was significantly shorter in the localized group, as compared to the nonlocalized group (37.9 +/- 23.0% in the localized group and 72.3 +/- 46.2% in the nonlocalized group, p < 0.001). The localized ictal EEG patterns at the time of injection were more frequent in the localized SISCOM group. The secondary generalization of seizures at the time of injection was more frequent in nonlocalized groups. Significance: Repeated ictal SPECT with SISCOM analysis is helpful for localizing an epileptic focus in patients with partial epilepsy who have a nonlocalized first ictal SPECT. The most important factor for increasing the localizability of repeated ictal SPECT is early injection time and a localizing ictal EEG pattern at the time of radiotracer injection.

However, to enable devices with high clinical value, a critical requirement is the ability to analyze the signals to extract specific medical information. Yet given the complexities of the underlying processes, signal analysis poses numerous challenges. Data-driven methods based on machine learning offer distinct solutions, but unfortunately the computations are not well supported by traditional DSP. This paper presents a custom processor that integrates a CPU with configurable accelerators for discriminative machine-learning functions. A support-vector-machine accelerator realizes various classification algorithms as well as various kernel functions and kernel formulations, enabling range of points within an accuracy-versus-energy and -memory trade space. An accelerator for embedded active learning enables prospective adaptation of the signal models by utilizing sensed data for patient-specific customization, while minimizing the effort from human experts. The prototype is implemented in 130-nm CMOS and operates from 1.2 V-0.55 V (0.7 V for SRAMs). Medical applications for EEG-based seizure detection and ECG-based cardiac-arrhythmia detection are demonstrated using clinical data, while consuming 273 mu J and 124 mu J per detection, respectively; this represents 62.4x and 144.7x energy reduction compared to an implementation based on the CPU. A patient-adaptive cardiac-arrhythmia detector is also demonstrated, reducing the analysis-effort required for model customization by 20x.

To obtain this objective, BCI devices make use of classifiers which translate inputs from the user's brain signals into commands for external devices. This paper describes an adaptive bi-stage classifier based on RBF neural networks and Hidden Markov Models. The first stage analyses the user's electroencephalografic input signal and provides sequences of pre-assignations to the second stage. The segment of EEG signal is assigned to the HMM with the highest probability of generating the pre-assignation sequence. The algorithm is tested with real samples of electroencephalografic signal, from five healthy volunteers using the cross-validation method. The results allow to conclude that it is possible to implement this algorithm in an on-line BCI device, but a huge dependency in the percentage of the correct classification from the user and the setup parameters has been detected.

In order to complement existing motor-based control paradigms, this paper proposed a novel imagery mode: speech imagery. Chinese characters are monosyllabic and one Chinese character can express one meaning. Thus, eight Chinese subjects were required to read two Chinese characters in mind in this experiment. There were different shapes, pronunciations and meanings between two Chinese characters. Feature vectors of EEG signals were extracted by common spatial patterns (CSP), and then these vectors were classified by support vector machine (SVM). The accuracy between two characters was not superior. However, it was still effective to distinguish whether subjects were reading one character in mind, and the accuracies were between 73.65% and 95.76%. The results were better than vowel speech imagery, and they were suitable for asynchronous BCI. BCI systems will be also extended from motor imagery to combine motor imagery and speech imagery in the future. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

C	Wang, N; Lyu, MR; Yang, CG			IEEE	Wang, Ning; Lyu, Michael R.; Yang, Chenguang			A Machine Learning Framework for Space Medicine Predictive Diagnostics with Physiological Signals	2013 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2013	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			SEIZURE-PREDICTION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SYMPTOMS; EPILEPSY; LONG	Prognostics and health management (PHM) in the context of space missions focuses on the fundamental issues of system failures in an attempt to predict when the failures may occur, and links these issues to system life cycle management. Space missions that are targeting for aerospace exploration or aviation also pose great challenges on the health conditions of people involved, such like astronauts, crew members, aviators, etc. Considering the inherent risks of space missions and the difficulty of direct communications between crew and ground support medical specialists, we see that greater autonomy in medical operations for crew is required. Namely, there is an urgent call for an effective on board medical system to predict and prevent health problems in a timely manner, rather than following reactive approaches which are inherent to conventional medicine. Interdisciplinary research is underway to develop computer based, self-diagnosis and self-directed treatment programs for the crew to autonomously predict, prevent, and manage potential health problems of two types: physiological and psychological. Predictive diagnostics aims at identifying negative health trends with concerned premonitory symptoms followed by predicting the future health condition and raising alarms in case of emergency. These alarms will startup devices that are capable of quickly reacting to an acute disease by delivering therapy or notifying a caregiver, thus avoiding fatal consequences likely to occur. Acute diseases such as cardiovascular and epileptic seizures are found to be frequently incident in-flight medical events, where the aftermath of seizures such as dyspnoea or serious physical injuries usually does the most harm to the subject. Consequently, a predictive diagnostics system that is able to provide early and action able real-time warnings of impending health problems would play an extremely crucial role in aerospace medicine. In this process, the diagnostic determination is based on the differences between current health status and the predefined normal status. Besides, considering the underlying concepts in predictive diagnostics of aerospace medicine in which every crew member is unique, the development of a processing strategy specially designed for each individual on a subject-by-subject basis is not only necessary but also feasible. The highly autonomous predictive diagnostics system in aerospace medicine would then be able to perform real-time health assessment followed by a comparison of inspection results with a crew member's health baseline, where the health baseline refers to a normal health state in which the crew member is identified as a physically and mentally healthy person to meet in-flight specific requirements. On the Information Technology side, machine learning techniques have made tremendous progress recently in medical diagnosis and health data analytics. We consequently initiate an effort on bringing machine learning based disease prediction technology as predictive diagnostics applications in the context of aerospace medicine. In space missions the physiological and psychological health conditions of crew are subject to continuous monitoring, in which electroencephalogram (EEG) , electromyogram (EMG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals can be critical. EEG is broadly used to study the nervous system, monitoring of sleep stages, biofeedback and control, and diagnosis of epilepsy. Considering EEG has long been employed in crew selection and training, and recently been widely recognized as an effective means for disease diagnosis and prediction, in this paper we mainly focus on EEG in our investigation for aerospace medicine. After introduction of EEG and its applications in predictive diagnostics, we explore and extract amplitude-frequency patterns in EEG to provide distinctive features as health indicators. To further achieve predictive diagnostics for aerospace medicine, we propose a machine learning based framework involving physiological signals for automatic health monitoring and disease prediction. This framework incorporates feature extraction as front end, and employs state-of-the-art data mining and classification mechanism to proactively distinguish between normal and abnormal health conditions in real time. Automatic disease prediction for crew members can therefore be timely provided for proper actions. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm, we employ epileptic seizure prediction as a case study. It is shown through experiments that the proposed predictive diagnostic system leads to promising prediction results. As an application of the disease prediction framework on physiological sources other than EEG, we have further discussed its employment on measuring and diagnosing disrupted neuromuscular characteristics and muscle fatigue for astronauts and aviators with EMG signals.

Brain imaging differences among single domain subgroups of MCI were recently reported supporting the idea that electroencephalography (EEG) functional hallmarks can be used to differentiate these subgroups. We performed event-related potential (ERP) measures and independent component analysis in 18 sd-aMCI, 13 sd-dMCI and 35 nnd-aMCI cases during the successful performance of the Attentional Network Test. Sensitivity and specificity analyses of ERP for the discrimination of MCI subgroups were also made. In center-cue and spatial-cue warning stimuli, contingent negative variation (CNV) was elicited in all MCI subgroups. Two independent components (ICA1 and 2) were superimposed in the time range on the CNV. The ICA2 was strongly reduced in sd-dMCI compared to sd-aMCI and nnd-aMCI (4.3 vs. 7.5% and 10.9% of the CNV component). The parietal P300 ERP latency increased significantly in sd-dMCI compared to md-aMCI and sd-aMCI for both congruent and incongruent conditions. This latency for incongruent targets allowed for a highly accurate separation of sd-dMCI from both sd-aMCI and nnd-aMCI with correct classification rates of 90 and 81%, respectively. This EEG parameter alone performed much better than neuropsychological testing in distinguishing sd-dMCI from md-aMCI. Our data reveal qualitative changes in the composition of the neural generators of CNV in sd-dMCI. In addition, they document an increased latency of the executive P300 component that may represent a highly accurate hallmark for the discrimination of this MCI subgroup in routine clinical settings.

Since large volume of data need to be analyzed, visual analysis has been proven to be time consuming and subsequently automated detection techniques have gained importance in the recent years. For the biomedical research community, the major challenge lies in providing a solution to neurologists in terms of diagnosis and EEG database management. This paper discusses the automated detection of epileptic seizure using frequency domain and entropy parameters which helps in the construction of epileptic database for handling EEG data. Experimental study indicates that the suggested mode of operation can be used for internet based framework which contains pure epileptic patterns in the server. This can be retrieved and analyzed for detection and annotation of epileptic spikes in extensive EEG recordings.

To improve the portability and practicability of BCI systems, it is crucial to reduce the number of EEG channels as well as to have a good reliability. However, a relatively neglected issue in the EEG channel selection studies is the robustness of selected channels across sessions. This paper investigates whether the selected channels from first session is also useful for subsequent sessions on other days for a stroke patient. For this purpose, a new robust sparse common spatial pattern (RSCSP) algorithm is proposed for optimal EEG channel selection. Thereafter, the robustness of the proposed algorithm as well as 5 existing channel selection algorithms is investigated across 12 sessions data from 11 stroke patients who performed motor imagery based-BCI rehabilitation. The experimental results show that the proposed RSCSP channel selection algorithm significantly outperforms the other channel selection algorithms, when the 8 channels selected from the first session are evaluated on the 11 subsequent sessions. Moreover, there is no significant difference between the classification results of 8 channels selected by the proposed RSCSP algorithm from the first session and the classification results of 8 optimal channels selected from the same session as the test session.

Passive robot assistance in arm movement decoding from EEG signals	2013 6TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	NOV 06-08, 2013	San Diego, CA	IEEE EMBS, Battelle, Brain Vis LLC, Cortech Solut, Univ Minnesota, IGERT Program, Syst Neuroengineering, IOP Publishing, Ripple, Univ Minnesota, Inst Engn Med, Plexon				The past decade has seen the rapid development of upper limb kinematic decoding techniques by performing intracortical recordings of brain signals. However, the use of non-invasive approaches to perform similar decoding procedures is still in its early stages. Previous works show that there is a correlation between electroencephalographic signals and position/velocity hand movement parameters. In these studies, it was observed that uniform and linear movements were better decoded. In this paper, a passive robot assistance has been used during non-invasive hand kinematics decoding. To study the influence of movement variability in this decoding, we propose to use this passive robot arm to track a circle that moves on the screen. Brain signals are recorded while performing the movements. The decoding method is based on a linear regression model applied to low frequency signal components. The decoding accuracy has been analyzed by studying the correlation between the reconstructed and original movements. These results have been compared to previous works in which a computer mouse was used to perform the movements. The results show more stable and realistic decoding accuracies when using the planar robot. Also, we show that decoding accuracy is directly correlated to tracking success.

However, there is no direct objective measure to determine if a subject is performing motor imagery correctly for proper calibration. Studies have shown that passive movement, which is directly observable, induces Event-Related Synchronization patterns that are similar to those induced from motor imagery. Hence, this paper investigates the feasibility of calibrating EEG-based motor imagery BCI from passive movement. EEG data of 12 healthy subjects were collected during motor imagery and passive movement of the hand by a haptic knob robot. The calibration models using the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern algorithm on the EEG data from motor imagery were compared against using the EEG data from passive movement. The performances were compared based on the 10. 10-fold cross-validation accuracies of the calibration data, and off-line session-to-session transfer kappa values to other sessions of motor imagery performed on another day. The results showed that the calibration performed using passive movement yielded higher model accuracy and off-line session-to-session transfer (73.6% and 0.354) than the calibration performed using motor imagery (71.3% and 0.311), and no significant differences were observed between the two groups (p=0.20, 0.23). Hence, this study shows that it is feasible to calibrate EEG-based motor imagery BCI from passive movement.

Since sleep EEG patterns also change regularly from light to deep sleep states, we firstly applied multiscale permutation entropy (MPE) to analysis sleep EEG to investigate the relations between changes of sleep stages and the MPE values. It was observed that correlation coefficient between the averaged MPE values of sleep EEG and the manual scoring of sleep stages can reach over 0.7. Then a MPE-based sleep scoring method for single channel EEG was developed. After training based on the data from 10 subjects, the overall sensitivity of the proposed automatic sleep scoring method combining MPE, autoregressive models, and linear discriminant analysis can reach 89.1% evaluated by the data of the other 10 subjects. Due to high accuracy and requiring only single-channel EEG, the proposed method has good applicability for sleep monitoring and home cares.

EEG-Based Classification of Music Appraisal Responses Using Time-Frequency Analysis and Familiarity Ratings	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING			English	Article						Appraisal classification; EEG; familiarity; music; pattern recognition; signal processing	LIKING; RECORDINGS; FLUENCY; EMOTION; MEMORY	A time-windowing feature extraction approach based on time-frequency (TF) analysis is adopted here to investigate the time-course of the discrimination between musical appraisal electroencephalogram (EEG) responses, under the parameter of familiarity. An EEG data set, formed by the responses of nine subjects during music listening, along with self-reported ratings of liking and familiarity, is used. Features are extracted from the beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-49 Hz) EEG bands in time windows of various lengths, by employing three TF distributions (spectrogram, Hilbert-Huang spectrum, and Zhao-Atlas-Marks transform). Subsequently, two classifiers (k-NN and SVM) are used to classify feature vectors in two categories, i.e., "like" and "dislike," under three cases of familiarity, i.e., regardless of familiarity (LD), familiar music (LDF), and unfamiliar music (LDUF). Key findings show that best classification accuracy (CA) is higher and it is achieved earlier in the LDF case {91.02 +/- 1.45% (7.5-10.5 s)} as compared to the LDUF case {87.10 +/- 1.84% (10-15 s)}. Additionally, best CAs in LDF and LDUF cases are higher as compared to the general LD case {85.28 +/- 0.77%}. The latter results, along with neurophysiological correlates, are further discussed in the context of the existing literature on the time-course of music-induced affective responses and the role of familiarity.

The chapter starts with the concept of BCI, the different categories and their relevance for speech- and motor disabled patients. The SSVEP paradigm is explained in detail. The discussed processing and decoding methods employ either time-domain or spectral domain features. Finally, to show the usability of these methods and of SSVEP-based BCIs in general, three applications are described: a spelling system, the "Maze" game and the "Tower Defense" game. We conclude the chapter by addressing some challenges for future research.

In this paper, the phenomenon of event-related de-synchronization in EEG was pre-processed and features were extracted by using common space pattern filtering algorithm. Higher classification accuracy was then obtained by employing C-SVM for left, right hand and leg movement discrimination. Then the algorithms were applied in the design of brain computer interface for the control of humanoid robot. The operations by EEG and manual device were compared to illustrate the effectiveness of the BCI system.

Time-frequency mapping of the rhythmic limb movements distinguishes convulsive epileptic from psychogenic nonepileptic seizures	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures; Epileptic seizures; Time-frequency mapping; Limb movements		Purpose A definite diagnosis of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) usually requires in-patient video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. Previous research has shown that convulsive psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) demonstrate a characteristic pattern of rhythmic movement artifact on the EEG. Herein we sought to examine the potential for time-frequency mapping of data from a movement-recording device (accelerometer) worn on the wrist as a diagnostic tool to differentiate between convulsive epileptic seizures and PNES. Methods Time-frequency mapping was performed on accelerometer traces obtained during 56 convulsive seizure-like events from 35 patients recorded during in-patient video-EEG monitoring. Twenty-six patients had PNES, eight had epileptic seizures, and one had both seizure types. The time-frequency maps were derived from fast Fourier transformations to determine the dominant frequency for sequential 2.56-s blocks for the course of each event. Key Findings The coefficient of variation (CoV) of limb movement frequency for the PNES events was less than for the epileptic seizure events (median, 17.18% vs. 52.23%; p<0.001). A blinded review of the time-frequency maps by an epileptologist was accurate in differentiating between the event types, that is, 38 (92.7%) of 41 and 6 (75%) of 8 nonepileptic and epileptic seizures, respectively, were diagnosed correctly, with seven events classified as nondiagnostic. Using a CoV cutoff score of 32% resulted in similar classification accuracy, with 42 (93%) of 45 PNES and 10 (91%) of 11 epileptic seizure events correctly diagnosed. Significance Time-frequency analysis of data from a wristband movement monitor could be utilized as a diagnostic tool to differentiate between epileptic and nonepileptic convulsive seizure-like events.

A dataset of 82 recordings of sevoflurane, isoflurane and desflurane anesthesia underlies the study. 3 second segments from the onset of altogether 3214 bursts are described using AR model parameters, spectral entropy and sample entropy as features. The features are clustered using the K-means algorithm. The results indicate that no clear cut distinction can be made between the burst patterns induced by the mentioned anesthetics although bursts of certain properties are more common in certain patient groups. Several directions for further investigations are proposed based on visual inspection of the recordings.

Hyperkinetic seizures in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy: Clinical features and outcome after temporal lobe resection	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Hyperkinetic seizures; Temporal lobe epilepsy; Clinical features; Epilepsy surgery	COMPLEX PARTIAL SEIZURES; HYPERMOTOR SEIZURES; ICTAL SEMIOLOGY; ORIGIN; CLASSIFICATION; HIPPOCAMPAL; NETWORKS; LESIONS; ONSET	Purpose: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is usually associated with automatisms. Hyperkinetic seizures are supposed to be unusual. Because we witnessed several patients with TLE and ictal hyperkinetic symptoms, we retrospectively assessed the number, clinical findings, and seizure outcome in such patients who had undergone temporal lobe resection. Methods: We reviewed medical history, video-electroencephalography (EEG) recording and neuroimaging of adult patients who underwent epilepsy surgery for TLE at the Kork Epilepsy Center over the last 20 years with a minimum postoperative follow-up of 12 months. Key Findings: Among 294 patients who were resected exclusively in the temporal region, we identified 17 (6%) who presented with hyperkinetic semiology such as violent vocalization, complex movements of the proximal segments of the limbs, rotation of the trunk, pelvic thrusting, or early tonic or dystonic posturing. Most of the patients had a preceding aura. Ictal EEG activity was located in the corresponding temporal region, usually with a wide distribution over temporal electrodes with fast spread to unilateral frontal electrodes and to the contralateral side. Neuroimaging revealed extended lesions in the temporal lobe involving mesial and neocortical structures. Most of the patients underwent classical anterior temporal lobe resection including amygdalo-hippocampectomy. Fourteen patients (82%) became completely seizure-free (Engel class Ia). Histopathology showed mainly focal cortical dysplasia plus hippocampal sclerosis. Significance: Hyperkinetic seizure semiology may occasionally occur in patients with TLE and is, therefore, no contradiction to the hypothesis of TLE if scalp EEG patterns and neuroimaging findings correspond. The postoperative seizure outcome is favorable in such patients and not different from outcome data in classical TLE.

Linear Decoding of 2D Hand Movements for Target Selection Tasks Using a Non-Invasive BCI System	2013 7TH ANNUAL IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (SYSCON 2013)	Annual IEEE Systems Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	7th Annual IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon)	APR 15-18, 2013	Orlando, FL	IEEE			BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; STROKE	In this paper, a visual interface showing target selection tasks has been designed to decode 2D velocities from a brain-computer interface (BCI) system during hand movements. Ten healthy volunteers were asked to perform hand movements using a mouse to control a cursor on the screen. Three targets were randomly highlighted and the volunteers were asked to reach them with the cursor. The actual position of the cursor and the EEG activity were simultaneously acquired. To decode hand velocity, the EEG signals registered from 16 electrodes were processed and linear models were used to obtain the transformation to velocity values of the hand movement. The results of the decoded velocity were compared to the actual values using the Pearson correlation coefficient showing average correlation coefficients of 0.39 in the X-axis and 0.47 in the Y-axis, showing an improvement over previous results obtained when applying similar techniques. It is also relevant that the number of electrodes used has been significantly reduced (from 34 to 16) and the use of a 2D environment shows a great potential in future rehabilitation systems for stroke patients.

Ictal video-polygraphic features of perioral myoclonia with absences	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Perioral myoclonia with absences; Video-polygraphy; Idiopathic generalized epilepsy; Classification; Electromyography	SEIZURES; EEG	There have been few case reports of perioral myoclonia with absences (PUMA) because of the lack of video-polygraphic recordings clarifying the electroencephalogram (EEG)-electromyogram (EMG) correlations. We describe one of the first video-polygraphic studies of PUMA in a patient who underwent repeated and prolonged split-screen video-polygraphic recordings. The ictal EEG showed generalized and irregular discharges of spikes or multiple spikes and slow waves, while two concomitant EMG patterns appeared: (1) a rhythmic enhancement of the orbicularis oris and masseter muscles on both sides with minimal asymmetry corresponding to perioral movements, and (2) a progressive increment in muscular tone in the mylohyoideus muscle corresponding to oroalimentary automatisms. Myoclonic jerks were inconstantly time-locked to the spike component of the spike-wave complex. The evidence of a complex pattern of activation of the facial muscles suggests that the involvement of subcortical central pattern generators, related to masticatory activity, through the disinhibitory effect of the spike-wave discharge is a possible pathophysiological mechanism underlying POMA.

J	Shou, GF; Ding, L; Dasari, D				Shou, Guofa; Ding, Lei; Dasari, Deepika			Probing neural activations from continuous EEG in a real-world task: Time-frequency independent component analysis	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Data-driven method; EEG; Time-frequency independent component analysis; Air traffic control task	SINGLE-TRIAL ANALYSIS; MENTAL FATIGUE; BRAIN ACTIVITY; DYNAMICS; DESYNCHRONIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; STIMULATION; INCREASES; RHYTHMS; CORTEX	It is of fundamental significance to study human brain functions using neuroimaging technologies, such as electroencephalograph (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in real-world tasks. The present study explores the feasibility of using EEG to identify networked brain activations when subjects perform a realistic task. To robustly identify physiologically plausible EEG patterns related to brain activations involved in the task, a novel data-driven method, i.e., time-frequency independent component analysis (tfICA), is developed to analyze high-density EEG data, which combines the time-frequency analysis and complex-valued ICA method. Six classes of independent components (ICs) of various spatio-temporal-spectral patterns were identified across subjects, relating to frontal, motor, premotor, supplementary motor, secondary somatosensory, and occipital cortices, which suggest a networked brain activation involving visual perception and processing, movement planning and execution, working memory, performance monitoring, and decision making to accomplish the task. Our results indicate that temporal patterns of these ICs are consistent, show causal relationship among them, and of significant correlation to behavioral performance data recorded in same task sessions. Furthermore, the time-on-task effect that indicates the phenomenon of mental fatigue in sustained tasks for a long duration (i.e., 1 h) was observed. The present study demonstrates the capability of the tfICA method in distinguishing various brain processes from continuous EEG data obtained in a realistic task and it is thus promising to address real-world problems, such as time-on-task fatigue.

J	Brignol, A; Al-ani, T; Drouot, X				Brignol, Arnaud; Al-ani, Tarik; Drouot, Xavier			Phase space and power spectral approaches for EEG-based automatic sleep-wake classification in humans: A comparative study using short and standard epoch lengths	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Automated sleep-wake classification; Electroencephalogram; Classification; Phase space; Poincare plot	DYNAMICS; STATES	Sleep disorders in humans have become a public health issue in recent years. Sleep can be analysed by studying the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded during a night's sleep. Alternating between sleep-wake stages gives information related to the sleep quality and quantity since this alternating pattern is highly affected during sleep disorders. Spectral composition of EEG signals varies according to sleep stages, alternating phases of high energy associated to low frequency (deep sleep) with periods of low energy associated to high frequency (wake and light sleep). The analysis of sleep in humans is usually made on periods (epochs) of 30-s length according to the original Rechtschaffen and Kales sleep scoring manual. In this work, we propose a new phase space-based (mainly based on Poincare plot) algorithm for automatic classification of sleep-wake states in humans using EEG data gathered over relatively short-time periods. The effectiveness dour approach is demonstrated through a series of experiments involving EEG data from seven healthy adult female subjects and was tested on epoch lengths ranging from 3-s to 30-s. The performance of our phase space approach was compared to a 2-dimensional state space approach using the power spectral (PS) in two selected human-specific frequency bands. These powers were calculated by dividing integrated spectral amplitudes at selected human-specific frequency bands. The comparison demonstrated that the phase space approach gives better performance in the case of short as well as standard 30-s epoch lengths. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

We first selected 20 video clips with extrinsic emotional content from movies and online resources. Then, EEG responses and eye gaze data were recorded from 24 participants while watching emotional video clips. Ground truth was defined based on the median arousal and valence scores given to clips in a preliminary study using an online questionnaire. Based on the participants' responses, three classes for each dimension were defined. The arousal classes were calm, medium aroused, and activated and the valence classes were unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant. One of the three affective labels of either valence or arousal was determined by classification of bodily responses. A one-participant-out cross validation was employed to investigate the classification performance in a user-independent approach. The best classification accuracies of 68.5 percent for three labels of valence and 76.4 percent for three labels of arousal were obtained using a modality fusion strategy and a support vector machine. The results over a population of 24 participants demonstrate that user-independent emotion recognition can outperform individual self-reports for arousal assessments and do not underperform for valence assessments.

In our application, the data is collected in human computer interaction (HCI) scenarios. Basically, any type of input data can be processed by the ATLAS annotation tool, including speech (multi-channel), video (multi-channel), EEG, EMG, ECG data. In addition to the raw data, intermediate data processing results such as extracted features, and even (probabilistic or crisp) outputs of pre-trained classifier modules can be displayed. Tools for the annotation and transcription of HCI scenes are integrated as well. In this paper ATLAS's basic architectures and features are described, furthermore it is explained how different types of data and label information can be presented. Besides these basic annotation features, an active learning module (active data selection) has been integrated. Currently, probabilistic Support Vector Machines (SVM) are available in the ATLAS system.

However, conventional visual BCI feedback disturbs continuous and smooth interactions. Therefore, a new tactile stimulation system suitable for delivering BCI feedback to user is developed. The system employs tactile illusion of movement to produce a continuous movement within six coin motors. Two protocols that convert the BCI feedback into spatiotemporal patterns of the stimulator are tested online. The results show that there are no identified artifacts in the EEG signal and no degradation of classification accuracy.

J	Wang, HX				Wang, Haixian			Discriminant and adaptive extensions to local temporal common spatial patterns	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Common spatial patterns; Brain-computer interfaces (BCI); Fisher criterion; Sparse representation	FILTERS	An important issue in brain-computer interfaces based on multi-channel EEG signals is to extract spatial filters. Local temporal common spatial patterns (LTCSP) is a recently developed approach to find spatial filters, which takes temporally local information into account. The formulation of LTCSP, however, is essentially a subspace decomposition technique. In this paper, we extend LTCSP from the aspects of discrimination and adaption. The discriminant extension is based on the Fisher discriminant criterion that considers both the between-class and the within-class scatters. By contrast, LTCSP considers maximizing the between-class scatter only. The adaptive extension uses sparse representation to specify the weights between samples in constructing the temporally local scatter matrices. Experiments on single-trial EEG classification confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The ECG unit pattern concept was introduced to represent the standard RR interval, and our method extracted certain features from the unit patterns to classify by a primitive classifier. The proposed method was tested on two classification experiments by using ECG records in Physiobank databases and the results were compared to those from several previous studies. In the first experiment, an off-line classification was performed with unit patterns selected from long ECG segments. The method was also used to detect CHF by real-time ECG waveform analysis. In addition to demonstrating the success of the proposed method, the results showed that some unit patterns in a long ECG segment from a heart patient were more suggestive of disease than the others. These results indicate that the proposed approach merits additional research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The average range of local min-max R-lambda defined as the average differences between amplitudes of consecutive local minima and maxima is used as a temporal characteristic measure. From the computational results, it is observed that the sleep EEG epochs associated with different sleep stages manifest distinguishable characteristics of the average range of local min-max R-lambda for various subbands. The computational results also show that the lower frequency subbands of sleep EEG associated with various sleep stages exhibit opposite temporal characteristic (the average range of local min-max R-lambda) compared to the higher frequency subbands of sleep EEG. Furthermore, this suggests that the average range of local min-max R-lambda may be a useful feature for sleep stage classification.

The strength of a BCI system lies in its ability to determine the appropriate features for a given task and to be able to correctly classify a task amid many other mental tasks. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a cost effect and efficient means to capture the intent of a person with motor disorder. Wavelet decomposition for feature extraction from EEG is suitable for the analysis of non-linear and non-stationary time series. Hence, Wavelet decomposition of EEG is used in this study to form a feature set. Of the extracted features, a subset of discriminatory and relevant features is selected using ratio of scatter matrices, Chernoff distance measure and linear regression. The performance of different mental tasks using the selected features is compared and evaluated in terms of classification accuracy and the dimension of features. Experimental results on publicly available data show that there is significant improvement in classification accuracies with different feature selection methods. Linear regression performs better in comparison to other two methods and Support Vector Machine requires lesser number of features to build the model.	[Gupta, Akshansh; Agrawal, R.

Therefore, the N170 responses of EEG signals were analyzed to detect face stimuli in real time. We also proposed an analytical method for feature extraction of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with the bag of features scheme to overcome the general difficulty in setting of kernel parameters of SVM. The proposed method resulted in a constantly high accuracy in the face classification; the SVM classifier based on image pattern recognition in the time frequency domain efficiently enables easier setting of the non-linear kernel parameter.

People who are incapable to communicate conventionally due to spinal cord injury are in need of Brain Computer Interface. Brain Computer Interface uses the brain signals to take actions, control, actuate and communicate with the world directly using brain integration with peripheral devices and systems. Brain waves are in necessitating to eradicate noises and to extract the valuable features. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a functional pattern classification technique which is trained all the way through the error Back-Propagation algorithm. In this paper in order to classify the mental tasks, the brain signals are trained using neural network and also using Principal Component Analysis with Artificial Neural Network. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dominant tool for analyzing data and finding patterns in it. In Principal Component Analysis, data compression is possible and it projects higher dimensional data to lower dimensional data. By using Principal Component Analysis with Neural Network, the redundant data in the dataset is eliminated first and the obtained data is trained using Neural Network. EEG data for five cognitive tasks from five subjects are taken from the Colorado University database. Pattern classification is applied for the data of all tasks of one subject using Neural Network and also using Principal Component Analysis with Neural Network. Finally it is observed that the correctly classified percentage of data is better in Principal Component Analysis with Neural Network compared to Neural Network alone.

The formulation of the CSP criterion is based on variance using L2-norm, which implies that CSP is sensitive to outliers. In this paper, we propose a robust version of CSP, called CSP-L1, by maximizing the ratio of filtered dispersion of one class to the other class, both of which are formulated by using L1-norm rather than L2-norm. The spatial filters of CSP-L1 are obtained by introducing an iterative algorithm, which is easy to implement and is theoretically justified. CSP-L1 is robust to outliers. Experiment results on a toy example and datasets of BCI competitions demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

Previous research on music and emotions discovered that different music features can be used for classifying how certain music can induce emotions in an individual. We propose a method for collecting electroencephalograph (EEG) data from subjects listening to emotion-inducing music. The EEG data is used to continuously label high-level music features with continuous-valued emotion annotations using the emotion spectrum analysis method. The music features are extracted from MIDI files using a windowing technique. We highlight the results of two emotion models for stress and relaxation which were constructed using C4.5. Evaluations of the models using 10-fold cross validation give promising results with an average relative absolute error of 6.54% using a window length of 38.4 seconds.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) obtained when four subjects imagined the vocalization of Japanese vowels, /a/, lit, /u/, /e/, and /o/ in order and in random order while the subjects remained silent and immobilized were recorded using Ill scalp electrodes and 3 reference electrodes. Regarding detection of the imagined voice, some problems occurred by which the related brain geometries and suitable electrodes for classifications differed between subjects. To overcome these problems, we used an adaptive collection that divided ERP data into small elements, performed evaluation relative to the elements, and selected better elements for classification. In earlier reports of studies using the common spatial patterns (CSPs) filter and support vector machines (SI/Ms), the classification accuracies (CAs) were 56-72% for the pairwise classification /a/ vs. /u/ in the case of 63 channel EEG measurement In this study, the CA was improved to 73-92% using the adaptive collection. According to the CA, 19 channel measurements were worse than 111 channel measurements, but 63 channel measurements were slightly worse that 111 channel measurements. Using 63 channel measurements, 73% of CA was achieved for all pairwise combinations of the five vowels. The average of the CAs was 85%. These results show that the proposed method exhibited great potential for use in classification of imagined voice for a speech prosthesis controller.

Model-Based Seizure Detection for Intracranial EEG Recordings	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Automatic seizure detection; EEG; epilepsy; statistically optimal null filters (SONFs)	EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; SCALP EEG; SYSTEM; SEGMENTATION; ALGORITHM; ONSET; CLASSIFICATION	This paper presents a novel model-based patient-specific method for automatic detection of seizures in the intracranial EEG recordings. The proposed method overcomes the complexities in the practical implementation of the patient-specific approach of seizure detection. The method builds a seizure model (set of basis functions) for a priori known seizure (the template seizure pattern), and uses the statistically optimal null filters as a building block for the detection of similar seizures. The process of modeling the template seizure is fully automatic. Overall, the detection method involves the segmentation of the template seizure pattern, rejection of the redundant and noisy segments, extraction of features from the segments to generate a set of models, selection of the best seizure model, and training of the classifier. The trained classifier is used to detect similar seizures in the remaining data. The resulting seizure detection method was evaluated on a total of 304 h of single-channel depth EEG recordings from 14 patients. The system performance is further compared to the Qu-Gotman patient-specific system using the same data. A significant improvement in the proposed system, in terms of specificity, is observed over the compared method.	[Yadav, R.; Swamy, M. N.

Although spatial filters are increasingly being used to mitigate these effects, results have been limited. In this work, we investigate the use of the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) filtering technique to spatially filter signals from a 64-channel offline EEG data set comprising two classes of imagined movements. Despite CSP methods having already been demonstrated in BCI algorithms, there has been no study of how this technique can be used as a de-noising stage prior to feature extraction and classification. We propose the use of spectral analysis subsequent to CSP-based spatial filtering and demonstrate that this signal processing combination provides superior class separation to existing methods. Our results demonstrate that CSP-filtered signals exhibit strong separation between signal classes at frequency peaks at 4, 12, and 20Hz and at various electrode locations across the scalp.

However, patients who suffered a stroke in the motor cortex have lost brain activity in the injured area, and consequently, mobility in contralateral limbs. Such a loss eliminates the possibility of extracting motor information from brain activity while the patient is undergoing therapy for the affected limb. This work proposes to decode motor information from EEG activity of the contralesional hemisphere in patients who suffered a hemiparetic stroke. Four stroke patients participated in this study and the results proved the feasibility of decoding motor information while patients attempted to move the affected limb.

We recorded the EEG signals evoked by repeated presentation of 12 American English phonemes. A support vector machine model correctly recognized a high percentage of the EEG brain wave recordings represented by their phases, which were expressed in discrete Fourier transform coefficients. We show that phases of the oscillations restricted to the frequency range of 2-9 Hz can be used to successfully recognize brain processing of these phonemes. The recognition rates can be further improved using the scalp tangential electric field and the surface Laplacian around the auditory cortical area, which were derived from the original potential signal. The best rate for the eight initial consonants was 66.7%. Moreover, we found a distinctive phase pattern in the brain for each of these consonants. We then used these phase patterns to recognize the consonants, with a correct rate of 48.7%. In addition, in the analysis of the confusion matrices, we found significant similarity-differences were invariant between brain and perceptual representations of phonemes. These latter results supported the importance of phonological distinctive features in the neural representation of phonemes.

In statistics, a CSP filter can optimally separate the motor-imagery-related components. However, for a single trail, the EEG features extracted after a CSP filter still include features not related to motor imagery. In this study, we introduce a linear dynamical system (LDS) approach to motor-imagery-based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) to reduce the influence of these unrelated EEC features. This study is conducted on a BCI competition data set, which comprises EEG signals from several subjects performing various movements. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm with LDS performs better than a traditional algorithm on average. The results reveal a promising direction in the application of LDS-based approach to MI-BCI.

In this work, local temporal correlation (LTC) information was introduced to further improve the covariance matrices estimation (LTCCSP). Compared to the Euclidean distance used in a previous CSP variant named local temporal CSP (LTCSP), the correlation may be a more reasonable metric to measure the similarity of activated spatial patterns existing in motor imagery period. Numerical comparisons among CSP, LTCSP, and LTCCSP were quantitatively conducted on the simulated datasets by adding outliers to Dataset IVa of BCI Competition III and Dataset IIa of BCI Competition IV, respectively. Results showed that LTCCSP achieves the highest average classification accuracies in all the outliers occurrence frequencies. The application of the three methods to the EEG dataset recorded in our laboratory also demonstrated that LTCCSP achieves the highest average accuracy. The above results consistently indicate that LTCCSP would be a promising method for practical motor imagery BCI application.

We recorded EEG data while participants performed an associative recognition task that involved manipulations of word length, associative fan, and probe type, which were hypothesized to affect the perceptual encoding, retrieval, and decision stages of the recognition task, respectively. Analyses of the behavioral and EEG data, supplemented with classification of the EEG data using machine-learning techniques, provided evidence that generally supported the sequence of stages assumed by a computational model developed in the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational cognitive architecture. However, the results suggested a more complex relationship between memory retrieval and decision-making than assumed by the model. Implications of the results for modeling associative recognition are discussed. The study illustrates how a classifier approach, in combination with focused manipulations, can be used to investigate the timing of processing stages.

Such algorithms can facilitate novel clinical applications such as the estimation of a seizure's duration: the delivery of therapies designed to mitigate postictal period symptoms: or detection of the presence of status epilepticus. In this article, we present and evaluate a novel, machine learning-based method for detecting the termination of electrographic seizure activity. When tested on 133 seizures from a public database, our method successfully detected the end of 132 seizures within 10.3 +/- 5.5 seconds of the time determined by an electroencephalographer to represent the electrographic end of seizure. Furthermore, by pairing our seizure end detector with a previously published seizure onset detector, we could automatically estimate the duration of 85% of test electrographic seizures within a 15-second error margin compared with electroencephalographer determinations.

Exploiting these in intelligent, closed-loop systems requires detecting specific physiological states using very low power (i.e., 1-10mW for wearable devices, 10-100 mu W for implantable devices). Machine learning is a powerful tool for modeling correlations in physiological signals, but model complexity in typical biomedical applications makes detection too computationally intensive. We analyze the computational energy trade-offs and propose a method of restructuring the computations to yield more favorable trade-offs, especially for typical biomedical applications. We thus develop a methodology for implementing low-energy classification kernels and demonstrate energy reduction in practical biomedical systems. Two applications, arrhythmia detection using electrocardiographs (ECG) from the MIT-BIH database [1] and seizure detection using electroencephalographs (EEG) from the CHB-MIT [1,2] database, are used. The proposed computational restructuring can be used with very little performance degradation, and it reduces energy by 2627x and 7.0-36.3x (depending on the patient), respectively.

In order to recover the ability of movement, rehabilitation is the only way to improve the situation for many clients. Therefore, this study proposed a novel robot with brain-computer interface for rehabilitation exercises, namely BCRS (Brian-Controlled Rehabilitation System) and using multiple kernel learning (MKL) trains the classifier. BCRS detects and classifies the P300 and non-P300 signals from human brain and determines what kind of the rehabilitation exercises will be chosen. Three types of exercises, passive range of motion, isotonic, and isometric exercise, were realized in the system and support vector machine was used as the classification algorithm. For the three exercises, a new P300 panel was designed and composed of 25 commands. Through the experiments, we can find that BCRS can achieve good performance for rehabilitation exercises and MKL is a good method for EEG to have good accuracy of P300 signal classification and low training time than support vector machine (SVM).

We represent desired paths as geodesics with respect to a cost function that is defined so that each path-homotopy class contains exactly one (local) geodesic. We apply max-margin structured learning to recover a cost function that is consistent with observations of human walking paths. We derive an optimal feedback communication protocol to select a local geodesic-equivalently, a path-homotopy class-using a sequence of noisy bits. We validate our approach with experiments that quantify both how well our learned cost function characterizes human walking data and how well human subjects perform with the resulting interface in navigating a simulated robot with EEG.

In the context of machine learning, minimization of such a composite objective function is useful in enforcing various structures, such as sparsity, on the solution in a learning task. We introduce a particularly efficient instance of an augmented Lagrangian method called the Dual Augmented Lagrangian (DAL) algorithm, and discuss its connection to proximal minimization and operator splitting algorithms in the primal. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the DAL algorithm for the trace norm regularization can be used to learn features from multiple data sources and optimally combine them in a convex optimization problem.

This is devastatingly illustrated in clinical conditions such as the so-called locked-in syndrome (LIS) [1], in which severely motor-disabled patients become incapable to communicate naturally while being fully conscious and awake. For the last 20 years, research on motor-independent communication has focused on developing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) implementing neuroelectric signals for communication (e.g., [2-7]), and BCIs based on electroencephalography (EEG) have already been applied successfully to concerned patients [8-11]. However, not all patients achieve proficiency in EEG-based BCI control [12]. Thus, more recently, hemodynamic brain signals have also been explored for BCI purposes [13-16]. Here, we introduce the first spelling device based on fMRI. By exploiting spatiotemporal characteristics of hemodynamic responses, evoked by performing differently timed mental imagery tasks, our novel letter encoding technique allows translating any freely chosen answer (letter-by-letter) into reliable and differentiable single-trial fMRI signals. Most importantly, automated letter decoding in real time enables back-and-forth communication within a single scanning session. Because the suggested spelling device requires only little effort and pre-training, it is immediately operational and possesses high potential for clinical applications, both in terms of diagnostics and establishing short-term communication with nonresponsive and severely motor-impaired patients.

Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems can make use of such knowledge to deliver relevant feedback to the user or to an observer, or within a human-machine system to increase safety and enhance overall performance. Building robust and useful BCI models from accumulated biological knowledge and available data is a major challenge, as are technical problems associated with incorporating multimodal physiological, behavioral, and contextual data that may in the future be increasingly ubiquitous. While performance of current BCI modeling methods is slowly increasing, current performance levels do not yet support widespread uses. Here we discuss the current neuroscientific questions and data processing challenges facing BCI designers and outline some promising current and future directions to address them.

Sensor measurements are often highly correlated and signal-to-noise ratio is not homogeneously spread across sensors. Thus, collected data are highly variable and discrimination tasks are challenging. In this work, we focus on sensor weighting as an efficient tool to improve the classification procedure. We present an approach integrating sensor weighting in the classification framework. Sensor weights are considered as hyper-parameters to be learned by a support vector machine (SVM). The resulting sensor weighting SVM (sw-SVM) is designed to satisfy a margin criterion, that is, the generalization error. Experimental studies on two data sets are presented, a P300 data set and an error-related potential (ErrP) data set. For the P300 data set (BCI competition III), for which a large number of trials is available, the sw-SVM proves to perform equivalently with respect to the ensemble SVM strategy that won the competition. For the ErrP data set, for which a small number of trials are available, the sw-SVM shows superior performances as compared to three state-of-the art approaches. Results suggest that the sw-SVM promises to be useful in event-related potentials classification, even with a small number of training trials.

Given the very low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG, a signal enhancement phase is crucial for ensuring decent performances in BCI systems. Several methods have been proposed for EEG signal enhancement, such as Independent Component Analysis, Common Spatial Pattern, and Principal Component Analysis. We show that Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), initially introduced to SSVEP-based BCI as a feature extraction method, is a good candidate for such preprocessing state. Evaluation is performed on a recording from 5 subjects during a BCI task based on Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP). The authors demonstrate that CCA significantly improves classification performances in SSVEP-based BCIs.

The incidence and clinical implications of this EEG pattern in children are not known. In this study, we examined the clinical features of children with GPDs. Methods: EEG-video monitoring reports of children with critical illness in the intensive care unit were retrospectively reviewed to detect GPDs. The clinical history, hospital course and seizure characteristics were reviewed and outcome was based on the clinical findings at hospital discharge. Results: Twenty one children (age 2-18 years) were identified with GPDs. The most common underlying etiology was encephalitis (N=11). At the time of EEG, a continuous intravenous infusion (cIV) of an anticonvulsant drug was used to treat refractory status epilepticus (RSE). Non-convulsive seizures (NCS) were identified in 15, and clinical seizures in 13 children after GPDs were detected. GPDs occurred after a dose reduction in the cIV in 43%. Neuroimaging done in 16 children showed an acute change in 13/16 (81%) and chronic changes in 2/16 (13%). Five children (23%) died. Seven (33%) children had a favorable outcome, whereas the remaining children had a moderate to severe disability at the time of hospital discharge. Conclusion: GPDs are seen during the course of RSE in critically ill children and are associated with seizure recurrence. A lower mortality rate occurs in children with GPDs compared to adult counterparts, likely related to different etiologies. Although the significance of GPDs must be determined within the context of the clinical situation, GPDs suggest a still active epileptic process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Duffy, FH; Als, H				Duffy, Frank H.; Als, Heidelise			A stable pattern of EEG spectral coherence distinguishes children with autism from neuro-typical controls - a large case control study	BMC MEDICINE			English	Article						Autism spectrum disorder; pervasive developmental disorder; PDD; EEG coherence; principal components analysis; PCA; coherence factors; discriminant analysis	PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NUMERICAL EVALUATION; CYTOLOGIC DATA; BRAIN; DISORDERS; ADOLESCENTS; AGE; ARTIFACTS; GENDER	Background: The autism rate has recently increased to 1 in 100 children. Genetic studies demonstrate poorly understood complexity. Environmental factors apparently also play a role. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies demonstrate increased brain sizes and altered connectivity. Electroencephalogram (EEG) coherence studies confirm connectivity changes. However, genetic, MRI- and/or EEG-based diagnostic tests are not yet available. The varied study results likely reflect methodological and population differences, small samples and, for EEG, lack of attention to group-specific artifact. Methods: Of the 1,304 subjects who participated in this study, with ages ranging from 1 to 18 years old and assessed with comparable EEG studies, 463 children were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); 571 children were neuro-typical controls (C). After artifact management, principal components analysis (PCA) identified EEG spectral coherence factors with corresponding loading patterns. The 2- to 12-year-old subsample consisted of 430 ASD- and 554 C-group subjects (n = 984). Discriminant function analysis (DFA) determined the spectral coherence factors' discrimination success for the two groups. Loading patterns on the DFA-selected coherence factors described ASD-specific coherence differences when compared to controls. Results: Total sample PCA of coherence data identified 40 factors which explained 50.8% of the total population variance. For the 2- to 12-year-olds, the 40 factors showed highly significant group differences (P < 0.0001). Ten randomly generated split half replications demonstrated high-average classification success (C, 88.5%; ASD, 86.0%). Still higher success was obtained in the more restricted age sub-samples using the jackknifing technique: 2- to 4-year-olds (C, 90.6%; ASD, 98.1%); 4- to 6-year-olds (C, 90.9%; ASD 99.1%); and 6- to 12-year-olds (C, 98.7%; ASD, 93.9%). Coherence loadings demonstrated reduced short-distance and reduced, as well as increased, long-distance coherences for the ASD-groups, when compared to the controls. Average spectral loading per factor was wide (10.1 Hz). Conclusions: Classification success suggests a stable coherence loading pattern that differentiates ASD-from C-group subjects. This might constitute an EEG coherence-based phenotype of childhood autism. The predominantly reduced short-distance coherences may indicate poor local network function. The increased long-distance coherences may represent compensatory processes or reduced neural pruning. The wide average spectral range of factor loadings may suggest over-damped neural networks.

An ensemble system for automatic sleep stage classification using single channel EEG signal	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						EEG; Recursive feature elimination; Sleep staging; Support vector machine	POSITIVE LYAPUNOV EXPONENT; CORRELATION DIMENSION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; QUANTIFICATION; ENTROPY; APNEA; DISCRIMINATION; SELECTION; HEALTH	The present work aims at automatic identification of various sleep stages like, sleep stages 1, 2, slow wave sleep (sleep stages 3 and 4), REM sleep and wakefulness from single channel EEG signal. Automatic scoring of sleep stages was performed with the help of pattern recognition technique which involves feature extraction, selection and finally classification. Total 39 numbers of features from time domain, frequency domain and from non-linear analysis were extracted. After extraction of features, SVM based recursive feature elimination (RFE) technique was used to find the optimum number of feature subset which can provide significant classification performance with reduced number of features for the five different sleep stages. Finally for classification, binary SVMs were combined with one-against-all (OAA) strategy. Careful extraction and selection of optimum feature subset helped to reduce the classification error to 8.9% for training dataset, validated by k-fold cross-validation (CV) technique and 10.61% in the case of independent testing dataset. Agreement of the estimated sleep stages with those obtained by expert scoring for all sleep stages of training dataset was 0.877 and for independent testing dataset it was 0.8572. The proposed ensemble SVM-based method could be used as an efficient and cost-effective method for sleep staging with the advantage of reducing stress and burden imposed on subjects.

Specifically, we propose an iterative clustering and support vector-based criterion to select samples of high-confidence to construct a robust training set. The common spatial pattern (CSP)-based features are iteratively clustered till the number of support vectors in the cluster is less than a predefined threshold. A predefined number of samples close to the cluster centers are chosen. When such clusters cannot be found, the samples that are of farthest distances to a group of support vectors of class "0" and "1" are alternately chosen. Experimental results on BCI competition IV dataset IIb show superior performance compared with a baseline method, which is 9% increase in accuracy averaged across subjects and training sizes.

Automatic Detection of CAP on central and fronto-central EEG leads via Support Vector Machines	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			CYCLIC ALTERNATING PATTERN; GATE-CONTROL; SLEEP; MICROSTRUCTURE; AROUSAL	The aim of this study is to implement a high-accuracy automatic detector of the Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) during sleep. EEG data from four healthy subjects were used. Both the C4-A1 and the F4-C4 leads were analyzed for this study. Seven features were extracted from each of the two leads and two separate studies were performed for each set of descriptors. For both sets, a Support Vector Machine was trained and tested on the data with the Leave One Out cross-validation method. The two final classifications obtained on the two sets were merged, by considering a CAP A phase scored only if it had been recognized both on the central and on the frontal lead. The length of the A phase was then determined by the result on the fronto-central lead. This method leads to encouraging results, with a classification sensitivity on the whole dataset equal to 73.82%, specificity equal to 85.93%, accuracy equal to 84,05% and Cohen's kappa equal to 0.50.

Unlike common device-specific BMI systems, our software architecture maps simple EEG-based commands to diverse functionalities depending on the robotic platform, so the user does not have learn to generate new EEG commands for different robots. The graphic user interface provides a mechanism that allows the user to navigate through menus using EMG signals (i.e. eye-blink), and then execute robot commands using EEG signals. Our software is based on a modular design that allows the integration of new robotic platforms with easy customization. Our current prototype explores the controllability of a humanoid robot, a flying robot and a pan-tilt robot using the proposed software interface. Experimental evidence shows that the system achieves good user satisfaction as well as easy controllability of different types of robotic systems.

MULTICHANNEL DECODING FOR PHASE-CODED SSVEP BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						SSVEP; brain-computer interface; EEG; neural network	NEURAL-NETWORK; FREQUENCY	We propose a complex-valued multilayer feedforward neural network classifier for decoding of phase-coded information from steady-state visual evoked potentials. To optimize the performance of the classifier we supply it with two filter-based feature selection strategies. The proposed approaches could be used for a phase-coded brain-computer interface, enabling to encode several targets using only one stimulation frequency. The proposed classifier is a multichannel one, which distinguishes our approach from the existing single-channel ones. We show that the proposed approach outperforms others in terms of accuracy and length of the data segments used for decoding. We show that the decoding based on one optimally selected channel yields an inferior performance compared to the one based on several features, which supports our argument for a multichannel approach.

Methods: The C3-A2 or C4-A1 EEG leads of the night recording of eight healthy adult subjects were used for this analysis. CAP was scored by an expert and the portions relative to NREM were selected. Nine descriptors were computed: band descriptors (low delta, high delta, theta, alpha, sigma and beta); Hjorth activity in the low delta and high delta bands; differential variance of the EEG signal. The information content of each descriptor in recognizing the A phases was evaluated through the computation of the ROC curves and the statistics sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Results: The ROC curves show that all the descriptors have a certain significance in characterizing A phases. The average accuracy obtained by thresholding the descriptors ranges from 59.89 (sigma descriptor) to 72.44 (differential EEG variance). Conclusions: The results show that it is possible to attribute a significant quantitative value to the information content of the descriptors. Significance: This study gives a mathematical confirm to the features of CAP generally described qualitatively, and puts the bases for the creation of automatic detection methods.

However, the CSP method requires a large number of electrodes to produce good results. To improve the CSP classification accuracy with a smaller number of electrodes, we introduce a new method of feature extraction named common spatial patterns with autoregressive parameters (CSP-AR). The CSP-AR method not only maximizes the differences between two populations (i.e., right and left motor imagery), but also makes explicit use of frequency information. The data set of BCI Competition II (held by Berlin Brain-Computer Interface in 2003) for motor imagery is used and the experimental results show the CSP-AR has higher classification accuracy of 87.1% than traditional CSP and AR parameters (82.9% and 81.9%, respectively). The method of CSP-AR improves the classification results and has the advantages of high robustness.

In this paper we investigate three methods to alleviate this: (1) Regularization of Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) towards stationary subspaces in order to reduce the influence of artefacts. (2) Unsupervised adaptation of the classifier bias with the goal to account for systematic shifts of the features occurring for example in the transition from calibration to feedback session or with increasing fatigue of the subject. (3) Decomposition of the CSP projection matrix into a whitening and a rotation part and adaptation of the whitening matrix in order to reduce the influence of non-task related changes. We study all three approaches on a data set of 80 subjects and show that stationary features with bias adaptation significantly outperforms the other combinations.

Methods: Eight quantitative features were extracted from the raw EEG and combined into a single classifier. The system was trained with 41 EEG recordings and subsequently evaluated using an additional 20 recordings. Through visual analysis, each recording was assigned to one of the following categories: normal, iso-electric, low voltage, burst suppression, slowing, and EEGs with generalized periodic discharges or seizure activity. Results: 36 (88%) recordings from the training set and 17 (85%) recordings from the test set were classified correctly. A user interface was developed to present both trend-curves and a diagnostic output in text form. Implementation in a dedicated EEG monitor allowed real-time analysis in the intensive care unit (ICU) during pilot measurements in four patients. Conclusions: We present the first results from a computer assisted EEG interpretation system, based on a combination of eight quantitative features. Our system provided an initial, reasonably accurate interpretation by non-experts of the most common EEG patterns observed in neurological patients in the adult ICU. Significance: Computer assisted EEG monitoring may improve early detection of seizure activity and ischemia in critically ill patients. (C) 2011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Depending on the stimuli, there are different responses which one could get from EEG signals. One of them is the P300 response which is a visually evoked response that has been widely studied. Steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) is the response to an oscillating stimulus with fixed frequency, which is detectable from the visual cortex. However, there exists some work on using an m-sequence with different lags as the control sequence of the flickering stimuli. In this study, we used several m-sequences instead of one with the intent of increasing the number of possible command options in a BCI setting. We also tested two different classifiers to decide between the m-sequences and study the performance of multi channel classifiers versus single channel classifiers. The study is done over two different flickering frequencies, 15 and 30 Hz to investigate the effect of flickering frequency on the accuracy of the classification methods. Our study shows that the EEG channels are correlated, and although all the channels contain some useful information, but combining them with a multi channel classifier based on the assumption of having conditional independence will not improve the classification accuracy. In addition, we were able to get reasonably good results using the 30 Hz flickering frequency comparing with 15 Hz flickering frequency that will give us the ability of having a shorter training and decision making time.

The common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is a widely used spatial filtering method for MI-based BCIs. In this work, we propose a new sparse representation-based classification (SRC) scheme for MI-based BCI applications. Sensorimotor rhythms are extracted from electroencephalograms and used for classification. The proposed SRC method utilizes the frequency band power and CSP algorithm to extract features for classification. We analyzed the performance of the new method using experimental datasets. The results showed that the SRC scheme provides highly accurate classification results, which were better than those obtained using the well-known linear discriminant analysis classification method. The enhancement of the proposed method in terms of the classification accuracy was verified using cross-validation and a statistical paired t-test (p < 0.001).

This paper describes the mathematical properties of the linear model and the correlation evaluation metric that may lead to a misinterpretation of the results of this type of decoders. Firstly, the use of a linear regression model to adjust the two temporal signals (EEG and velocity profiles) implies that the relevant component of the signal used for decoding (EEG) has to be in the same frequency range as the signal to be decoded (velocity profiles). Secondly, the use of a correlation to evaluate the fitting of two trajectories could lead to overly-optimistic results as this metric is invariant to scale. Also, the correlation has a non-linear nature that leads to higher values for sinus/cosinus-like signals at low frequencies. Analysis of these properties on the reconstruction results was carried out through an experiment performed in line with previous studies, where healthy participants executed predefined reaching movements of the hand in 3D space. While the correlations of limb velocity profiles reconstructed from low-frequency EEG were comparable to studies in this domain, a systematic statistical analysis revealed that these results were not above the chance level. The empirical chance level was estimated using random assignments of recorded velocity profiles and EEG signals, as well as combinations of randomly generated synthetic EEG with recorded velocity profiles and recorded EEG with randomly generated synthetic velocity profiles. The analysis shows that the positive correlation results in this experiment cannot be used as an indicator of successful trajectory reconstruction based on a neural correlate. Several directions are herein discussed to address the misinterpretation of results as well as the implications on previous invasive and non-invasive works.

In this study we propose a novel method for feature extraction and pattern recognition of ictal EEG, based upon empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and support vector machine (SVM). First the EEG signal is decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) using EMD, and then the coefficient of variation and fluctuation index of IMFs are extracted as features. SVM is then used as the classifier for recognition of ictal EEG. The experimental results show that this algorithm can achieve the sensitivity of 97.00% and specificity of 96.25% for interictal and ictal EEGs, and the sensitivity of 98.00% and specificity of 99.40% for normal and ictal EEGs on Bonn data sets. Besides, the experiment with interictal and ictal EEGs from Qilu Hospital dataset also yields a satisfactory sensitivity of 98.05% and specificity of 100%. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Especially, the detection of existence and/or level of pain can be vital when verbal information is not present for instant for neonates, disabled persons, anesthetized patients and also animals. Various researches have been performed to locate and classify pain, however, no consistent result has been achieved. The aim of this study is to show a strict relation between electroencephalogram (EEG) signal features and perceptual pain levels and to clarify the relation of classified signal to pain origin. Cortical regions on scalp were assigned based on an evolutional method for optimized alignment of electrodes that improve the clinical monitoring results. The EEG signals were recorded during relax condition and variety of pain conditions. Specific spectral features which are studied to show consistency with dynamical characteristic of EEG signals were combined with non-linear features including approximate entropy and Lyapunov exponent to provide the feature vector. Evolutionary optimization method was used to reduce the features space dimension and computational costs. A hybrid adaptive network fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and support vector machine (SVM) scheme was used for classification of pain levels. ANFIS optimizer is used to fine tune the non-linear alignment of kernels of SVM. The results show that pain levels can be differentiated with high accuracy and robustness even for few recording electrodes. This research verifies the hypothesis that electrical variations of brain patterns can be used for determination of pain levels. The proposed classification method provided up to 95% accuracy.

We extracted features and applied machine learning techniques (discriminant analysis, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbor) from the sleep data to classify whether the participants showed improvement in the memory task. Our results showed 60-70% accuracy in a binary classification of task performance using EDA or EDA+ACC features, which provided an improvement over the more traditional use of sleep stages (the percentages of slow wave sleep (SWS) in the 1st quarter and rapid eye movement (REM) in the 4th quarter of the night) to predict VDT improvement.

Stephen Hawking has been able to break new ground in theoretical physics just by twitching his hand and cheek. Jean-Dominique Bauby was able to write a best-selling memoir by blinking one eyelid. By reading and decoding "brain-waves", the field of brain-computer interfacing (BCI) is poised to open up the possibility of such expression, even for people who can no longer move a single muscle. A BCI still requires an HCI front-end to be of practical use, but many currently-used HCIs do not adequately address limitations on the typical target user's input (e. g., limited eye movement leading to poor spatial vision) or output (e. g. variable delays, and false positives/negatives, in "pressing the button"). In this symposium, BCI experts will present their view of the challenges arising from these limitations. The HCI community is invited to participate in a competition to provide the best solutions.

EEG Controlled Remote Robotic System from Motor Imagery Classification	2012 THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING COMMUNICATION & NETWORKING TECHNOLOGIES (ICCCNT)	International Conference on Computing Communication and Network Technologies		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)	JUL 26-28, 2012	Coimbatore, INDIA			EEG; BCI; Hjorth Parameters; AAR; kNN; Kbepera Mobile Robot-II	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES	This paper aims at laying a foundation towards the development of a robust platform for efficient control of the motion of autonomous mobile robots. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals liberated during motor imagery of a human controller have been used to design the control mechanism. The proposed scheme can find widespread applications in the defense sector as secrecy of generated commands can be maintained efficiently. With decoding of the brain signals for various limb movements being a major area of research for EEG based BCI, the paper employs the usage of finger-elbow-shoulder movement classification in addition to the left-right arm movement classification. The proposed system integrates the advantages of high classification accuracy of EEG measurements (more than 80% for both the folds, i.e., Left-Right classification and Finger-Elbow-Shoulder classification) along with a suitable coding technique of liberated control signals for error detection thereby paving the way for an efficient EEG signal encoded robot control system design.

This study examined the modulatory effects of COMT Val158Met on neural interactions, indicated by connectivity strengths. Blood samples and resting state eyes-closed EEG signals were collected in 254 healthy young females. The COMT Val158Met polymorphism was decoded into 3 groups: Val/Val, Val/Met and Met/Met. The values of mutual information of 20 frontal-related channel pairs across delta, theta, alpha and beta frequencies were analyzed based on the time-frequency mutual information method. Our one-way ANOVA analyses revealed that the significant connection-frequency pairs were relatively left lateralized (P<0.01) and included F7-T3 and F7-C3 at delta frequency, and F3-F4, F7-T3, F7-C3, F7-P3, F3-C3, F3-F7 and F4-F8 at theta frequency. The F-test at F7-T3 and F7-C3 theta surpassed the statistical threshold of P<0.003 (after Bonferroni correction). For all the above connection-frequency pairs, there was a dose-dependent trend in the connectivity strengths of the alleles as follows: VaVVal>VaVMet>Met/Met. Our analyses complemented previous literature regarding neural modulation by the COMT Val158Met polymorphism. The implication to the pathogenesis in schizophrenia was also discussed. Further studies are needed to clarify whether there is gender difference on this gene-brain interaction. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a game has been developed to test whether these statistical differences are good enough for online Brain Computer Interface (BCI) application. We implemented a two-choice BCI game in which the subject makes the choice by looking at a color option and our system decodes the subject's intention by analyzing the EEG signal. In our system, band power features of the EEG data were used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classification model. An online mechanism was adopted to update the classification model during the training stage to account for individual differences. Our results showed that an accuracy of 70%-80% could be achieved and it provided evidence for the possibility in applying color stimuli to BCI applications.

The evaluation of effective EEG patterns is one of the crucial issues in the current research of BCI. Most of the traditional visual evoked paradigms only evoke one kind of EEG pattern for the subsequent feature classification. This study presents a new paradigm based on P300 and Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) that involves event-related stimulation and frequency flashing stimulation. P300 and SSVEP patterns are evoked simultaneously to enhance the discriminahility of features. Offline comparison is implemented among the proposed paradigm and the traditional P300 and SSVEP paradigms. The results show that the new paradigm evokes more significant P300 features while weaken SSVEP features a little without destroying the online feasibility of the BCI system. Therefore, the proposed paradigm can satisfy requirements from different subjects to enlarge the user of group.

A Comprehensive Evaluation of Weight Growth and Weight Elimination Methods Using the Tangent Plane Algorithm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						neural networks; backpropagation; generalization; tangent plane; weight elimination; extreme learning machine	NEURAL-NETWORKS	The tangent plane algorithm is a fast sequential learning method for multilayered feedforward neural networks that accepts almost zero initial conditions for the connection weights with the expectation that only the minimum number of weights will be activated. However, the inclusion of a tendency to move away from the origin in weight space can lead to large weights that are harmful to generalization. This paper evaluates two techniques used to limit the size of the weights, weight growing and weight elimination, in the tangent plane algorithm. Comparative tests were carried out using the Extreme Learning Machine which is a fast global minimiser giving good generalization. Experimental results show that the generalization performance of the tangent plane algorithm with weight elimination is at least as good as the ELM algorithm making it a suitable alternative for problems that involve time varying data such as EEG and ECG signals.

Previously, various methods have been proposed to improve the performance of the SP-BCI. However, no studies have been presented to compare the existing methods. In this study, we concentrate on a motor imagery-based two-state SP-BCI and compare the state-of-the-art methods, including various feature extraction and classification methods. Comparisons were carried on EEG data collected from four participants. True positive and false positive rates were used as the performance indices to evaluate the methods for the motor imagery-based SP-BCI. Comparison results indicate that common spatial pattern (CSP) is the best representation method. Also, support vector machine (SVM) achieves the highest true positive rate. However, its false positive rate is also the highest in most cases. Moreover, imbalanced SVM (ISVM) can keep the false positive rate below a desired threshold.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid algorithm to improve the classification success rate of MI-based electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in BCIs. The proposed scheme develops a novel cross-correlation based feature extractor, which is aided with a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) for two-class MI signals recognition. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed classifier, we replace the LS-SVM classifier by a logistic regression classifier and a kernel logistic regression classifier, separately, with the same features extracted from the cross-correlation technique for the classification. The proposed approach is tested on datasets, IVa and IVb of BCI Competition III. The performances of those methods are evaluated with classification accuracy through a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. We also assess the performance of the proposed method by comparing it with eight recently reported algorithms. Experimental results on the two datasets show that the proposed LS-SVM classifier provides an improvement compared to the logistic regression and kernel logistic regression classifiers. The results also indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the most recently reported eight methods and achieves a 7.40% improvement over the best results of the other eight studies.

Using an electroencephalograph (EEG) to detect neurological activity permits the collection of data representing brain signals without the need for invasive technology or procedures. A 14-electrode EPOC headset produced by the Emotiv Company is used to capture live data, which can then be classified and encoded into control signals for a 7-degree-of-freedom robotic arm. The collected data is analyzed in using an independent component analysis (ICA) based feature extraction and a neural network classifier. The collected EEG data is classified into one of four control signals: lift, lower, rotate clockwise, and rotate counter-clockwise. Additionally, the system watches the collected data for electromyography (EMG) signals indicative of movement of the facial muscles. Detections are used to incorporate two additional control signals: open and close. A personal set of EEG data patterns is trained for each individual, with each control signal requiring only a few minutes to train initially. EMG signal detections are measured against a generic threshold for all users. Once a user has trained their personal data into the system any positive detections trigger a signal to the interfaced robotic arm to perform a corresponding, discrete action. Currently, subjects are able to repeatedly execute two EEG commands with accuracy within a short period of time. As the number of EEG based commands increases, the training time required for accurate control increases significantly. EMG based control is almost always immediately responsive. In order to extend the range of available controls beyond a few discrete actions, this research intends to incorporate and refine the algorithmic steps of classification and detection to shift an increased percentage of the burden of training onto the computer.

Switch-Related and General Preparation Processes in Task-Switching: Evidence from Multivariate Pattern Classification of EEG Data	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							RECONFIGURATION; COMPONENTS	The cued-trials task-switching paradigm is used to investigate the processes involved in preparation to change task. Task switch trials typically show poorer performance than task repeat trials, suggesting that additional or more time-consuming preparation processes are required to switch tasks. However, behavioral and neuroimaging studies have so far been unable to decipher whether preparing for a switch in task involves distinct cognitive processes to those required more generally on both switch and repeat trials. The current study addresses this question using a novel multivariate pattern misclassification analysis of frequency band-specific local topographical patterns in human EEG activity that was elicited by cues varying in information value. Within the alpha frequency band, misclassification analysis produced evidence for an early switch-related preparation process over right frontal cortex, as well as a later task readiness preparation process over right parietal cortex. This represents compelling evidence for dissociable switch-related and task readiness preparation processes that show distinct time course and spatial activation patterns.

In this domain, the existing methods usually use only a few labeled samples to classify affective states consisting of over thousands of features. Therefore, important information may not be well utilized and performance is lowered due to the randomness caused by the small sample problem. However, this issue has rarely been discussed in the previous studies. Besides, many EEG channels are irrelevant to the specific learning tasks, which introduce lots of noise to the systems and further lower the performance in the recognition of affective states. To address these two challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Deep Belief Networks (DBN) based model for affective state recognition from EEG signals. Specifically, signals from each EEG channel are firstly processed with a DBN for effectively extracting critical information from the over thousands of features. The extracted low dimensional characteristics are then utilized in the learning to avoid the small sample problem. For the noisy channel problem, a novel stimulus-response model is proposed. The optimal channel set is obtained according to the response rate of each channel. Finally, a supervised Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is applied on the combined low dimensional characteristics from the optimal EEG channels. To evaluate the performance of the proposed Supervised DBN based Affective State Recognition (SDA) model, we implement it on the Deap Dataset and compare it with five baselines. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can successfully handle the aforementioned two challenges and significantly outperform the baselines by 11.5% to 24.4%, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the task of affective state recognition.

Driving mental fatigue has major implications for transportation system safety. Monitoring physiological signal while driving can provide the possibility to detect the mental fatigue and give the necessary warning. In this paper an EEG-based fatigue countermeasure algorithm is presented to classify the driving mental fatigue. The features of multichannel electroencephalographic (EEG) signals of frontal, central and occipital are extracted by multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model. Then kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and support vector machines (SVM) are employed to identify three-class EEG-based driving mental fatigue. The results show that KPCA-SVM method is able to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors, speed up the convergence in the training of SVM and achieve higher recognition accuracy (81.64%) of three driving mental fatigue states in 10 subjects. The KPCA-SVM method could be a potential tool for classification of driving mental fatigue. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thus, at present, classification of epileptic disorders should be mainly based on electroclinical features. Electro-clinical syndrome is a term used to identify a group of clinical entities showing a cluster of electro-clinical characteristics, with signs and symptoms that together define a distinctive, recognizable, clinical disorder. These often become the focus of treatment trials as well as of genetic, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging investigations. They are distinctive disorders identifiable on the basis of a typical age onset, specific EEG characteristics, seizure types, and often other features which, when taken together, permit a specific diagnosis which, in turn, often has implications for treatment, management, and prognosis. Each electro-clinical syndrome can be classified according to age at onset, cognitive and developmental antecedents and consequences, motor and sensory examinations, EEG features, provoking or triggering factors, and patterns of seizure occurrence with respect to sleep. Therefore, according to the age at onset, here we review the more frequently observed paediatric electro-clinical syndrome from their clinical-EEG, genetic and therapeutic point of views.

While there is a body of work on drowsiness detection using EEG signals in neuroscience and engineering, there exist unanswered questions pertaining to the best mechanisms to use for detecting drowsiness. Targeting a range of practical safety-awareness applications, this study adopts a machine learning based approach to build support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to distinguish between awake and drowsy states. While broadband alpha, beta, delta, and theta waves are often used as features in the existing work, lack of widely agreed precise definitions of such broadband signals and difficulty in accounting for interpersonal variability has led to poor classification performance as demonstrated in this study. Furthermore, the transition from wakefulness to drowsiness and deeper sleep stages is a complex multifaceted process. The richness of this process calls for inclusion of sub-band features for more accurate drowsiness detection. To shed light on the effectiveness of sub-banding, we quantitatively compare the performances of a large set of SVM classifiers trained upon a varying number of 1Hz subband features. More importantly, we identify a compact set of neuroscientifcally motivated EEG features and demonstrate that the resulting classifier not only outperforms traditional broadband based classifiers but also is on a par with or superior than the best sub-band classifiers found by thorough search in a large space of 1Hz subband features.

To address the drawback, the regularized CSP (R-CSP) was proposed that adds regularization information into the CSP learning process. In the algorithm, all samples of each generic subject were used for training sample covariance matrices. When only a part of the samples of each generic subject are allowed as generic training set, this R-CSP algorithm wouldn't work. To solve this problem, an improved method is proposed in this paper. The new algorithm was applied to a brain-computer interface (BC!) data set containing five subjects and a mean improvement of 2.5% in classification rate was achieved.

Motor imagery causes detectable amplitude changes in certain frequency bands of EEGs, which are dubbed event-related desynchronization\synchronization. The frequency components that give effective discrimination between different types of motor imagery are subject specific and identification of these subject-specific discriminative frequency components (DFCs) is important for the accurate classification of motor imagery activities. In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate the DFC using the Fisher criterion and investigate the variability of these DFCs over multiple sessions of EEG recording. Observing the variability of DFC over sessions in the analysis, a new BCI approach called the Adaptively Weighted Spectral-Spatial Patterns (AWSSP) algorithm is proposed. AWSSP tracks the variation in DFC over time adaptively based on the deviation of discriminative weight values of frequency components. The classification performance of the proposed AWSSP is compared with a static BCI approach that employs fixed DFCs. In the offline and online experiments, AWSSP offers better classification performance than the static approach, emphasizing the significance of tracking the variability of DFCs in EEGs for developing robust motor imagery-based BCI systems. A study of the effect of feedback on the variation in DFCs is also performed in online experiments and it is found that the presence of visual feedback results in increased variation in DFCs.

Brain-Computer Interfaces are applied in our experiments to acquire the maximal learning ability. Recent times, tablets are rapidly gaining popularity in education and smart phones are regularly used by children and by adolescents; therefore our primary research focuses on these mobile devices. Over the past decades, reinforcement learning - a learning algorithm well- known from machine learning - was applied in cognitive neuroscience; however, here the neurotransmitter dopamine is responsible for the rewarding signal. In our study, based on reinforcement learning we show how manipulating reward by a feedback from BCI through educational games can lead to a better learning ability in general. Therefore a neurofeedback self- rewarding learning framework is provided for game developers to create adaptive educational games on mobile devices.

This article explores the use of EMG-based HMIs in the steering of farm tractors. An EPOC, a low-cost human-computer interface (HCI) from the Emotiv Company, was employed. This device, by means of 14 saline sensors, measures and processes EMG and electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from the scalp of the driver. In our tests, the HMI took into account only the detection of four trained muscular events on the driver's scalp: eyes looking to the right and jaw opened, eyes looking to the right and jaw closed, eyes looking to the left and jaw opened, and eyes looking to the left and jaw closed. The EMG-based HMI guidance was compared with manual guidance and with autonomous GPS guidance. A driver tested these three guidance systems along three different trajectories: a straight line, a step, and a circumference. The accuracy of the EMG-based HMI guidance was lower than the accuracy obtained by manual guidance, which was lower in turn than the accuracy obtained by the autonomous GPS guidance; the computed standard deviations of error to the desired trajectory in the straight line were 16 cm, 9 cm, and 4 cm, respectively. Since the standard deviation between the manual guidance and the EMG-based HMI guidance differed only 7 cm, and this difference is not relevant in agricultural steering, it can be concluded that it is possible to steer a tractor by an EMG-based HMI with almost the same accuracy as with manual steering.

This paper investigates several evolutionary algorithms used to reduce the dimensionality of the data. The study presents electrode and feature reduction methods based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Evolution-based methods are used to generate a set of indexes presenting either electrode seats or feature points that maximizes the output of a weak classifier. The results are interpreted based on the dimensionality reduction achieved, the significance of the lost accuracy, and the possibility of improving the accuracy by passing the chosen electrode/feature sets to alternative classifiers.

In traditional paradigms, the control over the BCI-performance completely depends on the subjects' ability to learn from the given feedback cues. By contrast, in the proposed protocol both the subject and the machine share information and control over the BCI goal. Generally, the innovative assistance consists in the delivery of online information together with the online adaptation of BCI stimuli properties. In our case, this adaptive optimization process is realized by (1) a closed-loop search for the best set of SSVEP flicker frequencies and (2) feedback of actual SSVEP magnitudes to both the subject and the machine. These closed-loop interactions between subject and machine are evaluated in real-time by continuous measurement of their efficiencies, which are used as online criteria to adapt the BCI control parameters. The proposed protocol aims to compensate for variability in possibly unknown subjects' state and trait dimensions. In a study with N = 18 subjects, we found significant evidence that our protocol outperformed classic SSVEP-BCI control paradigms. Evidence is presented that it takes indeed into account interindividual variabilities: e.g., under the new protocol, baseline resting state EEG measures predict subjects' BCI performances. This paper illustrates the promising potential of assisted closed-loop protocols in BCI systems. Probably their applicability might be expanded to innovative uses, e.g., as possible new diagnostic/therapeutic tools for clinical contexts and as new paradigms for basic research.

Reconstructing hand kinematics during reach to grasp movements from electroencephalographic signals	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)				With continued research on brain machine interfaces (BMIs), it is now possible to control prosthetic arm position in space to a high degree of accuracy. However, a reliable decoder to infer the dexterous movements of fingers from brain activity during a natural grasping motion is still to be demonstrated. Here, we present a methodology to accurately predict and reconstruct natural hand kinematics from non-invasively recorded scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) signals during object grasping movements. The high performance of our decoder is attributed to a combination of the correct input space (time-domain amplitude modulation of delta-band smoothed EEG signals) and an optimal subset of EEG electrodes selected using a genetic algorithm. Trajectories of the joint angles were reconstructed for metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints of the fingers as well as the carpometacarpal (CMC) and MCP joints of the thumb. High decoding accuracy (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r) between the predicted and observed trajectories (r = 0.76 +/- 0.01; averaged across joints) indicate that this technique may be suitable for use with a closed-loop real-time BMI to control grasping motion in prosthetics with high degrees of freedom. This demonstrates the first successful decoding of hand pre-shaping kinematics from non-invasive neural signals.

Toward an EEG-Based Recognition of Music Liking Using Time-Frequency Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); machine learning; music liking/disliking; time-frequency (TF) analysis	EMOTION; ASYMMETRY; AROUSAL; STANDARDIZE; EXPRESSIONS; INTENSITY	Affective phenomena, as reflected through brain activity, could constitute an effective index for the detection of music preference. In this vein, this paper focuses on the discrimination between subjects' electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to self-assessed liked or disliked music, acquired during an experimental procedure, by evaluating different feature extraction approaches and classifiers to this end. Feature extraction is based on time-frequency (TF) analysis by implementing three TF techniques, i.e., spectrogram, Zhao-Atlas-Marks distribution and Hilbert-Huang spectrum (HHS). Feature estimation also accounts for physiological parameters that relate to EEG frequency bands, reference states, time intervals, and hemispheric asymmetries. Classification is performed by employing four classifiers, i.e., support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), quadratic and Mahalanobis distance-based discriminant analyses. According to the experimental results across nine subjects, best classification accuracy {86.52 (+/-0.76)%} was achieved using k-NN and HHS-based feature vectors (FVs) representing a bilateral average activity, referred to a resting period, in beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-49 Hz) bands. Activity in these bands may point to a connection between music preference and emotional arousal phenomena. Furthermore, HHS-based FVs were found to be robust against noise corruption. The outcomes of this study provide early evidence and pave the way for the development of a generalized brain computer interface for music preference recognition.

These Electroencephalogram signals alter with the different vigilance levels of human brain. Medicines with high alcoholic contents make patient feel drowsy. This can cause change in the pattern of Electroencephalogram signals recovered from patient and wrong interpretation by classifier algorithm, if change in signals is severe. Further a wrong command can be generated by Brain Computer Interface. In present work, a methodology for feature extraction and classification of EEG signals recorded under drowsy and controlled state of mind is proposed for vigilance level detection of human body. Filtered EEG data is transformed to the time frequency domain and further processed to derive initial parameters based on dynamic programming for nonlinear fitting, to prepare feature vector from raw Electroencephalogram signals. Classifier is trained with the input feature vector and tested with the unseen data. For classification of signals Random Forest Tree classifier is employed.	[Reddy, D.

Impact of Prolonged Periodic Epileptiform Discharges on Coma Prognosis	NEUROCRITICAL CARE			English	Article						Periodic epileptiform discharges; Electroencephalography; Coma; Prognosis	CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; CLINICAL-SIGNIFICANCE; EEG PATTERNS; SEIZURES; CLASSIFICATION; ETIOLOGY; PLEDS	Periodic epileptiform discharges (PEDs) are a frequent finding in comatose patients undergoing continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring, but their clinical significance is unclear. PET and SPECT studies indicate that PEDs can be associated with focal hypermetabolism and hyperemia, suggesting that in some cases this pattern may be ictal and potentially harmful. We hypothesized that frequent PED activity in comatose patients is associated with reduced likelihood of recovery of consciousness. We identified all comatose patients treated in the Columbia neuro-ICU between June 2008 and August 2009 who underwent ten or more consecutive days of video cEEG monitoring (N = 67), and classified them into three groups: those with (1) prolonged PEDs (five or more consecutive days), (2) intermittent PEDs (at least one but fewer than five consecutive days), and (3) no PEDs. Outcome at discharge was assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale and classified as dead (GOS 1), vegetative (GOS 2), and command-following (GOS 3-5). Mean age was 56 years, mean admission Glasgow Coma Scale score was seven, and the median duration of cEEG monitoring was 18 (range 10-111) days. The most common diagnoses were hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (18 %), subarachnoid hemorrhage (16 %), epilepsy (15 %), encephalitis (15 %), metabolic encephalopathy (13 %), and intracerebral hemorrhage (12 %). 37 % of patients (N = 25) had prolonged PEDs, 31 % (N = 21) had intermittent PEDs, and 31 % (N = 21) had no PEDs. Prolonged PEDs were associated with the presence of SIRPIDS (P = 0.009), electrographic seizures (P = 0.019), and number of AEDs administered (P < 0.0001). However, the presence of intermittent or prolonged PED activity had no impact on mortality (31 % overall) or recovery of consciousness (command-following) at the time of discharge (36 % overall). Persistent spontaneous PED activity in comatose patients is associated with SIRPIDs and electrographic seizures, but has no impact on the likelihood of survival or recovery of consciousness.

Methods: Charts of 407 consecutive patients aged 0-21 years undergoing continuous video-EEG monitoring for epilepsy were reviewed for the presence of GTC evolution. Seizures were characterized according to 2001 ILAE terminology. Charts were reviewed for EEG seizure localization, MRI lesion, and for seizure occurrence in 3-h time blocks, out of sleep or wakefulness, and during the day (6 AM-6 PM) or night. Analysis was done with binomial testing. Regression models were fitted using generalized estimating equations with patients as the cluster level variable. Results: 71 patients (32 girls, mean age 12.63 +/- 5.3 years) had 223 seizures with GTC evolution. Sleep/wake seizure distribution predicted tonic-clonic evolution better than time of day, with more occurring during sleep (p < 0.001). Tonic-clonic evolution occurred most frequently between 12-3 AM and 6-9 AM (p < 0.05). Patients with generalized EEG onset had more tonic-clonic evolution between 9 AM and 12 PM (p < 0.05). Patients with extratemporal focal seizures were more likely to evolve during sleep (p < 0.001); this pattern was not found in patients with temporal or generalized seizure onset on EEG. Patients without MRI lesions were more likely to evolve between 12 AM and 3 AM (p < 0.05), in the sleeping state (p < 0.001), and at night (p < 0.05). Logistic regression revealed that sleep and older patient age were the most important predictors of GTC evolution. Conclusion: GTC evolution occurs most frequently out of sleep and in older patients. Our results may assist in seizure prediction, individualized treatment patterns, and potentially complication and SUDEP prevention. (c) 2012 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, information from other types of features could be extracted and combined with CSP features to enhance the classification performance. Hence this paper proposes a Filter Bank Feature Combination (FBFC) approach and investigates the use of CSP and Phase Lock Value (PLV) features, where the latter measures the phase synchronization between the EEG electrodes. The performance of the FBFC using CSP and PLV features is evaluated on four-class motor imageries from the publicly available BCI Competition IV Dataset IIa. The experimental results showed that the proposed FBFC using CSP and PLV features yielded a significant improvement in cross-validation accuracies on the training data (p=0.008) and better session-to-session transfer accuracies to the evaluation data compared to the use of CSP features using the FBCSP algorithm. This motivates the research of FBFC using a battery of other features that could possibly benefit EEG-based BCIs and multi-modal BCI systems.

CLDA first applies a spectral clustering algorithm to automatically partition the BCI features into several groups where the within-group correlation is maximized and the between-group correlation is minimized. As such, the covariance matrix of all features can be approximated as a block diagonal matrix, thereby facilitating us to accurately extract the correlation information required by movement decoding from a small set of training data. The efficiency of the proposed CLDA algorithm is theoretically studied and an error bound is derived. Our experiment on movement decoding of five human subjects demonstrates that CLDA achieves superior decoding accuracy over other traditional approaches. The average accuracy of CLDA is 87% for single-trial movement decoding of four directions (i.e., up, down, left, and right).

Previous investigations have shown that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can accurately classify workload, but only when trained on neurophysiological exemplars from experienced operators on specific tasks. The present study examined classification accuracies for ANNs trained on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity recorded while participants performed the same (within task) and different (cross) tasks for short periods of time with little or no prior exposure to the tasks. Participants performed three working memory tasks at two difficulty levels with order of task and difficulty level counterbalanced. Within-task classification accuracies were high when ANNs were trained on exemplars from the same task or a set containing the to-be-classified task, (M = 87.1% and 85.3%, respectively).

However, the CSP algorithm, is sensitive to variations in channel placement and can easily overfit to the data when the number of training trials is insufficient. Construction of sparse spatial projections where a small subset of channels is used in feature extraction, can increase the stability and generalization capability of the CSP method. The existing l(0) norm based sub-optimal greedy channel reduction methods are either too complex such as Backward Elimination (BE) which provided best classification accuracies or have lower accuracy rates such as Recursive Weight Elimination (RWE) and Forward Selection (FS) with reduced complexity. In this paper, we apply the Oscillating Search (OS) method which fuses all these greedy search techniques to sparsify the CSP filters. We applied this new technique on EEG dataset IVa of BCI competition III. Our results indicate that the OS method provides the lowest classification error rates with low cardinality levels where the complexity of the OS is around 20 times lower than the BE.

Decoding of inherent information in brain signals to interpret the user's intention is one of main approaches for developing BMI technology. Subdural electrocorticography (sECoG)-based decoding provides good accuracy, but surgical complications are one of the major concerns for this approach to be applied in BMIs. In contrast, epidural electrocorticography (eECoG) is less invasive, thus it is theoretically more suitable for long-term implementation, although it is unclear whether eECoG signals carry sufficient information for decoding natural movements. We successfully decoded continuous three-dimensional hand trajectories from eECoG signals in Japanese macaques. A steady quantity of information of continuous hand movements could be acquired from the decoding system for at least several months, and a decoding model could be used for similar to 10 days without significant degradation in accuracy or recalibration. The correlation coefficients between observed and predicted trajectories were lower than those for sECoG-based decoding experiments we previously reported, owing to a greater degree of chewing artifacts in eECoG-based decoding than is found in sECoG-based decoding. As one of the safest invasive recording methods available, eECoG provides an acceptable level of performance. With the ease of replacement and upgrades, eECoG systems could become the first-choice interface for real-life BMI applications.

Such a task is relevant to diverse domains, where a person is expected or required to be in a particular state. For instance, pilots or medical staffs are expected to be in a highly alert state, and this method could help to detect possible problems. In this paper, an approach is developed to predict the state of alertness ("normal" or "relaxed") from the study of electroencephalographic signals (EEG) collected with a limited number of electrodes. The EEG of 58 participants in the two alertness states (116 records) were collected via a cap with 58 electrodes. After a data validation step, 19 subjects were retained for further analysis. A genetic algorithm was used to select an optimal subset of electrodes. Common spatial pattern (CSP) coupled to linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to build a decision rule and thus predict the alertness of the participants. Different subset sizes were investigated and the best result was obtained by considering 9 electrodes (correct classification rate of 73.68%).

This is accomplished by recognizing specific mental states and using their detection to trigger actions in a computer controlled environment. To achieve such goal it is necessary to record brain activity, typically through EEG, and then process the recorded signal to compute features allowing the detection of the user's mental states being monitored. In recent years several paradigms for BCI have been developed, each based on different neural mechanism underlying the generation of a specific signal pattern. Several signal processing techniques allowing extraction of meaningful features are described in the scientific literature, yet these techniques may be quite diverse, often specific to both the experimental protocol and setup. Here we developed a general purpose genetic algorithm which proved able to face the problem of computing features allowing efficient trial classification from EEG signals. The algorithm was tested on three different datasets drawn from the BCI competition II and based on slow cortical potentials, motor imagery and self-paced movements, and obtained encouraging results.

This is a time-consuming task requiring significant training and experience. A lot of effort has been devoted to developing automatic detection techniques which might help not only in accelerating this process but also in avoiding the disagreement among readers of the same record. In this work, Neyman-Pearson criteria and a support vector machine (SVM) are applied for detecting an epileptic EEG. Decision making is performed in two stages: feature extraction by computing the wavelet coefficients and the approximate entropy (ApEn) and detection by using Neyman-Pearson criteria and an SVM. Then the detection performance of the proposed method is evaluated. Simulation results demonstrate that the wavelet coefficients and the ApEn are features that represent the EEG signals well. By comparison with Neyman-Pearson criteria, an SVM applied on these features achieved higher detection accuracies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Motor imagery tasks included brief and continuous imagined hand movements. During an imagery task, participants imagined an indicated movement for 1 s (i.e., brief movement imagery) or 5 s (i.e., continuous movement imagery). The results of the study support (1) that mu and beta ERD/ERS patterns are elicited during imagined hand movements and (2) that movement duration affects ERS and does not affect ERD patterns, during motor movement imagery. Additionally, brief movement imagery had a greater impact on mu and beta ERD; continuous movement imagery had a greater impact on mu and beta ERS. This research will be useful for designing future brain computer interfaces as it provides valuable insight into the dynamics of electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillatory changes during motor imagery tasks with varying movement duration. Relevance to industry: : Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) have gained considerable interests by both research and industry communities who want to improve the quality of life for those who suffer from severe motor disabilities, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke, and cerebral palsy (CP). The results of this study should be applied to EEG-based BCI system design in order to enhance accuracy and classification performance for BCI system control. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, the effect of presence and absence of gamma band on performance improvement is discussed since movement imaginations affect gamma frequency band as well. Methods: In this study we used data set 2a from BCI Competition IV. In this data set, 9 healthy subjects have performed left hand, right hand, foot and tongue movement imaginations. Time and frequency intervals are computed for each subject and then are classified using Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) as a feature extractor. Finally, data is classified by LDA(1), RBF2 MLP3, SVM(4)and KNN5 methods. In all experiments, accuracy rate of classification is computed using 4 fold validation method. Results: It is seen that most of the time, combination of mu, beta and gamma bands would have better performance than just using combination of mu and beta bands or gamma band alone. In general, the improvement rate of the average classification accuracy is computed 2.91%. Discussion: In this study, it is shown that using combination of mu, beta and gamma frequency bands provides more information than only using combination of mu and beta in movement imagination separations.

The analysis of sleep in humans is usually made on periods (epochs) of 30-s length according to the original Rechtschaffen and Kales sleep scoring manual. In this paper, we propose a new phase space-based algorithm (mainly based on Poincare plot) for automatic classification of sleep-wake states in humans using EEG data gathered over relatively short-time periods. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through a series of experiments involving EEG data from seven healthy adult female subjects and was tested on epoch lengths ranging from 3-s to 30-s. The performance of our phase space approach was compared to a 2-dimensional state space approach using spectral power in two selected human-specific frequency bands. These powers were calculated by dividing integrated spectral amplitudes at selected human-specific frequency bands. The comparison demonstrated that the phase space approach gives better performance in the case of short as well as standard 30-s epoch lengths.

This system has two main blocks, feature extraction and classification. In the feature extraction block, in addition to morphological features, some new features including intelligent segmentation, common spatial pattern (CSP) and combined features (CSP + Segmentation) have also been used. Two criteria were used for the feature evaluation. Firstly, at-test has been applied. Secondly, each of these four groups of features was evaluated by a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier. Afterwards, the best set of features was selected by using Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis (SWLDA). In the classification phase, the LDA was used as a linear classifier.

ERD-Based Online Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMI) in the Context of Neurorehabilitation: Optimizing BMI Learning and Performance	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-machine interface; event-related desynchronization; neurorehabilitation; stroke	EEG; RECOVERY; STROKE; BCI; COMMUNICATION; MOVEMENT; ARM	Event-related desynchronization (ERD) of sensori-motor rhythms (SMR) can be used for online brain-machine interface (BMI) control, but yields challenges related to the stability of ERD and feedback strategy to optimize BMI learning. Here, we compared two approaches to this challenge in 20 right-handed healthy subjects (HS, five sessions each, S1-S5) and four stroke patients (SP, 15 sessions each, S1-S15). ERD was recorded from a 275-sensor MEG system. During daily training, motor imagery-induced ERD led to visual and proprioceptive feedback delivered through an orthotic device attached to the subjects' hand and fingers. Group A trained with a heterogeneous reference value (RV) for ERD detection with binary feedback and Group B with a homogenous RV and graded feedback (10 HS and 2 SP in each group). HS in Group B showed better BMI performance than Group A and improved BMI control from S1 to S5 while Group A did not. In spite of the small n, SP in Group B showed a trend for a higher BMI performance and learning was significantly better. Using a homogeneous RV and graded feedback led to improved modulation of ipsilesional activity resulting in superior BMI learning relative to use of a heterogeneous RV and binary feedback.

EEG signals related to emotional states can be applied to the context of software usability providing more resources to the validation process and the identification of the degree of user satisfaction. This work aims to establish a relationship between EEG signals and the user opinion about the usability of some Facebook privacy features. Based on the assumption that there are variation in brain activity during the execution of tasks labeled as "easy" or "difficult", a performance evaluation was done based on a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers. The Mean Power Spectral Density, in 7 frequency bands, from 8 electrodes in F, C, P, and O areas were used as features. The classification rates showed a small advantage of the SVM when all the 28 variables were used. However, when the 13 variables pointed by the Mann-Whitney U test were used, LDA showed good discrimination capability. The electrodes in F and C areas, related with cognition and motor functions, rejected null hypothesis in almost all frequency bands during the execution of the tasks, showing that it is possible to recognize the studied emotional states. Despite the fact that this was a preliminary study, it showed the feasibility of using the EEG as a potential source of information to be added to software usability testing.

Inferring Driver's Turning Direction through Detection of Error Related Brain Activity	2013 35TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 03-07, 2013	Osaka, JAPAN	IEEE Engn Med Biol Soc, Japanese Soc Med & Biol Engn			MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; EEG; POTENTIALS	This work presents EEG-based Brain-computer interface (BCI) that uses error related brain activity to improve the prediction of driver's intended turning direction. In experiments while subjects drive in a realistic car simulator, we show a directional cue before reaching intersection, and analyze error related EEG potential to infer if the presented direction coincides with the driver's intention. In this protocol, the directional cue provides an initial estimation of the driving direction (based on EEG, environmental or previous driving habits), and we focus on the recognition of error-potentials it may elicit. Experiments with 7 healthy human subjects yield an average classification 0.69 +/- 0.16, which confirms the feasibility of decoding these signals to help estimating driver's turning direction. This study can be further exploited by intelligent cars to tune their driving assistant systems to improve their performance and enhance the driving experience.

Physiological Cognitive State Assessment: Applications for Designing Effective Human-Machine Systems	2011 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	Boston, MA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES; EEG INDEXES; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE; FEATURES	Significant growth in the field of neuroscience has occurred over the last decade such that new application areas for basic research techniques are opening up to practitioners in many other areas. Of particular interest to many is the principle of neuroergonomics, by which the traditional work in neuroscience and its related topics can be applied to non-traditional areas such as human-machine system design. While work in neuroergonomics certainly predates the use of the term in the literature (previously identified by others as applied neuroscience, operational neuroscience, etc.), there is great promise in the larger framework that is represented by the general context of the terminology. Here, we focus on the very specific concept that principles in brain-computer interfaces, neural prosthetics and the larger realm of machine learning using physiological inputs can be applied directly to the design and implementation of augmented human-machine systems. Indeed, work in this area has been ongoing for more than 25 years with very little cross-talk and collaboration between clinical and applied researchers. We propose that, given increased interest in augmented human-machine systems based on cognitive state, further progress will require research in the same vein as that being done in the aforementioned communities, and that all researchers with a vested interest in physiologically-based machine learning techniques can benefit from increased collaboration. We thereby seek to describe the current state of cognitive state assessment in human-machine systems, the problems and challenges faced, and the tightly-coupled relationship with other research areas. This supports the larger work of the Cognitive State Assessment 2011 Competition by setting the stage for the purpose of the session by showing the need to increase research in the machine learning techniques used by practitioners of augmented human-machine system design.

J	Ramantani, G				Ramantani, Georgia			Neonatal epilepsy and underlying aetiology: to what extent do seizures and EEG abnormalities influence outcome?	EPILEPTIC DISORDERS			English	Article						neonatal seizure; outcome; prognosis; preterm; term infants	RISK-FACTORS; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; PRETERM INFANTS; TERM NEWBORNS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SUSCEPTIBILITY; MECHANISMS; PATTERNS; COUNTY	Neonatal seizures constitute the most common and distinctive sign of neurological dysfunction in the first weeks of life and reflect a wide variety of underlying central nervous system disorders. Acute symptomatic seizures occur more often during the neonatal period than at any period of life and are associated with adverse long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae and an increased risk of post-neonatal epilepsy. The improvements of neonatal care in the last decades have changed the spectrum of insults to which the immature brain is exposed and facilitated a decrease in mortality of newborns with seizures. However, the prevalence of long-term morbidity in survivors remains unchanged. Whereas aetiology is presumed to be the main predictor of long-term outcome in neonates with seizures, there is converging evidence that specific electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities are related to unfavourable outcomes. Interictal EEG abnormalities, especially concerning background activity patterns, thus constitute a major indicator of disease severity and predictor of outcome, while the added value of sequential EEG assessments is so far controversial. Moreover, experimental as well as clinical studies of hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy support the notion that recurrent seizures may amplify injury to the developing brain beyond that associated with the underlying aetiology, thus justifying antiepileptic drug treatment. To date, unresolved issues in seizure detection and classification, in addition to the significant variation in gestational ages and brain insults of neonates, still impede clinical research of neonatal seizures. The wider use of long-term EEG or amplitude integrated EEG monitoring may prove crucial for timely neonatal seizure identification and treatment initiation, and thus ultimately improve outcome.

In this paper, we present an LSK data demodulator to decode sub-scalp EEG data for seizure detection and treatment. The demodulator consists of a multi-phase envelope detector that extracts the envelope of the power carrier and a 10-bit SAR ADC to digitalize the envelope waveform, which can work under a variety of modulation indexes and different coding/decoding protocols. The circuits are fabricated in a 0.18 mu m CMOS process and can support a flexible power carrier frequency and data rate.

Extracting feature from ERPs is very important due to high dimension of ERPs which includes much information having nothing to do with classification. The principle and weakness of CSP were analyzed and the method to extract spatio-temporal feature by combining AR model and Whiten transformation was proposed. Cognitive experiments were designed to verify our method. Two kind of features were extracted from the data collected from the cognitive experiments separately by spatio-temporal method and CSP, the classifiers were trained both by SVM, and compared the two on effectiveness of classification were compared. The result demonstrates the spatio-temporal feature method is clearly superior to CSP in the classification of ERPs and the precision rate of classification based on spatio-temporal feature method may be over 90% if the parameters are reasonably determined.

The successful extraction of the relevant signals becomes more and more challenging due to increasing complexities in acquisition techniques and questions addressed. Here, automated signal processing and machine learning tools can help to process the data, e.g., to separate signal and noise. With the presented software pySPACE (http://pyspace.github.io/pyspace), signal processing algorithms can be compared and applied automatically on time series data, either with the aim of finding a suitable preprocessing, or of training supervised algorithms to classify the data. pySPACE originally has been built to process multi-sensor windowed time series data, like event-related potentials from the electroencephalogram (EEG). The software provides automated data handling, distributed processing, modular build-up of signal processing chains and tools for visualization and performance evaluation. Included in the software are various algorithms like temporal and spatial filters, feature generation and selection, classification algorithms, and evaluation schemes. Further, interfaces to other signal processing tools are provided and, since pySPACE is a modular framework, it can be extended with new algorithms according to individual needs. In the presented work, the structural hierarchies are described. It is illustrated how users and developers can interface the software and execute offline and online modes. Configuration of pySPACE is realized with the YAML format, so that programming skills are not mandatory for usage. The concept of pySPACE is to have one comprehensive tool that can be used to perform complete signal processing and classification tasks. It further allows to define own algorithms, or to integrate and use already existing libraries.

We propose the use of different sources of information and introduce an automatic channel selection procedure. To determine an informative set of channels, our approach combines a variety of machine learning algorithms: feature subset selection methods, classifiers based on regularized logistic regression, information fusion, and multiobjective optimization based on probabilistic modeling of the search space. The experimental results show that our proposal is able to improve classification accuracy compared to approaches whose classifiers use only one type of MEG information or for which the set of channels is fixed a priori.

Periodic epileptiform discharges in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						PLEDs; Periodic epileptiform discharges; Outcome; Seizures; Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy; Hippocampal sclerosis	CLINICAL-SIGNIFICANCE; EEG PATTERNS; PLEDS; SEIZURES; CLASSIFICATION; PSYCHOSIS; ETIOLOGY	Purpose: Periodic epileptiform discharges (PEDs) are an uncommon, abnormal EEG pattern seen usually in patients with acute diseases and less frequently in chronic conditions, such as mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE). Evaluate the clinical histories, neuroimaging findings, and serial electrophysiological studies prior to the appearance of PEDs in patients with mTLE secondary to hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Methods: We searched 19,375 EEGs (2006-2012) for the presence of PEDs secondary to mTLE due to HS. Results: 12 patients were included. The patients with PEDs had a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbilities, including major depression (50%), interictal psychosis (16%) and dementia (8%). All of the patients had intractable epilepsy with similar clinical findings. We observed a sequential neurophysiological worsening of the EEG patterns prior to the appearance of PEDs. Five patients with PEDs underwent epilepsy surgery and four were seizure free at follow-up 15 (+/- 9) months. Conclusions: PEDs are rare in patients with mTLE and HS and their presence in these cases could reflect clinical severity and neurophysiologic worsening, clinically manifested by intractable epilepsy and severe psychiatric comorbidities. The presence of PEDs in EEGs of patients with mTLE, however, was not associated with poor postsurgical seizure-freedom. (C) 2013 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed CTVEP-based encoding/decoding approach is designed to provide a safer and more comfortable stimulation method than the conventional VEP-based stimulation methods for BCI without loss of efficiency. For this purpose, low-frequency isoluminant chromatic stimuli are time-encoded to serve as different input commands for BCI control, and the superior comfortableness of the proposed stimulation method is validated by a survey. A combination of diversified signal processing techniques are further employed to decode the information from CTVEP. Based on experimental results, a properly designed configuration of the CTVEP-based stimulation method and a tailored signal processing framework are developed. It is demonstrated that high performance (at information transfer rate: 58.0 bits/min, accuracy: 94.9%, false alarm rate: 1.3%) for BCI can be achieved by means of the CTVEP-based encoding/decoding approach. It turns out that to achieve such good performance, only simple signal processing algorithms with very low computational complexity are required, which makes the method suitable for the development of a practical BCI system. A preliminary prototype of such a system has been implemented with demonstrated applicability.

When neurons are activated, the synaptic currents are produced within the dendrites. This current produces the magnetic field giving rise to mapping of cortical activity measurable by magneto-encephalography (MEG) machines and a secondary electrical field over the scalp measurable by EEG systems. Mastery and expertise in clinical EEG interpretation is one of the most desirable diagnostic clinical skills in interpreting seizures, epilepsy, sleep disorders, and other neurocognitive studies. In most cases EEG activity is described in terms of frequency, amplitude, distribution or location, symmetry, synchrony, reactivity, morphology, rhythmicity and regulation. The dynamic nature of epileptic phenomena causes EEG signals to exhibit stochastic and non-stationary behavior. The time frequency distributions are potentially very useful for detecting and analyzing non-stationary epileptic EEGs. Although visual analysis of raw EEG traces is still the major clinical tool and the point of reference for other methods, we can relate visual analysis to mathematics with a time-frequency description. The EEG signal analysis is often complemented with MEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to correlate specific EEG findings with pathology of the brain and selectively demonstrate the diagnosis of certain neuronal disease processes, and assessment parameters. This diagnostic tool is in no way to be taken as a final word to replace physician's clinical consultation and opinion, rather it is intended to be an early monitoring and warning tool which will aid in diagnosis of certain aspects of critical care and emergency medicine. This interactive teaching module will be highly beneficial since it will facilitate progressive learning of students by enhancing their understanding of clinical EEG parameters and their relationship with differential diagnosis of the patients.

As a result many literature reports about the increasing rate of misdiagnosis of ADHD disorder with other types of brain disorder. There is also a risk of normal children to be associated with ADHD if practical diagnostic criteria are not supported. To this end we propose a decision support system in diagnosing of ADHD disorder through brain electroencephalographic signals. Subjects of 10 children participated in this study, 7 of them were diagnosed with ADHD disorder and remaining 3 children are normal group. Our main goal of this sthudy is to present a supporting diagnostic tool that uses signal processing for feature selection and machine learning algorithms for diagnosis.Particularly, for a feature selection we propose information theoretic which is based on entropy and mutual information measure. We propose a maximal discrepancy criterion for selecting distinct (most distinguishing) features of two groups as well as a semi-supervised formulation for efficiently updating the training set. Further, support vector machine classifier trained and tested for identification of robust marker of EEG patterns for accurate diagnosis of ADHD group. We demonstrate that the applicability of the proposed approach provides higher accuracy in diagnostic process of ADHD disorder than the few currently available methods.

In this paper, we study nonlinear analysis of EEG signal for discriminating depression patients and normal controls. Forty-five unmedicated depressed patients and 45 normal subjects were participated in this study. Power of four EEG bands and four nonlinear features including detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), higuchi fractal, correlation dimension and lyapunov exponent were extracted from EEG signal. For discriminating the two groups, k-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression as the classifiers are then used. Highest classification accuracy of 83.3% is obtained by correlation dimension and LR classifier among other nonlinear features. For further improvement, all nonlinear features are combined and applied to classifiers. A classification accuracy of 90% is achieved by all nonlinear features and LR classifier. In all experiments, genetic algorithm is employed to select the most important features. The proposed technique is compared and contrasted with the other reported methods and it is demonstrated that by combining nonlinear features, the performance is enhanced. This study shows that nonlinear analysis of EEG can be a useful method for discriminating depressed patients and normal subjects. It is suggested that this analysis may be a complementary tool to help psychiatrists for diagnosing depressed patients. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Little is known about the electroclinical presentation in these MRI-negative patients and a poor surgical outcome is frequently reported. We compared the clinical and neurophysiologic features in MRI-negative and MRI-positive cases in order to better identify candidates for surgery. Methods: Among 62 consecutive TTFCD patients (38 male, 24 female; 7-52 years old; 22 children) operated for intractable epilepsy, 25 (40%) presented negative MRI findings. We compared the history of epilepsy; the type, frequency, and distribution of seizures; neurologic examination cognitive and psychiatric impairment; interictalictal electroencephalography (EEG) and stereo-EEG (SEEG) data, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data, neuropathologic findings; and surgical outcome in the MRI-negative and the MRI-positive groups. Key Findings: Severe partial epilepsy beginning in childhood, high seizure frequency including status epilepticus, stereotyped seizures suggestive of precise brain localization, extratemporal location and functional area involvement were characteristic and similarly found in both groups. On EEG, pseudorhythmic activity was found in about 40% of patients in each group. SEEG recordings demonstrated the typical pattern characterizing TTFCD in both groups. FDG-PET had a localization value in 84% of the MRI-negative cases and helped to delineate the dysplastic cortex in 65% of the MRI-positive cases. The combination of imaging and neurophysiologic data allowed us to perform safe and restricted resections, limited to a single gyrus in more than half of all cases. In addition, we were able to avoid invasive monitoring in most MRI-positive cases and even in some selected MRI-negative cases. The proportion of patients with a favorable surgical outcome was comparable in both groups (88% in MRI-negative and 94% in MRI-positive cases). The main difference between the groups was a significantly higher frequency of sleep-related epilepsy in the MRI-negative group (p = 0.028). This phenotypic characteristic provides a new argument for TTFCD in MRI-negative extratemporal epilepsy. Significance: These results lead us to consider that children or adult patients in whom electroclinical data suggest TTFCD, are highly suitable for surgery, especially for cryptogenic sleep-related epilepsy.

Optimal spatial filtering for brain oscillatory activity using the Relevance Vector Machine	COGNITIVE PROCESSING			English	Article						RVM; Beamformer; Magnetoencephalography; MEG inverse problem; Cortical rhythms; Source localization; Bayesian approaches	BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; MEG; LOCALIZATION; BEAMFORMER; EEG; PERFORMANCE	Over the past decade, various techniques have been proposed for localization of cerebral sources of oscillatory activity on the basis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography recordings. Beamformers in the frequency domain, in particular, have proved useful in this endeavor. However, the localization accuracy and efficacy of such spatial filters can be markedly limited by bias from correlation between cerebral sources and short duration of source activity, both essential issues in the localization of brain data. Here, we evaluate a method for frequency-domain localization of oscillatory neural activity based on the relevance vector machine (RVM). RVM is a Bayesian algorithm for learning sparse models from possibly overcomplete data sets. The performance of our frequency-domain RVM method (fdRVM) was compared with that of dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS), a frequency-domain spatial filter that employs a minimum variance adaptive beamformer (MVAB) approach. The methods were tested both on simulated and real data. Two types of simulated MEG data sets were generated, one with continuous source activity and the other with transiently active sources. The real data sets were from slow finger movements and resting state. Results from simulations show comparable performance for DICS and fdRVM at high signal-to-noise ratios and low correlation. At low SNR or in conditions of high correlation between sources, fdRVM performs markedly better. fdRVM was successful on real data as well, indicating salient focal activations in the sensorimotor area. The resulting high spatial resolution of fdRVM and its sensitivity to low-SNR transient signals could be particularly beneficial when mapping event-related changes of oscillatory activity.

In this paper, a new feature extraction method was proposed that was based on the combination of WPT and CSP. The raw EEG signals were band pass filtered between 8 and 30Hz, then the filtered signals were subject to WPT and reconstruction, and finally the reconstructed signals were spatially filtered by CSP algorithm. The proposed algorithm was applied to six datasets recorded during BCI experiments based on motor imagery. The results showed superior classification performance, thus verifying the feasibility and validity of the algorithm.

All recording channels are combined when extracting the variance as input features for a brain machine interface. This results in overacting and robustness problems of the constructed system in presence of high number of channels. Here, we construct spatially sparse common spatio-spectral pattern method in which only a subset of all available channels is linearly combined when extracting the features. We utilized a modified version of the recently introduced recursive weight elimination technique to select a subset of electrodes for spatio-spectral projections. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method to distinguish between the movements of the fiirst three fingers of the hand using electrocoracogram signals of the brain computer interfaces competition 2005. We observed that spatially sparse spatio-spectral filter outperforms both original common spatial pattern and non-sparse spatio-spectral filter and results in improved generalization in classification.

Current Source Density Measures of Electroencephalographic Alpha Predict Antidepressant Treatment Response	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Alpha rhythm; antidepressant treatment response; current source density (CSD); depression; principal components analysis; quantitative EEG (qEEG)	PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS-ANALYSIS; FRONTAL EEG ASYMMETRY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; MULTICHANNEL ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; QUANTITATIVE EEG; RESTING EEG; WAVE-FORMS; ANXIETY; PATTERNS; RISK	Background: Despite recent success in pharmacologic treatment of depression, the inability to predict individual treatment response remains a liability. This study replicates and extends findings relating pretreatment electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha to treatment outcomes for serotonergic medications. Methods: Resting EEG (eyes-open and eyes-closed) was recorded from a 67-electrode montage in 41 unmedicated depressed patients and 41 healthy control subjects. Patients were tested before receiving antidepressants including a serotonergic mode of action (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI], serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, or SSRI plus norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor). EEG was quantified by frequency principal components analysis of spectra derived from reference-free current source density (CSD) waveforms, which sharpens and simplifies EEG topographies, disentangles them from artifact, and yields measures that more closely represent underlying neuronal current generators. Results: Patients who did not respond to treatment had significantly less alpha CSD compared with responders or healthy control subjects, localizable to well-defined posterior generators. The alpha difference between responders and nonresponders was greater for eyes-closed than eyes-open conditions and was present across alpha subbands. A classification criterion based on the median alpha for healthy control subjects showed good positive predictive value (93.3) and specificity (92.3). There was no evidence of differential value for predicting response to an SSRI alone or dual treatment targeting serotonergic plus other monoamine neurotransmitters. Conclusions: Findings confirm the value of EEG alpha amplitude as a viable predictor of antidepressant response and suggest that personalized treatments for depression may be identified using simple electrophysiologic CSD measures.

Short-Term Outcome Prediction by Electroencephalographic Features in Children Treated with Therapeutic Hypothermia After Cardiac Arrest	NEUROCRITICAL CARE			English	Article						Therapeutic hypothermia; Outcome; Pediatric; Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy; Heart arrest; Prognosis	HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; EEG PATTERNS; COMATOSE SURVIVORS; BISPECTRAL INDEX; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; RESUSCITATION; SUBCOMMITTEE; SUPPRESSION; QUALITY; ADULTS	Electroencephalographic (EEG) features may provide objective data regarding prognosis in children resuscitated from cardiac arrest (CA), but therapeutic hypothermia (TH) may impact its predictive value. We aimed to determine whether specific EEG features were predictive of short-term outcome in children treated with TH after CA, both during hypothermia and after return to normothermia. Thirty-five children managed with a standard clinical TH algorithm after CA were prospectively enrolled. EEG recordings were scored in a standardized manner and categorized. EEG category 1 consisted of continuous and reactive tracings. EEG category 2 consisted of continuous but unreactive tracings. EEG category 3 included those with any degree of discontinuity, burst suppression, or lack of cerebral activity. The primary outcome was unfavorable short-term outcome defined as Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score of 4-6 (severe disability, vegetative, death) at hospital discharge. Univariate analyses of the association between EEG category and outcome was performed using logistic regression. For tracings obtained during hypothermia, patients with EEGs in categories 2 or 3 were far more likely to have poor outcome than those in category 1 (OR 10.7, P = 0.023 and OR 35, P = 0.004, respectively). Similarly, for tracings obtained during normothermia, patients with EEGs in categories 2 or 3 were far more likely to have poor outcomes than those in category 1 (OR 27, P = 0.006 and OR 18, P = 0.02, respectively). A simple EEG classification scheme has predictive value for short-term outcome in children undergoing TH after CA.

Identification of Electroencephalographic Arousals in Multichannel Sleep Recordings	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG) arousal; pattern classification; sleep studies	AUTOMATIC DETECTION	Electroencephalographic arousals are defined as abrupt shifts in electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency during sleep. Occurrence of arousals results in fragmented sleep, being one of the most important causes of daytime sleepiness among sleep disorders. Detection of arousals requires a polysomnographic (PSG) recording to be made during the patient's sleep. The resulting PSG is then analyzed offline by the physician. This is a time-consuming task, hence, automation of this process is pursued. The analysis, which involves the correlation of various events in time occurring among the different channels, in conjunction with the complexity of the related biomedical signals, makes this task also difficult to achieve in the computer algorithm. In this paper, we present a method for the detection of EEG arousals working on multichannel PSGs. The algorithm detects arousals using the information available through two EEG channels and the electromyography. A signal-processing technique is first proposed for the analysis of biomedical signals and extraction of relevant information. Individual events are detected from the signals and subsequently are related in time. Finally, a classification phase carries out the final decision on the presence of the event. Classifiers based on Fisher's linear and quadratic discriminants, support vector machines and artificial neural networks are compared at this phase. Experiments conducted on 20 patients reported a sensitivity and specificity respectively of 0.86 and 0.76 in the detection of the arousal events.

Twenty children (six M/14 F) aged 7-12 years, diagnosed with moderate to severe OSA participated in this study. Overnight polysomnography was performed, and sleep stages and arousals visually scored using clinical paediatric measures. The EEG was spectrally analysed in six 5-s epochs across respiratory events, namely two consecutive 5-s epochs pre-event onset and a 5s epoch post-event onset, 5-s before event termination, and two contiguous 5-s epochs post-event termination. EEG spectral power distribution was compared across respiratory events visually categorised as full cortical arousals, subcortical activations, or non-arousals using specialised software (Sleep Research System 5.0). There was no difference in power spectra between events in REM and NREM sleep and these were combined. There was a statistically significant fall from pre-arousal baseline values in delta and theta spectral power at respiratory event terminations associated with cortical arousals only. No change in power was detected at respiratory event terminations associated with subcortical activations or non-arousals. The lack of significant EEG spectral power changes at respiratory event terminations not associated with visually identified cortical arousals indicates undetected micro-arousals are not present. The results support the validity of clinical classifications of arousals at respiratory event termination.	[Yang, Joel S. C.; Nixon, Gillian M.; Walker, Adrian M.; Horne, Rosemary S.

It is theoretically equivalent and computationally superior to the common spatial patterns (CSP) method which is a widely used technique in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, EER may seriously overfit on small training sets due to the presence of large noise. Moreover, it is a totally supervised method that cannot take advantage of unlabeled data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a regularization constraint utilizing local temporal information of unlabeled trails. It can encourage the temporal smoothness of source signals discovered, and thus alleviate their tendency to overfit. By combining this regularization trick with the EER method, we present a semi-supervised feature extractor termed semi-supervised extreme energy ratio (SEER). After solving two eigenvalue decomposition problems, SEER recovers latent source signals that not only have discriminative energy features but also preserve the local temporal structure of test trails. Compared to the features found by EER, the energy features of these source signals have a stronger generalization ability, as shown by the experimental results. As a nonlinear extension of SEER, we further present the kernel SEER and provide the derivation of its solutions.

The ability to efficiently process rapid changes in auditory information is important for decoding speech and thereby crucial during language acquisition. Investigating functional networks of speech perception in infancy might elucidate neuronal ensembles supporting perceptual abilities that gate language acquisition. Interhemispheric specializations for language have been demonstrated in infants. How these asymmetries are shaped by basic temporal acoustic properties is under debate. We recently provided evidence that newborns process non-linguistic sounds sharing temporal features with language in a differential and lateralized fashion. The present study used the same material while measuring brain responses of 6 and 3 month old infants using simultaneous recordings of electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). NIRS reveals that the lateralization observed in newborns remains constant over the first months of life. While fast acoustic modulations elicit bilateral neuronal activations, slow modulations lead to right-lateralized responses. Additionally, auditory-evoked potentials and oscillatory EEG responses show differential responses for fast and slow modulations indicating a sensitivity for temporal acoustic variations. Oscillatory responses reveal an effect of development, that is, 6 but not 3 month old infants show stronger theta-band desynchronization for slowly modulated sounds. Whether this developmental effect is due to increasing fine-grained perception for spectrotemporal sounds in general remains speculative. Our findings support the notion that a more general specialization for acoustic properties can be considered the basis for lateralization of speech perception. The results show that concurrent assessment of vascular based imaging and electrophysiological responses have great potential in the research on language acquisition.

In spite of available drug and surgical treatment options, more than 25% of individuals with epilepsy have seizures that are uncontrollable. For these patients with intractable epilepsy, the unpredictability of seizure occurrence underlies an enhanced risk of sudden unexpected death or morbidity. A system that could warn the patient of the impending event or trigger an antiepileptic device would dramatically increase the quality of life for those patients. Here, we proposed a patient-specific algorithm for possible seizure warning using machine learning classification of 34 algorithmic features derived from EEG-ECG recordings. We evaluated our algorithm on unselected and continuous recordings of 12 patients (total of 108 seizures and 3178-h). Good out-of-sample performances were observed around 25% of the patients with an average preictal period around 30 min and independently of the EEG type (scalp or intracranial). Inspection of the most discriminative EEG-ECG features revealed that good classification rates reflected specific physiological precursors, particularly related to certain stages of sleep. From these observations, we conclude that our algorithmic strategy enables a quantitative way to identify "pro-ictal" states with a high risk of seizure generation.

Typical facial dysmorphisms, pigmentary abnormalities, and some major malformations are frequently present. Neurological manifestations include mental retardation, hypotonia, and seizures. Epilepsy incidence ranged from 39 to 59% in a previously reported series. No specific clinical and EEG phenotype has ever been reported to describe seizure features, electroclinical patterns, and response to therapy in PKS. Methods: This was a multicentre study conducted on 13 Italian children with PKS, as diagnosed by clinical phenotype and confirmed in cultured fibroblasts. All patients underwent several polygraphic video-EEG recordings and brain magnetic resonance imaging. Results and conclusions: All the patients presented with epilepsy and seizures that started at a mean age of 19 months. In six cases, epilepsy started with epileptic spasms (ES) combined with focal seizures in another case. In four cases, seizures were focal, and this was followed by ES in two patients. In only two cases, epilepsy started with myoclonic seizures, and spasms were never observed. The study provides further evidence that epilepsy is a part of the phenotype of PKS, although a specific clinical and EEG pattern could not be identified. Our cases show how ES with late- or first-year onset is the most common type of seizure. Despite a variable prognosis in terms of response to therapy, a significant proportion of patients achieved good seizure control. (C) 2012 European Paediatric Neurology Society.

For the new system, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is developed for each sleep stage. Initially, three types of electrophysiological signals including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), and electromyogram (EMG) were collected from twenty five healthy subjects. The input pattern used for training the ANFIS subsystem is a set of extracted features based on the entropy measure which characterize the recorded signals. Finally an output selection subsystem is utilized to provide the appropriate sleep stage according to the ANFIS stage subsystems outputs. The developed system was able to provide an acceptable estimation for six sleep stages with an average accuracy of about 76.43% which confirmed its ability for multistage sleep level scoring based on the extracted features from the EEG, EOG and EMG signals compared to other approaches.

This paper presents a self-paced BCI based on a robust learning mechanism that extracts and selects spatio-spectral features for differentiating multiple EEG classes. It also employs a non-linear regression and post-processing technique for predicting the time-series of class labels from the spatio-spectral features. The method was validated in the BCI Competition IV on Dataset I where it produced the lowest prediction error of class labels continuously. This report also presents and discusses analysis of the method using the competition data set.

Neurocysticercosis and its impact on crude prevalence rate of epilepsy in an Indian community	NEUROLOGY INDIA			English	Article						Acute symptomatic seizures; epilepsy prevalence; pattern of epilepsy in Indian community	MAJOR NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS; RURAL KASHMIR; PATTERN	Background: Community-based studies of epilepsy in India have reported variable prevalence rates, 5-10/1000 population. Reasons for this wide variation in the prevalence rates are uncertain. Most of the earlier studies had not done appropriate investigations to establish the possible etiology. Aim: To study the prevalence and etiological profile of active epilepsy in the rural population of Uttarakhand. Material and Methods: In this rural community-based study in the state of Uttarakhand, a door-to-door survey was conducted using validated questionnaire. All the suspected cases of epilepsy were examined by a neurologist to confirm the diagnosis of epilepsy and all the confirmed cases underwent contrast computed tomography (CT) scan and electroencephalography (EEG). Epilepsy and epilepsy syndromes were classified using the classifications proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy. Results: Of the 14,086 population studied, 141 cases of active epilepsy were detected giving a crude prevalence rate of 1%. After clinical evaluation and scanning, 35 (24.8%) were found to have seizure disorder active neurocysticercosis (NCC) and 14 (9.9%) had remote symptomatic seizures related to calcified granuloma. After excluding acute and remote symptomatic cases related to NCC, prevalence rate of epilepsy was 6.5/1000. Conclusion: The study suggests that the region-specific prevalence rates of epilepsy in India are partly dependent on the prevalence of NCC in the given community. To some extent, this may be responsible for variable rates of epilepsy prevalence reported from different regions of the country.	[Goel, Deepak; Dhanai, J.

The primary focus of this study is to identify the correlation between fluctuating level of attention and its implications on the cardiac rhythm recorded in the ECG. Furthermore, Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals are also analyzed and classified for use as a benchmark for comparison with ECG analysis. Several advanced signal processing techniques have been implemented and investigated to derive multiple clandestine and informative features from both these physiological signals. Decomposition and feature extraction are done using Stockwell-transform for the ECG signal, while Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used for EEG. These features are then applied to various machine-learning algorithms to produce classification models that are capable of differentiating between the cases of a person being attentive and a person not being attentive. The presented results show that detection and classification of cognitive attention using ECG are fairly comparable to EEG.

This retrospective analysis included 82 patients (M:F = 38:44; mean age: 33.4 +/- 12.0 years) diagnosed to have PNESs based on video-EEG recording. Detailed semiological characteristics including pattern of limb movements, body movements, psychological/emotional manifestations, "aura", level of consciousness, age at onset of PNESs, age at diagnosis, and history of AED intake were recorded. We classified our cohort of patients as per available classifications and proposed a modified new classification. Age at onset of PNESs was 21.8 +/- 14.1 years (range: 2-64; median: 18.5 years), age at diagnosis was 29.3 +/- 12.7 years (range: 2-67; median: 26.0 years), and delay in diagnosis was 7.4 +/- 7.3 years (range: 0-28; median: 5.0 years). There were 369 recorded attacks (range: 1-10; median: 4). Prior to VEEG, 47 (57.3%) patients were incorrectly diagnosed as having true epileptic seizures initially and were on antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), 15 (18.3%) patients had an initial diagnosis of PNESs which remained unchanged after VEEG analysis, and 20 (24.4%) patients had both PNESs and epileptic seizures. We could not classify 40-66% of our patients into any of the available classification proposed by previous authors. We categorized all our patients into the following categories of a modified new classification: abnormal hypermotor response: 23 (28%), abnormal partial motor response: 18 (22%), affective/emotional behavior phenomena: 4 (4.9%), dialeptic type: 5 (6.1%), nonepileptic aura: 5 (6.1%), and mixed pattern: 27 (32.9%). Incorrect diagnosis of PNESs leads to unnecessary prescription of AEDs, with side effects and cost implications. A modified systematic classification of PNESs is proposed which would help in the better characterization of PNESs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TSDCA involves the compression of high-dimensional time series into a lower-dimensional space using a set of orthogonal transformations and the calculation of posterior probabilities based on a continuous-density hidden Markov model that incorporates a Gaussian mixture model expressed in the reduced-dimensional space. The analysis can be incorporated into a neural network so that parameters can be obtained appropriately as network coefficients according to backpropagation-through-time-based training algorithm. The network is considered to enable high-accuracy classification of high-dimensional time-series patterns and to reduce the computation time taken for network training. In the experiments conducted during the study, the validity of the proposed network was demonstrated for EEG signals.

J	Yu, K; Wang, Y; Shen, KQ; Li, XP				Yu, Ke; Wang, Yue; Shen, Kaiquan; Li, Xiaoping			The Synergy between Complex Channel-Specific FIR Filter and Spatial Filter for Single-Trial EEG Classification	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MOTOR IMAGERY; PATTERNS	The common spatial pattern analysis (CSP), a frequently utilized feature extraction method in brain-computer-interface applications, is believed to be time-invariant and sensitive to noises, mainly due to an inherent shortcoming of purely relying on spatial filtering. Therefore, temporal/spectral filtering which can be very effective to counteract the unfavorable influence of noises is usually used as a supplement. This work integrates the CSP spatial filters with complex channel-specific finite impulse response (FIR) filters in a natural and intuitive manner. Each hybrid spatial-FIR filter is of high-order, data-driven and is unique to its corresponding channel. They are derived by introducing multiple time delays and regularization into conventional CSP. The general framework of the method follows that of CSP but performs better, as proven in single-trial classification tasks like event-related potential detection and motor imagery.

Closing the sensorimotor loop: haptic feedback facilitates decoding of motor imagery	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							BETA EEG-CHANGES; CHRONIC STROKE; BRAIN; MOVEMENTS; ROBOT	The combination of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) with robot-assisted physical therapy constitutes a promising approach to neurorehabilitation of patients with severe hemiparetic syndromes caused by cerebrovascular brain damage (e. g. stroke) and other neurological conditions. In such a scenario, a key aspect is how to reestablish the disrupted sensorimotor feedback loop. However, to date it is an open question how artificially closing the sensorimotor feedback loop influences the decoding performance of a BCI. In this paper, we answer this issue by studying six healthy subjects and two stroke patients. We present empirical evidence that haptic feedback, provided by a seven degrees of freedom robotic arm, facilitates online decoding of arm movement intention. The results support the feasibility of future rehabilitative treatments based on the combination of robot-assisted physical therapy with BCIs.

The outer computer and machine are controlled by brain action potentials detected through a device such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and electroencephalograph (EEG), and some discriminant model determines a control process. In this paper, we introduce a fuzzy bio-interface between a culture dish of rat hippocampal neurons and the khepera robot. We propose a model to analyze logic of signals and connectivity of electrodes in a culture dish, and show the bio-robot hybrid we developed. We believe that the framework of fuzzy system is essential for BCI and BMI, thus name this technology "fuzzy bio-interface". We show the usefulness of a fuzzy bio-interface through some examples.

However, it is known that the nature of motor imagery-related electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is non-stationary and highly variable over time and frequency. In this paper, we propose a novel method of finding a discriminative time-and frequency-dependent spatial filter, which we call 'non-homogeneous filter.' We adaptively select bases of spatial filters over time and frequency. By taking both temporal and spectral features of EEGs in finding a spatial filter into account it is beneficial to be able to consider non-stationarity of EEG signals. In order to consider changes of ERDIERS patterns over the time-frequency domain, we devise a spectrally and temporally weighted classification method via statistical analysis. Our experimental results on the BCI Competition IV dataset II-a clearly presented the effectiveness of the proposed method outperforming other competing methods in the literature.

However, the neural activity associated with comprehending an extended text is not well-understood. Here we describe a current-source-density (CSD) index that predicts individual differences in the comprehension of an extended text. The index is the difference in CSD-transformed event-related potentials (ERPs) to a target word between two conditions: a comprehension condition with words from a story presented in their original order, and a scrambled condition with the same words presented in a randomized order. In both conditions participants responded to the target word, and in the comprehension condition they also tried to follow the story in preparation for a comprehension test. We reasoned that the spatiotemporal pattern of difference-CSDs would reflect comprehension-related processes beyond word-level processing. We used a pattern-classification method to identify the component of the difference-CSDs that accurately (88%) discriminated good from poor comprehenders. The critical CSD index was focused at a frontal-midline scalp site, occurred 400-500 ms after target-word onset and was strongly correlated with comprehension performance. Behavioral data indicated that group differences in effort or motor preparation could not explain these results. Further, our CSD index appears to be distinct from the well-known P300 and N400 components, and CSD transformation seems to be crucial for distinguishing good from poor comprehenders using our experimental paradigm. Once our CSD index is fully characterized, this neural signature of individual differences in extended-text comprehension may aid the diagnosis and remediation of reading comprehension deficits.

In mobile applications these possibilities are attractive as elements in systems for personal state monitoring and well-being, and in clinical settings were patients may need imaging under quasi-natural conditions. Challenges related to the ill-posed nature of the EEG imaging problem escalate in mobile real-time systems and new algorithms and the use of meta-data may be necessary to succeed. Based on recent work (Delorme et al., 2011) we hypothesize that solutions of interest are sparse. We propose a new Markovian prior for temporally sparse solutions and a direct search for sparse solutions as implemented by the so-called "variational garrote" (Kappen, 2011). We show that the new prior and inference scheme leads to improved solutions over competing sparse Bayesian schemes based on the "multiple measurement vectors" approach.

Classification of newborn EEG maturity with Bayesian averaging over decision trees	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						EEG; Brain maturity; Bayesian model averaging; Markov Chain Monte Carlo	FEATURE-SELECTION; MATURATION; RISK; SLEEP	EEG experts can assess a newborn's brain maturity by visual analysis of age-related patterns in sleep EEG. It is highly desirable to make the results of assessment most accurate and reliable. However, the expert analysis is limited in capability to provide the estimate of uncertainty in assessments. Bayesian inference has been shown providing the most accurate estimates of uncertainty by using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration over the posterior distribution. The use of MCMC enables to approximate the desired distribution by sampling the areas of interests in which the density of distribution is high. In practice, the posterior distribution can be multimodal, and so that the existing MCMC techniques cannot provide the proportional sampling from the areas of interest. The lack of prior information makes MCMC integration more difficult when a model parameter space is large and cannot be explored in detail within a reasonable time. In particular, the lack of information about EEG feature importance can affect the results of Bayesian assessment of EEG maturity. In this paper we explore how the posterior information about EEG feature importance can be used to reduce a negative influence of disproportional sampling on the results of Bayesian assessment. We found that the MCMC integration tends to oversample the areas in which a model parameter space includes one or more features, the importance of which counted in terms of their posterior use is low. Using this finding, we proposed to cure the results of MCMC integration and then described the results of testing the proposed method on a set of sleep EEG recordings. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined the neural predictions of these models in 3 short-term recognition memory experiments using electrocorticographic/depth electrode recordings and scalp electroencephalography. On each experimental trial, participants judged whether a test face had been among a small set of recently studied faces. Consistent with summed-similarity theory, participants' tendency to endorse a test item increased as a function of its summed similarity to the items on the just-studied list. To characterize this behavioral effect of summed similarity, we successfully fit a summed-similarity model to individual participant data from each experiment. Using the parameters determined from fitting the summed-similarity model to the behavioral data, we examined the relation between summed similarity and brain activity. We found that 4-9 Hz theta activity in the medial temporal lobe and 2-4 Hz delta activity recorded from frontal and parietal cortices increased with summed similarity. These findings demonstrate direct neural correlates of the similarity computations that form the foundation of several major cognitive theories of human recognition memory.

The aim of the study was to assess the EEG of 84 violent offenders by visual inspection and frequency-domain quantitative analysis in 84 violent prisoners. Low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) was also employed for theta band of the EEG spectra. Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) was present in 50 of the offenders and it was absent in the remaining 34. The prevalence of EEG abnormalities, by visual inspection, was similar for both the ASPD group (82%) and non-ASPD group (79%). The brain topography of these anomalies also did not differ between groups, in contrast to results of the EEG quantitative analysis (QEEG) and LORETA that showed remarkable regional differences between both groups. QEEG analysis showed a pattern of excess of theta-delta activities and decrease of alpha band on the right fronto-temporal and left temporo-parietal regions in the ASPD group. LORETA signified an increase of theta activity (5.08 Hz) in ASPD group relative to non-ASPD group within left temporal and parietal regions.

In this study, ECG (Electrocardiogram), HF (Heat Flux) and EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals were collected from 8 subjects. The subjects were made to watch a series of videos which demanded contrasting engagement levels. On the collected ECG data, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is applied to the raw signal and multiple features are extracted. Features from HF were also obtained. In EEG signals, different band components were first extracted upon which DWT is applied to extract numerous features. Finally machine learning techniques were employed to classify the extracted features into two categories of 'attention' and 'non-attention'. The results show success in distinguishing 'attention' vs. 'non-attention' cases by processing acquired physiological signals.

The treatment for epilepsy is medication and surgery. Some patients are not cured with medicine and surgery. One third of the patients still remain with uncontrolled epilepsy. They need constant monitoring for epileptic seizures. Better treatment can be provided by the doctors or precautionary measures can be taken by the patients themselves if any abnormal brain activity or seizure is predicted before its occurrence. The pre-ictal period has some information about the occurrence of epileptic seizure in EEG signals. The brain behaves normal in inter-ictal and postictal periods. For epilepsy, long duration EEG recording are required from days to week. This keeps the patients to stay in the hospital for many days. Our proposed methodology is to predict the epileptic seizure and monitor the brain abnormality in real time. Still there is no epileptic seizure prediction algorithm using EEG available for clinical applications. Our aim is to study and develop a good epileptic seizure prediction algorithm/method with high value of sensitivity and specificity using scalp EEG i-e noninvasive approach. Also a comprehensive survey is done to find the limitations and research issues related to this. The proposed pattern recognition approach has great potential to be used in real time monitoring for epileptic patients and it can be helpful in improving the quality of life of the patients.

Augmentation complements and/or enhances the capabilities of one or more robots while such robots can simultaneously serve as intermediaries to ubiquitous services. Electroencephalograms (EEG) are Brain-Computer Interfaces that consist of a series of conductors placed on the scalp. These conductors measure voltage fluctuations in the brain, and using machine learning techniques can be classified and used to command ubiquitous robotic systems. The purpose of our work is to increase the collaboration between humans and surrounding robotic components while fulfilling a certain goal or requirement. We aim to do that by granting humans more precise manipulation, (i.e., brain-driven), over part or all of the involved robotic components. This paper presents our approach on the integration and benefits of an EEG interface within ubiquitous robotic systems. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We propose a novel multivariate machine learning model and algorithmic strategy for multi-subject regression or classification that uses regularization to directly account for the spatio-temporal nature of the data. Our method begins by fitting multi-subject models to each location separately (similar to univariate frameworks), and then aggregates information across nearby locations through regularization. We develop an optimization strategy so that our so called, Local-Aggregate Models, can be fit in a completely distributed manner over the locations which greatly reduces computational costs. Our models achieve better predictions with more interpretable results as demonstrated through a multi-subject EEG example.

Ripple classification helps to localize the seizure-onset zone in neocortical epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						High frequency oscillation; Epileptiform discharges; Neocortical epilepsy; Primary motor cortex; Primary visual cortex; Seizure onset zone	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; HIGH GAMMA ACTIVITY; 80-200 HZ; MACROELECTRODES; CORTEX; BRAIN; EEG	Purpose: Fast ripples are reported to be highly localizing to the epileptogenic or seizure-onset zone (SOZ) but may not be readily found in neocortical epilepsy, whereas ripples are insufficiently localizing. Herein we classified interictal neocortical ripples by associated characteristics to identify a subtype that may help to localize the SOZ in neocortical epilepsy. We hypothesize that ripples associated with an interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) are more pathologic, since the IED is not a normal physiologic event. Methods: We studied 35 patients with epilepsy with neocortical epilepsy who underwent invasive electroencephalography (EEG) evaluation by stereotactic EEG (SEEG) or subdural grid electrodes. Interictal fast ripples and ripples were visually marked during slow-wave sleep lasting 1030min. Neocortical ripples were classified as type I when superimposed on epileptiform discharges such as paroxysmal fast, spike, or sharp wave, and as type II when independent of epileptiform discharges. Key Findings: In 21 patients with a defined SOZ, neocortical fast ripples were detected in the SOZ of only four patients. Type I ripples were detected in 14 cases almost exclusively in the SOZ or primary propagation area (PP) and marked the SOZ with higher specificity than interictal spikes. In contrast, type II ripples were not correlated with the SOZ. In 14 patients with two or more presumed SOZs or nonlocalizable onset pattern, type I but not type II ripples also occurred in the SOZs. We found the areas with only type II ripples outside of the SOZ (type II-O ripples) in SEEG that localized to the primary motor cortex and primary visual cortex. Significance: Neocortical fast ripples and type I ripples are specific markers of the SOZ, whereas type II ripples are not. Type I ripples are found more readily than fast ripples in human neocortical epilepsy. Type II-O ripples may represent spontaneous physiologic ripples in the human neocortex.

William			Agreement Between Long-Term Neonatal Background Classification by Conventional and Amplitude-Integrated EEG	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Neonatal EEG; EEG monitoring; Cerebral function monitors; AEEG; Infant heart surgery	HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; FULL-TERM; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SEIZURES; PRETERM; INFANTS; AGE; PATTERNS	Conventional EEG (CEEG) in neonates is considered the gold standard for evaluating EEG background and detecting electrographic seizures. However, CEEG is expensive and cumbersome for long-term monitoring. A simplified method, amplitude-integrated EEG (AEEG) has been rapidly adopted to accomplish the same goals. The purpose of this study was to measure the agreement between the methods of classification in long-term EEG background assessments by CEEG and AEEG. Infants underwent CEEG monitoring after cardiac surgery and the background during four 12-hour epochs classified as "normal" or "mildly," "moderately," or "markedly" abnormal. CEEGs were converted to a single-channel AEEG and independently interpreted as "normal," "moderately abnormal," or "markedly abnormal" by standard amplitude criteria. The distributions of CEEG and AEEG interpretations were statistically compared, and the associations between CEEG and AEEG interpretations were measured. Generalized estimating equations were used to measure the effects of seizures and patient age on the agreement between AEEG and CEEG scores. Paired CEEGs and AEEGs were available for 637 epochs recorded from 179 infants. The distribution of CEEG backgrounds included 60% normal, 22% mildly abnormal, 13% moderately abnormal, and 5% markedly abnormal. The distribution of AEEG backgrounds was significantly different from CEEG and included 22% normal, 73% moderately abnormal, and 5% markedly abnormal. Nevertheless, the two techniques exhibited a significant, moderate positive association. Generalized estimating equations focusing on those with moderately abnormal AEEGs showed that younger patients with seizures were significantly more likely to have moderately or markedly abnormal CEEGs than older patients without seizures. Although there was overall significant moderate agreement between the two techniques, the distribution of backgrounds assigned by AEEG was significantly different from CEEG. Most moderately abnormal AEEGs were associated with normal or mildly abnormal CEEGs. However, the ability of moderately abnormal AEEGs to correctly predict moderately or markedly abnormal CEEG was significantly associated with the knowledge of the patient's age and the presence of seizures on CEEG.

Individual EEG differences in affective valence processing in women with low and high neuroticism	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Affective valence; EEG; Individual differences; Neuroticism; Single-trial; SVM	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; EMOTIONAL STIMULI; VISUAL-STIMULI; PERSONALITY; RESPONSES; BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; EXTROVERSION; OSCILLATIONS	Objective: In this study, individual differences in brain electrophysiology during positive and negative affective valence processing in women with different neuroticism scores are quantified. Methods: Twenty-six women scoring high and low on neuroticism participated on this experiment. A support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier was applied on the EEG single trials elicited by high arousal pictures with negative and positive valence scores. Based on the accuracy values obtained from subject identification tasks, the most distinguishing EEG channels among participants were detected, pointing which scalp regions show more distinct patterns. Results: Significant differences were obtained, in the EEG heterogeneity between positive and negative valence stimuli, yielding higher accuracy in subject identification using negative pictures. Regarding the topographical analysis, significantly higher accuracy values were reached in occipital areas and in the right hemisphere (p < 0: 001). Conclusions: Mainly, individual differences in EEG can be located in parietooccipital regions. These differences are likely to be due to the different reactivity and coping strategies to unpleasant stimuli in individuals with high neuroticism. In addition, the right hemisphere shows a greater individual specificity. Significance: An SVM-based classifier asserts the individual specificity and its topographical differences in electrophysiological activity for women with high neuroticism compared to low neuroticism.

To identify a target character in 12 x 7 matrix using the RC pattern, 19 flashes (sub-trials) are necessary. In each flash, the selected characters (one column or one row in the RC pattern) are flashing. We present four new paradigms and compare the performance to the RC paradigm. These paradigms present quasi-random groups of characters using 9, 12, 14 and 16 flashes per trial to identify a target character. The 12-, 14- and 16-flash patterns were optimized so that the same character never flashed twice in succession. We assessed the practical bit rate and classification accuracy of the 9-, 12-, 14-, 16- and RC (19-flash) pattern conditions in an online experiment and with offline simulations. The results indicate that 16-flash pattern is better than other patterns and performance of an online P300 BCI can be significantly improved by selecting the best presentation paradigm for each subject.

J	Henry, MJ; Obleser, J				Henry, Molly J.; Obleser, Jonas			Dissociable Neural Response Signatures for Slow Amplitude and Frequency Modulation in Human Auditory Cortex	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; SPEECH-INTELLIGIBILITY; PHASE; TONES; DISCRIMINATION; ADAPTATION; PATTERNS; STIMULI; MEG; AM	Natural auditory stimuli are characterized by slow fluctuations in amplitude and frequency. However, the degree to which the neural responses to slow amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) are capable of conveying independent time-varying information, particularly with respect to speech communication, is unclear. In the current electroencephalography (EEG) study, participants listened to amplitude- and frequency-modulated narrow-band noises with a 3-Hz modulation rate, and the resulting neural responses were compared. Spectral analyses revealed similar spectral amplitude peaks for AM and FM at the stimulation frequency (3 Hz), but amplitude at the second harmonic frequency (6 Hz) was much higher for FM than for AM. Moreover, the phase delay of neural responses with respect to the full-band stimulus envelope was shorter for FM than for AM. Finally, the critical analysis involved classification of single trials as being in response to either AM or FM based on either phase or amplitude information. Time-varying phase, but not amplitude, was sufficient to accurately classify AM and FM stimuli based on single-trial neural responses. Taken together, the current results support the dissociable nature of cortical signatures of slow AM and FM. These cortical signatures potentially provide an efficient means to dissect simultaneously communicated slow temporal and spectral information in acoustic communication signals.

A new (semantic) reflexive brain-computer interface: In search for a suitable classifier	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Classical semantic conditioning; Electroencephalogram; Single-trial classification; Brain-computer interface	AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; P300 SPELLER; PARALYZED PATIENTS; COMMUNICATION; BCI	The goal of the current study is to find a suitable classifier for electroencephalogram (EEG) data derived from a new learning paradigm which aims at communication in paralysis. A reflexive semantic classical (Pavlovian) conditioning paradigm is explored as an alternative to the operant learning paradigms, currently used in most brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Comparable with a lie-detection experiment, subjects are presented with true and false statements. The EEG activity following true and false statements was classified with the aim to separate covert 'yes' from covert 'no' responses. Four classification algorithms are compared for classifying off-line data collected from a group of 14 healthy participants: (i) stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA), (ii) shrinkage linear discriminant analysis (SLDA), (iii) linear support vector machine (LIN-SVM) and (iv) radial basis function kernel support vector machine (RBF-SVM). The results indicate that all classifiers perform at chance level when separating conditioned 'yes' from conditioned 'no' responses. However, single conditioned reactions could be successfully classified on a single-trial basis (single conditioned reaction against a baseline interval). All of the four investigated classification methods achieve comparable performance, however results with RBF-SVM show the highest single-trial classification accuracy of 68.8%. The results suggest that the proposed paradigm may allow affirmative and negative (disapproving negative) communication in a BCI experiment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The objective of the present study is to develop a novel approach to extract pain-related features from single-trial laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) for classification of pain perception. The single-trial LEP feature extraction approach combines a spatial filtering using common spatial pattern (CSP) and a multiple linear regression (MLR). The CSP method is effective in separating laser-evoked EEG response from ongoing EEG activity, while MLR is capable of automatically estimating the amplitudes and latencies of N2 and P2 from single-trial LEP waveforms. The extracted single-trial LEP features are used in a Naive Bayes classifier to classify different levels of pain perceived by the subjects. The experimental results show that the proposed single-trial LEP feature extraction approach can effectively extract pain-related LEP features for achieving high classification accuracy.

For matrix-variate data such as spatio-spectral electroencephalogram (EEG), matrix-variate LDA formulations have been proposed. Compared to the standard vector-variate LDA, these formulations assume a separable structure for the within-class and between-class scatter matrices; these structured parameters can be estimated more accurately with a limited number of training samples. However, separable scatters do not fit some data, resulting in aggravated performance for matrix-variate methods. This paper first proposes a common framework for the vector-variate LDA with non-separable scatters and our previously proposed solution with separable scatters. Then, a regularization of the non-separable scatter estimates toward the separable estimates is introduced. This novel regularized framework integrates vector-variate and matrix-variate approaches, and allows the estimated scatter matrices to adapt to the data characteristics. Experiments on data set V from BCI competition III demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a considerable classification performance gain.

A novel method that aims at identifying event-related potentials (ERPs) in time-frequency is proposed, and a robust classifier with feature clustering is developed to better utilize the correlated ERP features. The method is applied to EEG recordings of a RSVP experiment with multiple sessions and subjects. The results show that, the target image events are mainly characterized by 3 distinct patterns in the time-frequency domain, i.e., a theta band (4.3 Hz) power boost 300-700 ms after the target image onset, an alpha band (12 Hz) power repression 500-1000 ms after the stimulus onset, and a delta band (2 Hz) power boost after 500 ms. The discriminate time-frequency features are mostly power boost and relatively consistent among multiple sessions and subjects. These features are visualized for later analysis. For classification of target and non-target images, our LDA classifier was based on the uncorrelated features, which was constructed from original correlated features using clustering method. With feature clustering, the performance (area under ROC) was improved from 0.85 to 0.89 for within-session tests, and from 0.76 to 0.84 for cross-subject tests. Meanwhile, the constructed uncorrelated features were shown more robust than the original discriminant features, and corresponding to a local region in time-frequency.

The non-stationarities in the signal may come from many different sources, for instance, electrode artefacts, muscular activity or changes of task involvement, and often deteriorate classification performance. This is mainly because features extracted by standard methods like common spatial patterns (CSP) are not invariant to variations of the signal properties, thus should also change over time. Although many extensions of CSP were proposed to, for example, reduce the sensitivity to noise or incorporate information from other subjects, none of them tackles the non-stationarity problem directly. In this paper, we propose a method which regularizes CSP towards stationary subspaces (sCSP) and show that this increases classification accuracy, especially for subjects who are hardly able to control a BCI. We compare our method with the state-of-the-art approaches on different datasets, show competitive results and analyse the reasons for the improvement.

The immediate goal of BCI research is to provide communications capabilities to severely disabled people who are totally paralyzed or 'locked in' by neurological neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brain stem stroke, or spinal cord injury. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of BCIs, looking at the different steps that form a standard BCI: signal acquisition, preprocessing or signal enhancement, feature extraction, classification and the control interface. We discuss their advantages, drawbacks, and latest advances, and we survey the numerous technologies reported in the scientific literature to design each step of a BCI. First, the review examines the neuroimaging modalities used in the signal acquisition step, each of which monitors a different functional brain activity such as electrical, magnetic or metabolic activity. Second, the review discusses different electrophysiological control signals that determine user intentions, which can be detected in brain activity. Third, the review includes some techniques used in the signal enhancement step to deal with the artifacts in the control signals and improve the performance. Fourth, the review studies some mathematic algorithms used in the feature extraction and classification steps which translate the information in the control signals into commands that operate a computer or other device. Finally, the review provides an overview of various BCI applications that control a range of devices.

In our classic machine learning approach to BCIs, the participants undertake a calibration measurement without feedback to acquire data to train the BC! system. After the training, the user can control a BCI and improve the operation through some type of feedback. However, not all BCI users are able to perform sufficiently well during feedback operation. In fact, a non-negligible portion of participants (estimated 15%-30%) cannot control the system (a BCI illiteracy problem, generic to all motor-imagery-based BCIs). We hypothesize that one main difficulty for a BCI user is the transition from offline calibration to online feedback. In this work, we investigate adaptive machine learning methods to eliminate offline calibration and analyze the performance of 11 volunteers in a BCI based on the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms. We present an adaptation scheme that individually guides the user. It starts with a subject-independent classifier that evolves to a subject-optimized state-of-the-art classifier within one session while the user interacts continuously. These initial runs use supervised techniques for robust coadaptive learning of user and machine. Subsequent runs use unsupervised adaptation to track the features' drift during the session and provide an unbiased measure of BCI performance. Using this approach, without any offline calibration, six users, including one novice, obtained good performance after 3 to 6 minutes of adaptation. More important, this novel guided learning also allows participants with BCI illiteracy to gain significant control with the BCI in less than 60 minutes. In addition, one volunteer without sensorimotor idle rhythm peak at the beginning of the BCI experiment developed it during the course of the session and used voluntary modulation of its amplitude to control the feedback application.

The current state of research allows to use certain properties of electromagnetic waves (brain activity) produced by brain neurons, measured using electroencephalographic techniques (EEG recording involves reading from electrodes attached to the scalp - the non-invasive method - or with electrodes implanted directly into the cerebral cortex - the invasive method). A BCI system reads the user's "intentions" by decoding certain features of the EEG signal. Those features are then classified and "translated" (on-line) into commands used to control a computer, prosthesis, wheelchair or other device. In this article, the authors try to show that the BCI is a typical example of a measurement and control unit.

Due to an ergonomic kinematic architecture and the presence of three contact points, which enable the reflection of complex force patterns, the developed exoskeleton takes full advantage of the human arm mobility, allowing the operator to tele-control complex robotic systems in an intuitive way via an immersive simulation environment. Taking into account the operator's percept and a set of constraints on the exoskeleton control system, it is illustrated how to quantitatively enhance the comfort and the performance of this sophisticated human-machine interface. Our approach of integrating EEG signals into the control of the exoskeleton guarantees the safety of the operator in any working modality, while reducing effort and ensuring functionality and comfort even in case of possible misclassification of the EEG instances. Tests on different subjects with simulated movement prediction values were performed in order to prove that the integration of EEG signals into the control architecture can significantly smooth the transition between the control states of the exoskeleton, as revealed by a significant decrease in the interaction force.

Five able-bodied subjects and a transradial amputee participated in an experiment of eight-task wrist and hand motion recognition. Low-density (six channels) surface EMG signals were collected on forearms. Since surface EMG signals are contaminated by large amount of noises from various sources, the performance of the conventional time-domain feature extraction method is limited. The CSSP method is a classification-oriented optimal spatio-spectral filter, which is capable of separating discriminative information from noise and, thus, leads to better classification accuracy. The substantially improved classification accuracy of the CSSP method over the time-domain and other methods is observed in all five able-bodied subjects and verified via the cross-validation. The CSSP method can also achieve better classification accuracy in the amputee, which shows its potential use for functional prosthetic control.

In present study, a novel approach, which combines common spatial pattern (CSP) and multiple linear regression (MLR), is proposed to for single-trial detection of pain-related laser-evoked potentials (LEPs). The CSP method is effective in separating laser-evoked EEG response from ongoing EEG activity, while MLR makes an automatic and reliable estimation of the amplitudes and latencies of N2 and P2 from single-trial LEP waveforms. The MLR coefficients are further used for the prediction of pain perception, which is of great importance for both basic and clinical applications. The prediction is performed with both binary (classification of low pain and high pain) and continuous (regression on a continuous scale from 0 to 10) outcomes. The results show that the proposed methods could provide reliable performance at both with- and cross-individual levels.

Characteristics of sleep EEG power spectra in healthy infants in the first two years of life	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sleep; EEG; Power spectra; Infants	WAKE PATTERNS; SPINDLES; BRAIN; MATURATION; CLASSIFICATION; RECHTSCHAFFEN; CHILDREN; NIGHT; TERM; AASM	Objective: This study characterises and describes the maturational evolution of the healthy infant sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) longitudinally from 2 weeks to 24 months of age, by means of power spectral analysis. Methods: A prospective cohort of 34 healthy infants underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG) at 2 weeks, and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months of age. Sleep epochs were scored as Active Sleep (AS) and Quiet Sleep (QS) at 2 weeks of age and as Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and Non-REM (NREM) stages from 3 months onwards. Representative epochs were used to generate the EEG power spectra, from the central C3 derivation. These were analysed visually and quantitatively in AS/REM and QS/NREM sleep in the following bandwidths: delta (0.5-4 Hz); theta (4-8 Hz); alpha (8-11 Hz); sigma (11-15 Hz) and 0.5-25 Hz. Results: Sleep EEG (central derivation) power spectra changed significantly in the different bandwidths as the infants matured. The emergence of a peak in the sigma bandwidth in NREM N2 sleep corresponded with the development of sleep spindles. Maturational changes were also seen in NREM N3 and in theta and alpha bandwidths in both AS/REM and QS/NREM. Conclusions: Sleep EEG power spectra characteristics in healthy infants evolve in keeping with maturation and neurodevelopmental milestones. Significance: This study provides an atlas of healthy infant sleep EEG in the early years of life, providing a basis for association with other neurodevelopmental measures and a normative dataset on which disease may be discriminated.

Characterizing multivariate decoding models based on correlated EEG spectral features	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sensorimotor rhythm; Multivariate decoding; Multicollinearity; Brain-computer interface	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; SIGNAL; BCI; SUPPRESSION; OPERATION; SELECTION	Objective: Multivariate decoding methods are popular techniques for analysis of neurophysiological data. The present study explored potential interpretative problems with these techniques when predictors are correlated. Methods: Data from sensorimotor rhythm-based cursor control experiments was analyzed offline with linear univariate and multivariate models. Features were derived from autoregressive (AR) spectral analysis of varying model order which produced predictors that varied in their degree of correlation (i.e., multicollinearity). Results: The use of multivariate regression models resulted in much better prediction of target position as compared to univariate regression models. However, with lower order AR features interpretation of the spectral patterns of the weights was difficult. This is likely to be due to the high degree of multicollinearity present with lower order AR features. Conclusions: Care should be exercised when interpreting the pattern of weights of multivariate models with correlated predictors. Comparison with univariate statistics is advisable. Significance: While multivariate decoding algorithms are very useful for prediction their utility for interpretation may be limited when predictors are correlated.

Consequently, we can overlay them together by non-uniform electrode distribution enhancing the signal noise ratio and therefore the degree of sparseness by threshold. We overcame the conflicting requirements between a high spatial electrode density and precise temporal resolution (beyond Event Related Potential (ERP) P300 brainwave at 0.3 sec), and Smartphone wireless bottleneck of spatiotemporal throughput rate. Our main contribution in this paper is the quality and the speed of iterative compressed image recovery algorithm based on a Block Sparse Code (Baranuick et al, IEEE/IT 2008). As a result, we achieved real-time wireless dynamic measurement of EEG brainwaves, matching well with traditionally tethered high density EEG.

In order to avoid the invasiveness of electrophysiological recording, more non-invasive approaches such as EEG or fMRI was likewise proposed. However, most non-invasive BCI studies suffer from the fact that they classify brain differential activity states, rather than deciphering the actual neural responses underlying the target behavior. In this simulation study, in order to decode the brain activity states underlying the target behavior from the fMRI signals, we found the directional tuning properties, a basic functional property of neural activity in Ml, at the voxel level for motor trajectory decoding, and we performed a simulation to demonstrate that it is feasible to control the robotic arm in real time based on multi-voxel patterns.

Movement related cortical potentials change after EEG-BMI rehabilitation in chronic stroke	2013 6TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	NOV 06-08, 2013	San Diego, CA	IEEE EMBS, Battelle, Brain Vis LLC, Cortech Solut, Univ Minnesota, IGERT Program, Syst Neuroengineering, IOP Publishing, Ripple, Univ Minnesota, Inst Engn Med, Plexon			SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA	Movement related cortical potentials (MRCPs) have been studied for many years and proposed as reliable and immediate indicators of cortical reorganizations in motor learning and after stroke. It has been reported that decrease in amplitude and later onset of MRCPs reflect less mental effort and shorter planning time during a motor task. In this study MRCPs preceding hand movements in severe chronic stroke were investigated in an EEG screening paradigm (patients performed hand open and close for paretic and healthy hand) before and after a one-month online-EEG-Brain-Machine-Interface neuro rehabilitation intervention coupled with physiotherapy. Five severely impaired (no residual finger extension) chronic stoke patients were enrolled in the study. We observed that MRCPs peak amplitude over Cz during paretic hand movement attempts decreased significantly after compared to before intervention. Furthermore, MRCP onset was significantly later over central regions during paretic hand movements after compared to before intervention. There were no significant pre-post differences during healthy hand movements. Our results suggest that our patients needed less mental effort and shorter planning time after intervention. We demonstrated for the first time significant MRCP changes after a neurorehabilitation intervention (BMI + physiotherapy) in severe chronic stroke patients.

Refractory nonconvulsive status epilepticus in coma: analysis of the evolution of ictal patterns	ARQUIVOS DE NEURO-PSIQUIATRIA			English	Article						nonconvulsive status epilepticus; ictal patterns; PLEDs	EEG; SEIZURES; CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES	Objective: Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is currently considered as one of the most frequent types of status epilepticus (SE). The objective of the present study was to identify the natural history of the electrographical evolution of refractory NCSE and to establish the relationship between ictal patterns and prognosis. Methods: We analyzed, retrospectively, 14 patients with loss of consciousness and NCSE. The ictal patterns were classified as discrete seizures (DS), merging seizures (MS), continuous ictal discharges (CID), continuous ictal discharges with flat periods (CID-F), and periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs). Results: The ictal patterns were DS (n=7; 50.0%), PLEDs (n=3; 1.4%), CID (n=2; 14.3%), MS (n=1; 7.1%), and CID-F (n=1; 7.1%). Conclusions: NCSE electrographic findings are heterogeneous and do not follow a stereotyped sequence. PLEDs were related to a higher probability of neurological morbidity and mortality.

However it is designed for 2-class BCI classification problems. Current extensions of this method to multiple classes based on subspace union and covariance matrix similarity do not provide a high performance. This paper presents a new approach to solving multi-class BCI classification problems by forming a subspace resembled from original subspaces and the proposed method for this approach is called Approximation-based Common Principal Component (ACPC). We perform experiments on Dataset 2a used in BCI Competition IV to evaluate the proposed method. This dataset was designed for motor imagery classification with 4 classes. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed ACPC feature extraction method when combining with Support Vector Machines outperforms CSP-based feature extraction methods on the experimental dataset.

Single-trial connectivity estimation for classification of motor imagery data	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							PARTIAL DIRECTED COHERENCE; INFORMATION-FLOW; EEG DATA; BRAIN; PHASE; AMPLITUDE	Objective. Many brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) use band power (BP) changes in the electroencephalogram to distinguish between different motor imagery (MI) patterns. Most current approaches do not take connectivity of separated brain areas into account. Our objective is to introduce single-trial connectivity features and apply these features to BCI data. Approach. We introduce a procedure for extracting single-trial connectivity estimates from vector autoregressive (VAR) models of independent components in a BCI setting. Main results. In a simulated BCI, we demonstrate that the directed transfer function (DTF) with full-frequency normalization and the direct DTF give classification results similar to BP, while other measures such as the partial directed coherence perform significantly worse. Significance. We show that single-trial MI classification is possible with connectivity measures extracted from VAR models, and that a BCI could potentially utilize such measures.

The typical approach is to modify the end devices to interpret these signals and to function accordingly [2-5]. But our system proposes an Interpreter System within which these signals are decoded and interfaced with the existing devices. The advantage is that the end devices need not be changed to suit the user, because the logic required for interpretation is within the Interpreter System. Therefore it acts as an interface through which the user can control multiple devices at the same time. Acquisition systems can capture and process EOG, EMG and EEG signals and transmit them to the Interpreter System via the Bluetooth Low Energy module. A communication language using EOG works in combination with EEG and EMG to enable communication. This language will help the users to interface with multiple devices with a limited number of symbols.	[Ramesh, Maneesha V.; Nair, Aswathy Asok; Menon, K. A.

However, the method used to design a real-time BCI paradigm for controlling unstable devices is still a challenging problem. This paper presents a real-time feedback BO paradigm for controlling an inverted pendulum on a cart (IPC). In this paradigm, sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) were recorded using 15 active electrodes placed on the surface of the subject's scalp. Subsequently, common spatial pattern (CSP) was used as the basic filter to extract spatial patterns. Finally, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to translate the patterns into control commands that could stabilize the simulated inverted pendulum. Offline trainings were employed to teach the subjects to execute corresponding mental tasks, such as left/right hand motor imagery. Five subjects could successfully balance the online inverted pendulum for more than 35s. The results demonstrated that BCIs are able to control nonlinear unstable devices. Furthermore, the demonstration and extension of real-time continuous control might be useful for the real-life application and generalization of BCI. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Clinical genetic studies in benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Childhood epilepsy; Centrotemporal spikes; Genetics	LANDAU-KLEFFNER SYNDROME; FOCAL SHARP WAVES; ROLANDIC EPILEPSY; CHILDREN; EEG; SEIZURES; SPEECH; CLASSIFICATION; ABNORMALITIES; PREVALENCE	Purpose: To accurately determine the frequency and nature of the family history of seizures in patients with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS). Method: Participants with BECTS were recruited from the electroencephalography (EEG) laboratories of three pediatric centers and by referral. Pedigrees were constructed for up to three degrees of relatedness for each proband. All available affected and unaffected individuals underwent phenotyping using a validated seizure questionnaire. The proportion of affected relatives according to degree of relatedness was calculated and phenotypic patterns were analyzed. Key Findings: Fifty-three probands with BECTS had a mean age of seizure onset at 7.8 years (range 2-12 years). Thirty-four (64%) of 53 patients were male. For 51 participants, pedigrees were available for three degrees of relatedness. Fifty-seven (2.7%) of 2,085 relatives had a history of seizures: Twenty-one (9.8%) of 214 first-degree, 15 (3%) of 494 second-degree, and 21 (1.5%) of 1,377 third-degree relatives. Febrile seizures were the most frequent phenotype, occurring in 26 of 57 affected relatives. There were 34 relatives with epilepsy: 6.5% (14 of 214) first-degree, 1.8% (9 of 494) second-degree, and 0.8% (11 of 1,377) third-degree relatives. Of 21 affected first-degree relatives: 8 of 21 had febrile seizures (FS), 4 had BECTS, 2 had epilepsy-aphasia spectrum disorder, one had temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis, 2 had focal epilepsy of unknown cause, 2 had genetic generalized epilepsies, and 3 had miscellaneous. Significance: The frequency of epilepsies in relatives and the heterogeneous syndromes observed suggest that BECTS has a genetic component consistent with complex inheritance. Focal epilepsies are the most common seizure disorder observed in relatives, especially BECTS and epilepsy-aphasia spectrum disorder. Additional acquired or environmental factors are likely to be necessary for expression of the seizure disorder.

In this work, different types of machine learning methods were used to classify EMG signals and compared in relation to their accuracy in classification of EMG signals. The models automatically classify the EMG signals into normal, neurogenic or myopathic. The best averaged performance over 10 runs of randomized cross-validation is also obtained by different classification models. Some conclusions concerning the impacts of features on the EMG signal classification were obtained through analysis of the classification techniques. The comparative analysis suggests that the fuzzy support vector machines (FSVM) modelling is superior to the other machine learning methods in at least three points: slightly higher recognition rate; insensitivity to overtraining; and consistent outputs demonstrating higher reliability. The combined model with discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and FSVM achieves the better performance for internal cross validation (External cross validation) with the area under the reciever operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and accuracy equal to 0.996 (0.970) and 97.67% (93.5%), respectively. These results show that the proposed model have the potential to obtain a reliable classification of EMG signals, and to assist the clinicians for making a correct diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders.

Therefore, the ability to detect and recognize one's emotional states is essential in intelligence Human Machine Interaction (HMI). The aim of this study was to develop a new system that can sense and communicate emotion changes expressed by the Central Nervous System (CNS) through the use of EEG signals. More specifically, this study was carried out to develop an EEG-based subject-dependent affect recognition system to quantitatively measure and categorize three affect states: Positively excited, neutral and negatively excited. In this paper, we discussed implementation issues associated with each key stage of a fully automated affect recognition system: emotion elicitation protocol, feature extraction and classification. EEG recordings from 5 subjects with IAPS images as stimuli from the eNTERFACE06 database were used for simulation purposes. Discriminating features were extracted in both time and frequency domains (statistical, narrow-band, HOC, and wavelet entropy) to better understand the oscillatory nature of the brain waves. Through the use of k Nearest Neighbor classifier (kNN), we obtained mean correct classification rates of 90.77% on the three emotion classes when K equals 5. This demonstrated the feasibility of brain waves as a mean to categorize a user's emotion state. Secondly, we also assessed the suitability of commercially available EEG headsets such as Emotive Epoc for emotion recognition applications. This study was carried out by comparing the sensor location, signal integrity with those of Biosemi Active II. A new set of recognition performance was presented with reduced number of channels.

Because the cognitive demands of the task can also vary it is possible that the capabilities of the operator are not sufficient to satisfy the job demands. This can lead to serious errors when the operator is overwhelmed by the task demands. Psychophysiological measures, such as heart rate and brain activity, can be used to monitor operator cognitive workload. In this paper, the most influential psychophysiological measures are extracted to characterize Operator Functional State (OFS) in automated tasks under a complex form of human-automation interaction. The fuzzy c-mean (FCM) algorithm is used and tested for its OFS classification performance. The results obtained have shown the feasibility and effectiveness of the FCM algorithm as well as the utility of the selected input features for OFS classification. Besides being able to cope with nonlinearity and fuzzy uncertainty in the psychophysiological data it can provide information about the relative importance of the input features as well as the confidence estimate of the classification results. The OFS pattern classification method developed can be incorporated into an adaptive aiding system in order to enhance the overall performance of a large class of safety-critical human-machine cooperative systems.

Investigation into the Efficacy of Generating Synthetic Pathological Oscillations for Domain Adaptation	IX INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON MEDICAL INFORMATION PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Seminar on Medical Information Processing and Analysis	NOV 11-14, 2013	Mexico City, MEXICO	Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Univ Panamericana, Univ Nacl Colombia		Machine Learning; Domain Adaptation; Synthetic Oscillations; Knowledge Discovery in Databases	NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; NEURAL SYNCHRONY; EEG; SEIZURES; EPILEPSY	In our ongoing work to integrate Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) into neuroscience, we present a paper that facilitates overcoming the two challenges preventing this integration. Pathological oscillations found in the human brain are difficult to evaluate because 1) there is often no time to learn and train off of the same distribution in the fatally sick, and 2) sinusoidal signals found in the human brain are complex and transient in nature, requiring large data sets to work with which are costly and often very expensive or impossible to acquire. Overcoming these challenges in today's neuro-intensive care unit (ICU) requires insurmountable resources. For these reasons, optimizing KDD for pathological oscillations so machine learning systems can predict neuropathological states would be of immense value. Domain adaptation, which allows a way of predicting on a separate set of data than the training data, can theoretically overcome the first challenge. However, the challenge of acquiring large data sets that show whether domain adaptation is a good candidate to test in a live neuro ICU remains a challenge. To solve this conundrum, we present a methodology for generating synthesized neuropathological oscillations for domain adaptation.

It is highly common in children and adults at the age of 65-70. Around 1% of the world's population is affected by this disease. The mechanism of epilepsy is still incomprehensible to researchers; however, 80% of the seizure activity can be treated effectively if proper diagnosis is performed. This disease mostly leads to uncontrollable movements, convulsions and loss of conscious and contends the patient to increased possibility of accidental injury and even death. As a result, monitoring the person with epilepsy from being exposed to the danger is among the basic death to life transformation solutions. In this paper, we propose the most important methodologies that could be implemented in hardware for monitoring an epileptic patient. Many studies show that, Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most important signal used by physicians in assessing the brain activities and diagnosing different brain disorders. This study is based on different EEG datasets that were obtained and described by researchers for analysis and diagnosis of epilepsy. Butterworth band-pass filters are implemented and used to preprocess and decompose the EEG signal into five different EEG frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). In addition, different features such as energy, standard deviation and entropy are then computed and extracted from each Delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma sub-band. Furthermore, the extracted features are then fed to a supervised learning classifier; support vector machine (SVM); in order to detect the epileptic events and identify if the acquired signal is corresponding to seizure or not according to the objective of this research. If seizure is experienced, appropriate monitoring should be taken in action. Experimental results on a number of subjects confirm 95% classification accuracy of the proposed work.

Improved decoding of neural activity from fMRI signals using non-separable spatiotemporal deconvolutions	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neurovascular coupling; EEG-fMRI; Multivoxel pattern analysis; Spatiotemporal hemodynamic response function	HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSE; VISUAL-CORTEX; STIMULATION; FUSION; MODEL; EEG	The goal of most functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) analyses is to investigate neural activity. Many fMRI analysis methods assume that the temporal dynamics of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) to neural activation is separable from its spatial dynamics. Although there is empirical evidence that the HRF is more complex than suggested by space-time separable canonical HRF models, it is difficult to assess how much information about neural activity is lost when assuming space-time separability. In this study we directly test whether spatiotemporal variability in the HRF that is not captured by separable models contains information about neural signals. We predict intracranially measured neural activity from simultaneously recorded fMRI data using separable and non-separable spatiotemporal deconvolutions of voxel time series around the recording electrode. Our results show that abandoning the spatiotemporal separability assumption consistently improves the decoding accuracy of neural signals from fMRI data. We compare our findings with results from optical imaging and fMRI studies and discuss potential implications for classical fMRI analyses without invasive electrophysiological recordings.

Dimension Reduction in EEG Data using Particle Swarm Optimization	2012 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION (CEC)	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	JUN 10-15, 2012	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	IEEE				EEG data contains high-dimensional data that requires considerable computational power for distinguishing different classes. Dimension reduction is commonly used to reduces the necessary training time of the classifiers with some degree of accuracy lost. The dimension reduction is usually performed on either feature or electrode space. In this study, a new dimension reduction method that reduce the number of electrodes and features using variations of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used. The variation is in terms of parameter adjustment and adding a mutation operator to the PSO. The results are assessed based on the dimension reduction percentage, the potential of selected electrodes and the degree of performance lost. An Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used as the primary classifier to evaluate the sets of electrodes and features selected by PSO. Two alternative classifiers such as Polynomial SVM and Perceptron are used for further evaluation of the reduced dimension data. The results indicate the potential of variations of PSO for reducing up to 99% of the data with minimal performance lost.	[Atyabi, Adham; Luerssen, Martin; Fitzgibbon, Sean; Powers, David M.

Also, the system was modularized into three components: Bel, control, and network.

K.; Van Huffel, Sabine; De Vos, Maarten			Incorporating structural information from the multichannel EEG improves patient-specific seizure detection	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Seizure detection; EEG; Structural information; Convex optimization; Nuclear norm; LS-SVM	EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; ONSET; TIME; ALGORITHM	Objective: A novel patient-specific seizure detection algorithm is presented. As the spatial distribution of the ictal pattern is characteristic for a patient's seizures, this work incorporates such information into the data representation and provides a learning algorithm exploiting it. Methods: The proposed training algorithm uses nuclear norm regularization to convey structural information of the channel-feature matrices extracted from the EEG. This method is compared to two existing approaches utilizing the same feature set, but integrating the multichannel information in a different manner. The performances of the detectors are demonstrated on a publicly available dataset containing 131 seizures recorded in 892 h of scalp EEG from 22 pediatric patients. Results: The proposed algorithm performed significantly better compared to the reference approaches (p = 0.0170 and p = 0.0002). It reaches a median performance of 100% sensitivity, 0.11 h(-1) false detection rate and 7.8 s alarm delay, outperforming a method in the literature using the same dataset. Conclusion: The strength of our method lies within conveying structural information from the multichannel EEG. Such formulation automatically includes crucial spatial information and improves detection performance. Significance: Our solution facilitates accurate classification performance for small training sets, therefore, it potentially reduces the time needed to train the detector before starting monitoring.

Video recordings synchronized with motion recordings were analyzed visually during seizures and divided, for each limb, into events corresponding to different classes of motor manifestations. For each classified event, features were extracted and a subset selection was automated using artificial neural networks. The best artificial neural network was simulated on whole recordings to generate a stereotypic evolution of motor manifestations that we called motorograms. It is shown that motorograms can point out seizure movements and emphasize epileptic patterns. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Brain computer interface based on EEG signal recognized brain control limbs movement is one of the main application of BCI system. Classification attention of user when moving limbs find out the brain region activating and translate them into commands which could control outer device. Recently, a famous technique to analyze EEG signals based on spatial filter is common spatial patterns (CSP). It is popular for two-class paradigm when maximize one class in the same time minimize the other one. In the other hand, CSP gets limitation when just working on covariance matrices in which not only stationary brain signal sources but also contaminated non-stationary sources. In this paper, we proposed to applied extension of CSP to separate non-stationary and also apply for multi-class BCI to reduce these disadvantage mentioned above. To solve non-stationary sources problem, we applied stationary CSP (sCSP) to separate signal sources. sCSP method is also powerful for binary paradigm. To improve sCSP for multi-class, we applied joint approximate diagonalization (JAD), which is successful to find efficient spatial filter in the context of multi-class BCI. Since CSP supposed to separate data space linearly, nearest neighbor method was used to classify the multi-class BCI to evaluate the performance of methods. We used 2 sorts of dataset: 1) auditory cue to two patients respond to three kinds of sound for executive movement; 2) auditory spatial from 2 speakers separate sounds. Three kinds of sound are: 500Hz left hand, 2000Hz right hand and noise sound ignored.

A novel method that aims to identify single-trial event-related potentials (ERPs) in time-frequency is proposed, and a robust classifier with feature clustering is developed to better utilize the correlated ERP features. The method is applied to EEG recordings of a RSVP experiment with multiple sessions and subjects. The results show that the target image events are mainly characterized by 3 distinct patterns in the time-frequency domain, i.e., a theta band (4.3 Hz) power boosting 300-700 ms after the target image onset, an alpha band (12 Hz) power boosting 500-1000 ms after the stimulus onset, and a delta band (2 Hz) power boosting after 500 ms. The most discriminant time-frequency features are power boosting and are relatively consistent among multiple sessions and subjects. Since the original discriminant time-frequency features are highly correlated, we constructed the uncorrelated features using hierarchical clustering for better classification of target and non-target images. With feature clustering, performance (area under ROC) improved from 0.85 to 0.89 on within-session tests, and from 0.76 to 0.84 on cross-subject tests. The constructed uncorrelated features were more robust than the original discriminant features and corresponded to a number of local regions on the time-frequency plane.

J	De Ville, DV; Lee, SW				De Ville, Dimitri Van; Lee, Seong-Whan			Brain decoding: Opportunities and challenges for pattern recognition	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Editorial Material						Brain decoding; Neuroimaging; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Electroencephalography; Brain-computer interface		The neuroimaging community heavily relies on statistical inference to explain measured brain activity given the experimental paradigm. Undeniably, this method has led to many results, but it is limited by the richness of the generative models that are deployed, typically in a mass-univariate way. Such an approach is suboptimal given the high-dimensional and complex spatiotemporal correlation structure of neuroimaging data. Over the recent years, techniques from pattern recognition have brought new insights into where and how information is stored in the brain by prediction of the stimulus or state from the data. Pattern recognition is intrinsically multivariate and the underlying models are data-driven. Moreover, the predictive setting is more powerful for many applications, including clinical diagnosis and brain-computer interfacing. This special issue features a number of papers that identify and tackle remaining challenges in this field. The specific problems at hand constitute opportunities for future research in pattern recognition and neurosciences. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Non-invasive BMI have the potential to improve the quality of life of many disabled individuals with safer operation. The non-invasive BMI using the functional functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) with the electroencephalogram (EEG) has potential applicability beyond the restoration of lost movement and rehabilitation in paraplegics and would enable normal individuals to have direct brain control of external devices in their daily lives. To shift stage of the non-invasive BMI from laboratory to clinical, the key factor is to develop high-accuracy signal decoding technology and highly restrictive of the measurement area. In this article, we present the development of a high-accuracy brain activity measurement system by combining fNIRS and EEG. The new fNIRS had high performances with high spatial resolution using double density technique and a large number of measurement channels to cover a whole human brain.

J	Pang, YW; Yuan, Y; Wang, KQ				Pang, Yanwei; Yuan, Yuan; Wang, Kongqiao			Learning optimal spatial filters by discriminant analysis for brain-computer-interface	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Neural interfaces; Brain-computer interfaces; Common spatial pattern; EEG; Discriminant analysis		Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) is one of the most widespread methods for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), which is capable of enhancing the separability of the brain signals such as multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG). CSP attempts to strengthen the separability by maximizing the variance of the spatially filtered signal of one class while minimizing it for another class. A straightforward way to improve the CSP is to employ the Fisher-Rao linear discriminant analysis (FLDA). But for the two-class scenario in BCI, FLDA merely result in as small as one filter. Experimental results have shown that the number of spatial filter is too small to achieve satisfying classification accuracy. Therefore, more than one filter is expected to get better performance. To deal with this difficulty, in this paper we propose to divide each class into many sub-classes (clusters) and formulate the problem in a re-designed graph embedding framework where the vertexes are cluster centers. We also reformulate the traditional FLDA in our graph embedding framework, which helps developing and understanding the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The approach is to construct an ordered symbolic language for smooth planar curves and to use these curves as desired paths for a mobile robot. The underlying problem is then to design a communication protocol by which the user can, with vanishing error probability, specify a string in this language using a sequence of inputs. Such a protocol, provided by tools from information theory, relies on a human user's ability to compare smooth curves, just like they can compare strings of text. We demonstrate our interface by performing experiments in which twenty subjects fly a simulated aircraft at a fixed speed and altitude with input only from EEG. Experimental results show that the majority of subjects are able to specify desired paths despite a wide range of errors made in decoding EEG signals.

FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						dual EEG; hyperscanning; social interaction; interpersonal analysis; decoding	INFORMATION; FMRI; SYNCHRONIZATION; COHERENCE; DYNAMICS; FLOW	Measuring brain activity simultaneously from two people interacting is intuitively appealing if one is interested in putative neural markers of social interaction. However, given the complex nature of interactions, it has proven difficult to carry out two-person brain imaging experiments in a methodologically feasible and conceptually relevant way. Only a small number of recent studies have put this into practice, using fMRI, EEG, or NIRS. Here, were view two main two-brain methodological approaches, each with two conceptual strategies. The first group has employed two-brain fMRI recordings, studying (1) turn-based interactions on the order of seconds, or (2) pseudo-interactive scenarios, where only one person is scanned at a time, investigating the flow of information between brains. The second group of studies has recorded dual EEG/NIRS from two people interacting, in (1) face-to-face turn-based interactions, investigating functional connectivity between theory of-mind regions of interacting partners, or in (2) continuous mutual interactions on millisecond timescales, to measure coupling between the activity in one person's brain and the activity in the other's brain. We discuss the questions these approaches have addressed, and consider scenarios when simultaneous two-brain recordings are needed. Furthermore, we suggest that (1) quantification of inter-personal neural effects via measures of emergence, and (2) multivariate decoding models that generalize source-specific features of interaction, may provide novel tools to study brains in interaction. This may allow for a better understanding of social cognition as both representation and participation.

Adaptive Laplacian filtering for sensorimotor rhythm-based brain-computer interfaces	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; AVERAGE REFERENCE; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; BCI; SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; MODEL; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE	Objective. Sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) are 8-30 Hz oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded from the scalp over sensorimotor cortex that change with movement and/or movement imagery. Many brain-computer interface (BCI) studies have shown that people can learn to control SMR amplitudes and can use that control to move cursors and other objects in one, two or three dimensions. At the same time, if SMR-based BCIs are to be useful for people with neuromuscular disabilities, their accuracy and reliability must be improved substantially. These BCIs often use spatial filtering methods such as common average reference (CAR), Laplacian (LAP) filter or common spatial pattern (CSP) filter to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of EEG. Here, we test the hypothesis that a new filter design, called an 'adaptive Laplacian (ALAP) filter', can provide better performance for SMR-based BCIs. Approach. An ALAP filter employs a Gaussian kernel to construct a smooth spatial gradient of channel weights and then simultaneously seeks the optimal kernel radius of this spatial filter and the regularization parameter of linear ridge regression. This optimization is based on minimizing the leave-one-out cross-validation error through a gradient descent method and is computationally feasible. Main results. Using a variety of kinds of BCI data from a total of 22 individuals, we compare the performances of ALAP filter to CAR, small LAP, large LAP and CSP filters. With a large number of channels and limited data, ALAP performs significantly better than CSP, CAR, small LAP and large LAP both in classification accuracy and in mean-squared error. Using fewer channels restricted to motor areas, ALAP is still superior to CAR, small LAP and large LAP, but equally matched to CSP. Significance. Thus, ALAP may help to improve the accuracy and robustness of SMR-based BCIs.

Exploration of Instantaneous Amplitude and Frequency Features for Epileptic Seizure Prediction	IEEE 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS & BIOENGINEERING	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering		English	Proceedings Paper	12th IEEE International Conference on BioInformatics and BioEngineering (BIBE)	NOV 11-13, 2012	Larnaca, CYPRUS	IEEE, Cyprus Presidency Council European Union, IEEE Comp Soc, Univ Cyprus, Biol & AI Fdn (BAIF), Frederick Univ, Hellen Soc Computat Biol & Bioinformat (HSCBB), Tech Univ Cyprus, IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (IEEE EMBS), Int Federat Med & Biol Engn (IFMBE)		Epileptic seizure prediction; electroencephalogram signal representation; instantaneous amplitude and frequency modulation features	INTRACRANIAL EEG; SYMPTOMS; SIGNAL	For the purpose of effective epileptic seizure prediction, this paper presents a new representation for the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal by recurring to their primary amplitude and frequency components. This formulation is then applied on an epoch-by-epoch basis to the preictal and interictal states of EEG signals in order to extract the most dominant amplitude and frequency characteristics. Through inspecting and identifying the distinctive EEG signal changes and stage transitions revealed by these extracted feature vectors, upcoming epileptic seizures could be predicted in due course. Machine learning approaches have been employed to construct patient-specific classifiers that can divide the extracted feature vectors into preictal and interictal groups. In this context, our work is distinguished from most currently adopted feature extraction process which employs time-consuming high-dimensional parameter sets. We have made special efforts to derive discriminative and comprehensive features for the front-end of the epileptic seizure prediction algorithm. To reduce false alarms due to trivial signal fluctuation, a simple yet effective post-processing step is incorporated thereafter. Performance of the prediction algorithm is assessed through out-of-sample evaluation on the intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings provided by the publicly available Freiburg data set. It has been shown by simulation results that the proposed feature estimation method leads to promising prediction results in terms of sensitivity and specificity. In particular, only four out of the 83 seizures across all the patients included in our experiment were missed by the prediction, which means that a sensitivity as high as 95.2% has been achieved.

Differentiating transformational and non-transformational leaders on the basis of neurological imaging	LEADERSHIP QUARTERLY			English	Article						Transformational leadership; Social cognitive neuroscience; Discriminant analysis	SPECTRAL EEG PARAMETERS; TRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP; COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; ROLE OCCUPANCY; BRAIN; COHERENCE; INTELLIGENCE; PERSONALITY; BEHAVIOR	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the viability of using neurological imaging to classify transformational leaders, versus non-transformational leaders, as identified through existing psychometric methods. Specifically, power spectral analysis measures based on electroencephalograms (EEG) were used to develop and validate a discriminant function that can classify individuals according to their transformational leadership behavior. Resting, eyes closed EEG was recorded from 19 scalp locations for 200 civilian and military leaders. We also assessed follower or peer perceptions of transformational leadership through the use of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ). Our discriminant analysis, which involved a two-step, neural variable reduction and selection process, was 92.5% accurate in its classification of leaders. Patterns in the spectral measures of the brain of leaders, including activity and network dynamic metrics, are discussed as potential correlates of transformational leadership behavior. The current work provides a better understanding of the latent and dynamic neurological mechanisms that may underpin the transformational leadership qualities of individuals. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Selection of the most similar mother wavelet function has been a challenge for the application of wavelet transform in signal processing. This paper introduces Daubechies 44 (db44) as the most similar mother wavelet function across a variety of biological signals. Three-hundred and twenty four potential mother wavelet functions were selected and investigated in the search for the most similar function. The algorithms were validated by three categories of biological signals: forearm electromyographic (EMG), electroencephalographic (EEG), and vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA). Surface and intramuscular EMG signals were collected from multiple locations on the upper forearm of subjects during ten hand motions. EEG was recorded from three monopolar Ag-AgCl electrodes (Pz, POz, and Oz) during visual stimulus presentation. VPA, a useful source for female sexuality research, were recorded during a study of alcohol and stimuli on sexual behaviors. In this research, after extensive studies on mother wavelet functions, results show that db44 has the most similarity across these classes of biosignals. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

An idea previously expressed, but as of yet not quantitatively tested, is that it is the LFC phase that is the main source of decodable information. To test this issue, we analyzed human ECoG recorded during a game-like, one-dimensional, continuous motor task with a novel decoding method suitable for unfolding magnitude and phase explicitly into a complex-valued, time-frequency signal representation, enabling quantification of the decodable information within the temporal, spatial and frequency domains and allowing disambiguation of the phase contribution from that of the spectral magnitude. The decoding accuracy based only on phase information was substantially (at least 2 fold) and significantly higher than that based only on magnitudes for position, velocity and acceleration. The frequency profile of movement-related information in the ECoG data matched well with the frequency profile expected when assuming a close time-domain correlate of movement velocity in the ECoG, e.g., a (noisy) "copy" of hand velocity. No such match was observed with the frequency profiles expected when assuming a copy of either hand position or acceleration. There was also no indication of additional magnitude-based mechanisms encoding movement information in the LFC range. Thus, our study contributes to elucidating the nature of the informative LFC of motor cortical population activity and may hence contribute to improve decoding strategies and BMI performance.

A first issue concerns the timing and place of rapid visual categorization and to what extent it can be performed with an early feed-forward pass of information through the visual system. A second issue involves the categorization of stimuli that do not reach visual awareness. There is disagreement over the degree to which these stimuli activate the same early mechanisms as stimuli that are consciously perceived. We employed continuous flash suppression (CFS), EEG recordings, and machine learning techniques to study visual categorization of seen and unseen stimuli. Our classifiers were able to predict from the EEG recordings the category of stimuli on seen trials but not on unseen trials. Rapid categorization of conscious images could be detected around 100 ms on the occipital electrodes, consistent with a fast, feed-forward mechanism of target detection. For the invisible stimuli, however, CFS eliminated all traces of early processing. Our results support the idea of a fast mechanism of categorization and suggest that this early categorization process plays an important role in later, more subtle categorizations, and perceptual processes	[Kaunitz, Lisandro Nicolas; Olivetti, Emanuele; Murphy, Brian; Avesani, Paolo; Melcher, David Paul] Univ Trento, Ctr Mind Brain Sci, Trento, Italy; [Kamienkowski, Juan Esteban] Univ Buenos Aires, Sch Exact & Nat Sci, Lab Integrat Neurosci, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Avesani, Paolo] Bruno Kessler Fdn, Neuroinformat Lab, Trento, Italy; [Melcher, David Paul] Univ Trento, Dept Cognit Sci, Rovereto, Italy		Kaunitz, LN (corresponding author), Univ Trento, Ctr Mind Brain Sci CIMeC, Via Regole 101, I-38060 Mattarello, TN, Italy.	lkaunitz@gmail.com	Olivetti, Emanuele/AAT-2384-2020; Avesani, Paolo/AAY-9704-2021; Melcher, David/D-1775-2010	Olivetti, Emanuele/0000-0001-7653-1519; Avesani, Paolo/0000-0001-8943-8911; Melcher, David/0000-0003-0926-585X; Kamienkowski, Juan Esteban/0000-0002-5725-6539					67	15	15	0	8	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND	1664-1078			FRONT PSYCHOL	Front.

But most of ICA-based BCI researches only used batch ICA algorithm as the offline preprocessing step for EEG artifact removal and pattern enhancement. This paper explored a new approach of applying online ICA based on sliding window Infomax algorithm for BCI implementation. In addition to having good performance of blind source separation as traditional ICA, the proposed method has the characteristics that can synchronously realize the online envelope detection of multi-channel signals, which is that other methods do not have, such as Hilbert transform. Then the online ICA is applied to the envelope detection of mu rhythm evoked by motor imagery and good classification results of imagining left and right hand movement are achieved on real-life data.

LDA assumes Gaussian distribution of the data, with equal covariance matrices for the concerned classes, however, the assumption is not usually held in actual BCI applications, where the heteroscedastic class distributions are usually observed. This paper proposes an enhanced version of LDA, namely z-score linear discriminant analysis (Z-LDA), which introduces a new decision boundary definition strategy to handle with the heteroscedastic class distributions. Z-LDA defines decision boundary through z-score utilizing both mean and standard deviation information of the projected data, which can adaptively adjust the decision boundary to fit for heteroscedastic distribution situation. Results derived from both simulation dataset and two actual BCI datasets consistently show that Z-LDA achieves significantly higher average classification accuracies than conventional LDA, indicating the superiority of the new proposed decision boundary definition strategy.

Combining these two kinds of information under a uniform feature extraction framework can better reflect the brain states and potentially contribute to BCI classification. Here the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and the Phase Locking Value (PLV) were used to capture the amplitude and the phase information. To integrate these two feature extraction procedures, the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is introduced in preprocessing which behaved as filter bank to optimize bands selection automatically for CSP and exactly calculate the instantaneous phase for PLV. The most discriminative features were selected from the feature pool by the sequential floating forward feature selection method (SFFS). The proposed method was applied to both public and recorded datasets (each n = 4). Compared with the traditional CSP, the average increment of classification accuracy is 5.4% (2.0% for public and 8.7% for recorded datasets), which both manifests statistically significances (p < 0.05). Moreover, we preliminarily investigate the possibility of the online realization of this method and it shows a comparable result with the offline result.

Study design A total of 56 newborns treated with hypothermia were monitored using video electroencephalography through cooling and rewarming, and then imaged at a median of 5 days. The electroencephalograms were reviewed for indications of seizure and status epilepticus. Moderate-severe injury detected on magnetic resonance imaging was measured using a classification scheme similar to one predicting abnormal outcome in an analogous population. Results Seizures were recorded in 17 newborns (30%), 5 with status epilepticus. Moderate-severe injury was more common in newborns with seizures (relative risk, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-4.5; P = .02), and was present in all 5 newborns with status epilepticus. Newborns with moderate-severe injury had seizures that were multifocal and of later onset, and they were more likely to experience recurrent seizures after treatment with 20 mg/kg phenobarbital. Newborns with only subclinical seizures were as likely to have injury as those with seizures with a clinical correlate (57% vs 60%). Conclusion Seizures represent a risk factor for brain injury in the setting of therapeutic hypothermia, especially in neonates with status epilepticus, multifocal-onset seizures, and a need for multiple medications. However, 40% of our neonates were spared from brain injury, suggesting that the outcome after seizures is not uniformly poor in children treated with therapeutic hypothermia.

Neurophysiological tests and neuroimaging procedures in non-acute headache (2nd edition)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						autonomic tests; clinical tests; electroencephalography; EMG; evoked potentials; guidelines; neuroimaging; non-acute headache; pain threshold; reflex responses; SPECT and PET; total tenderness score; transcranial Doppler	QUALITY STANDARDS SUBCOMMITTEE; TENSION-TYPE HEADACHE; REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROME; AMERICAN-ACADEMY; PRACTICE PARAMETER; QUANTITATIVE EEG; MIGRAINE; GUIDELINES; TOMOGRAPHY; NEUROLOGY	Background and purpose: A large number of instrumental investigations are used in patients with non-acute headache in both research and clinical fields. Although the literature has shown that most of these tools contributed greatly to increasing understanding of the pathogenesis of primary headache, they are of little or no value in the clinical setting. Methods: This paper provides an update of the 2004 EFNS guidelines and recommendations for the use of neurophysiological tools and neuroimaging procedures in non-acute headache (first edition). Even though the period since the publication of the first edition has seen an increase in the number of published papers dealing with this topic, the updated guidelines contain only minimal changes in the levels of evidence and grades of recommendation. Results: (i) Interictal EEG is not routinely indicated in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with headache. Interictal EEG is, however, indicated if the clinical history suggests a possible diagnosis of epilepsy (differential diagnosis). Ictal EEG could be useful in certain patients suffering from hemiplegic or basilar migraine. (ii) Recording evoked potentials is not recommended for the diagnosis of headache disorders. (iii) There is no evidence warranting recommendation of reflex responses or autonomic tests for the routine clinical examination of patients with headache. (iv) Manual palpation of pericranial muscles, with standardized palpation pressure, can be recommended for subdividing patient groups but not for diagnosis. Pain threshold measurements and EMG are not recommended as clinical diagnostic tests. (v) In adult and pediatric patients with migraine, with no recent change in attack pattern, no history of seizures, and no other focal neurological symptoms or signs, the routine use of neuroimaging is not warranted. In patients with trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia, neuroimaging should be carefully considered and may necessitate additional scanning of intracranial/cervical vasculature and/or the sellar/orbital/(para) nasal region. In patients with atypical headache patterns, a history of seizures and/or focal neurological symptoms or signs, MRI may be indicated. (vi) If attacks can be fully accounted for by the standard headache classification (IHS), a PET or SPECT scan will normally be of no further diagnostic value. Nuclear medical examinations of the cerebral circulation and metabolism can be carried out in subgroups of patients with headache for the diagnosis and evaluation of complications, when patients experience unusually severe attacks or when the quality or severity of attacks has changed. (vii) Transcranial Doppler examination is not helpful in headache diagnosis. Conclusion: Although many of the examinations described in the present guidelines are of little or no value in the clinical setting, most of the tools, including thermal pain thresholds and transcranial magnetic stimulation, have considerable potential for differential diagnostic evaluation as well as for the further exploration of headache pathophysiology and the effects of pharmacological treatment.

J	Winkler, I; Haufe, S; Tangermann, M				Winkler, Irene; Haufe, Stefan; Tangermann, Michael			Automatic Classification of Artifactual ICA-Components for Artifact Removal in EEG Signals	BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS			English	Article							OCULAR ARTIFACT; BRAIN; IDENTIFICATION; SLEEP; EMG	Background: Artifacts contained in EEG recordings hamper both, the visual interpretation by experts as well as the algorithmic processing and analysis (e. g. for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) or for Mental State Monitoring). While hand-optimized selection of source components derived from Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to clean EEG data is widespread, the field could greatly profit from automated solutions based on Machine Learning methods. Existing ICA-based removal strategies depend on explicit recordings of an individual's artifacts or have not been shown to reliably identify muscle artifacts. Methods: We propose an automatic method for the classification of general artifactual source components. They are estimated by TDSEP, an ICA method that takes temporal correlations into account. The linear classifier is based on an optimized feature subset determined by a Linear Programming Machine (LPM). The subset is composed of features from the frequency-, the spatial- and temporal domain. A subject independent classifier was trained on 640 TDSEP components (reaction time (RT) study, n = 12) that were hand labeled by experts as artifactual or brain sources and tested on 1080 new components of RT data of the same study. Generalization was tested on new data from two studies (auditory Event Related Potential (ERP) paradigm, n = 18; motor imagery BCI paradigm, n = 80) that used data with different channel setups and from new subjects. Results: Based on six features only, the optimized linear classifier performed on level with the inter-expert disagreement (<10% Mean Squared Error (MSE)) on the RT data. On data of the auditory ERP study, the same pre-calculated classifier generalized well and achieved 15% MSE. On data of the motor imagery paradigm, we demonstrate that the discriminant information used for BCI is preserved when removing up to 60% of the most artifactual source components. Conclusions: We propose a universal and efficient classifier of ICA components for the subject independent removal of artifacts from EEG data. Based on linear methods, it is applicable for different electrode placements and supports the introspection of results. Trained on expert ratings of large data sets, it is not restricted to the detection of eye-and muscle artifacts. Its performance and generalization ability is demonstrated on data of different EEG studies.

David; Robbins, Kay			DETECT: A MATLAB Toolbox for Event Detection and Identification in Time Series, with Applications to Artifact Detection in EEG Signals	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM	Recent advances in sensor and recording technology have allowed scientists to acquire very large time-series datasets. Researchers often analyze these datasets in the context of events, which are intervals of time where the properties of the signal change relative to a baseline signal. We have developed DETECT, a MATLAB toolbox for detecting event time intervals in long, multi-channel time series. Our primary goal is to produce a toolbox that is simple for researchers to use, allowing them to quickly train a model on multiple classes of events, assess the accuracy of the model, and determine how closely the results agree with their own manual identification of events without requiring extensive programming knowledge or machine learning experience. As an illustration, we discuss application of the DETECT toolbox for detecting signal artifacts found in continuous multi-channel EEG recordings and show the functionality of the tools found in the toolbox. We also discuss the application of DETECT for identifying irregular heartbeat waveforms found in electrocardiogram ( ECG) data as an additional illustration.

The classification of the International League Against Epilepsy does not refer to this type of disorder, while the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2) defines three kinds of association: 1. migraine-triggered seizure ("migralepsy"), 2. hemicrania epileptica, and 3. post-ictal headache. Methods: We performed an extensive review of the literature, not including "post-ictal" and "inter-ictal" headaches. Results: On the basis of well-documented reports, the following clinical entities may be identified: (A) "epileptic headache (EH)" or "ictal epileptic headache (IEH)": in this condition headache (with or without migrainous features) is an epileptic manifestation per se, with onset, and cessation if isolated, coinciding with the scalp or deep EEG pattern of an epileptic seizure. EH maybe followed by other epileptic manifestations (motor/sensory/autonomic); this condition should be differentiated from "pure" or "isolated" EH, in which headache/migraine is the sole epileptic manifestation (requiring differential diagnosis from other headache forms). "Hemicrania epileptica" (if confirmed) is a very rare variant of EH, characterized by ipsilateral location of headache and ictal EEG paroxysms. (B) "Pre-ictal migraine" and "pre-ictal headache": when a headache attack is followed during, or shortly after, by a typical epileptic seizure. The migraine attack may be with or without aura, and its seizure-triggering role ("migraine-triggered seizure") is still a subject of debate. A differentiation from occipital epilepsy is mandatory. The term "migralepsy" has not been used uniformly, and may therefore led to misinterpretation. Conclusions: On the basis of this review we suggest definitions and a terminology which may become the basis of a forthcoming classification of headaches associated with epileptic seizures.

Different types of mental tasks have been used in BCI including left, right, foot, and tongue motor imageries. However, the mental tasks are different from the actions to be controlled by the BCI. It is desirable to select a mental task to be consistent with the desired action to be performed by BCI. In this paper, we investigated the detecting the imagination of the hand grasping, hand opening, and hand reaching in one hand using electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. The results show that the ERD/ERS patterns, associated with the imagination of hand grasping, opening, and reaching are different. For classification of brain signals associated with these mental tasks and feature extraction, a method based on wavelet packet, regularized common spatial pattern (CSP), and mutual information is proposed. The results of an offline analysis on five subjects show that the two-class mental tasks can be classified with an average accuracy of 77.6% using proposed method. In addition, we examine the proposed method on datasets IVa from BCI Competition III and IIa from BCI Competition IV.

Being able to perform such a prediction paves the way to high-degree precision command for a machine such as a robotic arm or robotic hands. As a witness of the BCI community increasing interest toward such a problem, the fourth BCI Competition provides a dataset which aim is to predict individual finger movements from ECoG signals. The difficulty of the problem relies on the fact that there is no simple relation between ECoG signals and finger movements. We propose in this paper, to estimate and decode these finger flexions using switching models controlled by an hidden state. Switching models can integrate prior knowledge about the decoding problem and helps in predicting fine and precise movements. Our model is thus based on a first block which estimates which finger is moving and another block which, knowing which finger is moving, predicts the movements of all other fingers. Numerical results that have been submitted to the Competition show that the model yields high decoding performances when the hidden state is well estimated. This approach achieved the second place in the BCI competition with a correlation measure between real and predicted movements of 0.42.

Technological development makes it possible to massproduce cheap sensors for personal use. The data collected provide objective and comprehensive personal health information. In this paper, we report our preliminary findings in applying modern information technology to personal healthcare systems. We are constructing a brain activity level model by using EEG signals to objectively measure the effectiveness of meditation, detect mental fatigue and boredom, and comprehend human emotions. Also we have used accelerometer and GPS data to assess sports performance and training enhancement, lower limb injury prevention and recovery monitoring, and falls prevention for aged people.

Models based on spiking neural networks (SNN) have already proved their potential in capturing spatial and temporal data. One class of them, the evolving SNN (eSNN), uses a one-pass rank-order learning mechanism and a strategy to evolve a new spiking neuron and new connections to learn new patterns from incoming data. So far these networks have been mainly used for fast image and speech frame-based recognition. Alternative spike-time learning methods, such as Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and its variant Spike Driven Synaptic Plasticity (SDSP), can also be used to learn spatio-temporal representations, but they usually require many iterations in an unsupervised or semi-supervised mode of learning. This paper introduces a new class of eSNN, dynamic eSNN, that utilise both rank-order learning and dynamic synapses to learn SSTD in a fast, on-line mode. The paper also introduces a new model called deSNN, that utilises rank-order learning and SDSP spike-time learning in unsupervised, supervised, or semi-supervised modes. The SDSP learning is used to evolve dynamically the network changing connection weights that capture spatio-temporal spike data clusters both during training and during recall. The new deSNN model is first illustrated on simple examples and then applied on two case study applications: (1) moving object recognition using address-event representation (AER) with data collected using a silicon retina device; (2) EEG SSTD recognition for brain-computer interfaces. The deSNN models resulted in a superior performance in terms of accuracy and speed when compared with other SNN models that use either rank-order or STDP learning. The reason is that the deSNN makes use of both the information contained in the order of the first input spikes (which information is explicitly present in input data streams and would be crucial to consider in some tasks) and of the information contained in the timing of the following spikes that is learned by the dynamic synapses as a whole spatio-temporal pattern.

However, most of the research has focused on the computer side of BCI, such as developing powerful machine-learning algorithms, while less research has focused on investigating how BCI users may optimally adapt. This paper assesses the influences of positive and negative visual feedback on motor imagery (MI) skills by evaluating the performance. More precisely, a MI based BCI paradigm was employed with fake visual feedback, regardless of subjects' real performance. Subjects were exposed to two experimental conditions -one positive and one negative, in which 80% or 30% of the trials were associated with positive feedback, respectively. The main EEG feature for MI-BCI classification -the asymmetry of mu-rhythm between hemispheres- was more prominent only after the negative feedback session. In addition, the negative feedback condition was accompanied by larger heart rate variability compared to the positive feedback condition. Our results suggest that visual feedback is an important aspect to take into account when designing BCI skill acquisition sessions.

J	Vecchierini, MF				Vecchierini, M-F			Sleep: Regulation and phenomenology	REVUE DES MALADIES RESPIRATOIRES			French	Article						Sleep; Regulation; Homeostatic; Circadian process; Clinical phenomenology	VALUES; STATES; SLOW; CAP; EEG	This article describes the two-process model of steep regulation. The 24-hour sleep-wake cycle is regulated by a homeostatic process and an endogenous, 2 oscillators, circadian process, under the influence of external synchronisers. These two processes are partially independent but influence each other, as shown in the two-sleep-process auto-regulation model. A reciprocal inhibition model of two interconnected neuronal groups, "SP on" and "SP off", explains the regular recurrence of paradoxical sleep. Sleep studies have primarily depended on observation of the subject and have determined the optimal conditions for sleep (position, external conditions, sleep duration and need) and have studied the consequences of sleep deprivation or modifications of steep schedules. Then, electrophysiological recordings permitted the classification of sleep stages according to the observed EEG patterns. The course of a night's sleep is reported on a "hypnogram". The adult subject falls asleep in non-REM sleep (N1), then sleep deepens progressively to stages N2 and N3 with the appearance of spindles and slow waves (N2). Slow waves become more numerous in stage N3. Every 90 minutes REM sleep recurs, with muscle atonia and rapid eye movements. These adult sleep patterns develop progressively during the 2 first years of life as total sleep duration decreases, with the reduction of diurnal sleep and of REM sleep. Around 2 to 4 months, spindles and K complexes appear on the EEG, with the differentiation of light and deep sleep with, however, a predominance of slow wave sleep. (C) 2013 SPLF.

In order to properly decode the electroencephalographic (EEG) brain signals, the BCI needs to adapt to the subject via calibration to ensure stable performance. One of the major challenges in realization of the EEG signals is the long calibration time required since they show significant variations between recording sessions even for the same subject within the same experimental condition. This paper proposes a score-based adaptive training algorithm that maximally utilizes relevant information from prior recording sessions and significantly shortens the calibration time. Also the proposed method is suitable to develop real-time, wearable, and low-power BCI embedded devices. The BCI developed in this work is based on the P300 word speller application introduced by Farwell and Donchin in 1988. The experimental results show that by employing few letters for calibration, the proposed adaptive training algorithm can achieve 100% classification accuracy.

Decoding Attended Information in Short-term Memory: An EEG Study	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RETENTION; ACCESS; FOCUS; DYNAMICS; STORAGE; STATES	For decades it has been assumed that sustained, elevated neural activity-the so-called active trace-is the neural correlate of the short-term retention of information. However, a recent fMRI study has suggested that this activity may be more related to attention than to retention. Specifically, a multivariate pattern analysis failed to find evidence that information that was outside the focus of attention, but nonetheless in STM, was retained in an active state. Here, we replicate and extend this finding by querying the neural signatures of attended versus unattended information within STM with electroencephalograpy (EEG), a method sensitive to oscillatory neural activity to which the previous fMRI study was insensitive. We demonstrate that in the delay-period EEG activity, there is information only about memory items that are also in the focus of attention. Information about items outside the focus of attention is not detectable. This result converges with the fMRI findings to suggest that, contrary to conventional wisdom, an active memory trace may be unnecessary for the short-term retention of information.

These abnormal balances are likely to result in loss of functional connectivities between remote brain structures, while functional connectivities within the incriminated zone are enhanced. The identification of the epileptic networks underlying these hyper-synchronies are expected to contribute to a better understanding of the brain mechanisms responsible for the development of the seizures. In this objective, threshold strategies are commonly applied, based on synchrony measurements computed from recordings of the electrophysiologic brain activity. However, such methods are reported to be prone to errors and false alarms. In this paper, we propose a hidden Markov chain modeling of the synchrony states with the aim to develop a reliable machine learning methods for epileptic network inference. The method is applied on a real Stereo-EEG recording, demonstrating consistent results with the clinical evaluations and with the current knowledge on temporal lobe epilepsy.

Abnormal low-gamma activity, hypothesized to reflect impaired synchronization, has been evidenced in several brain disorders. Thus, understanding the relations between gamma oscillations, neuronal synchrony and behavior is a major research challenge. We used a brain-machine interface (BMI) to train monkeys to specifically increase low-gamma power in selected sites of motor cortex to move a cursor and obtain a reward. The monkeys learned to robustly generate oscillatory gamma waves, which were accompanied by a dramatic increase of spiking synchrony of highly precise spatiotemporal patterns. The findings link volitional control of LFP oscillations, neuronal synchrony, and the behavioral outcome. Subjects' ability to directly modulate specific patterns of neuronal synchrony provides a powerful approach for understanding neuronal processing in relation to behavior and for the use of BMIs in a clinical setting.

By making a comparison with a control-state in the form of a classification problem, we can detect and quantify the changes in coordinated brain activity in terms of functional connectivity. The interactions are quantified at the level of EEG sensors through descriptors that differ over the nature of functional dependencies sought (linear vs. nonlinear) and over the specific form of the measures employed (amplitude/phase covariation). Functional connectivity graphs (FCGs) are analysed with a novel clustering algorithm, and the resulting segregations enter an appropriate discriminant function. The magnitude of the contrast function depends on the frequency-band (0, alpha(1), alpha(2), beta and gamma) and the neural synchrony descriptor. We first show that the maximal-contrast corresponds to a phase coupling descriptor and then identify the corresponding spatial patterns that represent best the task-induced changes for each frequency band. The principal finding of this study is that, during mental calculations, phase synchrony plays a crucial role in the segregation into distinct functional domains, and this segregation is the most prominent feature of the brain's self-organisation as this is reflected in sensor space.

Material and methods: We analyzed the charts of forty-two patients who met the diagnostic criteria of MTLE-HS. The mean follow-up after seizure onset was 10.5 years. Results: According to age, we defined three groups. The first group included nine patients that started with seizures before 2 years of age. Motor seizures were the hallmark clinical manifestation. All patients of this group also presented with motor arrest and oro-alimentary automatisms. In three of them, the interictal EEG recordings showed bilateral paroxysms predominantly in anterior regions, in addition to focal abnormalities, and two had an apparently generalized ictal pattern. The second group included 17 patients that started with seizures between 2 and 10 years of age. In this group the automatisms were also oroalimentary, but more complex and the patients had less motor manifestations. The interictal EEG recordings showed temporal abnormalities. The ictal EEG recordings showed lateralized abnormalities with a maximum in the temporal electrodes. The third group included 16 patients that started with seizures between 10 and 16 years of age. The most common clinical manifestation was abdominal aura followed by oroalimentary, gestural, and verbal automatisms. The interictal and ictal EEG recordings showed well-localized abnormalities in temporal lobes. Thirty-eight patients underwent surgical treatment. Thirty-five patients are seizure free. Conclusion: MTLE-HS represents a well-defined and distinct symptomatic epileptic syndrome. Surgical treatment was successful in most patients. (C) 2010 British Epilepsy Association.

Thus early identification of chemicals with seizure liability using rapid and cheaper approaches would be preferable. In this study, an optimal support vector machine (SVM) modeling method has been employed to develop a prediction model of seizure liability of chemicals. A set of 680 compounds were used to train the SVM model. The established SVM model was then validated by an independent test set comprising 175 compounds, which gave a prediction accuracy of 86.9%. Further, the SVM-based prediction model of seizure liability was compared with various preclinical seizure assays, including in vitro rat hippocampal brain slice, in vivo zebrafish larvae assay, mouse spontaneous seizure model, and mouse EEG model. In terms of predictability, the SVM model was ranked just behind the mouse EEG model, but better than the rat brain slice and zebrafish models. Nevertheless, the SVM model has considerable advantages compared with the preclinical seizure assays in speed and cost. In summary, the SVM-based prediction model of seizure liability established here offers potential as a cheaper, rapid and accurate assessment of seizure liability of drugs, which could be used in the seizure risk assessment at the early stage of drug discovery.

A robust sensor-selection method for P300 brain-computer interfaces	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MENTAL PROSTHESIS; CHANNEL SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; MOVEMENT; PEOPLE	A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a specific type of human-computer interface that enables direct communication between human and computer through decoding of brain activity. As such, event-related potentials like the P300 can be obtained with an oddball paradigm whose targets are selected by the user. This paper deals with methods to reduce the needed set of EEG sensors in the P300 speller application. A reduced number of sensors yields more comfort for the user, decreases installation time duration, may substantially reduce the financial cost of the BCI setup and may reduce the power consumption for wireless EEG caps. Our new approach to select relevant sensors is based on backward elimination using a cost function based on the signal to signal-plus-noise ratio, after some spatial filtering. We show that this cost function selects sensors' subsets that provide a better accuracy in the speller recognition rate during the test sessions than selected subsets based on classification accuracy. We validate our selection strategy on data from 20 healthy subjects.

Treatment for all these problems requires accurate analysis of the sleep stages and patterns in the polysomno graphic signals collected in overnight recording over several months. However, manual sleep staging is a repetitive and time-consuming process as marking one typical eight hours overnight polysomnographic recording can take up to two hours to complete. Due to increased processing capabilities, it is now possible to automate this process and assist the sleep expert. A large number of algorithms have been proposed during the last few decades. This review article presents an overview of the existing automatic sleep staging methods, discusses the different challenges and proposes future prospects for new research opportunities.

We propose to select the most correlated channels by jointly considering the mutual information between the LAD power features of the channels and the class labels, and the redundancy between the LAD power features of the channel with that of the selected channels. Experiments are conducted on the EEG data collected for 11 healthy subjects using proposed method and compared with existing methods. The results show that the proposed method yielded an average classification accuracy of 67.19% by selecting as few as 4 LAD channels. An improved result of 71.45% and 73.23% are achieved by selecting 10 and 22 LAD channels, respectively. Comparison results revealed significantly superior performance of our proposed method compared to that obtained using common spatial pattern and filter bank with power features. Most importantly, our proposed method achieves significant better accuracy for poor BCI performers compared to existing methods. Thus, the results demonstrated the potential of using the proposed method for detecting motor imagery of walking for the rehabilitation of stroke patients.

In general, such trained systems are highly specialized to the subject's characteristic activation patterns and cannot be used for other sessions or subjects. This paper presents a feature space transformation that transforms features generated using subject-specific spatial filters into a subject-independent feature space. The transformation can be estimated from little adaptation data of the subject. Furthermore, we combine three different Common Spatial Pattern based feature extraction approaches using decision-level fusion, which enables BCI use when little calibration data is available, but also outperformed the subject- dependent reference approaches for larger amounts of training data.

The double generalization phenomenon in juvenile absence epilepsy	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Juvenile absence epilepsy; Generalized epilepsy; Focal findings; Electroencephalogram; Diagnosis; Absence epilepsy; Classification	VIDEO-EEG; SEIZURES; ILAE	The characterization of a seizure as generalized or focal onset depends on a basic knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology. Recently, an uncommon phenomenon in generalized epilepsy evolution of seizures from generalized to focal followed by secondary generalization was reported for the first time. We describe a 15-year-old boy, initially classified as having partial epilepsy, who had a typical absence seizure that became focal with second secondary generalization (double generalization). On the basis of these findings his epilepsy was classified as juvenile absence epilepsy and his treatment was changed, resulting in seizure freedom. This is the first report of this unusual electroclinical evolution in a patient with juvenile absence epilepsy. The recognition of this particular pattern allows correct classification and impacts both treatment and prognosis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The Phase Lag Index (PLI), a linear and nonlinear estimator, computed for each pair of sensors, was used to construct graphs and obtain estimates of local and global network efficiency according to graph theory. In the 8-13 Hz (alpha band) and 20-30 Hz (gamma band) range, RD students showed significantly lower global efficiency than NI children, for the entire MEG recording epoch. RD students also displayed reduced local network efficiency in the alpha band. Correlations between phonological decoding ability and graph metrics were particularly evident during the task that posed significant demands for phonological decoding, and followed distinct time courses depending on signal frequency. Results are consistent with the notion of task-dependent, aberrant long- and short-range functional connectivity in RD children. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

ElectroMyoGram(EMG), ElectroOculoGram(EOG), ElectroEncephaloGram(EEG) are typical important bio-signals for u-health care. In this paper, we approach the EMG signals from electrodes placed on the forearm and recognizes the four kinds of motion. We also develops the prototype of a u-health device controller that controls hardware devices using EMG signal. To analyze EMG with properties of non-stationary signal, time-frequency features are extracted by wavelet packet transform. For dimensionality reduction and nonlinear mapping of the features. We proposes a feature projection method composed of PCA and SVM. The dimensionality reduction simplifies the structure of the classifier, and reduces processing time for the pattern recognition. The nonlinear mapping using SVM transforms the PCA-reduced features to a new feature space with a highly class separatability. SVM is a pattern classifier to recognize various motions. We finally show the experimental results using the proposed method enhances the accuracy of pattern recognition.

This channel is commonly used to provide direct and active input to the robot, resulting in a tele-operation system. We argue in favor of a more passive brain-machine interface as a means for human-robot interaction. There, the brain signals of the human interaction partner are constantly monitored and decoded to detect particular states that correlate with events in the robot's behavior. Such a state can be surprise due to a strange or erroneous robot action. We review three studies that we conducted with our own EEG-based brain-robot interface framework. The interface is active, that is, we directly control humanoid robots in different application scenarios in a semi-autonomous manner. Our results show that automated and unconscious components in the EEG are the most robust and acceptable for the user. These are exactly the components that are useful for a passive interface. Finally, we present a pilot study where we extract correlates of human surprise from an interaction with a real humanoid robot. We show that, currently in offline analysis, we are able to extract similar components used in the structured, stimulus based active interfaces. We pinpoint the issues that need to be solved, such as a more reliable real-time decoding of brain signals from real-world interaction situations.

The main focus of this paper is to quantitatively classify the ADHD and BMD patients using their Visual Evoke Potential (VEP) features elicited from their Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Methods and materials: In this study, 36 subjects were participated including 12 healthy ones, 12 patients with ADHD and 12 ones with BMD. The age of ADHD patients was 16.92 +/- 6.29 and for the BMD ones was 17.85 +/- 3.68. Their scalp EEG signals in the presence of visual stimulus were recorded using 22 silver electrodes located according to the 10-20 international recording protocol. To extract their VEP, first a preprocessing step was executed to remove the power line and movement artifacts. Afterward, the wavelet denoising and synchronous averaging were applied to the preprocessed trials in order to elicit the P100 component. To obtain interpretable features from the evoked patterns, amplitude and latency were extracted and applied to the 1-Nearest Neighbor (INN) classifier due to the locally scattered distribution of the VEP features. Results: The evaluation was performed according to leave-one(subject)-out method and the experimental results were led to 92.85% classification accuracy which is a fairly promising achievement to distinguish the BMD, ADHD, and healthy subjects from each other. Conclusion: From the physiological point of view, this result point out to the existence of significant difference in the neural activities of their visual system in the ADHD, BMD, and healthy subjects in response to a periodic optical stimulus.

To enhance the performance of a BCI, it is necessary to improve the feature extraction techniques being applied to decode the users' intentions. Objective comparison methods are needed to analyze different feature extraction techniques. One possibility is to use the classifier performance as a comparative measure. In this paper, we study the behavior of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) when used to distinguish between electroencephalographic (EEG) signals with and without the presence of event related potentials (ERPs).

The AASM Scoring Manual Four Years Later	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Review						Sleep scoring parameters; AASM standard; polysomnography/classification/standards; practice guidelines as topic sleep apnea; practice guidelines as topic sleep scoring	CYCLIC ALTERNATING PATTERN; PERIODIC LEG MOVEMENTS; SLOW-WAVE ACTIVITY; EEG CHANGES; INTERRATER RELIABILITY; SLEEP CLASSIFICATION; ELECTRODE PLACEMENT; RESPIRATORY EVENTS; TIME STRUCTURE; UPPER AIRWAY	Purpose of Review: Review published studies and critiques which evaluate the impact and effects of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) Sleep Scoring Manual in the four years since its publication. Findings: Using the AASM Manual rules to score sleep and events in a polysomnogram (PSG) results in: (1) very large differences in apnea-hypopnea indexes (AHI) when using the recommended and alternative rule for scoring hypopneas in adults; (2) increases in NREM 1 and sleep stage shifts with compensatory decreases in NREM 2 in children and adults when following rule 5.C.b. for ending NREM 2 sleep; (3) increases in NREM 3 in adults scoring slow wave activity in the frontal EEG derivations; (4) improved interscorer reliability; and (5) successfully identified fragmented sleep in children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) from primary snorers or normal controls because they had more NREM 1 and stage shifts using rule 5.C.b. Criticism of the Manual most often cited: (1) two rules for scoring hypopneas; (2) alternative EEG montage cancellation effects; (3) scoring stages 3 and 4 as NREM 3; and (4) too few rules for scoring arousals and REM sleep without atonia. Summary: Four years have passed since the AASM Scoring Manual was published with far less criticism than those who developed it feared. The AASM Manual provides a foundation upon which we all can build rules and methods which identify the complexity of sleep and its disorders.

Cognitive impairment is, however, difficult to detect. Apart from the traditional features used in P300 experiments (e. g. amplitude and latency at different electrodes), we want to investigate the value of network-features on the classification of MS patients as cognitively intact or impaired. We included 305 MS patients, recruited at the National MS Center Melsbroek (Belgium). About half of them was denoted cognitively impaired (143). We divided this patient group in a training set (on which we used 10-fold crossvalidation) and an independent test set. Results are reported on this last group to increase the generalizability. We found the correlations linking electrodes from one hemisphere with the other significantly different between the two groups MS patients. Especially in the parietal region this difference was very significant (1.5e(-12)). Using a simple cutoff on this variable, lead to a Percentage Correctly Classified (PCC) of 0.70 and an Area Under Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) of 0.76. The network parameters that were calculated showed a comparable result for the total number of edges included in the network. Combining these features in a logistic regression model, artificial neural networks or Naive Bayes resulted in a PCC's of 0.68-0.70. These results support the recent suggestion that cognitive dysfunction in MS is caused by a disconnection mechanism in the cerebellum. We have obtained these results applying graph theoretical analyses on EEG data instead of the more common fMRI-analyses. The classification accuracy obtained is, however, not yet sufficient for application in clinical practice.

Automated determination of wakefulness and sleep in rats based on non-invasively acquired measures of movement and respiratory activity	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Automated sleep scoring; Non-invasive; Movement and respiratory activity; Doppler radar; Support vector machine	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DOPPLER-SHIFT RADAR; HOME CAGE ACTIVITY; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; PRACTICE PARAMETERS; STRAIN DIFFERENCES; MICE; WAKE; EEG; CLASSIFICATION	The current standard for monitoring sleep in rats requires labor intensive surgical procedures and the implantation of chronic electrodes which have the potential to impact behavior and sleep. With the goal of developing a non-invasive method to determine sleep and wakefulness, we constructed a non-contact monitoring system to measure movement and respiratory activity using signals acquired with pulse Doppler radar and from digitized video analysis. A set of 23 frequency and time-domain features were derived from these signals and were calculated in 10 s epochs. Based on these features, a classification method for automated scoring of wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) and REM in rats was developed using a support vector machine (SVM). We then assessed the utility of the automated scoring system in discriminating wakefulness and sleep by comparing the results to standard scoring of wakefulness and sleep based on concurrently recorded EEG and EMG. Agreement between SVM automated scoring based on selected features and visual scores based on EEG and EMG were approximately 91% for wakefulness, 84% for NREM and 70% for REM. The results indicate that automated scoring based on non-invasively acquired movement and respiratory activity will be useful for studies requiring discrimination of wakefulness and sleep. However, additional information or signals will be needed to improve discrimination of NREM and REM episodes within sleep. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper presented a novel method named cultural-based MOPSO (CMOPSO) for channel selection in motor imagery based BCI. The CMOPSO method introduces a cultural framework to adapt the personalized flight parameters of the mutated particles. A comparison between the proposed algorithm and typical L1-norm algorithm was conducted, and the results showed that the proposed approach is more effective in selecting a smaller subset of channels while maintaining the classification accuracy unreduced.

This paper proposes an unsupervised method to detecting and classifying spikes in the reconstructed phase space. The spikes detected by adaptive energy threshold are transformed to two-dimensional phase space trajectories and are then quantified by the major trajectory radius curves. These curves serve as specific features to classify the detected spikes. Our results showed that the topological mapping of the classified spikes could be potential for finding the locations of epileptic foci.

This research deals with decoding the informational content of the brain processing via its physiological parameters. Such studies are based on rather complicated methods of mathematical analysis. Single records rather than averaged data are used to reveal their content. Three main streams of studies are distinguished, i.e. the object classification, the emotion recognition and brainotyping. Particularly, the studies directed to recognizing the type of thinking via EEG spectra, carried out in the author's laboratory, are reviewed. The possible outcome of the brain reading technique is considered. Finally it is argued that in the future, the broad application of this technique needs to be controlled with some ethical rules.

It is very important that the classifiers have the ability for discriminating signals which are recorded in different sessions to make brain computer interfaces practical in use. This paper proposes a method for classifying motor imagery electrocorticogram signals recorded in different sessions. Extracted feature vectors based on wavelet transform were classified by using k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine and linear discriminant analysis algorithms. The proposed method was successfully applied to Data Set I of BCI competition 2005, and achieved a classification accuracy of 94 % on the test data. The performance of the proposed method was confirmed in terms of sensitivity, specificity and Kappa and compared with that of other studies used the same data set. This paper is an extended version of our work that won the Best Paper Award at the 33rd International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing.

Acute ischemic stroke brainwave classification using relative power ratio cluster analysis	9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COGNITIVE SCIENCE	Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Cognitive Science	AUG 27-30, 2013	Kuching, MALAYSIA	Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Int Assoc Cognit Sci		stroke; EEG; power spectral density; power ratio; cluster analysis	EEG	This study proposed the application of cluster analysis to classify the brainwaves of stroke level based on the Relative Power Ratio (RPR) techniques. RPR was performed to determine the brainwave characteristics due to group of stroke level. In this research, we determined seventy four stroke patients brainwave activity with open eyes (OE) session. Then group them into Advance Group (AG), Intermediate Group (IG) and Early Group (EG). Simultaneously, their Electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded from which the EEG dataset will be calculated using the RPR formula. Beta, Alpha, Theta and Delta Power Spectrum Density (PSD) are used as input for RPR. The results show that by implementing RPR technique, the pattern of group stroke level, especially in the cognitive or thinking abilities can be clearly observed. Then cluster analysis using a factorial ANOVA (analysis of variance) design with factors Group will be deployed to cluster RPR towards the corresponding group of stroke level. It can be concluded that the AG are higher in the cluster 1 for RPR Beta (RPRB) while IG and EG were grouped together because they do not differ from each other in cluster 2. For RPR Alpha (RPRA), EG are higher in the cluster 2 while AG and IG were grouped together in cluster 1. AG was found in both clusters for RPR Theta (RPRT) and AG are lower in cluster 1 for RPR Delta (RPRD). This indicates that the group stroke level can discriminate due to the brainwaves characteristics. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Omar, W. R. W.; Taib, M.

The morphological pattern spectrum describes the shape characteristics of the inspected signal based on the morphological opening operation with multi-scale structuring elements. The pattern spectrum entropy and the barycenter scale location of the spectrum curve are extracted as the feature vectors presenting different faults of the bearing, which are more effective and representative than the kurtosis and the enveloping demodulation spectrum. The 'one to others' SVM algorithm is adopted to distinguish six kinds of fault signals which were measured in the experimental test rig under eight different working conditions. The recognition results of the SVM are ideal and more precise than those of the artificial neural network even though the training samples are few. The combination of the morphological pattern spectrum parameters and the 'one to others' multi-class SVM algorithm is suitable for the on-line automated fault diagnosis of the rolling element bearings. This application is promising and worth well exploiting.

This may vary depending on factors such as the experience of the interpreter, mode of study observation (digital screen or printed), and patients' clinical presentation, often leading to inherent flaws in diagnosis and prognosis. Objective: To analyze the interobserver variability between different physicians, certified neurologists and neurophysiologists, for reading conventional electroencephalogram, using the scale of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Methods: A random quota sampling was performed. Of the 93 EEGs observed during the study period, 31 were selected. Subsequently 3 neurologists and 3 neurophysiologists, had they were asked to interpret the selected EEGs, which consisted of 10 sheets, with sensitivity 7. V/mm and speed of 10 seconds per page. Each clinician had a maximum of 2 min per study for interpretation and qualification. Results: Only 9 (29%) of the EEGs were classified as normal. It was found a slightly higher agreement among neurophysiologists (from 0.64 to 0.82) than among neurologists (from 0.64 to 0.72) in the classification of EEGs. Conclusions: Wide interobserver variability was found for the classification of EEGs, with differences according to the specialty of examining physicians.

The objective is to glean new insights into the brain of AD patients. Methods: EEGs are obtained from 20 AD-probable patients and 7 healthy (control) subjects. Pair-wise electrode coherence is calculated over each frequency band (delta, theta, alpha, and beta). Results: One-way ANOVA test shows a set of statistically significant differences in electrode coherence between AD and controls. In general, AD patients present a significant pattern of increase in the left intrahemispheric frontal coherence in the delta, theta, and alpha bands, an increase in the left intrahemispheric temporo-parietal coherence in all bands, and a decrease in the right temporo-parieto-central coherence in all bands. The increase in left temporo-parietal, temporo-central, and frontal coherence of AD patients in specific bands, being most pronounced in the theta band, could be attributed to compensatory mechanisms that attempt to make up for the decrease in memory and cognitive functions caused by the progression of AD. Conclusions: The coherence study presented in this paper shows a pattern of decrease in AD coherence, indicating a decline in cortical connectivity. Exceptions are seen in specific bands where an increase in coherence can be attributed to compensatory mechanisms. Significance: The research shows that coherence studies have potentials in differentiating between healthy elderly and probable AD patients.

While the relation between oscillation amplitude (power) and sensory-cognitive variables has been extensively studied, recent work reveals that the dynamic oscillation signature (phase pattern) can carry information about such processes to a greater degree than amplitude. To elucidate the neural correlates of oscillatory phase patterns, we compared the stimulus selectivity of neural firing rates and auditory-driven electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations. We employed the same naturalistic sound stimuli in 2 experiments, one recording scalp EEGs in humans and one recording intracortical local field potentials (LFPs) and single neurons in macaque auditory cortex. Using stimulus decoding techniques, we show that stimulus selective firing patterns imprint on the phase rather than the amplitude of slow (theta band) oscillations in LFPs and EEG. In particular, we find that stimuli which can be discriminated by firing rates can also be discriminated by phase patterns but not by oscillation amplitude and that stimulus-specific phase patterns also persist in the absence of increases of oscillation power. These findings support a neural basis for stimulus selective and entrained EEG phase patterns and reveal a level of interrelation between encephalographic signals and neural firing beyond simple amplitude covariations in both signals.

Classification of Stationary Signals with Mixed Spectrum	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOSTATISTICS			English	Article						classification; stationary processes; mixed spectrum; LogitBoost	TIME-SERIES	This paper deals with the problem of discrimination between two sets of complex signals generated by stationary processes with both random effects and mixed spectral distributions. The presence of outlier signals and their influence on the classification process is also considered. As an initial input, a feature vector obtained from estimations of the spectral distribution is proposed and used with two different learning machines, namely a single artificial neural network and the LogitBoost classifier. Performance of both methods is evaluated on five simulation studies as well as on a set of actual data of electroencephalogram (EEG) records obtained from both normal subjects and others having experienced epileptic seizures. Of the different classification methods, Logitboost is shown to be more robust to the presence of outlier signals.

Perez			Distinct dynamical patterns that distinguish willed and forced actions	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography; Single trial analysis; Free will; Fischer criterion; Common spatial patterns	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; MOVEMENT; FILTERS; CHOICE	The neural pathways for generating willed actions have been increasingly investigated since the famous pioneering work by Benjamin Libet on the nature of free will. To better understand what differentiates the brain states underlying willed and forced behaviours, we performed a study of chosen and forced actions over a binary choice scenario. Magnetoencephalography recordings were obtained from six subjects during a simple task in which the subject presses a button with the left or right finger in response to a cue that either (1) specifies the finger with which the button should be pressed or (2) instructs the subject to press a button with a finger of their own choosing. Three independent analyses were performed to investigate the dynamical patterns of neural activity supporting willed and forced behaviours during the preparatory period preceding a button press. Each analysis offered similar findings in the temporal and spatial domains and in particular, a high accuracy in the classification of single trials was obtained around 200 ms after cue presentation with an overall average of 82%. During this period, the majority of the discriminatory power comes from differential neural processes observed bilaterally in the parietal lobes, as well as some differences in occipital and temporal lobes, suggesting a contribution of these regions to willed and forced behaviours.

BCI can be divided into three main components: signal acquisition, signal processing, and effector device. The signal acquisition component is generally divided into two categories: noninvasive and invasive. For noninvasive, this review focuses on electroencephalogram. For the invasive, the review includes electrocorticography, local field potentials, multiple-unit activity, and single-unit action potentials. Signal processing techniques reviewed are divided into time-frequency methods such as Fourier transform, autoregressive models, wavelets, and Kalman filter and spatiotemporal techniques such as Laplacian filter and common spatial patterns. Additionally, various signal feature classification algorithms are discussed such as linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and Bayesian classifiers. The article ends with a discussion of challenges facing BCI and concluding remarks on the future of the technology.

Distinct clinical and pathological characteristics separate sporadic diseases into three phenotypes: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), fatal insomnia, and variably protease-sensitive prionopathy. CJD accounts for more than 90% of all cases of sporadic prion disease; it is commonly categorised into five subtypes that can be distinguished according to leading clinical signs, histological lesions, and molecular traits of the pathogenic prion protein. Three subtypes affect prominently cognitive functions whereas the other two impair cerebellar motor activities. An accurate and timely diagnosis depends on careful clinical examination and early performance and interpretation of diagnostic tests, including electroencephalography, quantitative assessment of the surrogate markers 14-3-3, tau, and of the prion protein in the CS F, and neuroimaging. The reliability of CSF tests is improved when these tests are interpreted alongside neuroimaging data.

Long-Range, Pattern-Dependent Contextual Effects in Early Human Visual Cortex	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							CLASSICAL RECEPTIVE-FIELD; CAT STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE V1 NEURONS; SELECTIVE ADAPTATION; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; AREA MT; ORIENTATION; RESPONSES; MECHANISMS; SYSTEM	The standard view of neurons in early visual cortex is that they behave like localized feature detectors [1-7]. Here we demonstrate that processing in early visual areas goes beyond feature detection by showing that neural responses are greater when a feature deviates from its context compared to when it does not deviate from its context. Using psychophysics, fMRI, and electroencephalography methodologies, we measured neural responses to an oriented Gabor ("target") embedded in various visual patterns as defined by the relative orientation of flanking stimuli. We first show using psychophysical contrast adaptation and fMRI that a target that differs from its context results in more neural activity compared to a target that is contained within an alternating sequence, suggesting that neurons in early visual cortex are sensitive to large-scale orientation patterns. Next, we use event-related potentials to show that orientation deviations affect the earliest sensory components of the target response. Finally, we use forced-choice classification of "noise" stimuli to show that we are more likely to "see" orientations that deviate from the context. Our results suggest that early visual cortex is sensitive to global patterns in images in a way that is markedly different from the predictions of standard models of cortical visual processing.

Classification of Intelligence Quotient Using EEG Sub-band Power Ratio and ANN During Mental Task	2013 IEEE CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, PROCESS & CONTROL (ICSPC)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Systems, Process and Control (ICSPC)	DEC 13-15, 2013	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA	IEEE Control Syst Soc Chapter Malaysia, IEEE Malaysia Sect, IEEE, Univ Teknologi Mara		intelligence quotient (IQ); electroencephalogram (EEG); sub-band power ratio; artificial neural network (ANN); Raven's Progressive Matrices	NEURAL EFFICIENCY; INDIVIDUALS; PERFORMANCE; NETWORKS	It has been a long debate on conventional psychometric test as benchmark of individual's intelligence quotient (IQ). However, recent studies in a variety of neurophysiological researches have been done to link intelligence with individual's brainwave pattern. Hence this paper proposes an intelligent approach to classify IQ via brainwave sub-band power ratio and artificial neural network (ANN). Fifty samples of electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset have been collected during IQ test session. Three IQ levels have been categorized based on the IQ scores from Raven's Progressive Matrices as the control group. Left hemispheric brainwave focusing on theta, alpha and beta sub-bands are the key discussion of this paper. The features are used as input to train the ANN. Formerly, synthetic data have also been generated with white Gaussian noise to increase the performance of the classifier. Subsequently, the network model have been developed using an ANN that is trained with optimized parameters which are learning rate, momentum constant and hidden neurons. The network model trained with back-propagation algorithm has yielded low mean squared error (MSE). Findings also indicate that the distinct intelligence quotient levels can be classified with 97.62% training and 94.44% testing accuracies via brainwave sub-band power ratio.	[Jahidin, A.

Detecting these errors online from neuronal activity can improve BMI performance by modifying the decoding algorithm and by correcting the errors made. Here, we study the neuronal correlates of two different types of errors which can both be employed in BMI: (i) the execution error, due to inaccurate decoding of the subjects' movement intention; (ii) the outcome error, due to not achieving the goal of the movement. We demonstrate that, in electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings from the surface of the human brain, strong error-related neural responses (ERNRs) for both types of errors can be observed. ERNRs were present in the low and high frequency components of the ECoG signals, with both signal components carrying partially independent information. Moreover, the observed ERNRs can be used to discriminate between error types, with high accuracy (>= 83%) obtained already from single electrode signals. We found ERNRs in multiple cortical areas, including motor and somatosensory cortex. As the motor cortex is the primary target area for recording control signals for a BMI, an adaptive motor BMI utilizing these error signals may not require additional electrode implants in other brain areas.

Automatic multi-modal intelligent seizure acquisition (MISA) system for detection of motor seizures from electromyographic data and motion data	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Epilepsy; Movement sensors; Seizure detection; Surface EMG sensors; Support vector machine learning; Wavelet packet	EEG; EPILEPSY	The objective is to develop a non-invasive automatic method for detection of epileptic seizures with motor manifestations. Ten healthy subjects who simulated seizures and one patient participated in the study. Surface electromyography (sEMG) and motion sensor features were extracted as energy measures of reconstructed sub-bands from the discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) and the wavelet packet transformation (WPT). Based on the extracted features all data segments were classified using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm as simulated seizure or normal activity. A case study of the seizure from the patient showed that the simulated seizures were visually similar to the epileptic one. The multi-modal intelligent seizure acquisition (MISA) system showed high sensitivity, short detection latency and low false detection rate. The results showed superiority of the multi-modal detection system compared to the uni-modal one. The presented system has a promising potential for seizure detection based on multi-modal data.

The analgesic effect of pregabalin in patients with chronic pain is reflected by changes in pharmaco-EEG spectral indices	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						analgesic; electroencephalographic; pain; pattern recognition; pregabalin	COMPUTER-SUPPORTED EVALUATION; STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; CHRONIC-PANCREATITIS; WAVELET ANALYSIS; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; GABAPENTIN; REGISTRATION; FREQUENCY	AIM To identify electroencephalographic (EEG) biomarkers for the analgesic effect of pregabalin in patients with chronic visceral pain. METHODS This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 31 patients suffering from visceral pain due to chronic pancreatitis. Patients received increasing doses of pregabalin (75 mg-300 mg twice a day) or matching placebo during 3 weeks of treatment. Pain scores were documented in a diary based on a visual analogue scale. In addition, brief pain inventory-short form (BPI) and quality of life questionnaires were collected prior to and after the study period. Multi-channel resting EEG was recorded before treatment onset and at the end of the study. Changes in EEG spectral indices were extracted, and individual changes were classified by a support vector machine (SVM) to discriminate the pregabalin and placebo responses. Changes in individual spectral indices and pain scores were correlated. RESULTS Pregabalin increased normalized intensity in low spectral indices, most prominent in the theta band (3.5-7.5 Hz), difference of-3.18, 95% CI-3.57,-2.80; P = 0.03. No changes in spectral indices were seen for placebo. The maximum difference between pregabalin and placebo treated patients was seen in the parietal region, with a classification accuracy of 85.7% (P = 0.009). Individual changes in EEG indices were correlated with changes in pain diary (P = 0.04) and BPI pain composite scores (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Changes in spectral indices caused by slowing of brain oscillations were identified as a biomarker for the central analgesic effect of pregabalin. The developed methodology may provide perspectives to assess individual responses to treatment in personalized medicine.

ECoG-based BCIs have recently drawn the attention from the community. Indeed, ECoG can provide higher spatial resolution and better signal quality than classical EEG recordings. It is also more suitable for long-term use. These characteristics allow to decode precise brain activities and to realize efficient ECoG-based neuroprostheses. Signal processing is a very important task in BCIs research for translating brain signals into commands. Here, we present a linear regression method based on the amplitude modulation of band-specific ECoG including a short-term memory for individual finger flexion prediction. The effectiveness of the method was proven by achieving the highest value of correlation coefficient between the predicted and recorded finger flexion values on data set 4 during the BCI competition IV.

However, the question of movement event detection from brain activity, that is, decoding the time at which an event occurred (e. g. movement onset), has been addressed less often. Yet, this may be a topic of key importance, as a brain-machine interface (BMI) that controls a grasping prosthesis could be realized by detecting the time of grasp, together with an optional decoding of which type of grasp to apply. We, therefore, studied the detection of time of grasps from human ECoG recordings during a sequence of natural and continuous reach-to-grasp movements. Using signals recorded from the motor cortex, a detector based on regularized linear discriminant analysis was able to retrieve the time-point of grasp with high reliability and only few false detections. Best performance was achieved using a combination of signal components from time and frequency domains. Sensitivity, measured by the amount of correct detections, and specificity, represented by the amount of false detections, depended strongly on the imposed restrictions on temporal precision of detection and on the delay between event detection and the time the event occurred. Including neural data from after the event into the decoding analysis, slightly increased accuracy, however, reasonable performance could also be obtained when grasping events were detected 125 ms in advance. In summary, our results provide a good basis for using detection of grasping movements from ECoG to control a grasping prosthesis.

Aged-related Changes in Brain Activity Classification with respect to Age by means of Graph Indexes	2013 35TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 03-07, 2013	Osaka, JAPAN	IEEE Engn Med Biol Soc, Japanese Soc Med & Biol Engn			MODELS	Recent studies have investigated changes in the human brain network organization during the normal aging. A reduction of the connectivity between brain areas was demonstrated by combining neuroimaging technologies and graph theory. Clustering, characteristic path length and small-worldness are key topological measures and they are widely used in literature. In this paper we propose a new methodology that combine advanced techniques of effective connectivity estimation, graph theoretical approach and classification by SVM method. EEG signals recording during rest condition from 20 young subjects and 20 mid-aged adults were studied. Partial Directed Coherence was computed by means of General Linear Kalman Filter and graph indexes were extracted from estimated patterns. At last small-worldness was used as feature for the SVM classifier. Results show that topological differences of brain networks exist between young and mid-aged adults: small-worldness is significantly different between the two populations and it can be used to classify the subjects with respect to age with an accuracy of 69%.

Spatial Auditory BCI Paradigm based on Real and Virtual Sound Image Generation	2013 ASIA-PACIFIC SIGNAL AND INFORMATION PROCESSING ASSOCIATION ANNUAL SUMMIT AND CONFERENCE (APSIPA)	Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Summit and Conference of the Asia-Pacific-Signal-and-Information-Processing-Association (APSIPA)	OCT 29-NOV 01, 2013	Kaohsiung, TAIWAN	Asia Pacific Signal & Informat Proc Assoc				This paper presents a novel concept of spatial auditory brain-computer interface utilizing real and virtual sound images. We report results obtained from psychophysical and EEG experiments with nine subjects utilizing a novel method of spatial real or virtual sound images as spatial auditory brain computer interface (BCI) cues. Real spatial sound sources result in better behavioral and BCI response classification accuracies, yet a direct comparison of partial results in a mixed experiment confirms the usability of the virtual sound images for the spatial auditory BCI. Additionally, we compare stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers in a single sequence BCI experiment. The interesting point of the mixed usage of real and virtual spatial sound images in a single experiment is that both stimuli types generate distinct event related potential (ERP) response patterns allowing for their separate classification. This discovery is the strongest point of the reported research and it brings the possibility to create new spatial auditory BCI paradigms.

The human-robot system consists of three components: human user, wheelchair robot and the noninvasive brain-computer interface (BCI) which can represent limit types of user's intention patterns based on EEG signals, with insufficient decoding accuracy and time delay. To achieve efficient navigation and positioning under condition of decoding uncertainties of the BCI, three cooperative modes are proposed for specific situations based on trade-off of robot's autonomy and user's flexibility. The coding protocol in each mode is elucidated in detail, and strategies of mode switching are developed. To achieve continuous and smooth motion, a look-ahead visual feedback is applied, so that the user can adjust the intention and/or actively correct extraction error of the BCI before the robot reaches current path node, and consequently, reliable planning and execution are ensured. The effectiveness of the strategies is evaluated by simulations.

Time-dependent approach for single trial classification of covert visuospatial attention	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; ALPHA-BAND; HUMAN EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS; COMMUNICATION; ENHANCEMENT; MODULATIONS; SUPPRESSION	Recently, several studies have started to explore covert visuospatial attention as a control signal for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Covert visuospatial attention represents the ability to change the focus of attention from one point in the space without overt eye movements. Nevertheless, the full potential and possible applications of this paradigm remain relatively unexplored. Voluntary covert visuospatial attention might allow a more natural and intuitive interaction with real environments as neither stimulation nor gazing is required. In order to identify brain correlates of covert visuospatial attention, classical approaches usually rely on the whole alpha-band over long time intervals. In this work, we propose a more detailed analysis in the frequency and time domains to enhance classification performance. In particular, we investigate the contribution of alpha sub-bands and the role of time intervals in carrying information about visual attention. Previous neurophysiological studies have already highlighted the role of temporal dynamics in attention mechanisms. However, these important aspects are not yet exploited in BCI. In this work, we studied different methods that explicitly cope with the natural brain dynamics during visuospatial attention tasks in order to enhance BCI robustness and classification performances. Results with ten healthy subjects demonstrate that our approach identifies spectro-temporal patterns that outperform the state-of-the-art classification method. On average, our time-dependent classification reaches 0.74 +/- 0.03 of the area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC) value with an increase of 12.3% with respect to standard methods (0.65 +/- 0.4). In addition, the proposed approach allows faster classification (<1 instead of 3 s), without compromising performances. Finally, our analysis highlights the fact that discriminant patterns are not stable for the whole trial period but are changing over short time intervals. These results support the hypothesis that visual attention information is actually indexed by subject-specific alpha sub-bands and is time dependent.

J	Wang, YJ; Jung, TP				Wang, Yijun; Jung, Tzyy-Ping			A Collaborative Brain-Computer Interface for Improving Human Performance	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; BCI; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION	Electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have been studied since the 1970s. Currently, the main focus of BCI research lies on the clinical use, which aims to provide a new communication channel to patients with motor disabilities to improve their quality of life. However, the BCI technology can also be used to improve human performance for normal healthy users. Although this application has been proposed for a long time, little progress has been made in real-world practices due to technical limits of EEG. To overcome the bottleneck of low single-user BCI performance, this study proposes a collaborative paradigm to improve overall BCI performance by integrating information from multiple users. To test the feasibility of a collaborative BCI, this study quantitatively compares the classification accuracies of collaborative and single-user BCI applied to the EEG data collected from 20 subjects in a movement-planning experiment. This study also explores three different methods for fusing and analyzing EEG data from multiple subjects: (1) Event-related potentials (ERP) averaging, (2) Feature concatenating, and (3) Voting. In a demonstration system using the Voting method, the classification accuracy of predicting movement directions (reaching left vs. reaching right) was enhanced substantially from 66% to 80%, 88%, 93%, and 95% as the numbers of subjects increased from 1 to 5, 10, 15, and 20, respectively. Furthermore, the decision of reaching direction could be made around 100-250 ms earlier than the subject's actual motor response by decoding the ERP activities arising mainly from the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which are related to the processing of visuomotor transmission. Taken together, these results suggest that a collaborative BCI can effectively fuse brain activities of a group of people to improve the overall performance of natural human behavior.

The Role of Delta-Modulated High Frequency Oscillations in Seizure State Classification	2013 35TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 03-07, 2013	Osaka, JAPAN	IEEE Engn Med Biol Soc, Japanese Soc Med & Biol Engn			EPILEPSY; PHASE; BRAIN; HZ	High frequency oscillations (HFOs), which collectively refer to ripples (80-200 Hz) and fast ripples (>200 Hz), have been implicated as key players in epileptogenesis. However, their presence alone is not in and of itself indicative of a pathological brain state. Rather, spatial origins as well as coexistence with other neural rhythms are essential components in defining pathological HFOs. This study investigates how the phase of the delta rhythm (0.5-4 Hz) modulates the amplitude of HFOs during a seizure episode. Seven seizures recorded from three patients presenting with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy were obtained via intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) from a 64-electrode grid. Delta modulation of the HFO rhythms was found to emerge at seizure onset and termination regardless of the dynamics present within the seizure episode itself. Moreover, the differences between delta modulating the ripple or fast ripple may be due to the sleep stage of the patient when the seizures were being recorded. Further studies exploring how this modulation changes in space across the grid may also highlight additional properties of this phenomenon. Its temporal pattern suggests that it is a potential iEEG-based biomarker for seizure state classification.

The proposed method integrated two interrelated steps: (1) establishing a decisional space on the basis of the inter-electrode mean of the spectral power in the gamma frequencies after a thorough evaluation of temporal and frequency-based features and (2) constructing an artificial neural network that operated on this decisional space to delineate EEG files that contained seizures from those that did not. The data were obtained from 14 patients who underwent two-stage epilepsy surgery with subdural recordings. Of the total 157 files considered, 35 (21 interictal and 14 ictal) iEEG data files or 22% were selected randomly and used initially in a training phase. The remaining 122 iEEG data files or 78% were then used in the testing phase to assess the merits in selecting gamma power as means to detect a seizure. The results obtained exhibited an accuracy of 95.90%, a sensitivity of 92.59%, and a specificity of 96.84%. Although this method had to contend with the complex nature of iEEG and the inherent heavy computational load, the constructed artificial neural networks together with the chosen decisional space yielded the best possible outcome. The proposed method was based on aggregating the power in the 36 to 44-Hz frequency range and analyzing its behavior in time, looking for patterns indicative of seizure evolution. It was shown that the power measurement in the gamma range contains the information needed to discriminate seizure files from nonseizure files. The algorithm consisted in establishing a decision space most suitable for iEEG data classification by relying on the power spectra in the gamma frequencies and constructing and implementing an artificial neural network that generates the highest classification accuracy possible. It was noted that although only 29% (35/122) of the files were used randomly for training the detector, high measures in sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were still achieved in the remaining files, which were subsequently used in the testing phase. Seizures are known to occur intermittently and unpredictably, and massive amounts of EEG or iEEG data need to be analyzed offline to detect seizures. This is a challenge that can only be met through reliable and time-efficient seizure-detection paradigms, an affirmation this study attempted to prove.

This paper presents the outcomes of a preliminary research that investigates a subject's reaction when exposed to live violin music. An electroencephalogram machine (EEG) and a computer was used to observe and record the subject's brainwaves activities in three phases; before, during, and after listening to violin music in order to compare the subjects brainwaves reaction during this three phases/conditions. Preliminary results from this investigation indicate that while listening to a live performance of violin music, the subject's brain induced both left and right brainwaves (theta, alpha and beta brainwaves) to be balanced. The study points to a possible relationship between frequency and power emitted by live music in affecting human brainwaves, suggesting further research in this domain.

Acoustically presented words were degraded in acoustic envelope and spectrum in an orthogonal design, and electroencephalogram responses in the frequency domain were analyzed in 24 participants, who rated word comprehensibility after each trial. First, the alpha power suppression during and after a degraded word depended monotonically on spectral and, to a lesser extent, envelope detail. The magnitude of this alpha suppression exhibited an additional and independent influence on later comprehension ratings. Second, source localization of alpha suppression yielded superior parietal, prefrontal, as well as anterior temporal brain areas. Third, multivariate classification of the time-frequency pattern across participants showed that patterns of late posterior alpha power allowed best for above-chance classification of word intelligibility. Results suggest that both magnitude and topography of late alpha suppression in response to single words can indicate a listener's sensitivity to acoustic features and the ability to comprehend speech under adverse listening conditions.

An evaluation study	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Brain-Computer Interface Meeting	MAY 31-JUN 04, 2010	Monterey, CA				EEG; LAPLACIAN; PATTERN; CLASSIFICATION	Laplacian filters are widely used in neuroscience. In the context of brain-computer interfacing, they might be preferred to data-driven approaches such as common spatial patterns (CSP) in a variety of scenarios such as, e. g., when no or few user data are available or a calibration session with a multi-channel recording is not possible, which is the case in various applications. In this paper we propose the use of an ensemble of local CSP patches (CSPP) which can be considered as a compromise between Laplacian filters and CSP. Our CSPP only needs a very small number of trials to be optimized and significantly outperforms Laplacian filters in all settings studied. Additionally, CSPP also outperforms multi-channel CSP and a regularized version of CSP even when only very few calibration data are available, acting as a CSP regularizer without the need of additional hyperparameters and at a very low cost: 2-5 min of data recording, i.e. ten times less than CSP.

Although a wide range of research has been devoted to building OFS assessment models, most of the models are based on group statistics and little or no research has been directed towards model individualization, i.e., tuning the group statistics based model for individual pilots. Moreover, little emphasis has been placed on monitoring whether the pilot is disengaged during low workload conditions. The primary focus of this research is to provide a real-time engagement assessment technique considering individual variations in an aviation environment. This technique is based on an advanced machine learning technique, called enhanced committee machine. We have investigated two different model individualization approaches: similarity-based and dynamic ensemble selection-based. The basic idea of the similarity-based technique is to find similar subjects from the training data pool and use their data together with the limited training data from the test subject to build an individualized OFS assessment model. The dynamic ensemble selection dynamically select data points in a validation dataset (with labels) that are adjacent to each test sample, and evaluate all the trained models using the identified data points. The best performing models will be selected and maximum voting can be applied to perform individualized assessment for the test sample. To evaluate the developed approaches, we have collected data from a high fidelity Boeing 737 simulator. The results show that the performance of the dynamic ensemble selection approach is comparable to that achieved from an individual model (assuming sufficient data is available from each individual).

In an attempt to reduce this time and improve the application robustness, recent works have explored shared-control strategies where the device does not only execute the decoded commands, but it is also involved in executing the task. This work proposes a shared-control BCI using error potentials for a 2D reaching task with discrete actions and states. The proposed system has several interesting properties: the system is scalable without increasing the complexity of the user's mental task; the interaction is natural for the user, as the mental task is to monitor the device performance to promote its task learning (in this context the reaching task); and the system has the potential to be combined with additional brain signals to recover or learn from interaction errors. Online control experiments were performed with four subjects, showing that it was possible to reach a goal location from any starting point within a 5x5 grid in around 23 actions (about 19 seconds of EEG signal), both with fixed goals and goals freely chosen by the users.				iturrate@unizar.es; montesano@unizar.es; jminguez@unizar.es	Iturrate, Inaki/B-2396-2018	Iturrate, Inaki/0000-0001-7781-7826; Minguez Zafra, Javier/0000-0002-2957-0133					23	26	26	0	8	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1557-170X		978-1-4577-0216-7	IEEE ENG MED BIO			2013							5258	5262						5	Engineering, Biomedical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BB2DX	24110922	Green Submitted			2022-08-02	WOS:000341702105168

MEG-based decoding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of visual category perception	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Spatiotemporal dynamics; Multivariate analysis; Perception; MEG	HUMAN FACE PERCEPTION; NATURAL IMAGES; FMRI ACTIVITY; TIME-COURSE; OBJECT; REPRESENTATIONS; RECOGNITION; POTENTIALS; SPEED; EEG	Visual processing is a complex task which is best investigated using sensitive multivariate analysis methods that can capture representation-specific brain activity over both time and space. In this study, we applied a multivariate decoding algorithm to MEG data of subjects engaged in passive viewing of images of faces, scenes, bodies and tools. We used reconstructed source-space time courses as input to the algorithm in order to localize brain regions involved in optimal image discrimination. Applying this method to the interval of 115 to 315 ms after stimulus onset we show a focal localization of regression coefficients in the inferior occipital, middle occipital, and lingual gyrus that drive decoding of the different perceived image categories. Classifier accuracy was highest (over 90% correctly classified trials, compared to a chance level accuracy of 50%) when dissociating the perception of faces from perception of other object categories. Furthermore, we applied this method to each single time point to extract the temporal evolution of visual perception. This allowed for the detection of differences in visual category perception as early as 85 ms after stimulus onset. Furthermore, localizing the corresponding regression coefficients of each time point allowed us to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of visual category perception. This revealed initial involvement of sources in the inferior occipital, inferior temporal and superior occipital gyrus. During sustained stimulation additional sources in the anterior inferior temporal gyrus and superior parietal gyrus became involved. We conclude that decoding of source-space MEG data provides a suitable method to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of ongoing cognitive processing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

One putative mechanism for consolidation is the reactivation of memory traces after their initial encoding during subsequent sleep or waking state. However, it is still unknown whether consolidation of individual memory contents relies on reactivation of stimulus-specific neural representations in humans. Investigating stimulus-specific representations in humans is particularly difficult, but potentially feasible using multivariate pattern classification analysis (MVPA). Here, we show in healthy human participants that stimulus-specific activation patterns can indeed be identified with MVPA, that these patterns reoccur spontaneously during postlearning resting periods and sleep, and that the frequency of reactivation predicts subsequent memory for individual items. We conducted a paired-associate learning task with items and spatial positions and extracted stimulus-specific activity patterns by MVPA in a simultaneous electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. As a first step, we investigated the amount of fMRI volumes during rest that resembled either one of the items shown before or one of the items shown as a control after the resting period. Reactivations during both awake resting state and sleep predicted subsequent memory. These data are first evidence that spontaneous reactivation of stimulus-specific activity patterns during resting state can be investigated using MVPA. They show that reactivation occurs in humans and is behaviorally relevant for stabilizing memory traces against interference. They move beyond previous studies because replay was investigated on the level of individual stimuli and because reactivations were not evoked by sensory cues but occurred spontaneously.

Decoding the rat forelimb movement direction from epidural and intracortical field potentials	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; MOTOR CORTEX; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SIGNALS; ARM MOVEMENTS; MONKEY; PREDICTION; TISSUE; ARRAY; EEG	Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) use signals from the brain to control a device such as a computer cursor. Various types of signals have been used as BMI inputs, from single-unit action potentials to scalp potentials. Recently, intermediate-level signals such as subdural field potentials have also shown promise. These different signal types are likely to provide different amounts of information, but we do not yet know what signal types are necessary to enable a particular BMI function, such as identification of reach target location, control of a two-dimensional cursor or the dynamics of limb movement. Here we evaluated the performance of field potentials, measured either intracortically (local field potentials, LFPs) or epidurally (epidural field potential, EFPs), in terms of the ability to decode reach direction. We trained rats to move a joystick with their forepaw to control the motion of a sipper tube to one of the four targets in two dimensions. We decoded the forelimb reach direction from the field potentials using linear discriminant analysis. We achieved a mean accuracy of 69 +/- 3% with EFPs and 57 +/- 2% with LFPs, both much better than chance. Signal quality remained good up to 13 months after implantation. This suggests that using epidural signals could provide BMI inputs of high quality with less risk to the patient than using intracortical recordings.

Students' uncertainty is of primary interest as it is deeply rooted in the process of knowledge construction. In this paper we propose a new sensor-based multimodal approach to model users' uncertainty from their affective reactions and cognitive and personal characteristics. An experimental protocol was conducted to record participants' brain activity and physiological signals while they interacted with a computer-based problem solving system and self-reported their perceived level of uncertainty during the tasks. We study key indicators from affective reactions, trait-questionnaire responses, and individual differences that are related to uncertainty states. Then we develop models to automatically predict levels of uncertainty using machine learning techniques. Evidence indicated that students' uncertainty is associated to their mental and emotional reactions. Personal characteristics such as gender, skill level, and personality traits also showed a priori tendencies to be more or less in particular uncertainty states. The SVM algorithm demonstrated the best accuracy results for classifying students' uncertainty levels. Our findings have implications for ITS seeking to continuously monitor users' internal states so they can ultimately provide efficient interventions to enhance learning.

In spite of continuous improvements, errors in movement decoding are still a major problem of current BMI systems. If the difference between the decoded and intended movements becomes noticeable, it may lead to an execution error. Outcome errors, where subjects fail to reach a certain movement goal, are also present during online BMI operation. Detecting such errors can be beneficial for BMI operation: (i) errors can be corrected online after being detected and (ii) adaptive BMI decoding algorithm can be updated to make fewer errors in the future. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we show that error events can be detected from human electrocorticography (ECoG) during a continuous task with high precision, given a temporal tolerance of 300-400 milliseconds. We quantified the error detection accuracy and showed that, using only a small subset of 262 ECoG electrodes, 82% of detection information for outcome error and 74% of detection information for execution error available from all ECoG electrodes could be retained. Conclusions/Significance: The error detection method presented here could be used to correct errors made during BMI operation or to adapt a BMI algorithm to make fewer errors in the future. Furthermore, our results indicate that smaller ECoG implant could be used for error detection. Reducing the size of an ECoG electrode implant used for BMI decoding and error detection could significantly reduce the medical risk of implantation.

Improved patient specific seizure detection during pre-surgical evaluation	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Seizure detection; Interactive machine learning; Subject-specific; Adaptation	EEG; ONSET; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION	Objective: There is considerable interest in improved off-line automated seizure detection methods that will decrease the workload of EEG monitoring units. Subject-specific approaches have been demonstrated to perform better than subject-independent ones. However, for pre-surgical diagnostics, the traditional method of obtaining a priori data to train subject-specific classifiers is not practical. We present an alternative method that works by adapting the threshold of a subject-independent to a specific subject based on feedback from the user. Methods: A subject-independent quadratic discriminant classifier incorporating modified features based partially on the Gotman algorithm was first built. It was then used to derive subject-specific classifiers by determining subject-specific posterior probability thresholds via user interaction. The two schemes were tested on 529 h of intracranial EEG containing 63 seizures from 15 subjects undergoing pre-surgical evaluation. To provide comparison, the standard Gotman algorithm was implemented and optimised for this dataset by tuning the detection thresholds. Results: Compared to the tuned Gotman algorithm, the subject-independent scheme reduced the false positive rate by 51% (0.23 to 0.11 h(-1)) while increasing sensitivity from 53% to 62%. The subject-specific scheme further improved sensitivity to 78%, but with a small increase in false positive rate to 0.18 h(-1). Conclusions: The results suggest that a subject-independent classifier scheme with modified features is useful for reducing false positive rate, while subject adaptation further enhances performance by improving sensitivity. The results also suggest that the proposed subject-adapted classifier scheme approximates the performance of the subject-specific Gotman algorithm. Significance: The proposed method could potentially increase the productivity of offline EEG analysis. The approach could also be generalised to enhance the performance of other subject independent algorithms. (C) 2010 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

An online EEG BCI based on covert visuospatial attention in absence of exogenous stimulation	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; SPELLER	Objective. In this work we present-for the first time-the online operation of an electroencephalogram (EEG) brain-computer interface (BCI) system based on covert visuospatial attention (CVSA), without relying on any evoked responses. Electrophysiological correlates of pure top-down CVSA have only recently been proposed as a control signal for BCI. Such systems are expected to share the ease of use of stimulus-driven BCIs (e.g. P300, steady state visually evoked potential) with the autonomy afforded by decoding voluntary modulations of ongoing activity (e. g. motor imagery). Approach. Eight healthy subjects participated in the study. EEG signals were acquired with an active 64-channel system. The classification method was based on a time-dependent approach tuned to capture the most discriminant spectral features of the temporal evolution of attentional processes. The system was used by all subjects over two days without retraining, to verify its robustness and reliability. Main results. We report a mean online accuracy across the group of 70.6 +/- 1.5%, and 88.8 +/- 5.8% for the best subject. Half of the participants produced stable features over the entire duration of the study. Additionally, we explain drops in performance in subjects showing stable features in terms of known electrophysiological correlates of fatigue, suggesting the prospect of online monitoring of mental states in BCI systems. Significance. This work represents the first demonstration of the feasibility of an online EEG BCI based on CVSA. The results achieved suggest the CVSA BCI as a promising alternative to standard BCI modalities.

For each patient, a set of twenty-two linear univariate features were extracted from 6 electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to make a 132 dimensional feature space. Preprocessing and normalization methods of the features, which affect the output of the seizure prediction algorithm, were studied in terms of alarm sensitivity and false prediction rate (FPR). The problem of choosing an optimal preictal time was tackled using 4 distinct values of 10, 20, 30, and 40 min. The seizure prediction problem has traditionally been considered a two-class classification problem, which is also exercised here. These studies have been conducted on the features obtained from 10 patients. For each patient, 48 different combinations of methods are compared to find the best configuration. Normalization by dividing by the maximum and smoothing are found to be the best configuration in most of the patients. The results also indicate that applying machine learning methods on a multidimensional feature space of 22 univariate features predicted seizure onsets with high performance. On average, the seizures were predicted in 73.9% of the cases (34 out of 46 in 737.9 h of test data), with a FPR of 0.15 h(-1). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The technique of cognitive state assessment, as well as its benefits, has been demonstrated by many research groups. In an effort to move closer toward a realized system, efforts must now be focused on critical issues that remain unsolved, namely instability of pattern classifiers over the course of hours and days. This work, as part of the Cognitive State Assessment Competition 2011, seeks to explore methods for 'learning' non-stationarity as a mitigation for more generalized patterns that are stable over time courses that are not widely discussed in the literature.

Modern data acquisition and data analysis protocols have been of great assistance to medical researchers and clinical scientists. Especially in psychiatry, technology and science have made new computational methods available to assist the development of predictive modeling and to identify diseases more accurately. Data mining (or knowledge discovery) aims to extract information from large datasets and solve challenging tasks, like patient assessment, early mental disease diagnosis, and drug efficacy assessment. Accurate and fast data analysis methods are very important, especially when dealing with severe psychiatric diseases like schizophrenia. In this paper, we focus on computational methods related to data analysis and more specifically to data mining. Then, we discuss some related research in the field of psychiatry.

This article aims at detecting semantic priming at the single-trial level. By using machine learning techniques it is possible to analyse and classify short traces of brain activity, which could, for example, be used to build a Brain Computer Interface (BCI). This article describes an experiment where subjects were presented with word pairs and asked to decide whether the words were related or not. A classifier was trained to determine whether the subjects judged words as related or unrelated based on one second of EEG data. The results show that the classifier accuracy when training per subject varies between 54% and 67%, and is significantly above chance level for all subjects (N = 12) and the accuracy when training over subjects varies between 51% and 63%, and is significantly above chance level for 11 subjects, pointing to a general effect.

However, only recently have devices capable of providing sophisticated multi-dimensional control been achieved non-invasively. A major goal for non-invasive BCI systems has been to provide continuous, intuitive, and accurate control, while retaining a high level of user autonomy. By employing electroencephalography (EEG) to record and decode sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) induced from motor imaginations, a consistent, user-specific control signal may be characterized. Utilizing a novel method of interactive and continuous control, we trained three normal subjects to modulate their SMRs to achieve three-dimensional movement of a virtual helicopter that is fast, accurate, and continuous. In this system, the virtual helicopter's forward-backward translation and elevation controls were actuated through the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms that were converted to forces applied to the virtual helicopter at every simulation time step, and the helicopter's angle of left or right rotation was linearly mapped, with higher resolution, from sensorimotor rhythms associated with other motor imaginations. These different resolutions of control allow for interplay between general intent actuation and fine control as is seen in the gross and fine movements of the arm and hand. Subjects controlled the helicopter with the goal of flying through rings (targets) randomly positioned and oriented in a three-dimensional space. The subjects flew through rings continuously, acquiring as many as 11 consecutive rings within a five-minute period. In total, the study group successfully acquired over 85% of presented targets. These results affirm the effective, three-dimensional control of our motor imagery based BCI system, and suggest its potential applications in biological navigation, neuroprosthetics, and other applications.

The nonlinear measures are achieved based on the recurrence plot to represent dynamical characteristics of sEMG during hand movements. Fuzzy Gaussian Mixture Models (FGMMs) are proposed and employed as a nonlinear classifier to recognise different hand grasps and in-hand manipulations captured from different subjects. Various experiments are conducted to evaluate their performance by comparing 14 individual features, 19 multifeatures and 4 different classifiers. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed nonlinear measures provide important supplemental information and they are essential to the good performance in multifeatures. It is also shown that FGMMs outperform commonly used approaches including Linear Discriminant Analysis, Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machine in terms of the recognition rate. The best performance with the recognition rate of 96.7% is achieved by using FGMMs with the multifeature combining Willison Amplitude and Determinism.

A Combination of Spatial and Spectral Filters for Mental Condition Discrimination	2013 6TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	NOV 06-08, 2013	San Diego, CA	IEEE EMBS, Battelle, Brain Vis LLC, Cortech Solut, Univ Minnesota, IGERT Program, Syst Neuroengineering, IOP Publishing, Ripple, Univ Minnesota, Inst Engn Med, Plexon			SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MOTOR IMAGERY; COMPONENT	It is widely accepted that the common spatial pattern (CSP) analysis method, albeit being very popular in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications as a feature extraction method for binary classification, is vulnerable to artifact. It could underperform when it is exposed to an input whose frequency band is too broad that many interfering frequency components are contained. These drawbacks are closely related to the nature of CSP filters which are based on completely spatial weighting. That is, CSP has no control on the temporal space of brain signals. This work is one attempt to extend CSP by eliminating the undesirable temporal components through spectral filtering. The proposed method in this work retains the simplicity of CSP but derives a number of complex spatial and spectral integrated filters by applying multiple time lags and a regularization term. These filters are data-driven and channel-specific. Their ability to narrow the frequency band of signals so as to enhance feature extraction is demonstrated using a public available dataset, where 4.7% higher mean classification accuracy is achieved.

This paper explored a methodology used to discriminate between evoked related potential signals of stroke patients and their matched control subjects in a visual working memory paradigm. The proposed algorithm, which combined independent component analysis and orthogonal empirical mode decomposition, was applied to extract independent sources. Four types of target stimulus features including P300 peak latency, P300 peak amplitude, root mean square, and theta frequency band power were chosen. Evolutionary multiple kernel support vector machine (EMK-SVM) based on genetic programming was investigated to classify stroke patients and healthy controls. Based on 5-fold cross-validation runs, EMK-SVM provided better classification performance compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. Comparing stroke patients with healthy controls using the proposed algorithm, we achieved the maximum classification accuracies of 91.76% and 82.23% for 0-back and 1-back tasks, respectively. Overall, the experimental results showed that the proposed method was effective. The approach in this study may eventually lead to a reliable tool for identifying suitable brain impairment candidates and assessing cognitive function.

In this context, the chapter discusses the role of the bio-interfaces in building a differentiated condition of interaction governed by the biology of the users. For this, the chapter presents applications of bio-interfaces in the areas of design, art, and games, considering their use as wearable devices that provide an organic interaction between man and machine, which could, in turn, lead these systems to a co-evolutionary relationship.

The rather high rate of failure in epilepsy surgery of extra-temporal epilepsies highlights that the precise identification of the EZ, mandatory objective to achieve seizure freedom, is still an unsolved problem that requires more sophisticated methods of investigation. Despite the wide range of non-invasive investigations, intracranial stereo-EEG (SEEG) recordings still represent, in many patients, the gold standard for the EZ identification. In this contest, the EZ localization is still based on visual analysis of SEEG, inevitably affected by the drawback of subjectivity and strongly time-consuming. Over the last years, considerable efforts have been made to develop advanced signal analysis techniques able to improve the identification of the EZ. Particular attention has been paid to those methods aimed at quantifying and characterizing the interactions and causal relationships between neuronal populations, since is nowadays well assumed that epileptic phenomena are associated with abnormal changes in brain synchronization mechanisms, and initial evidence has shown the suitability of this approach for the EZ localization. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the different EEG signal processing methods applied to study connectivity between distinct brain cortical regions, namely in focal epilepsies. In addition, with the aim of localizing the EZ, the approach based on graph theory will be described, since the study of the topological properties of the networks has strongly improved the study of brain connectivity mechanisms.

More precisely, we are interested in assessing three extreme trends in the interaction experience, namely flow (a perfect immersion within the task), stuck (a difficulty to maintain focused attention) and off-task (a drop out from the task). We propose a hierarchical probabilistic framework using a dynamic Bayesian network to simultaneously assess the probability of experiencing each trend, as well as the emotional responses occurring subsequently. The framework combines three-modality diagnostic variables that sense the learner's experience including physiology, behavior and performance, predictive variables that represent the current context and the learner's profile, and a dynamic structure that tracks the temporal evolution of the learner's experience. We describe the experimental study conducted to validate our approach. A protocol was established to elicit the three target trends as 44 participants interacted with three learning environments involving different cognitive tasks. Physiological activities (electroencephalography, skin conductance and blood volume pulse), patterns of the interaction, and performance during the task were recorded. We demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional non-dynamic modeling approaches such as static Bayesian networks, as well as three non-hierarchical formalisms including naive Bayes classifiers, decision trees and support vector machines.

Firstly, time segment selection and electroencephalogram channel selection are jointly performed for better discriminability of P300 and background signals. Secondly, in view of the situation that training data with labels are insufficient, we propose an iterative semi-supervised support vector machine for joint spatio-temporal feature selection as well as classification, in which both labeled training data and unlabeled test data are utilized. More importantly, the semi-supervised learning enables the adaptivity of the system. The performance of our algorithm has been evaluated through the analysis of a P300 dataset provided by BCI Competition 2005 and another dataset collected from an in-house P300 speller system. The results show that our algorithm for joint feature selection and classification achieves satisfactory performance, meanwhile it can significantly reduce the training effort of the system. Furthermore, this algorithm is implemented online and the corresponding results demonstrate that our algorithm can improve the adaptiveness of the P300-based BCI speller.

One critical cognitive event, turning a sensory stimulus into a meaningful linguistic sign, is the access of a semantic representation from memory. Little is known about the changes that activating a word's meaning brings about in cortical dynamics. We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) while participants read sentences that could contain a contextually unexpected word, such as 'cold' in 'In July it is very cold outside'. We reconstructed trajectories in phase space from single-trial EEG time series, and we applied three nonlinear measures of predictability and complexity to each side of the semantic access boundary, estimated as the onset time of the N400 effect evoked by critical words. Relative to controls, unexpected words were associated with larger prediction errors preceding the onset of the N400. Accessing the meaning of such words produced a phase transition to lower entropy states, in which cortical processing becomes more predictable and more regular. Our study sheds new light on the dynamics of information flow through interfaces between sensory and memory systems during language processing.

Efficiency of SSVEF Recognition from the Magnetoencephalogram A Comparison of Spectral Feature Classification and CCA-based Prediction	NEUROTECHNIX: PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON NEUROTECHNOLOGY, ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATICS			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Neurotechnology, Electronics and Informatics	SEP 18-20, 2013	Vilamoura, PORTUGAL			BCI; SSVEP; CCA; MEG; Virtual Reality Objects	MEG; EEG	Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) are a popular method to control braincomputer interfaces (BCI). Here, we present a BCI for selection of virtual reality (VR) objects by decoding the steady-state visual evoked fields (SSVEF), the magnetic analogue to the SSVEP in the magnetoencephalogram (MEG). In a conventional approach, we performed online prediction by Fourier transform (FT) in combination with a multivariate classifier. As a comparative study, we report our approach to increase the BCI-system performance in an offline evaluation. Therefore, we transferred the canonical correlation analysis (CCA), originally employed to recognize relatively low dimensional SSVEPs in the electroencephalogram (EEG), to SSVEF recognition in higher dimensional MEG recordings. We directly compare the performance of both approaches and conclude that CCA can greatly improve system performance in our MEG-based BCI-system. Moreover, we find that application of CCA to large multi-sensor MEG could provide an effective feature extraction method that automatically determines the sensors that are informative for the recognition of SSVEFs.

This failure of the BCI system to read the intention of the user is one of the greatest problems and challenges in BCI research. There are two main causes for this problem in SMR-based BCI systems: either no idle SMR is observed over motor areas of the user, or this idle rhythm is not modulated during motor imagery, resulting in a classification performance lower than 70% (criterion level) that renders the control of a BCI application (like a speller) difficult or impossible. Previously, we introduced the concept of machine learning based co-adaptive calibration, which provided substantially improved performance for a variety of users. Here, we use a similar approach and investigate to what extent co-adaptive learning enables significant BCI control for completely novice users, as well as for those who could not achieve control with a conventional SMR-based BCI.

By several combined techniques (Fourier and wavelet transform, derivative dynamic time warping, and waveform recognition), our approach extracts meaningful features (frequencies and special patterns like k-complexes and sleep spindles) from physiological recordings containing EEG, ECG, EOG and EMG data. Based on these pieces of information, an ensemble of decision trees is constructed using the principle of bagging, which classifies sleep epochs in their sleep stages according to the rules by Rechtschaffen and Kales and annotates occurrences of apnea-hypopnea (total or partial cessation of respiration). After that, case-based reasoning is applied in order to improve quality. We tested and evaluated our approach on several large public databases from PhysioBank, which showed an overall accuracy of 95.2% for sleep stage scoring and 94.5% for classifying minutes as apneic or non-apneic.

MEG, iEEG) provide high temporal resolution data to study the dynamics of neurocognitive networks: large scale neural assemblies involved in task-specific information processing. How does a neurocognitive network reorganize spatiotemporally on the order of a few milliseconds to process specific aspects of the task? At what times do networks segregate for task processing, and at what time scales does integration of information occur via changes in functional connectivity? Here, we propose a data analysis framework-Temporal microstructure of cortical networks (TMCN)-that answers these questions for EEG/MEG recordings in the signal space. Method validation is established on simulated MEG data from a delayed-match to-sample (DMS) task. We then provide an example application on MEG recordings during a paired associate task (modified from the simpler DMS paradigm) designed to study modality specific long term memory recall. Our analysis identified the times at which network segregation occurs for processing the memory recall of an auditory object paired to a visual stimulus (visual-auditory) in comparison to an analogous visual-visual pair. Across all subjects, onset times for first network divergence appeared within a range of 0.08-0.47 s after initial visual stimulus onset. This indicates that visual-visual and visual auditory memory recollection involves equivalent network components without any additional recruitment during an initial period of the sensory processing stage which is then followed by recruitment of additional network components for modality specific memory recollection. Therefore, we propose TMCN as a viable computational tool for extracting network timing in various cognitive tasks. Published by Elsevier Inc.

These techniques have either inherently low temporal or low spatial resolution, and suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio and/or poor high-frequency sensitivity. Thus, they are suboptimal for exploring the short-lived spatio-temporal dynamics of many of the underlying brain processes. In contrast, the invasive technique of electrocorticography (ECoG) provides brain signals that have an exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio, less susceptibility to artifacts than EEG, and a high spatial and temporal resolution (i.e., <1 cm/<1 millisecond, respectively). ECoG involves measurement of electrical brain signals using electrodes that are implanted subdurally on the surface of the brain. Recent studies have shown that ECoG amplitudes in certain frequency bands carry substantial information about task-related activity, such as motor execution and planning(1), auditory processing(2) and visual-spatial attention(3). Most of this information is captured in the high gamma range (around 70-110 Hz). Thus, gamma activity has been proposed as a robust and general indicator of local cortical function(1-5). ECoG can also reveal functional connectivity and resolve finer task-related spatial-temporal dynamics, thereby advancing our understanding of large-scale cortical processes. It has especially proven useful for advancing braincomputer interfacing (BCI) technology for decoding a user's intentions to enhance or improve communication(6) and control(7). Nevertheless, human ECoG data are often hard to obtain because of the risks and limitations of the invasive procedures involved, and the need to record within the constraints of clinical settings. Still, clinical monitoring to localize epileptic foci offers a unique and valuable opportunity to collect human ECoG data. We describe our methods for collecting recording ECoG, and demonstrate how to use these signals for important real-time applications such as clinical mapping and brain-computer interfacing. Our example uses the BCI2000 software platform(8,9) and the SIGFRIED(10) method, an application for real-time mapping of brain functions. This procedure yields information that clinicians can subsequently use to guide the complex and laborious process of functional mapping by electrical stimulation.	[Hill, N.

In this paper, the effect of the window functions in SSVEP based BCIs is discussed. EEC signal is a typical color noise with a high energy of the low frequency component. The main findings are that (I) The spectral leakage for EEC signals has some regular patterns. An obvious oscillation with the corresponding frequency can be observed. The amplitude of the oscillation decreases with the growth of the frequency. A short analysis is also given for the leakage. (2) The leakage from the low frequency component can be effectively suppressed by the using of some windows, such as Hamming, Hann and triangle window; (3) By removing the influence of the leakage from the low frequency component with high pass filter, the classification results are mainly determined by the width of the main lobe. The rectangle window would have a better accuracy than Hamming. Hann and triangle window. Some windows constructed with a narrower main lobe width have a potential use in SSVEP based BCIs.

J	Schurger, A; Marti, S; Dehaene, S				Schurger, Aaron; Marti, Sebastien; Dehaene, Stanislas			Reducing multi-sensor data to a single time course that reveals experimental effects	BMC NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Spatial filter; Electroencephalography; Magnetoencephalography; Electrocorticography; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Decoding; EEG; MEG; ECoG; fMRI		Background: Multi-sensor technologies such as EEG, MEG, and ECoG result in high-dimensional data sets. Given the high temporal resolution of such techniques, scientific questions very often focus on the time-course of an experimental effect. In many studies, researchers focus on a single sensor or the average over a subset of sensors covering a "region of interest" (ROI). However, single-sensor or ROI analyses ignore the fact that the spatial focus of activity is constantly changing, and fail to make full use of the information distributed over the sensor array. Methods: We describe a technique that exploits the optimality and simplicity of matched spatial filters in order to reduce experimental effects in multivariate time series data to a single time course. Each (multi-sensor) time sample of each trial is replaced with its projection onto a spatial filter that is matched to an observed experimental effect, estimated from the remaining trials (Effect-Matched Spatial filtering, or EMS filtering). The resulting set of time courses (one per trial) can be used to reveal the temporal evolution of an experimental effect, which distinguishes this approach from techniques that reveal the temporal evolution of an anatomical source or region of interest. Results: We illustrate the technique with data from a dual-task experiment and use it to track the temporal evolution of brain activity during the psychological refractory period. We demonstrate its effectiveness in separating the means of two experimental conditions, and in significantly improving the signal-to-noise ratio at the single-trial level. It is fast to compute and results in readily-interpretable time courses and topographies. The technique can be applied to any data-analysis question that can be posed independently at each sensor, and we provide one example, using linear regression, that highlights the versatility of the technique. Conclusion: The approach described here combines established techniques in a way that strikes a balance between power, simplicity, speed of processing, and interpretability. We have used it to provide a direct view of parallel and serial processes in the human brain that previously could only be measured indirectly. An implementation of the technique in MatLab is freely available via the internet.

The term "frontal absence" has been used to imply fast, secondary, 3-Hz generalisation from occult frontal foci with potential impact on clinical EEG interpretation and syndrome classification. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between focal and generalised SWDs. We studied five children with CAE and examined a sufficient number of focal ("interictal") and generalised SWDs in order to obtain reliable analysis. All generalised SWDs with focal lead-in were "decomposed" into their "pre-generalisation" focal and "generalised" constituents, which were studied separately. Two types of focal SWD ("interictal" and "pregeneralisation") and generalised SWD were visually clustered into groups, waveform-averaged, and plotted in the 2D-electrode space. Spatiotemporal analysis demonstrated a variety (mean: 4.2 per child; SD: 2.12) of mainly frontal and occipital locations for pre-generalisation focal SWDs with propagation along the longitudinal axis in either direction and across homologous sites. Interictal focal SWDs demonstrated similar spatiotemporal characteristics. In contrast, the topography and propagation patterns of the first generalised spike of the SWD showed less variability (mean: 2.5 per child; SD: 2.07), mainly involved the fronto-temporal/temporal areas, and correlated poorly (<10%) with that of the pre-generalisation focal SWD. Our findings suggest that the process of generalised epileptogenesis in genetic epilepsies with electrographic "frontal absences" is far more complex than that proposed by the model for occult frontal focus with fast secondary generalisation.

Menstrual migraine attacks are almost invariably without aura. Categorizing migraines into menstrual or non-menstrual types is one way to stratify migraines without aura according to the appendix criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders. We report a peri-menopausal woman whose sensory aura exclusively heralded menstrual migraine. A 51-year-old woman had suffered from monthly episodic headaches since the age of 46. Before a headache, and within 1 h on the first day of her menstruation, she always experienced numbness in her entire left upper limb. After the sensory aura, migrainous headaches occurred with nausea and photophobia. In the postmenopausal period, she no longer had sensory aura, and her headache pattern changed and became less severe. Her physical and neurologic exams as well as electroencephalography, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and conventional angiography were all normal. She fulfilled the diagnosis of pure menstrual migraine with typical sensory aura. To our knowledge, this is the first formal case report of pure menstrual migraine with aura.

RSVP triage is essentially a cortically-coupled computer vision technique that relies on single-trial detection of event-related potentials (ERP). In RSVP triage, images are shown to a subject in a rapid serial sequence. When a target image is seen by the subject, unique ERP characterized by P300 are elicited. Thus, in RSVP triage, accurate detection of such distinct ERP allows for fast searching of target images in large volume imagery. The accuracy of the distinct ERP detection in RSVP triage depends on the feature extraction method, for which the common spatial pattern analysis (CSP) was used with limited success. This paper presents a novel feature extraction method, termed common spatio-temporal pattern (CSTP), which is critical for robust single-trial detection of ERP. Unlike the conventional CSP, whereby only spatial patterns of ERP are considered, the present proposed method exploits spatial and temporal patterns of ERP separately, providing complementary spatial and temporal features for high accurate single-trial ERP detection. Numerical study using data collected from 20 subjects in RSVP triage experiments demonstrates that the proposed method offers significant performance improvement over the conventional CSP method (corrected p-value <0.05, Pearson r = 0.64) and other competing methods in the literature. This paper further shows that the main idea of CSTP can be easily applied to other methods.

In this study, a novel CIT method based on denoised P3 and machine learning was proposed to improve the accuracy of lie detection. Thirty participants were chosen as the guilty and innocent participants to perform the paradigms of 3 types of stimuli. The electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded and separated into many single trials. In order to enhance the signal noise ratio (SNR) of P3 components, the independent component analysis (ICA) method was adopted to separate non-P3 components (ie, artifacts) from every single trial. In order to automatically identify the P3 independent components (ICs), a new method based on topography template was proposed to automatically identify the P3 ICs. Then the P3 waveforms with high SNR were reconstructed on Pz electrodes. Second, the 3 groups of features based on time, frequency, and wavelets were extracted from the reconstructed P3 waveforms. Finally, 2 classes of feature samples were used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier because it has higher performance compared with several other classifiers. Meanwhile, the optimal number of P3 ICs and some other parameter values in the classifiers were determined by the cross-validation procedures. The presented method achieved a balance test accuracy of 84.29% on detecting P3 components for the guilty and innocent participants. The presented method improves the efficiency of CIT in comparison with previous reported methods.

To provide a more direct link to emergent perceptual states we have used holistic EEG/ERP paradigms where the moment of perceptual "discovery'' of a global pattern was variable. Using a rapid visual presentation of short-lived Mooney objects we found an increase of gamma-band activity locked to perceptual events. Additional experiments using dynamic Mooney stimuli showed that gamma activity increases well before the report of an emergent holistic percept. To confirm these findings in a data driven manner we have further used a support vector machine classification approach to distinguish between perceptual vs. non perceptual states, based on time-frequency features. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were all above 95%. Modulations in the 30-75 Hz range were larger for perception states. Interestingly, phase synchrony was larger for perception states for high frequency bands. By focusing on global gestalt mechanisms instead of local processing we conclude that gamma-band activity and synchrony provide a signature of holistic perceptual states of variable onset, which are separable from sensory and motor processing.

In this study, a biomedical system based on Learning Vector Quantization Neural Network (LVQ NN) has been developed in order to classify the internal carotid artery Doppler signals obtained from the 191 subjects, 136 of them had suffered from internal carotid artery stenosis and rest of them had been healthy subject. The system is composed of feature extraction and classification parts, basically. In the feature extraction stage, power spectral density (PSD) estimates of internal carotid artery Doppler signals were obtained by using Burg autoregressive (AR) spectrum analysis technique in order to obtain medical information. In the classification stage, LVQ NN was used classify features from Burg AR method. In experiments, LVQ NN based method reached 97.91% classification accuracy with 5 fold Cross Validation (CV) technique. In addition, the classification performance of the LVQ NN was compared with some methods such as Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) NN, Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), decision tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with sensitivity and specificity statistical parameters. The classification results showed that the LVQ NN method is effective for classification of internal carotid artery Doppler signals.

In this study, the theta rhythms were studied while rats either walked or were passively translated by a toy car on a linear track (referred to as WALK and TRANS respectively). For the similar running speeds in WALK and TRANS conditions, theta frequency and amplitude were both reduced during TRANS. Theta modulation of pyramidal cells during TRANS was reduced compared to that during WALK. Theta frequency was positively correlated with translation speed during TRANS. Theta rhythm remained apparent during TRANS and WALK after large dose of atropine sulfate (blocking the cholinergic pathway) was injected compared to still states. The present study demonstrated the patterns of theta rhythm induced by passive translation in rats and suggested that the Type I theta rhythm could occur during non-voluntary locomotion. We further argued that the perception of actual self-motion may be the underlying mechanism that initiates and modulates type I theta. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

MOBBED: a computational data infrastructure for handling large collections of event-rich time series datasets in MATLAB	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						MATLAB; database; time series; events; EEG; EEGLAB; big data; provenance		Experiments to monitor human brain activity during active behavior record a variety of modalities (e.g., EEG, eye tracking, motion capture, respiration monitoring) and capture a complex environmental context leading to large, event-rich time series datasets. The considerable variability of responses within and among subjects in more realistic behavioral scenarios requires experiments to assess many more subjects over longer periods of time. This explosion of data requires better computational infrastructure to more systematically explore and process these collections. MOBBED is a lightweight, easy-to-use, extensible toolkit that allows users to incorporate a computational database into their normal MATLAB workflow. Although capable of storing quite general types of annotated data, MOBBED is particularly oriented to multichannel time series such as EEG that have event streams overlaid with sensor data. MOBBED directly supports access to individual events, data frames, and time-stamped feature vectors, allowing users to ask questions such as what types of events or features co-occur under various experimental conditions. A database provides several advantages not available to users who process one dataset at a time from the local file system. In addition to archiving primary data in a central place to save space and avoid inconsistencies, such a database allows users to manage, search, and retrieve events across multiple datasets without reading the entire dataset. The database also provides infrastructure for handling more complex event patterns that include environmental and contextual conditions. The database can also be used as a cache for expensive intermediate results that are reused in such activities as cross-validation of machine learning algorithms. MOBBED is implemented over PostgreSQL, a widely used open source database, and is freely available under the GNU general public license at http://visual.cs.utsa.edu/mobbed.

This effect is more pronounced in the chronic state, which can be reached approximately 6 months after the lesion. As many of the brain-computer interfaces (BCI) developed to date rely on the user motor activity, loss of this activity hinders the application of BCI technology for rehabilitation or motor compensation in these patients. This work is a preliminary study with three quadriplegic patients close to reaching the chronic state, addressing two questions: (i) whether it is still possible to use BCI technology to detect motor intention of the paralyzed hand at this state of chronicity; and (ii) whether it is better for the BCI decoding to rely on the motor attempt or the motor imagery of the hand as mental paradigm. The results show that one of the three patients had already lost the motor programs related to the hand, so it was not possible to build a motor-related BCI for him. For the other patients it was suitable to design a BCI based on both paradigms, but the results were better using motor attempt as it has broader activation associated patterns that are easier to recognize.				edulop@unizar.es; antelis@unizar.es; mon-tesano@unizar.es; amgila@sescam.jccm.es; jminguez@unizar.es	López-Larraz, Eduardo/AAB-9689-2019; Gil-Agudo, Ángel/ABD-3065-2021; Antelis, Javier M./W-3381-2019	López-Larraz, Eduardo/0000-0001-5482-1347; Gil-Agudo, Ángel/0000-0001-5082-4225; Antelis, Javier M./0000-0003-3377-0813; Minguez Zafra, Javier/0000-0002-2957-0133					17	26	26	0	5	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1557-170X		978-1-4577-1787-1	IEEE ENG MED BIO			2012							1798	1801						4	Engineering, Biomedical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BDH78	23366260				2022-08-02	WOS:000313296502012

Brain source localization: A new method based on MUltiple SIgnal Classification algorithm and spatial sparsity of the field signal for electroencephalogram measurements	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS			English	Article								Brain activity can be recorded by means of EEG (Electroencephalogram) electrodes placed on the scalp of the patient. The EEG reflects the activity of groups of neurons located in the head, and the fundamental problem in neurophysiology is the identification of the sources responsible of brain activity, especially if a seizure occurs and in this case it is important to identify it. The studies conducted in order to formalize the relationship between the electromagnetic activity in the head and the recording of the generated external field allow to know pattern of brain activity. The inverse problem, that is given the sampling field at different electrodes the underlying asset must be determined, is more difficult because the problem may not have a unique solution, or the search for the solution is made difficult by a low spatial resolution which may not allow to distinguish between activities involving sources close to each other. Thus, sources of interest may be obscured or not detected and known method in source localization problem as MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification) could fail. Many advanced source localization techniques achieve a best resolution by exploiting sparsity: if the number of sources is small as a result, the neural power vs. location is sparse. In this work a solution based on the spatial sparsity of the field signal is presented and analyzed to improve MUSIC method. For this purpose, it is necessary to set a priori information of the sparsity in the signal. The problem is formulated and solved using a regularization method as Tikhonov, which calculates a solution that is the better compromise between two cost functions to minimize, one related to the fitting of the data, and another concerning the maintenance of the sparsity of the signal. At the first, the method is tested on simulated EEG signals obtained by the solution of the forward problem. Relatively to the model considered for the head and brain sources, the result obtained allows to have a significant improvement compared to the classical MUSIC method, with a small margin of uncertainty about the exact location of the sources. In fact, the constraints of the spatial sparsity on the signal field allow to concentrate power in the directions of active sources, and consequently it is possible to calculate the position of the sources within the considered volume conductor. Later, the method is tested on the real EEG data too. The result is in accordance with the clinical report even if improvements are necessary to have further accurate estimates of the positions of the sources. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

Real-time decoding of the direction of covert visuospatial attention	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; SPATIAL ATTENTION; CORTICAL CONTROL; FUNCTIONAL MRI; FMRI; FIELD; COMMUNICATION; MODULATION; HUMANS	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) make it possible to translate a person's intentions into actions without depending on the muscular system. Brain activity is measured and classified into commands, thereby creating a direct link between the mind and the environment, enabling, e. g., cursor control or navigation of a wheelchair or robot. Most BCI research is conducted with scalp EEG but recent developments move toward intracranial electrodes for paralyzed people. The vast majority of BCI studies focus on the motor system as the appropriate target for recording and decoding movement intentions. However, properties of the visual system may make the visual system an attractive and intuitive alternative. We report on a study investigating feasibility of decoding covert visuospatial attention in real time, exploiting the full potential of a 7 T MRI scanner to obtain the necessary signal quality, capitalizing on earlier fMRI studies indicating that covert visuospatial attention changes activity in the visual areas that respond to stimuli presented in the attended area of the visual field. Healthy volunteers were instructed to shift their attention from the center of the screen to one of four static targets in the periphery, without moving their eyes from the center. During the first part of the fMRI-run, the relevant brain regions were located using incremental statistical analysis. During the second part, the activity in these regions was extracted and classified, and the subject was given visual feedback of the result. Performance was assessed as the number of trials where the real-time classifier correctly identified the direction of attention. On average, 80% of trials were correctly classified (chance level <25%) based on a single image volume, indicating very high decoding performance. While we restricted the experiment to five attention target regions (four peripheral and one central), the number of directions can be higher provided the brain activity patterns can be distinguished. In summary, the visual system promises to be an effective target for BCI control.	[Andersson, Patrik; Viergever, Max A.; Pluim, Josien P.

Such single trial detection requires a robust response that can be detected in a variety task conditions. Here, we investigated the influence of target probability, a key factor known to influence the amplitude of the evoked response, on single trial target classification in a difficult rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task. Our classification approach for detecting target vs. non target responses, considers spatial filters obtained through the maximization of the signal to signal-plus-noise ratio, and then uses the resulting information as inputs to a Bayesian discriminant analysis. The method is evaluated across eight healthy subjects, on four probability conditions (P=0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50). We show that the target probability has a statistically significant effect on both the behavioral performance and the target detection. The best mean area under the ROC curve is achieved with P=0.10, AUC=0.82. These results suggest that optimal performance of ERP detection in RSVP tasks is critically dependent on target probability.

Diffusion-weighted imaging changes in cerebral watershed distribution following neonatal encephalopathy are not invariably associated with an adverse outcome	DEVELOPMENTAL MEDICINE AND CHILD NEUROLOGY			English	Article							HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; PERINATAL ASPHYXIA; BRAIN-INJURY; MR SPECTROSCOPY; TERM NEWBORNS; PATTERNS; INFANTS; HYPOTHERMIA; CLASSIFICATION; ULEGYRIA	Aim Patterns of injury in term-born infants with neonatal encephalopathy following hypoxia-ischaemia are seen earlier and are more conspicuous on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) than on conventional imaging. Although the prognostic value of DW-MRI in infants with basal ganglia and thalamic damage has been established, data in infants in whom there is extensive injury in a watershed distribution are limited. The aim of this study was to assess cognitive and functional motor outcome in a cohort of infants with changes in a predominantly watershed distribution injury on neonatal cerebral MRI, including DWI. Method DW-MRI findings in infants with neonatal encephalopathy following hypoxia-ischaemia were evaluated retrospectively. Twenty-two infants in whom DWI changes exhibited a predominantly watershed distribution were enrolled in the study (10 males, 12 females; mean birthweight 3337g, 2830-3900g; mean gestational age 40.5wks, 37.9-42.1wks). Follow-up MRI data at the age of 3months (n=15) and over the age of 18months (n=7) were analysed. In survivors, neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed with the Griffiths Mental Development Scales at the age of at least 18months. Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography was used to score background patterns and the occurrence of epileptiform activity. Results DW-MRI revealed abnormalities that were bilateral in all infants and symmetrical in 10. The posterior regions were more severely affected in five infants and the anterior regions in three. Watershed injury occurred in isolation in 10 out of 22 infants and was associated with involvement of the basal ganglia and thalami in the other 12, of whom seven died. Cystic evolution, seen on MRI at age 3months, occurred in three of the 15 surviving infants. Neurodevelopmental assessment of the surviving infants was performed at a median age of 35months (range 18-48mo). Of the five survivors with basal ganglia and thalamic involvement, two developed cerebral palsy, one had a developmental quotient of less than 85, and two had a normal outcome. Of the 10 infants with isolated watershed injury, nine had an early normal motor and cognitive outcome. In all infants with a favourable outcome, background recovery was seen on amplitude integrated EEG within 48hours after birth. Conclusion Extensive DWI changes in a watershed distribution in term-born neonates are not invariably associated with adverse sequelae, even in the presence of cystic evolution. Associated lesions of the basal ganglia and thalami are a better predictor of adverse sequelae than the extent and severity of the watershed abnormalities seen on DW-MRI.

J	Adnane, M; Jiang, ZW; Yan, ZH				Adnane, Mourad; Jiang, Zhongwei; Yan, Zhonghong			Sleep-wake stages classification and sleep efficiency estimation using single-lead electrocardiogram	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Sleep staging; HRV; Sleep ECG; Pattern recognition; Time series analysis; Feature selection	FLUCTUATION ANALYSIS; VARIABILITY; SELECTION	Detecting sleep-wake stages is of paramount importance in the study of sleep. Conventional methods of sleep-wake stages classification are based on processing physiological signals such as, electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG) that are, mainly, recorded in hospitals using polysomnography (PSG) systems. In this paper, we present an automatic sleep-wake stages classifier method using a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Then, an important sleep quality marker called sleep efficiency is measured using classifier results. The method is based on the extraction, according to three methods, of several features from the heart rate series (RR series). The three methods are, the heart rate variability (HRV) and the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and a method we propose based on the calculation of local energy of detrended profile of RR series; inspired by DFA we call it windowed DFA (WDFA). A subject-specific scheme was adopted, where a part (around 20%) of a subject's data was used to train the classifier and the remaining part (around 80%) is used for the classification, two sets of features were used, i.e., 12 features, initially, and the optimal set of features (10 features in this paper) selected by the support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) system. The method was tested on the MIT/BIH Polysomnographic Database (MITBPD) using support vector machine (SVM) for training and classification. A mean classification accuracy of 79.31% (12 features, Cohen's kappa value kappa = 0.41) and 79.99% (10 features, kappa = 0.43) are reported. Finally, the measure of sleep efficiency was made using the classification results and compared to the actual sleep efficiency values; an average error of 4.52% and 4.64% are reported for the case of 12 features and 10 features, respectively. The method showed good potential for detecting changes in time series and in the sleep-wake stages classification, which prove that an approach with a single ECG lead can be sufficient to estimate an important sleep quality marker which is the sleep efficiency.

Most MI BCIs use power features in the mu or beta rhythms, while several results have been reported using a measure of phase synchrony, the phase-locking value (PLV). In this study, we investigated the performance of various phase-based features, including instantaneous phase difference (IPD) and PLV, for control of a MI BCI. Patterns of phase synchrony differentially appear over the motor cortices and between the primary motor cortex (M1) and supplementary motor area (SMA) during MI. Offline results, along with preliminary online sessions, indicate that IPD serves as a robust control signal for differentiating between MI classes, and that the phase relations between channels are relatively stable over several months. Offline and online trial-level classification accuracies based on IPD ranged from 84% to 99%, whereas the performance for the corresponding amplitude features ranged from 70% to 100%.

In BCI systems, activation and delay are well known issues in conducting experiments. The delay of meaningful brain signal depends on subjects, tasks and experimental design. Therefore, within a trial it is not easy to identify where meaningful brain signal starts and ends. Most of current methods estimate the delay and extract a portion of meaningful brain signal in a trial and use this signal as a representative for the whole trial. Instead of doing so, our proposed aggregate model divides a trial into overlapping frames and treat them equally. These frames are classified and their results are then aggregated together to form classification result of the trial. From the general aggregate model, we derive two specific aggregate models using two stateof-the-art Common Spatial Patterns (CSP)-based methods for feature extraction. We performed experiments on Dataset 2a used in BCI Competition IV to evaluate the proposed models. This dataset was designed for motor imagery classification with 4 classes. Preliminary experimental results show that our proposed aggregate models are up to 8% better than the original CSP-based methods. Furthermore, we show that our aggregate model can be easily extended to online BCI systems.

Detecting and characterizing these transitions in dynamical states of the brain is a critical issue in the field of neuroscience and psychiatry. In the current study, a novel method is proposed to quantify brain macrostates (e. g., sleep stages or cognitive states) from shifts of dynamical microstates or dynamical nonstationarity. A "dynamical microstate" is a temporal unit of the information processing in the brain with fixed dynamical parameters and specific spatial distribution. In this proposed approach, a phase-space-based dynamical dissimilarity map (DDM) is used to detect transitions between dynamically stationary microstates in the time series, and Tsallis time-dependent entropy is applied to quantify dynamical patterns of transitions in the DDM. We demonstrate that the DDM successfully detects transitions between microstates of different temporal dynamics in the simulated physiological time series against high levels of noise. Based on the assumption of nonlinear, deterministic brain dynamics, we also demonstrate that dynamical nonstationarity analysis is useful to quantify brain macrostates (sleep stages I, II, III, IV, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep) from sleep EEGs with an overall accuracy of 77%. We suggest that dynamical nonstationarity is a useful tool to quantify macroscopic mental states (statistical integration) of the brain using dynamical transitions at the microscopic scale in physiological data.

J	Moulson, MC; Balas, B; Nelson, C; Sinha, P				Moulson, Margaret C.; Balas, Benjamin; Nelson, Charles; Sinha, Pawan			EEG correlates of categorical and graded face perception	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Face perception; Event-related potentials; N170; Single-trial classification	TEMPORAL CORTEX; VISUAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; N170; OBJECT; COMPONENT; ERPS; CATEGORIZATION; POTENTIALS; HUMANS	Face perception is a critical social ability and identifying its neural correlates is important from both basic and applied perspectives. In EEG recordings, faces elicit a distinct electrophysiological signature, the N170, which has a larger amplitude and shorter latency in response to faces compared to other objects. However, determining the face specificity of any neural marker for face perception hinges on finding an appropriate control stimulus. We used a novel stimulus set consisting of 300 images that spanned a continuum between random patches of natural scenes and genuine faces, in order to explore the selectivity of face-sensitive ERP responses with a model-based parametric stimulus set. Critically, our database contained "false alarm" images that were misclassified as face by computational face-detection system and varied in their image-level similarity to real faces. High-density (128-channel) event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while 23 adult subjects viewed all 300 images in random order, and determined whether each image was a face or non-face. The goal of our analyses was to determine the extent to which a gradient of sensitivity to face-like structure was evident in the ERP signal. Traditional waveform analyses revealed that the N170 component over occipitotemporal electrodes was larger in amplitude for faces compared to all non-faces, even those that were high in image similarity to faces, suggesting strict selectivity for veridical face stimuli. By contrast, single-trial classification of the entire waveform measured at the same sensors revealed that misclassifications of non-face patterns as faces increased with image-level similarity to faces. These results suggest that individual components may exhibit steep selectivity, but integration of multiple waveform features may afford graded information regarding stimulus appearance.

A Tensorial Approach to Access Cognitive Workload related to Mental Arithmetic from EEG Functional Connectivity Estimates	2013 35TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 03-07, 2013	Osaka, JAPAN	IEEE Engn Med Biol Soc, Japanese Soc Med & Biol Engn			BRAIN; DYNAMICS; FMRI	The association of functional connectivity patterns with particular cognitive tasks has long been a topic of interest in neuroscience, e.g., studies of functional connectivity have demonstrated its potential use for decoding various brain states. However, the high-dimensionality of the pairwise functional connectivity limits its usefulness in some real-time applications. In the present study, the methodology of tensor subspace analysis (TSA) is used to reduce the initial highdimensionality of the pairwise coupling in the original functional connectivity network to a space of condensed descriptive power, which would significantly decrease the computational cost and facilitate the differentiation of brain states. We assess the feasibility of the proposed method on EEG recordings when the subject was performing mental arithmetic task which differ only in the difficulty level (easy: 1-digit addition v.s. 3-digit additions). Two different cortical connective networks were detected, and by comparing the functional connectivity networks in different work states, it was found that the task-difficulty is best reflected in the connectivity structure of sub-graphs extending over parietooccipital sites. Incorporating this data-driven information within original TSA methodology, we succeeded in predicting the difficulty level from connectivity patterns in an efficient way that can be implemented so as to work in real-time.

The goal was to optimize the BCI individually in order to achieve high performance within few sessions for all users. Eight able-bodied volunteers, who were initially naive to the use of a BCI, participated in 10 sessions over a period of about 5 weeks. In an initial screening session, users were asked to perform the following seven mental tasks while multi-channel EEG was recorded: mental rotation, word association, auditory imagery, mental subtraction, spatial navigation, motor imagery of the left hand and motor imagery of both feet. Out of these seven mental tasks, the best 4-class combination as well as most reactive frequency band (between 8-30 Hz) was selected individually for online control. Classification was based on common spatial patterns and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis. The number and time of classifier updates varied individually. Selection speed was increased by reducing trial length. To minimize differences in brain activity between sessions with and without feedback, sham feedback was provided in the screening and calibration runs in which usually no real-time feedback is shown. Selected task combinations and frequency ranges differed between users. The tasks that were included in the 4-class combination most often were (1) motor imagery of the left hand (2), one brain-teaser task (word association or mental subtraction) (3), mental rotation task and (4) one more dynamic imagery task (auditory imagery, spatial navigation, imagery of the feet). Participants achieved mean performances over sessions of 44-84% and peak performances in single-sessions of 58-93% in this user-centered 4-class BCI protocol. This protocol is highly adjustable to individual users and thus could increase the percentage of users who can gain and maintain BCI control. A high priority for future work is to examine this protocol with severely disabled users.	[Friedrich, Elisabeth V.

In this study, a new approach based on wavelet coefficients (WCs) and kernel learning algorithm is proposed to identify concealed information. Totally 16 subjects went through the designed CIT paradigm and the multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded. Then, the high-dimensional WCs of ERP in delta, theta, alpha and beta rhythms were extracted. For the analysis of the data, kernel principle component analysis (KPCA) and a support vector machines (SVM) classifier are implemented. The results show that WCs features are significant differences between concealed information and irrelevant information (P < 0.05). The KPCA is able to effectively reduce feature dimensionalities and increase generalization performance of SVM. A high accuracy (93.6%) in recognizing concealed information and irrelevant information is achieved, which indicates the combination KPCA and SVM may provide a useful tool for detecting the concealed information.

The interest scores are based on decoding the electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of target detection, attentional shifts and self-monitoring processes, which result from the user paying attention to target images interspersed in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) sequences. The highest scored images are passed to a semi-supervised computer vision system that reorganizes the image database accordingly, using a graph-based representation that captures visual similarity between images. The system can either query the user for more information, by adaptively resampling the database to create additional RSVP sequences, or it can converge to a 'done' state. The done state includes a final ranking of the image database and also a 'guess' of the user's chosen category of interest. We find that the closed-loop system's re-rankings can substantially expedite database searches for target image categories chosen by the subjects. Furthermore, better reorganizations are achieved than by relying on EEG interest rankings alone, or if the system were simply run in an open loop format without adaptive resampling.

In this study, we sought to determine abnormal patterns of resting-state EEG oscillations and functional connectivity in patients with SLPE, compared with nonpsychotic epilepsy patients, and to assess correlations with psychopathological deficits. Methodology/Principal Findings: Resting EEG was recorded in 21 patients with focal epilepsy and SLPE and in 21 clinically-matched non-psychotic epilepsy controls. Source current density and functional connectivity were determined using eLORETA software. For connectivity analysis, a novel nonlinear connectivity measure called "lagged phase synchronization" was used. We found increased theta oscillations in regions involved in the default mode network (DMN), namely the medial and lateral parietal cortex bilaterally in the psychotic patients relative to their nonpsychotic counterparts. In addition, patients with psychosis had increased beta temporo-prefrontal connectivity in the hemisphere with predominant seizure focus. This functional connectivity in temporo-prefrontal circuits correlated with positive symptoms. Additionally, there was increased interhemispheric phase synchronization between the auditory cortex of the affected temporal lobe and the Broca's area correlating with auditory hallucination scores. Conclusions/Significance: In addition to dysfunction of parietal regions that are part of the DMN, resting-state disrupted connectivity of the medial temporal cortex with prefrontal areas that are either involved in the DMN or implicated in psychopathological dysfunction may be critical to schizophrenia-like psychosis, especially in individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy. This suggests that DMN deficits might be a core neurobiological feature of the disorder, and that abnormalities in theta oscillations and beta phase synchronization represent the underlying neural activity.

This method simultaneously analyses data in several domains. It is based on the projection of a data tensor to a low dimensional space using all variables to create a final model. In the present paper the L1-Penalized NPLS is proposed for sparse BCI system calibration allowing to combine the projection technique with an effective selection of subset of features. The L1-Penalized NPLS was applied for binary self-paced BCI system calibration providing a subset of electrodes selection. Our BCI system is designed for animal research in particular for research in non-human primates.

They do this by generating random noise and then filtering the noise with adaptive filters. We simulate the operation with the solutions of matrices of ordinary differential equations that predict subcritical Hopf bifurcations between point and limit cycle attractors. The second step is integration of the outputs from the several sensory systems into a multisensory percept, called a gestalt, which in the third step is consolidated and stored as knowledge. Simulation of the second step requires use of landscapes of non-convergent chaotic attractors. This is not deterministic chaos, which is much too brittle owing to the infinite sensitivity to initial conditions. It is a hybrid form we call stochastic chaos, which is stabilized by additive noise modeled on noise sources in the sensory systems. Thus bifurcation and chaos theory provides tools for succinct empirical models of cortical dynamics performing the most basic cognitive operations: generalization, abstraction, and categorization in constructing knowledge. The descriptions are in a form that is suitable for more advanced modeling using analog VLSI, neuropercolation from random graph theory, non-equilibrium dissipative thermodynamics, and macroscopic many-body physics.

In order to properly assess the interactions between changes in state and changes in ventilatory parameters, a methodology capable of continuously and reliably detecting state transitions is needed. Traditional fixed-epoch analysis of polysomnographic recordings is not suitable for this purpose. Moreover, visual identification of changes in the dominant electroencephalogram activity at the transition from wakefulness to sleep and vice versa is often very subjective. We have therefore developed a hybrid approach including both visual scoring and computer-based procedures for continuous analysis of state transitions from polysomnographic recordings, specifically tailored for fluctuations between wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement-1 and -2 sleep. The overall analysis process comprises three major phases: (1) manual identification of relevant electroencephalogram/electrooculogram features and events, including a sample of unequivocal alpha and theta-delta activity; (2) automatic statistical discrimination of dominant electroencephalogram activity; and (3) state classification (wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement-1 and -2). The latter is carried out by merging information from visual scoring with the output of the discriminator. Validation has been carried out in 16 patients with heart failure during daytime CheyneStokes respiration, using a training and testing set of electroencephalogram polysomnograms. The statistical discriminator correctly classified 99.1 +/- 1.4% and 99.2 +/- 1.1% of unequivocal alpha and theta-delta activity. This approach has therefore the potential to be used to reliably measure the incidence and location of sleepwake transitions during abnormal breathing patterns, as well as their temporal relationship with major ventilatory events.

We present a system for wireless recording of micro-ECoG activity in a primate performing reach-to-grasp movements. The system is comprised of a head-mounted interface, off-the-shelf receiver module, and custom software written in Labview for real-time data monitoring and storage. The head-mounted interface is composed of a custom-designed VLSI neural recording front, a commercially available FSK transmitter module, a digital interface, and a battery. The system offers a fixed gain of 40 dB, programmable bandwidth settings in the 0.1 Hz to 8.2 kHz range, digital gain of 1-16, and ADC resolution of 8-12 bits. The interface consumes 6.7 mA of current from a 3.7 V battery and transmits digitized data at 1 Mbps rate. The system offers less than 0.25% dropped packets at 3m non-line-of-sight distance. We then used the wirelessly recorded ECoG signal from the dorsal premotor cortex region to decode the movement state of the animal. The ECoG spectral features could decode the movement state, achieving close to 70% accuracy as early as 100 ms prior to actual movement onset. Our system offers a new avenue for future ECoG-based brain-machine interface systems.

Interactive rTMS protocols in psychiatry	ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE			French	Article						Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Adaptation; Major depressive disorder; Cognitive; Alpha EEG	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; BRAIN-STIMULATION; MAJOR DEPRESSION; EEG; EXCITABILITY; TMS; NEUROFEEDBACK; MODULATION; EFFICACY; THERAPY	Background. - The efficiency of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of psychiatric disorders is robust for major depressive episode (MDE) while results are encouraging for schizophrenia. However, rTMS protocols need to be optimized. Basic researches in TMS led to the concept of "state dependency TMS". This concept suggests that the neural circuits' activation states, before and during the stimulation, influence the pulse effect. Indeed, TMS effect must be seen, not simply as a stimulus, but also as the result of an interaction between a stimulus and a level of brain activity. Those data suggest that rTMS efficiency could be increased in psychiatric disorders by triggering patients' neurocognitive activities during stimulation. Thus "interactive rTMS protocols" have been submitted. Objectives. - This article provides a review and a classification of different interactive protocols implemented in the treatment of MDE and schizophrenia. Protocols' interactions with cognitive activities and brain electrical activities will be discussed. Literature findings. - Interactive rTMS protocols that manipulate cognitive activities have been developed for MDE treatments. They aim at regulating emotional states of depressed patients during the stimulation. The patients perform emotional tasks in order to activate cortical networks involving the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) into a state that may be more sensitive to the rTMS pulse effect. Simultaneous cognitive behavioral therapy ("CBT rTMS") and cognitive-emotional reactivation ("affective rTMS") have thus been tested during left DLPFC rTMS in MDE. Interactive rTMS protocols that manipulate brain electrical activities have been developed for MDE and schizophrenia treatments. Two categories of protocols should be identified. In the first set, personalized brain activity has been analyzed to determine the parameters of stimulation (i.e. frequency of stimulation) matching the patient ("personalized rTMS"). Personalized rTMS protocols can be made "online" or "offline" depending on whether the EEG activity is measured during or prior to rTMS. Online protocol is called "contingent rTMS": it consists in stimulating the brain only when a specific EEG pattern involving the intensity of alpha rhythm is recorded and recognized. Offline protocol is called "alpha rTMS", and relies on ascertaining frequency of stimulation in accordance with personalized alpha peak frequency prior to rTMS. In the second set, electrical brain activity is modulated before or during rTMS in order to stimulate the DLPFC in optimal conditions. Brain activity modulation may be obtained by transcranial direct current stimulation ("tDCS rTMS") or EEG-biofeedack ("EEG-biofeedback rTMS"). Conclusion. - Interactive rTMS studies have various limitations, notably their exploratory character on a small sample of patients. Furthermore, their theoretical neurocognitive framework justification remains unclear. Nonetheless, interactive rTMS protocols allow us to consider a new field of rTMS, where cognitive and cerebral activities would no longer be considered as simple neural noise, leading to a kind of "first person rTMS", and certainly to innovative therapy in psychiatry.

Beta oscillations (12-40 Hz) occur in motor cortical LFPs, but their functional relevance remains controversial. Power modulation studies have related beta oscillations to a "resting" motor cortex, postural maintenance, attention, sensorimotor binding and planning. Frequency modulations were largely overlooked. We here describe context-related beta frequency modulations in motor cortical LFPs. Two monkeys performed a reaching task with 2 delays. The first delay demanded attention in time in expectation of the visual spatial cue, whereas the second delay involved visuomotor integration and movement preparation. The frequency in 2 beta bands (around 20 and 30 Hz) was systematically 2-5 Hz lower during cue expectancy than during visuomotor integration and preparation. Furthermore, the frequency was directionally selective during preparation, with about 3 Hz difference between preferred and nonpreferred directions. Direction decoding with frequency gave similar accuracy as with beta power, and decoding accuracy improved significantly when combining power and frequency, suggesting that frequency might provide an additional signal for brain-machine interfaces. In conclusion, multiple beta bands coexist in motor cortex, and frequency modulations within each band are as behaviorally meaningful as power modulations, reflecting the changing behavioral context and the movement direction during preparation.

To extract the useful information in the EMG signal, feature extraction method should be performed. The extracted features of the EMG signal are usually calculated based on linear or statistical methods, but the EMG signal exhibits the nonlinear and more complex in the properties. With recent advances in nonlinear analysis we are proposing the study of the EMG signals from upper-limb movements using Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) method. This study used EMG signals obtained from eight upper-limb movements and five muscle positions as representative EMG signals. The usefulness of the DFA method has been proposed to discriminate the upper-limb movements. Complete comparative studies of an optimal parameter of the DFA method were performed. From the viewpoints of maximum class separability, robustness, and complexity, scaling exponent obtained from the DFA method shows the appropriateness to be used as a feature in the classification of the EMG signal. From the experimental results, an optimal DFA method is obtained under these conditions: the minimum box size is approximately four, the maximum box size is one-tenth of the signal length, the box size increment is based on a power of two, and the quadratic polynomial fits is used in the fitting procedure. Moreover, the classification performance of the DFA method is better than other existing nonlinear methods, including the Higuchi's method.

The visual interpretation of iPET is challenging and requires years of epilepsy-specific expertise. We have developed an automated computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) tool that has the potential to work both independent of and synergistically with expert analysis. Our tool operates on distributed metabolic changes across the whole brain measured by iPET to both diagnose and lateralize temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). When diagnosing left TLE (LTLE) or right TLE (RTLE) vs. non-epileptic seizures (NES), our accuracy in reproducing the results of the gold standard long term video-EEG monitoring was 82% [95% confidence interval (CI) 69-90%] or 88% (95% CI 76-94%), respectively. The classifier that both diagnosed and lateralized the disease had overall accuracy of 76% (95% CI 66-84%), where 89% (95% CI 77-96%) of patients correctly identified with epilepsy were correctly lateralized. When identifying LTLE, our CAD tool utilized metabolic changes across the entire brain. By contrast, only temporal regions and the right frontal lobe cortex, were needed to identify RTLE accurately, a finding consistent with clinical observations and indicative of a potential pathophysiological difference between RTLE and LTLE. The goal of CADs is to complement not replace expert analysis. In our dataset, the accuracy of manual analysis (MA) of iPET (similar to 80%) was similar to CAD. The square correlation between our CAD tool and MA, however, was only 30%, indicating that our CAD tool does not recreate MA. The addition of clinical information to our CAD, however, did not substantively change performance. These results suggest that automated analysis might provide clinically valuable information to focus treatment more effectively.

In particular, prototype heuristics propositions that innovation may engage automatic activation of a prototype such as a biological system to form novel associations between a prototype's function and problem-solving. We speculated that the cortical dissociation between the automatic activation and forming novel associations in innovation is critical point to heuristic creativity. In the present study, novel and old scientific innovations (NSI and OSI) were selected as experimental materials in using learning-testing paradigm to explore the neural basis of scientific innovation induced by heuristic prototype. College students were required to resolve NSI problems (to which they did not know the answers) and OSI problems (to which they knew the answers). From two fMRI experiments, our results showed that the subjects could resolve NSI when provided with heuristic prototypes. In Experiment 1, it was found that the lingual gyrus (LG; BA18) might be related to prototype heuristics in college students resolving NSI after learning a relative prototype. In Experiment 2, the LG (BA18) and precuneus (BA31) were significantly activated for NSI compared to OSI when college students learned all prototypes one day before the test. In addition, the mean beta-values of these brain regions of NSI were all correlated with the behavior accuracy of NSI. As our hypothesis indicated, the findings suggested that the LG might be involved in forming novel associations using heuristic information, while the precuneus might be involved in the automatic activation of heuristic prototype during scientific innovation.

The standard technique consists on monitoring various bio-physiological signals of the patient during sleep. The resulting recording, the polysomnography (PSG) is then analyzed offline by the physician. This supposes a very time-consuming task and therefore automation of these analyses is desirable. An arousal during sleep is defined as an abrupt shift in EEG frequency. Normal structure of sleep is altered by the presence of these events, thus being an important factor that influences on the quality of sleep. The use of computing assistance for the detection of these events on the PSG is aimed at reducing the cost of the PSG test, both in economical and human resources. In this work, a dataset containing PSGs of real patients was used for the detection of arousals in sleep. A total of 42 features were extracted from biosignals for the detection of these events. Our aim was to use different feature selection methods to eliminate the redundant features studying their influence on the identification of sleep arousals, checking whether classification could be improved. The objective is to reduce the number of features, identifying the subset of those with more relevance while preserving a good performance on the classifier. Two approximations are explored, wrappers and filters, using different methods of both, and also combinations of each of the methods by means of the union and the intersection of the relevant features obtained. The results showed that discarding the irrelevant features by these methods is feasible, reducing the dimensionality on the input space and also improving the accuracy of the classifiers.

J	VanRullen, R				VanRullen, Rufin			Four common conceptual fallacies in mapping the time course of recognition	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						visual timing; methodological and conceptual mistakes; EEG; backward-masking; rapid serial visual presentation; low-level image properties; response bias; signal filtering	RAPID VISUAL CATEGORIZATION; SPEED	Determining the moment at which a visual recognition process is completed, or the order in which various processes come into play, are fundamental steps in any attempt to understand human recognition abilities, or to replicate the corresponding hierarchy of neuronal mechanisms within artificial systems. Common experimental paradigms for addressing these questions involve the measurement and/or comparison of backward-masking (or rapid serial visual presentation) psychometric functions and of physiological EEG/MEG/LFP signals (peak latencies, differential activities, single-trial decoding techniques). I review and illustrate four common mistakes that scientists tend to make when using these paradigms, and explain the conceptual fallacies that motivate their reasoning. First, contrary to collective intuition, presentation times, or stimulus-onset asynchrony masking thresholds cannot be taken to reflect, directly or indirectly, the timing of relevant brain processes. Second, psychophysical or electrophysiological measurements should not be compared without assessing potential physical differences between experimental stimulus sets. Third, such comparisons should not be performed in any manner contingent on subjective responses, so as to avoid response biases. Last, the filtering of electrophysiological signals alters their temporal structure, and thus precludes their interpretation in terms of time course. Practical solutions are proposed to overcome these common mistakes.

ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC RESPONSES TO PHOTOGRAPHS: A CASE STUDY OF THREE WOMEN WITH DISTINCT ADULT ATTACHMENT INTERVIEW CLASSIFICATIONS	PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS			English	Article							DISCRIMINANT VALIDITY; INFANT ATTACHMENT; REPRESENTATIONS; LATERALIZATION; EXPERIENCE; SECURITY; PATTERNS	This preliminary study explored whether neurophysiological responses to visual stimuli, including attachment-related pictures, differed based on attachment status. Along with self-reported valence ratings and reaction times, recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to a total of 100 images, 25 each of Positive, Negative, Neutral, and Personal (each participant's parents and child), were analyzed within and among three mothers with three attachment statuses (Dismissing, Preoccupied, and Secure), as judged by the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). All three mothers gave their highest pleasantness ratings for Personal photographs. However, differences emerged when cross-region Alpha2 activation patterns in response to each picture type were compared amongst attachment categories. Alpha2 activation recorded during viewing of the participants' children's photographs was similar to viewing Negative pictures for mothers with insecure (Dismissing and Preoccupied) status; whereas the Alpha2 activation of the mother with Secure status towards photographs of her child was similar to Positive pictures. Different patterns of hemispheric asymmetry in Betal frequency when processing different picture types were also found. The mother with Dismissing status showed significantly stronger left-hemisphere Betal activation across all image types. The Preoccupied mother showed significantly stronger right-hemisphere Betal activation for all but the Neutral images, during which activation did not differ between the two hemispheres. The mother with Secure status showed significantly stronger Betal activation in the left hemisphere for all but parental Personal photos, during which activation did not differ between the two hemispheres. Implications from the current findings and future research possibilities are discussed.

Methods: We retrospectively investigated all patients at the age of 18 or younger internalized within the last two years patients for a full night polysomnographic evaluation in our Sleep and Wake Disorders Unit. The diagnosis of epilepsy was made on the basis of clinical findings and electroencephalography findings; and the diagnosis of NREM parasomnia was made according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders. Results: A total of 29 male (67.4%) and 14 female (32.6%) patients were investigated. Nineteen (44.2%) out of 43 patients were diagnosed as epilepsy. Nine (47.4%) of the patients with epilepsy also had delta-alpha paroxysms (DAP) and partial wakefulness during sleep -which are the characteristics polysomnographic features of NREM parasomnias. Conclusion: We observed a high comorbidity of epilepsy and NREM parasomnia in pediatric group of patients investigated in our sleep center. The arousal parasomnias are increasingly being reported to be more common in patients with epilepsy, probably due to shared common physiopathological mechanism characterized by pathological arousals originating in abnormal thalamo-cortical circuits produced by the central pattern generators.

A novel approach to predict subjective pain perception from single-trial laser-evoked potentials	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Pain; Laser-evoked potentials (LEPs); Pain prediction; Classification; Regression	EFNS GUIDELINES; HUMAN BRAIN; EEG; RESPONSES; CORTEX; AMPLITUDE; LATENCY; HEAT; CLASSIFICATION; STIMULATION	Pain is a subjective first-person experience, and self-report is the gold standard for pain assessment in clinical practice. However, self-report of pain is not available in some vulnerable populations (e.g., patients with disorders of consciousness), which leads to an inadequate or suboptimal treatment of pain. Therefore, the availability of a physiology-based and objective assessment of pain that complements the self-report would be of great importance in various applications. Here, we aimed to develop a novel and practice-oriented approach to predict pain perception from single-trial laser-evoked potentials (LEPs). We applied a novel single-trial analysis approach that combined common spatial pattern and multiple linear regression to automatically and reliably estimate single-trial LEP features. Further, we adopted a Naive Bayes classifier to discretely predict low and high pain and a multiple linear prediction model to continuously predict the intensity of pain perception from single-trial LEP features, at both within- and cross-individual levels. Our results showed that the proposed approach provided a binary prediction of pain (classification of low pain and high pain) with an accuracy of 863 +/- 8.4% (within-individual) and 80.3 +/- 8.5% (cross-individual), and a continuous prediction of pain (regression on a continuous scale from 0 to 10) with a mean absolute error of 1.031 +/- 0.136 (within-individual) and 1.821 +/- 0.202 (cross-individual). Thus, the proposed approach may help establish a fast and reliable tool for automated prediction of pain, which could be potentially adopted in various basic and clinical applications.

The multi-component nature of general anesthesia complicates the identification of the precise mechanisms by which anesthetics disrupt consciousness. Devices that monitor the depth of anesthesia are an important aide for the anesthetist. This paper investigates the use of effective connectivity measures from human electrical brain activity as a means of discriminating between 'awake' and 'anesthetized' state during induction and recovery of consciousness under general anesthesia. Methodology/Principal Findings: Granger Causality (GC), a linear measure of effective connectivity, is utilized in automated classification of 'awake' versus 'anesthetized' state using Linear Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machines (with linear and non-linear kernel). Based on our investigations, the most characteristic change of GC observed between the two states is the sharp increase of GC from frontal to posterior regions when the subject was anesthetized, and reversal at recovery of consciousness. Features derived from the GC estimates resulted in classification of 'awake' and 'anesthetized' states in 21 patients with maximum average accuracies of 0.98 and 0.95, during loss and recovery of consciousness respectively. The differences in linear and non-linear classification are not statistically significant, implying that GC features are linearly separable, eliminating the need for a complex and computationally expensive non-linear classifier. In addition, the observed GC patterns are particularly interesting in terms of a physiological interpretation of the disruption of consciousness by anesthetics. Bidirectional interaction or strong unidirectional interaction in the presence of a common input as captured by GC are most likely related to mechanisms of information flow in cortical circuits. Conclusions/Significance: GC-based features could be utilized effectively in a device for monitoring depth of anesthesia during surgery.

However, there are individual differences in both brain areas and frequency ranges which can be used to identify ERD. This often results in low classification accuracy of ERD, which makes it difficult to implement of BCI application such as the control of external devices and motor rehabilitation. To overcome this problem, an individually optimized solution may be desirable for enhancing the accuracy of detecting motor action/imagery with ERD rather than a global solution for all BCI users. This paper presents a method based on a genetic algorithm to find individually optimized brain areas and frequency ranges for ERD classification. To optimize these two components, we designed a chromosome consisting of 64-bit elements represented by a binary number and another 9-bit elements using 512 pre-defined frequency ranges (2 boolean AND 9). The average value of the significant level is set for the properties of the objective function for use in a (t-test, (p < 0.01) depending on the random selection from a concurrent population. As a result, contralateral ERD responses in the spatial domain with individually optimized frequency ranges showed a significant difference between resting and motor action. The ERD responses for motor imagery, on the other hand, led to a bilateral pattern with a narrow frequency band compared to motor action. This study provides the possibility of selecting optimized electrode positions and frequency bands which can lead to high levels of ERD classification accuracy.

For many years, HS was studied in postmortem series; however, since the mid-20th century, surgical specimens from temporal lobe resections have provided important new knowledge. HS is the most common pathology underlying drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), a syndrome with a characteristic history and seizure semiology. In the early 1990s, it was recognized that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could detect HS. The standard MRI protocol for temporal lobe abnormalities uses coronal slices perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus. The MRI features of HS include reduced hippocampal volume, increased signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging, and disturbed internal architecture. The histopathologic diagnosis of HS is usually straightforward, with neuronal loss and chronic fibrillary gliosis centered on the pyramidal cell layer. There are several patterns or subtypes of HS recognized from surgical series based on qualitative or quantified assessments of regional neuronal loss. The pathologic changes of HS include granule cell dispersion, mossy fiber sprouting, and alterations to interneurons. There may also be more extensive sclerosis of adjacent structures in the medial temporal lobe, including the amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus. Subtle cortical neuropathologies may accompany HS. The revised classification of dysplasias in epilepsy denotes these as focal cortical dysplasias type IIIa. Sometimes, HS occurs with a second lesion, either in the temporal lobe or extratemporal, most often ipsilateral to the HS. HS on preoperative MRI strongly predicts good seizure outcome following temporal lobe resection (TLR). If adequate MRI shows no structural correlate in patients with MTLE, functional imaging studies are valuable, especially if they are in agreement with ictal electroencephalography (EEG) findings. Focal hypometabolism on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucosepositron emission tomography (FDG-PET) ipsilateral to the symptomatic temporal lobe predicts a good surgical outcome; the added value of 11C-Flumazenil-PET (FMZ-PET) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is less clear. Surgical methods have evolved, particularly resecting less tissue, aiming to preserve function without compromising seizure outcome. Around two thirds of patients operated for MTLE with HS obtain seizure freedom. However, the best surgical approach to optimize seizure outcome remains controversial.

Broad band time-varying estimation of event-related synchronization for user-independent configuration of a brain switch	2013 6TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE/EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING (NER)	International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	NOV 06-08, 2013	San Diego, CA	IEEE EMBS, Battelle, Brain Vis LLC, Cortech Solut, Univ Minnesota, IGERT Program, Syst Neuroengineering, IOP Publishing, Ripple, Univ Minnesota, Inst Engn Med, Plexon			EEG; MOVEMENT; RHYTHMS	Inter-user variability of brain activity patterns makes it necessary to obtain a user-specific configuration for optimal performance of a brain-computer interface (BCI). Setting up or adjusting a BCI requires a certain amount of data for the computation of spatial filters, selection of suitable features (e.g., frequency bands), and classifier training. Taking advantage of the spatial and spectral characteristics of the post-imagery beta event-related synchronization (ERS, power increase), we propose to use a user-independent configuration encompassing a single Laplacian filter, a broad frequency band (19 to 26 Hz), and a novel feature corresponding to the timevarying estimation of the beta ERS. In an offline analysis, we compare i) the use of this novel feature with the traditional logarithmic band power, and ii) the application of a broad frequency band with a user-specific band. After a 10 x 10 crossvalidation we found a reduction of the classification accuracy for detection of post-movement beta ERS (4%, 16 participants, p < 0.05) and post-imagery beta ERS (3%, 9 participants, p > 0.05), when using a general configuration instead of user-specific parameters. This performance reduction was only significant for motor execution. Our results demonstrate that the user-independent configuration proposed here leads to a classification accuracy of post-imagery beta ERS that is not significantly different from the performance achieved when the logarithmic band power of a user-specific frequency band is used.

Generalized periodic discharges in the critically ill A case-control study of 200 patients	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; NONCONVULSIVE STATUS EPILEPTICUS; CONVULSIVE STATUS EPILEPTICUS; EEG PATTERNS; ELECTROGRAPHIC SEIZURES; CLINICAL-FEATURES; PROGNOSIS; CLASSIFICATION; HEMORRHAGE	Objective: Generalized periodic discharges are increasingly recognized on continuous EEG monitoring, but their relationship to seizures and prognosis remains unclear. Methods: All adults with generalized periodic discharges from 1996 to 2006 were matched 1: 1 to controls by age, etiology, and level of consciousness. Overall, 200 patients with generalized periodic discharges were matched to 200 controls. Results: Mean age was 66 years (range 18-96); 56% were comatose. Presenting illnesses included acute brain injury (44%), acute systemic illness (38%), cardiac arrest (15%), and epilepsy (3%). A total of 46% of patients with generalized periodic discharges had a seizure during their hospital stay (almost half were focal), vs 34% of controls (p = 0.014). Convulsive seizures were seen in a third of both groups. A total of 27% of patients with generalized periodic discharges had nonconvulsive seizures, vs 8% of controls (p < 0.001); 22% of patients with generalized periodic discharges had nonconvulsive status epilepticus, vs 7% of controls (p < 0.001). In both groups, approximately half died or were in a vegetative state, one-third had severe disability, and one-fifth had moderate to no disability. Excluding cardiac arrest patients, generalized periodic discharges were associated with increased mortality on univariate analysis (36.8% vs 26.9%; p = 0.049). Multivariate predictors of worse outcome were cardiac arrest, coma, nonconvulsive status epilepticus, and sepsis, but not generalized periodic discharges. Conclusion: Generalized periodic discharges were strongly associated with nonconvulsive seizures and nonconvulsive status epilepticus. While nonconvulsive status epilepticus was independently associated with worse outcome, generalized periodic discharges were not after matching for age, etiology, and level of consciousness.

A general P300 brain-computer interface presentation paradigm based on performance guided constraints	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; EEG; P300; Event-related potential; Rehabilitation; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	MENTAL PROSTHESIS; BCI SYSTEM; PATTERN; ERPS	An electroencephalographic-based brain-computer interface (BCI) can provide a non-muscular method of communication. A general model for P300-based BCI stimulus presentations is introduced - the "m choose n" or C(m (number of flashes per sequence), n (number of flashes per item)) paradigm, which is a universal extension of the previously reported checkerboard paradigm (CBP). C(m,n) captures all possible (unconstrained) ways to flash target items, and then applies constraints to enhance ERP's produced by attended matrix items. We explore a C(36,5) instance of C(m,n) called the "five flash paradigm" (FFP) and compare its performance to the CBP. Eight subjects were tested in each paradigm, counter-balanced. Twelve minutes of calibration data were used as input to a stepwise linear discriminant analysis to derive classification coefficients used for online classification. Accuracy was consistently high for FFP (88%) and CBP (90%); information transfer rate was significantly higher for the FFP (63 bpm) than the CBP (48 bpm). The C(m,n) is a novel and effective general strategy for organizing stimulus groups. Appropriate choices for "m," "n," and specific constraints can improve presentation paradigms by adjusting the parameters in a subject specific manner. This may be especially important for people with neuromuscular disabilities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Role of magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid, and electroencephalogram in diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging; Cerebrospinal fluid	PRION DISEASE; LEWY BODIES; PROTEIN; MRI; DEMENTIA; PATTERNS; CLASSIFICATION; SENSITIVITY; CRITERIA; CJD	Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is a rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) that can be difficult to identify antemortem, with definitive diagnosis requiring tissue confirmation. We describe the clinical, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and electroencephalogram (EEG) measures of a small cohort of 30 patients evaluated for RPD. Clinical and diagnostic measures were cross-sectionally obtained from 17 sCJD patients (15 definite, two probable), 13 non-prion rapidly progressive dementia patients (npRPD), and 18 unimpaired controls. In a subset of patients (nine sCJD and nine npRPD) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures [fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD)] were also obtained for the caudate, corpus callosum, posterior limb of the internal capsule, pulvinar, precuneus, and frontal lobe. Differences among groups were assessed by an analysis of variance. Compared to npRPD individuals, sCJD patients had cerebellar dysfunction, significantly higher CSF tau, "positive" CSF 14-3-3, and hyperintensities on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) that met previously established imaging criteria for sCJD. EEG changes were similar for the two groups. In addition, sCJD patients had significant decreases in DTI measures (MD, AD, RD but not FA) within the caudate and pulvinar compared to either npRPD patients or unimpaired controls. Our results confirm that CSF abnormalities and MRI (especially DWI) can assist in distinguishing sCJD patients from npRPD patients. Future longitudinal studies using multiple measures (including CSF and MRI) are needed for evaluating pathological changes seen in sCJD patients.

Connectivity Analysis as a Novel Approach to Motor Decoding for Prosthesis Control	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces; connectivity analysis; motor control; time-varying dynamic Bayesian networks	ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; DYNAMIC BAYESIAN NETWORK; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; INFORMATION-FLOW; FINGER MOVEMENT; CORTICAL AREAS; EEG ACTIVITY; GAMMA-BAND	The use of neural signals for prosthesis control is an emerging frontier of research to restore lost function to amputees and the paralyzed. Electrocorticography (ECoG) brain-machine interfaces (BMI) are an alternative to EEG and neural spiking and local field potential BMI approaches. Conventional ECoG BMIs rely on spectral analysis at specific electrode sites to extract signals for controlling prostheses. We compare traditional features with information about the connectivity of an ECoG electrode network. We use time-varying dynamic Bayesian networks (TV-DBN) to determine connectivity between ECoG channels in humans during a motor task. We show that, on average, TV-DBN connectivity decreases from baseline preceding movement and then becomes negative, indicating an alteration in the phase relationship between electrode pairs. In some subjects, this change occurs preceding and during movement, before changes in low or high frequency power. We tested TV-DBN output in a hand kinematic decoder and obtained an average correlation coefficient (r(2)) between actual and predicted joint angle of 0.40, and as high as 0.66 in one subject. This result compares favorably with spectral feature decoders, for which the average correlation coefficient was 0.13. This work introduces a new feature set based on connectivity and demonstrates its potential to improve ECoG BMI accuracy.

J	Farquhar, J; Hill, NJ				Farquhar, J.; Hill, N. J.			Interactions Between Pre-Processing and Classification Methods for Event-Related-Potential Classification	NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						EEG; ERP; BCI; Decoding; LDA; Spatial filtering; Spectral filtering	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; MOTOR IMAGERY; EEG; ALGORITHMS; SELECTION	Detecting event related potentials (ERPs) from single trials is critical to the operation of many stimulus-driven brain computer interface (BCI) systems. The low strength of the ERP signal compared to the noise (due to artifacts and BCI irrelevant brain processes) makes this a challenging signal detection problem. Previous work has tended to focus on how best to detect a single ERP type (such as the visual oddball response). However, the underlying ERP detection problem is essentially the same regardless of stimulus modality (e.g. visual or tactile), ERP component (e.g. P300 oddball response, or the error-potential), measurement system or electrode layout. To investigate whether a single ERP detection method might work for a wider range of ERP BCIs we compare detection performance over a large corpus of more than 50 ERP BCI datasets whilst systematically varying the electrode montage, spectral filter, spatial filter and classifier training methods. We identify an interesting interaction between spatial whitening and regularised classification which made detection performance independent of the choice of spectral filter low-pass frequency. Our results show that pipeline consisting of spectral filtering, spatial whitening, and regularised classification gives near maximal performance in all cases. Importantly, this pipeline is simple to implement and completely automatic with no expert feature selection or parameter tuning required.

Brain plasticity involves distinct functional and structural components and plays a crucial role in reorganizing central nervous system's networks after any lesion in order to partly or totally restore lost and/or compromised functions. The idea that a computer can decode brain electromagnetic signals to infer the intentions of a human and then enact those intentions directly through a machine is becoming a reasonable technical possibility. In neurological patients unable to move and to communicate with the external environment, technologies implementing brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) can be of valuable aid and support. The emerging possibility, through neuro-imaging advanced techniques, to clarify some crucial issues underlying brain plasticity will give the possibility to modulate these mechanisms in a BCI-oriented way. This approach may have a tremendous impact in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders and the clinical advent of this technology will usher in a new era of restorative medicine.	[Rossini, P.

J	Xu, P; Yang, P; Lei, X; Yao, DZ				Xu, Peng; Yang, Ping; Lei, Xu; Yao, Dezhong			An Enhanced Probabilistic LDA for Multi-Class Brain Computer Interface	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EEG; BCI	Background: There is a growing interest in the study of signal processing and machine learning methods, which may make the brain computer interface (BCI) a new communication channel. A variety of classification methods have been utilized to convert the brain information into control commands. However, most of the methods only produce uncalibrated values and uncertain results. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we presented a probabilistic method "enhanced BLDA'' (EBLDA) for multi-class motor imagery BCI, which utilized Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) with probabilistic output to improve the classification performance. EBLDA builds a new classifier that enlarges training dataset by adding test samples with high probability. EBLDA is based on the hypothesis that unlabeled samples with high probability provide valuable information to enhance learning process and generate a classifier with refined decision boundaries. To investigate the performance of EBLDA, we first used carefully designed simulated datasets to study how EBLDA works. Then, we adopted a real BCI dataset for further evaluation. The current study shows that: 1) Probabilistic information can improve the performance of BCI for subjects with high kappa coefficient; 2) With supplementary training samples from the test samples of high probability, EBLDA is significantly better than BLDA in classification, especially for small training datasets, in which EBLDA can obtain a refined decision boundary by a shift of BLDA decision boundary with the support of the information from test samples. Conclusions/Significance: The proposed EBLDA could potentially reduce training effort. Therefore, it is valuable for us to realize an effective online BCI system, especially for multi-class BCI systems.

In the hybrid mental spelling system, a character decoded using SSVEP was not typed if the position of the selected character was not matched with the eye direction information ('left' or 'right') obtained from the eye-tracker. Thus, the users did not need to correct a misspelled character using a 'BACKSPACE' key. To verify the feasibility of the developed hybrid mental spelling system, we conducted online experiments with ten healthy participants. Each participant was asked to type 15 English words consisting of 68 characters. As a result, 16.6 typing errors could be prevented on average, demonstrating that the implemented hybrid mental spelling system could enhance the practicality of our mental spelling system.

Altered resting state complexity in schizophrenia	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Functional connectivity; Network analysis; Graph theory; Resting state	HUMAN BRAIN NETWORKS; SMALL-WORLD; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; VISUAL-ATTENTION; LOW-FREQUENCY; BETA RHYTHMS; SELF; EEG; RECONFIGURATION	The complexity of the human brain's activity and connectivity varies over temporal scales and is altered in disease states such as schizophrenia. Using a multi-level analysis of spontaneous low-frequency fMRI! data stretching from the activity of individual brain regions to the coordinated connectivity pattern of the whole brain, we investigate the role of brain signal complexity in schizophrenia. Specifically, we quantitatively characterize the univariate wavelet entropy of regional activity, the bivariate pairwise functional connectivity between regions, and the multivariate network organization of connectivity patterns. Our results indicate that univariate measures of complexity are less sensitive to disease state than higher level bivariate and multivariate measures. While wavelet entropy is unaffected by disease state, the magnitude of pairwise functional connectivity is significantly decreased in schizophrenia and the variance is increased. Furthermore, by considering the network structure as a function of correlation strength, we find that network organization specifically of weak connections is strongly correlated with attention, memory, and negative symptom scores and displays potential as a clinical biomarker, providing up to 75% classification accuracy and 85% sensitivity. We also develop a general statistical framework for the testing of group differences in network properties, which is broadly applicable to studies where changes in network organization are crucial to the understanding of brain function.

However, it is limited in terms of possible target numbers and, consequently, inappropriate for certain applications involving liquid crystal display (LCD) with multiple stimuli. This paper proposes an innovative coding method for SSVEP that, through a combination of frequency and phase, increases the number of targets, thus it improves the information transfer rate (ITR). With this method, a BCI system with 15 targets was developed using three stimulus frequencies, which is five times as many targets as the traditional method. Additionally, this paper defines the concept of reference phase, and decodes the EEG by means of Fourier coefficient projections onto the reference phase directions. Through the optimization of lead position, reference phase, data segment length, and harmonic components, the average ITR exceeded 60 bits/min in a simulated online test with ten subjects.

While recent studies in humans emphasized rhythmic modulations of neuronal oscillations ("second-order" rhythms), their potential involvement in information coding remains an open question. Here, we show that a rhythmic (similar to 0.7 Hz) modulation of hippocampal theta power, unraveled by second-order spectral analysis, supports encoding of spatial and behavioral information. The phase preference of neuronal discharge within this slow rhythm significantly increases the amount of information carried by action potentials in various motor/cognitive behaviors by (1) distinguishing between the spikes fired within versus outside the place field of hippocampal place cells, (2) disambiguating place firing of neurons having multiple place fields, and (3) predicting between alternative future spatial trajectories. This finding demonstrates the relevance of second-order spectral components of brain rhythms for decoding neuronal information.

Two channel electroencephalogram was analyzed with five subjects during simple string retrieval tasks using web browser with active eye movements, i. e., saccadic eye movements. After the saccadic eye movements the ERP signals were observed in target string retrievals, whereas not observed in standard string retrievals. The classification algorithm was applied and the average decoding performance of single-shot post-saccadic ERP could be 78.2% and 77.6% in recall and precision, respectively. The eye-tracking was also studied and the eye gaze points were confirmed to be on and around target strings when the ERP was elicited. This result suggests that the post-saccadic ERP with eye-tracking leads to a possibility of the use in the brain-computer interface for information retrieval.

Our approach was the best among ten submissions, reaching accuracy of 68 % of correct classifications in this five category problem. The method is based on a regularized logistic regression model, whose efficient feature selection is critical for cases with more measurements than samples. Moreover, a special attention is paid to the estimation of the generalization error in order to avoid overfitting to the training data.

Burlingame, CA, USA), which enables automated neurobehavioural phenotypic analysis and in vivo drug screening in a relatively higher-throughput and more objective manner. The individual platform consists of an infrared array, a vibration floor sensor and a variety of modular devices. One computer can simultaneously operate up to 16 platforms via USB cables. The SmartCage (TM) detects drug-induced increases and decreases in activity levels, as well as changes in movement patterns. Wake and sleep states of mice can be detected using the vibration floor sensor. The arousal state classification achieved up to 98% accuracy compared with results obtained by electroencephalography and electromyography. More complex behaviours, including motor coordination, anxiety-related behaviours and social approach behaviour, can be assessed using appropriate modular devices and the results obtained are comparable with results obtained using conventional methods. In conclusion, the SmartCage (TM) system provides an automated and accurate tool to quantify various rodent behaviours in a stress-free environment. This system, combined with the validated testing protocols, offers powerful a tool kit for transgenic phenotyping and in vivo drug screening.

A multimodal setup was arranged for synchronized recording of face videos, audio signals, eye gaze data, and peripheral/central nervous system physiological signals. Twenty-seven participants from both genders and different cultural backgrounds participated in two experiments. In the first experiment, they watched 20 emotional videos and self-reported their felt emotions using arousal, valence, dominance, and predictability as well as emotional keywords. In the second experiment, short videos and images were shown once without any tag and then with correct or incorrect tags. Agreement or disagreement with the displayed tags was assessed by the participants. The recorded videos and bodily responses were segmented and stored in a database. The database is made available to the academic community via a web-based system. The collected data were analyzed and single modality and modality fusion results for both emotion recognition and implicit tagging experiments are reported. These results show the potential uses of the recorded modalities and the significance of the emotion elicitation protocol.

Hippocampal specimens from 66 patients with MTLE and unilateral MTS and from 13 controls were studied. Quantitative neuropathological evaluation was performed on NeuN-stained hippocampal sections. Patients' clinical data, types of MTS and surgical outcome were reviewed. GCD occurred in 45.5% of cases and was not correlated with clinical variable. More severe neuronal loss was observed in patients with GCD. Except for MTS Type 2 observed only in four no-GCD patients groups did not differ with respect to the types of MTS. Surgical outcome was similar in both groups. In conclusion, GCD was associated with the degree of hippocampal cell loss, but was not a predictor of surgical outcome.

Cloud computing infrastructures (such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)) are specifically designed to combine high compute performance with high performance network capability to meet the needs of data-intensive science. Reliable, scalable, and distributed computing is used extensively on the cloud. Apache Hadoop is one such open-source project that provides a distributed file system to create multiple replicas of data blocks and distribute them on compute nodes throughout a cluster to enable reliable and rapid computations. Column-oriented databases built on Hadoop (such as HBase) along with Map Reduce programming paradigm allows development of large-scale distributed computing applications with ease. In this chapter, benchmarking results on a small in-house Hadoop cluster composed of 29 nodes each with 8-core processors is presented along with a case-study on distributed storage of electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Our results indicate that the Hadoop / HBase projects are still in their nascent stages but provide promising performance characteristics with regard to latency and throughput. In future work, we will explore the development of novel machine learning algorithms on this infrastructure.

Exploiting the differences between standard and deviant ERP responses, these multi-class paradigms are suitable for communication and control. Methods: The present study investigates the effect of giving up the randomness of stimulation sequences in favor of a repeated, predictable pattern. Data of healthy subjects (n=10) who performed a single session with a 6-class spatial auditory ERP paradigm were analyzed offline. Their auditory evoked potentials (AEP) resulting from the potentially simpler task (using fixed sequences) are compared with the AEP evoked by pseudo-randomized stimulation sequences. Results: Class-discriminative EEG responses between target and non-target stimuli were observed for both conditions. The binary classification error estimated for standard epochs of was comparable for both conditions (random: 24%, fixed: 25%). Expanding the standard epochs to include pre-stimulus intervals, we found that the regular structure of the fixed sequence can be exploited. Compared to the standard epoch, the MSE improves by 7%, while in the random condition an improvement could not be observed.

A significant number of BCI users is unable to obtain voluntary control of a BCI-system in proper time. This makes methods that can be used to determine the aptitude of a user necessary. Methods: We hypothesized that integrity and connectivity of involved white matter connections may serve as a predictor of individual BCI-performance. Therefore, we analyzed structural data from anatomical scans and DTI of motor imagery BCI-users differentiated into high and low BCI-aptitude groups based on their over all performance. Results: Using a machine learning classification method we identified discriminating structural brain trait features and correlated the best features with a continuous measure of individual BCI-performance. Prediction of the aptitude group of each participant was possible withn ear perfect accuracy (one error). Conclusions: Tissue volumetric analysis yielded only poor classification results. In contrast, the structural integrity and my elination quality of deep white matter structures such as the Corpus Callosum, Cingulum, and Superior Fronto-Occipital Fascicle were positively correlated with individual BCI performance. Significance: This confirms that structural brain traits contribute to individual performance in BCI use.

In particular, we are considering the case of some Kandinskij's oeuvres. There, it seems to see a deliberate willingness of introducing some effects today's hugely studied in the neuroscience, namely, for the retrieval of mental visual images or the neural correlates underlying visual tasks. The genial use of colours, geometry and vague forms generates very complex pictures that, we claim, excite preferentially mid-hierarchic levels of the bottom-up/top-down architecture of the brain, widely recognized as a possible framework for implementing AML. We introduce a quantitative metric for confirming the intuitive and psychological ranking of complexity given to paintings and pictures, the Artistic Complexity. The paintings of the artist are analysed, by selecting appropriately the oeuvres in order to point out different aspects of the topic. The concept of non-extensive Tsallis entropy is also introduced in an information-theoretic perspective, to cope with long-range interactions, as is done in spectral analysis of the human brain EEG. fMRI experimentations are sought to justify our speculations.

J	Simoens, VL; Tervaniemi, M				Simoens, Veerle L.; Tervaniemi, Mari			Auditory Short-Term Memory Activation during Score Reading	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EYE-HAND SPAN; WORKING-MEMORY; IMAGERY; REPRESENTATION; INTERFERENCE; EXPECTANCY; POTENTIALS; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; COMPONENT	Performing music on the basis of reading a score requires reading ahead of what is being played in order to anticipate the necessary actions to produce the notes. Score reading thus not only involves the decoding of a visual score and the comparison to the auditory feedback, but also short-term storage of the musical information due to the delay of the auditory feedback during reading ahead. This study investigates the mechanisms of encoding of musical information in short-term memory during such a complicated procedure. There were three parts in this study. First, professional musicians participated in an electroencephalographic (EEG) experiment to study the slow wave potentials during a time interval of short-term memory storage in a situation that requires cross-modal translation and short-term storage of visual material to be compared with delayed auditory material, as it is the case in music score reading. This delayed visual-to-auditory matching task was compared with delayed visual-visual and auditory-auditory matching tasks in terms of EEG topography and voltage amplitudes. Second, an additional behavioural experiment was performed to determine which type of distractor would be the most interfering with the score reading-like task. Third, the self-reported strategies of the participants were also analyzed. All three parts of this study point towards the same conclusion according to which during music score reading, the musician most likely first translates the visual score into an auditory cue, probably starting around 700 or 1300 ms, ready for storage and delayed comparison with the auditory feedback.

A brain-machine interface (BMI) offers patients with severe motor disabilities greater independence by controlling external devices such as prosthetic arms. Among the available signal sources for the BMI, electrocorticography (ECoG) provides a clinically feasible signal with long-term stability and low clinical risk. Although ECoG signals have been used to infer arm movements, no study has examined its use to control a prosthetic arm in real time. The authors present an integrated BMI system for the control of a prosthetic hand using ECoG signals in a patient who had suffered a stroke. This system used the power modulations of the ECoG signal that are characteristic during movements of the patient's hand and enabled control of the prosthetic hand with movements that mimicked the patient's hand movements. Methods. A poststroke patient with subdural electrodes placed over his sensorimotor cortex performed 3 types of simple hand movements following a sound cue (calibration period). Time-frequency analysis was performed with the ECoG signals to select 3 frequency bands (1-8. 25-40, and 80-150 Hz) that revealed characteristic power modulation during the movements. Using these selected features. 2 classifiers (decoders) were trained to predict the movement state that is. whether the patient was moving his hand or not and the movement type based on a linear support vector machine. The decoding accuracy was compared among the 3 frequency bands to identify the most informative features. With the trained decoders. novel ECoG signals were decoded online while the patient performed the same task without cues (free-run period). According to the results of the real-time. decoding. the prosthetic hand mimicked the patient's hand movements. Results. Offline cross-validation analysis of the ECoG data measured during the calibration period revealed that the state and movement type of the patient's hand were predicted with an accuracy of 79.6% (chance 50%) and 68.3% (chance 33.3%). respectively. Using the trained decoders, the onset of the hand movement was detected within 0.37 +/- 0.29 seconds of the actual movement. At the detected onset timing. the type of movement was inferred with an accuracy of 69.2%. In the free-run period, the patient's hand movements were faithfully mimicked by the prosthetic hand in real time. Conclusions. The present integrated BMI system successfully decoded the hand movements of a poststroke patient and controlled a prosthetic hand in real time. This success paves the way for the restoration of the patient's motor function using a prosthetic arm controlled by a BMI using ECoG signals.

The processing of facial expressions includes both specific neural activation and automatic congruent facial muscle reactions. While a considerable number of studies investigated the processing of emotional faces, few studies specifically focused on facial expressions of pain. Analyses of brain activity and facial responses elicited by the perception of facial pain expressions in contrast to other emotional expressions may unravel the processing specificities of pain-related information in healthy individuals and may contribute to explaining attentional biases in chronic pain patients. In the present study, 23 participants viewed short video clips of neutral, emotional (joy, fear), and painful facial expressions while affective ratings, event-related brain responses, and facial electromyography (Musculus corrugator supercilii, M. orbicularis oculi, M. zygomaticus major, M. levator labii) were recorded. An emotion recognition task indicated that participants accurately decoded all presented facial expressions. Electromyography analysis suggests a distinct pattern of facial response detected in response to happy faces only. However, emotion-modulated late positive potentials revealed a differential processing of pain expressions compared to the other facial expressions, including fear. Moreover, pain faces were rated as most negative and highly arousing. Results suggest a general processing bias in favor of pain expressions. Findings are discussed in light of attentional demands of pain-related information and communicative aspects of pain expressions. (c) 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Inspection of the P-QRS-T wave allows for the identification of the cardiac bioelectrical health and disorders of a subject. In order to extract the important features of the ECG signal, the detection of the P wave, QRS complex, and ST segment is essential. Therefore, abnormalities of these ECG parameters are associated with cardiac disorders. In this work, an introduction to the genesis of the ECG is given, followed by a depiction of some abnormal ECG patterns and rhythms (associated with P-QRS-T wave parameters), which have come to be empirically correlated with cardiac disorders (such as sinus bradycardia, premature ventricular contraction, bundle-branch block, atrial utter, and atrial fibrillation). We employed algorithms for ECG pattern analysis, for the accurate detection of the P wave, QRS complex, and ST segment of the ECG signal. We then catagorited and tabulated these cardiac disorders in terms of heart rate, PR interval, QRS width, and P wave amplitude. Finally, we discussed the characteristics and different methods (and their measures) of analyting the heart rate variability (HRV) signal, derived from the ECG waveform. The HRV signals are characterised in terms of these measures, then fed into classifiers for grouping into categories (for normal subjects and for disorders such as cardiac disorders and diabetes) for carrying out diagnosis.

Decoding Motor Signals From the Pediatric Cortex: Implications for Brain-Computer Interfaces in Children	PEDIATRICS			English	Article						brain-computer interface; electrocorticography; cerebral palsy; motor disability	ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; DESYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS	OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the decodable nature of pediatric brain signals for the purpose of neuroprosthetic control. We hypothesized that children would achieve levels of brain-derived computer control comparable to performance previously reported for adults. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy who were invasively monitored underwent screening for electrocortical control signals associated with specific motor or phoneme articulation tasks. Subsequently, patients received visual feedback as they used these associated electrocortical signals to direct one dimensional cursor movement to a target on a screen. RESULTS: All patients achieved accuracies between 70% and 99% within 9 minutes of training using the same screened motor and articulation tasks. Two subjects went on to achieve maximum accuracies of 73% and 100% using imagined actions alone. Average mean and maximum performance for the 6 pediatric patients was comparable to that of 5 adults. The mean accuracy of the pediatric group was 81% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 71.5-90.5) over a mean training time of 11.6 minutes, whereas the adult group had a mean accuracy of 72% (95% CI: 61.2-84.3) over a mean training time of 12.5 minutes. Maximum performance was also similar between the pediatric and adult groups (89.6% [95% CI: 83-96.3] and 88.5% [95% CI: 77.1-99.8], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Similarly to adult brain signals, pediatric brain signals can be decoded and used for BCI operation. Therefore, BCI systems developed for adults likely hold similar promise for children with motor disabilities.

J	Bosnjak, VM				Bosnjak, Vlatka Mejaski			GUIDELINES OF THE CROATIAN CHILD NEUROLOGY SOCIETY FOR CEREBRAL PALSY	PAEDIATRIA CROATICA			Croatian	Article						GUIDELINES AS TOPIC; CEREBRAL PALSY; CROATIA	CHANGING PANORAMA; ORIGIN; PREVALENCE; SWEDEN	Cerebral palsy is the most common cause of severe neuromotor disabilities in childhood, representing a group of disorders which involve impairment of movement and posture and of motor function. It is permanent but not unchanging, caused by non-progressive interference/lesions/abnormality in developing/immature brain. Overall, the cerebral palsy prevalence is between 2 and 3 per 1000 live births. Excluded are all progressive conditions resulting in loss of acquired skills, spinal diseases, as well as hypotonia as the sole neurological finding. Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe (SCPE) is a network of cerebral palsy surveys and registers, which extends across Europe, set up to monitor trends in cerebral palsy rate, to provide a framework fin. collaborative research and to serve as a basis for service planning. According to SCPE proposal, definition of cerebral palsy is based on phenomenology (clinical picture and history). Classification is made on the basis of the predominant neurological findings into three basic types: spastic, dyskinetic, and ataxic cerebral palsy. These basic types of cerebral palsy are further classified into subtypes according to neurological findings: bilateral spastic, unilateral spastic (hemiplegia), dystonic, and choreoathetotic cerebral palsy. All cerebral palsy subtypes have in common an abnormal pattern of movement and posture. Functional grading of cerebral palsy comprises the following domains, which are considered to be key elements in the description of a child with cerebral palsy: motor development, cognitive development, visual function, hearing, and epilepsy The Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) and Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) criteria describe the severity of impairment of lower limbs, whereas Bilateral Fine Motor Function (BFMF) and Manual Assessment Classification System (MAC'S) are related to the function of upper limbs in children with cerebral palsy Because of the changing pattern of neurological findings, diagnosis and classification of cerebral palsy is not allowed before age of 4 years (at least 3 years, and optimally 5 years). Neuroimaging (intracranial ultrasonography and magnetic resonance of the brain) are valuable diagnostic methods in visualization of perinatal brain lesions, which are the cause of cerebral palsy Cranial ultrasonography is a noninvasive, widely available method that can detect hypoxic-ischemic and hemorrhagic brain lesions, particularly in preterm neonates. It enables visualization of cystic pen ventricular leukomalacia, which is 70%-96% related to cerebral palsy and additional neurodevelopmetal impairments. Magnetic resonance has the potential to visualize and further specify or identify lesions or maldevelopments of the brain. It should ideally be performed after age of 2 years because of developing myelinization. On functional assessment of the central nervous system in children with cerebral palsy, neurophysiological procedures (EEG) and evoked potentials (VEP, SSPE, BERA) are increasingly used, particularly if epilepsy and sensory problems are accompanying neurodevelopmental disorders.

Understanding the nature of this synchrony and the dynamics of neuronal oscillators in the brain is a critical component towards decoding such complex behaviors. We have sought to achieve a more in-depth understanding of the dynamics underlying the evolution of seizures in limbic epilepsy by analyzing recordings of local field potentials from three subcortical nuclei that are part of the circuit of Papez in a kainic acid rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy using the empirical mode decomposition technique. The empirical mode decomposition allows for an adaptive and non-linear decomposition of the local field potentials into a series of finite oscillatory components. We calculated the frequencies, power, and measures of phase synchrony of these oscillatory components as seizures evolve in the brain and discovered patterns of phase synchrony that varies between the different stages of the seizures.

Objective: To determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of headache in a cohort of children, to classify the episodes, and to evaluate responses to prophylactic treatment. Methods: Prospective, descriptive, longitudinal study. The following variables were analyzed: age, sex, perinatal and personal history, family history of headache, characteristics of the episode, prophylactic treatment and response to it. Cases were classified according to the International Headache Society and the temporal pattern of episodes. Results: Schoolchildren and girls were more affected. Family history of migraine was present in 64.7%. Migraine without aura was predominant (63.9%). Prophylactic treatment was given to 88.6% and responses to it were good in 88.2%. Routinely done neuro-images studies and EEG were not useful. Conclusion: Although standardized criteria for the classification of headache in children are not available, an appropriate follow-up of symptoms must be done in order to validate the diagnostic criteria, and to reduce the negative impact on the quality of life.

Dissecting the genetic basis of myoclonic-astatic epilepsy	EPILEPSIA			English	Review						Doose; Classification; Endophenotype	LENNOX-GASTAUT-SYNDROME; IDIOPATHIC GENERALIZED EPILEPSY; FEBRILE SEIZURES PLUS; DOOSE-SYNDROME; EEG; CHILDHOOD; MUTATION; PATTERNS; ABSENCE; TWINS	Herman Doose first described the generalized childhood epilepsy syndrome of myoclonic astatic epilepsy (MAE) in 1970, attributing a genetic cause from this first description. However, although the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) defined criteria for MAE in 1989, the diagnostic boundaries of the syndrome continue to be debated. Moreover, 40 years since Doose's first description of MAE, although a genetic predisposition is acknowledged and many studies have demonstrated familial aggregation of seizures within MAE families, the actual genetic determinants of MAE still remain unknown. Although initially thought to be within the same spectrum as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, the exclusion of SCN1A mutations in non-generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) MAE cases has confirmed the genetic distinction of MAE. In this critical review, we shall trace the historical evolution of concepts around MAE and its distinction from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, review the described phenotypic features of MAE from updated studies that will allow its distinction from other overlap epilepsy syndromes, review the evidence of genetic influences and clues for genetic heterogeneity, and discuss strategies that may be helpful in elucidating the etiology of MAE in light of current genetic techniques.

Considering previous studies about morphovolumetric alterations in sleep apnea, in this study we aimed to investigate for the first time the functional connectivity profile of OSA patients and agegendermatched healthy controls, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty severe OSA patients (mean age 43.2 +/- 8years; mean apneahypopnea index, 36.3h1) and 20 non-apneic agegenderbody mass index (BMI)-matched controls underwent fMRI and polysomnographic (PSG) registration, as well as mood and sleepiness evaluation. Cerebro-cerebellar regional homogeneity (ReHo) values were calculated from fMRI acquisition, in order to identify pathology-related alterations in the local coherence of low-frequency signal (<0.1Hz). Multivariate pattern classification was also performed using ReHo values as features. We found a significant pattern of cortical and subcortical abnormal local connectivity in OSA patients, suggesting an overall rearrangement of hemispheric connectivity balance, with a decrease of local coherence observed in right temporal, parietal and frontal lobe regions. Moreover, an increase in bilateral thalamic and somatosensory/motor cortices coherence have been found, a finding due possibly to an aberrant adaptation to incomplete sleepwake transitions during nocturnal apneic episodes, induced by repetitive choke sensation and physical efforts attempting to restore breathing. Different hemispheric roles into sleep processes and a possible thalamus key role in OSA neurophysiopathology are intriguing issues that future studies should attempt to clarify.

Little is known about the neural basis of collective wisdom and whether its benefits arise in late decision stages or in early sensory coding. Here, we use electroencephalography and multi-brain computing with twenty humans making perceptual decisions to show that combining neural activity across brains increases decision accuracy paralleling the improvements shown by aggregating the observers' opinions. Although the largest gains result from an optimal linear combination of neural decision variables across brains, a simpler neural majority decision rule, ubiquitous in human behavior, results in substantial benefits. In contrast, an extreme neural response rule, akin to a group following the most extreme opinion, results in the least improvement with group size. Analyses controlling for number of electrodes and time-points while increasing number of brains demonstrate unique benefits arising from integrating neural activity across different brains. The benefits of multi-brain integration are present in neural activity as early as 200 ms after stimulus presentation in lateral occipital sites and no additional benefits arise in decision related neural activity. Sensory-related neural activity can predict collective choices reached by aggregating individual opinions, voting results, and decision confidence as accurately as neural activity related to decision components. Estimation of the potential for the collective to execute fast decisions by combining information across numerous brains, a strategy prevalent in many animals, shows large time-savings. Together, the findings suggest that for perceptual decisions the neural activity supporting collective wisdom and decisions arises in early sensory stages and that many properties of collective cognition are explainable by the neural coding of information across multiple brains. Finally, our methods highlight the potential of multi-brain computing as a technique to rapidly and in parallel gather increased information about the environment as well as to access collective perceptual/cognitive choices and mental states.

NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Functional connectivity; Graph theory; Neuro-oncology	BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; P-GLYCOPROTEIN; EEG; LOCALIZATION; RESISTANCE; LEVETIRACETAM; ORGANIZATION; MODULATION; FREQUENCY	Connectivity and network analysis in neuroscience has been applied to multiple spatial scales, but the links between these different scales have rarely been investigated. In tumor-related epilepsy, altered network topology is related to behavior, but the molecular basis of these observations is unknown. We elucidate the associations between microscopic features of brain tumors, local network topology, and functional patient status. We hypothesize that expression of proteins related to tumor-related epilepsy is directly correlated with network characteristics of the tumor area. Glioma patients underwent magnetoencephalography, and functional network topology of the tumor area was used to predict tissue protein expression patterns of tumor tissue collected during neurosurgery. Protein expression and network topology were interdependent; in particular between-module connectivity was selectively associated with two epilepsy-related proteins. Total number of seizures was related to both the role of the tumor area in the functional network and to protein expression. Importantly, classification of protein expression was predicted by between-module connectivity with up to 100% accuracy. Thus, network topology may serve as an intermediate level between molecular features of tumor tissue and symptomatology in brain tumor patients, and can potentially be used as a non-invasive marker for microscopic tissue characteristics.

There is continuously accumulating evidence for the existence of well-defined resting-state-networks (RSNs) in the brain, which play a crucial role in the generation of spontaneous activity and the associated neural responses. Hence, the signal plus noise is no longer a valid model and the ongoing fluctuations may influence the response. We introduce here the use of a multivariate statistical methodology, known as Mahalanobis-Taguchi (MT) strategy, which can be tailored to the spontaneous fluctuations so as to optimize the subsequent response detection. A subject-specific version of the MT strategy that combines the original methodology with a clustering algorithm for refining the training set is presented. The proposed methodology serves as an explorative tool for the detailed study of temporal patterning in brain responses. We demonstrate the potential of approach by applying it to experimental magneto-encephalographic (MEG) data. The results indicate vividly the effectiveness of the MT-strategy in analyzing and enhancing auditory responses. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In particular, we use Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to classify event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) patterns associated with motor imagery; however, instead of providing a binary classification output, we utilize posterior probabilities extracted from LDA classifier as the continuous-valued outputs to control a rehabilitation robot. Passive velocity field control (PVFC) is used as the underlying robot controller to map instantaneous levels of motor imagery during the movement to the speed of contour following tasks. In other words, PVFC changes the speed of contour following tasks with respect to intention levels of motor imagery. PVFC also allows decoupling of the task and the speed of the task from each other, and ensures coupled stability of the overall robot patient system. The proposed framework is implemented on ASSISTON-MOBILE-a series elastic actuator based on a holonomic mobile platform, and feasibility studies with healthy volunteers have been conducted test effectiveness of the proposed approach. Giving patients online control over the speed of the task, the proposed approach ensures active involvement of patients throughout exercise routines and has the potential to increase the efficacy of robot assisted therapies.

The developed BCI system allows users to express their binary intentions without needing to open their eyes. To present visual stimuli, we used a pair of glasses with two LEDs flickering at different frequencies. EEG spectral patterns were classified in real time while participants were attending to one of the presented visual stimuli with their eyes closed. Through offline experiments performed with 11 healthy participants, we confirmed that SSVEP responses could be modulated by visual selective attention to a specific light stimulus penetrating through the eyelids, and could be classified with accuracy high enough for use in a practical BCI system. After customizing the parameters of the proposed SSVEP-based BCI paradigm based on the offline analysis results, binary intentions of five healthy participants and one locked-in state patient were classified online. The average ITR of the online experiments reached to 10.83 bits/min with an average accuracy of 95.3 %. An online experiment applied to a patient with ALS showed a classification accuracy of 80 % and an ITR of 2.78 bits/min, demonstrating the practical feasibility of our BCI paradigm.

The specificity of deficits in neural specialization remains unclear, and alternative theories suggest generalized processing difficulties. The current study contrasted neural specialization for social information versus nonsocial information in 36 individuals with autism and 18 typically developing individuals matched for age, race, sex, handedness, and cognitive ability. Event-related potentials elicited by faces, inverted faces, houses, letters, and pseudoletters were recorded. Groups were compared on an electrophysiological marker of neural specialization (N170), as well as behavioral performance on standardized measures of face recognition and word reading/decoding. Consistent with prior results, individuals with autism displayed slowed face processing and decreased sensitivity to face inversion; however, they showed comparable brain responses to letters, which were associated with behavioral performance in both groups. Results suggest that individuals with autism display atypical neural specialization for social information but intact specialization for nonsocial information. Findings concord with the notion of specific dysfunction in social brain systems rather than nonspecific information-processing difficulties in autism.

Occipital lobe epilepsy in children: Characterization, evaluation and surgical outcomes	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Occipital lobe epilepsy; Surgical resection; Intractable epilepsy; Children	CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS; LOCALIZING VALUE; SURGERY; SEIZURE; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; PATTERNS; PARIETAL; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; LOCALIZATION	Introduction: Occipital lobe epilepsy (OLE) poses a diagnostic challenge to clinicians. Here, we present our experience in the surgical management of OLE in children using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in the pre-operative evaluation. Methods: Retrospective chart review was performed from 2000 to 2010 to identify patients with OLE. Patients were analyzed in two categories: isolated OLE (11 patients) and extended OLE (parietooccipital, temporooccipital, and temporoparietooccipital; 30 patients). Survival analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression were used to identify independent predictors of seizure outcome. Results: Forty-one patients with a mean follow-up of 3.1 years were identified with an overall 68% rate of satisfactory seizure outcome. Patients with extended OLE had younger ages at seizure onset and different seizure semiologies compared with those with isolated OLE. None of the latter underwent insertion of subdural grid electrodes for localization of the epileptogenic zone compared with 77% of the former (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, the strongest independent predictor of unsatisfactory outcome was MEG dipoles in the occipital lobe contralateral to resection. Conclusion: Here, we find similar seizure outcomes for isolated and extended OLE foci despite the use of less invasive strategies for the former. Furthermore, we describe the role of MEG in evaluation, surgical planning and prognostication of children with OLE. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Neurophysiological techniques have been scarcely involved in such debate, but nonlinear analysis methods may contribute to it. Methods: Fifteen patients (age range 23-42 years) matching DSM IV-TR criteria for SCH, and 15 sex-and age-matched control subjects (age range 23-42 years) underwent a resting-state magnetoencephalographic evaluation and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) scores were calculated. Results: Regression analyses indicated that LZC values were strongly dependent on age. Complexity scores increased as a function of age in controls, while SCH patients exhibited a progressive reduction of LZC values. A logistic model including LZC scores, age and the interaction of both variables allowed the classification of patients and controls with high sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: Results demonstrated that SCH patients failed to follow the "normal'' process of complexity increase as a function of age. In addition, SCH patients exhibited a significant reduction of complexity scores as a function of age, thus paralleling the pattern observed in neurodegenerative diseases. Significance: Our results support the notion of a progressive defect in SCH, which does not contradict the existence of a basic neurodevelopmental alteration.

J	Khushaba, RN; Kodagoda, S; Lal, S; Dissanayake, G				Khushaba, Rami N.; Kodagoda, Sarath; Lal, Sara; Dissanayake, Gamini			Uncorrelated fuzzy neighborhood preserving analysis based feature projection for driver drowsiness recognition	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Driver drowsiness; Feature extraction; Fuzzy discriminant analysis; Signal processing	DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; FATIGUE; ALERTNESS; VIGILANCE; COMPONENT; SYSTEM	Driver drowsiness is reported as one of the main causal factors in many traffic accidents as it progressively impairs the driver's awareness about external events. Drowsiness detection can be approached through monitoring physiological signals while driving to correlate drowsiness with the change in the corresponding patterns of the Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrooculogram (EOG), and Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The main challenge in such an approach is to extract a set of features that can highly discriminate between the different drowsiness levels. This paper proposes a new Fuzzy Neighborhood Preserving Analysis (FNPA) feature projection method that is used to extract the discriminant information relevant to the loss of attention caused by drowsiness. Unlike existing methods, FNPA considers the fuzzy memberships of the input measurements into the different classes while constructing the graph Laplacian. Thus, it is able to identify both the discriminant and the geometrical structure of the input data while accounting for the overlapping nature of the drowsiness patterns. Furthermore, in order to address the singularity problem that occurs in many real world problems, the singular value decomposition (SVD), and later the QR-Decomposition, are utilized to extract a set of statistically uncorrelated features presenting the Uncorrelated FNPA (UFNPA). In the current preliminary study with datasets collected from 31 subjects only, while performing a driving simulation task, the proposed method is capable of accurately classifying the drowsiness levels using a small number of features with an average accuracy of approximate to 93%. On the other hand, the possibility of developing a subject-independent drowsiness recognition system is also investigated when the problem is converted into a binary classification task, as imposed by the number of drowsiness levels exhibited by the drivers, with accuracies ranging from 82%-to-84%.

Dynamic network structure of interhemispheric coordination	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						community detection; network dynamics; split-brain; temporal network; neural oscillations	HUMAN BRAIN NETWORKS; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; VISUAL INFORMATION; PRESTIMULUS ALPHA; CEREBRAL COMMISSURES; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL AREAS; EEG ALPHA	Fifty years ago Gazzaniga and coworkers published a seminal article that discussed the separate roles of the cerebral hemispheres in humans. Today, the study of interhemispheric communication is facilitated by a battery of novel data analysis techniques drawn from across disciplinary boundaries, including dynamic systems theory and network theory. These techniques enable the characterization of dynamic changes in the brain's functional connectivity, thereby providing an unprecedented means of decoding interhemispheric communication. Here, we illustrate the use of these techniques to examine interhemispheric coordination in healthy human participants performing a split visual field experiment in which they process lexical stimuli. We find that interhemispheric coordination is greater when lexical information is introduced to the right hemisphere and must subsequently be transferred to the left hemisphere for language processing than when it is directly introduced to the language-dominant (left) hemisphere. Further, we find that putative functional modules defined by coherent interhemispheric coordination come online in a transient manner, highlighting the underlying dynamic nature of brain communication. Our work illustrates that recently developed dynamic, network-based analysis techniques can provide novel and previously unapproachable insights into the role of interhemispheric coordination in cognition.

Temporal changes of neocortical high-frequency oscillations in epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						epilepsy; HFO; oscillation; machine learning; classifier	FAST RIPPLES; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; 80-500 HZ; HIPPOCAMPUS; MECHANISMS; RECORDINGS; SEIZURES; SPIKES; EEG	High-frequency (100-500 Hz) oscillations (HFOs) recorded from intracranial electrodes are a potential biomarker for epileptogenic brain. HFOs are commonly categorized as ripples (100-250 Hz) or fast ripples (250-500 Hz), and a third class of mixed frequency events has also been identified. We hypothesize that temporal changes in HFOs may identify periods of increased the likelihood of seizure onset. HFOs (86,151) from five patients with neocortical epilepsy implanted with hybrid (micro + macro) intracranial electrodes were detected using a previously validated automated algorithm run over all channels of each patient's entire recording. HFOs were characterized by extracting quantitative morphologic features and divided into four time epochs (interictal, preictal, ictal, and postictal) and three HFO clusters (ripples, fast ripples, and mixed events). We used supervised classification and nonparametric statistical tests to explore quantitative changes in HFO features before, during, and after seizures. We also analyzed temporal changes in the rates and proportions of events from each HFO cluster during these periods. We observed patient-specific changes in HFO morphology linked to fluctuation in the relative rates of ripples, fast ripples, and mixed frequency events. These changes in relative rate occurred in pre- and postictal periods up to thirty min before and after seizures. We also found evidence that the distribution of HFOs during these different time periods varied greatly between individual patients. These results suggest that temporal analysis of HFO features has potential for designing custom seizure prediction algorithms and for exploring the relationship between HFOs and seizure generation.

Improved detection of amnestic MCI by means of discriminative vector quantization of single-trial cognitive ERP responses	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Mild cognitive impairment; Event-related potentials; Single-trial analysis; Vector quantization	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; P300 SUBCOMPONENTS; ONGOING EEG; IMPAIRMENT; DIAGNOSIS; PHASE; SYNCHRONIZATION; DEMENTIA; STATE	Cognitive event-related potentials (ERPs) are widely employed in the study of dementive disorders. The morphology of averaged response is known to be under the influence of neurodegenerative processes and exploited for diagnostic purposes. This work is built over the idea that there is additional information in the dynamics of single-trial responses. We introduce a novel way to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from the recordings of auditory ERP responses. Using single trial responses from a cohort of 25 amnestic MCI patients and a group of age-matched controls, we suggest a descriptor capable of encapsulating single-trial (ST) response dynamics for the benefit of early diagnosis. A customized vector quantization (VQ) scheme is first employed to summarize the overall set of ST-responses by means of a small-sized codebook of brain waves that is semantically organized. Each ST-response is then treated as a trajectory that can be encoded as a sequence of code vectors. A subject's set of responses is consequently represented as a histogram of activated code vectors. Discriminating MCI patients from healthy controls is based on the deduced response profiles and carried out by means of a standard machine learning procedure. The novel response representation was found to improve significantly MCI detection with respect to the standard alternative representation obtained via ensemble averaging (13% in terms of sensitivity and 6% in terms of specificity). Hence, the role of cognitive ERPs as biomarker for MCI can be enhanced by adopting the delicate description of our VQ scheme. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These methods typically register their data in Euclidean space, so that one can refer to a particular activity pattern by specifying its spatial coordinates. Since each of these methods has limited resolution in either the time or spatial domain, incorporating additional data, such as those obtained from invasive animal studies, would be highly beneficial to link structure and function. Here we describe an approach to spatially register all cortical brain regions from the macaque structural connectivity database CoCoMac, which contains the combined tracing study results from 459 publications (http://cocomac.g-node.org). Brain regions from 9 different brain maps were directly mapped to a standard macaque cortex using the tool Caret (Van Essen and Dierker, 2007). The remaining regions in the CoCoMac database were semantically linked to these 9 maps using previously developed algebraic and machine-learning techniques (Bezgin et al., 2008; Stephan et al., 2000). We analysed neural connectivity using several graph-theoretical measures to capture global properties of the derived network, and found that Markov Centrality provides the most direct link between structure and function. With this registration approach, users can query the CoCoMac database by specifying spatial coordinates. Availability of deformation tools and homology evidence then allow one to directly attribute detailed anatomical animal data to human experimental results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

From behavior to brain	PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Complexity; Mental illness; Entropy; Spontaneous brain activity	MULTISCALE ENTROPY ANALYSIS; HEART-RATE; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY; DIMENSIONAL COMPLEXITY; SCHIZOPHRENIC-PATIENTS; EEG COMPLEXITY; CHAOS THEORY; TIME-SERIES; DISEASE	A defining but elusive feature of the human brain is its astonishing complexity. This complexity arises from the interaction of numerous neuronal circuits that operate over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, enabling the brain to adapt to the constantly changing environment and to perform various amazing mental functions. In mentally ill patients, such adaptability is often impaired, leading to either ordered or random patterns of behavior. Quantification and classification of these abnormal human behaviors exhibited during mental illness is one of the major challenges of contemporary psychiatric medicine. In the past few decades, attempts have been made to apply concepts adopted from complexity science to better understand complex human behavior. Although considerable effort has been devoted to studying the abnormal dynamic processes involved in mental illness, unfortunately, the primary features of complexity science are typically presented in a form suitable for mathematicians, physicists, and engineers; thus, they are difficult for practicing psychiatrists or neuroscientists to comprehend. Therefore, this paper introduces recent applications of methods derived from complexity science for examining mental illness. We propose that mental illness is loss of brain complexity and the complexity of mental illness can be studied under a general framework by quantifying the order and randomness of dynamic macroscopic human behavior and microscopic neuronal activity. Additionally, substantial effort is required to identify the link between macroscopic behaviors and microscopic changes in the neuronal dynamics within the brain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The shape and size of the ECG signal may contain useful information about the nature of disease afflicting the heart. However, these subtle details cannot be directly monitored by the human eye and may indicate a particular cardiac abnormality. Also, the ECG is highly subjective, the symptoms may appear at random in the time scale. Hence computer assisted methods can help physicians to monitor cardiac health easily and accurately. The ECG signal is nonlinear and non-stationary in nature. These subtle variations can be captured using non-linear dynamical Higher Order Statistics (HOS) techniques. Bispectrum is the third order spectra which captures information beyond mean and standard deviation. In this work we have analyzed five types of beats namely: Normal, Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB), Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB), Atrial Premature Contraction (APC) and Ventricular Premature Contraction (VPC). The extracted bispectrum features are subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. These principal components were fed to four layered feed forward neural network and Least Square-Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) for automated pattern identification. In our work, we have obtained highest average accuracy of 93.48%, average sensitivity and specificity of 99.27% and 98.31% respectively using LS-SVM with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. Our system is clinically ready to run on large amount of data sets. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Martis, Roshan Joy; Ray, A.

MRCPs were detected online from EEG signals in eight healthy subjects with a true positive rate (TPR) of 67.15 +/- 7.87% and false positive rate (FPR) of 22.05 +/- 9.07%. The excitability of the cortical projection to the target muscle (tibialis anterior) was assessed before and after the intervention through motor evoked potentials (MEP) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The peak of the evoked potential significantly (P = 0.02) increased after the BCI intervention by 53 +/- 43% (relative to preintervention measure), although the spinal excitability (tested by stretch reflexes) did not change. These results demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to alter the corticospinal projections to the tibialis anterior muscle by using an asynchronous BCI system based on online motor imagination that triggered peripheral stimulation. This type of repetitive proprioceptive feedback training based on self-generated brain signal decoding may be a requirement for purposeful skill acquisition in intact humans and in the rehabilitation of persons with brain damage.

These images can be processed to emphasize hot spots that exhibit early and subtle changes owing to pathology. The resulting images show clusters that appear random in shape and spatial distribution but carry class dependent information in shape and texture. Automated pattern recognition techniques are challenged because of changes in location, size and orientation of these clusters. Higher order spectral invariant features provide robustness to such transformations and are suited for texture and shape dependent information extraction from noisy images. In this work, the effectiveness of bispectral invariant features in diagnostic classification of breast thermal images into malignant, benign and normal classes is evaluated and a phase-only variant of these features is proposed. High resolution IR images of breasts, captured with measuring accuracy of +/- 0.4% (full scale) and temperature resolution of 0.1 degrees C black body, depicting malignant, benign and normal pathologies are used in this study. Breast images are registered using their lower boundaries, automatically extracted using landmark points whose locations are learned during training. Boundaries are extracted using Canny edge detection and elimination of inner edges. Breast images are then segmented using fuzzy c-means clustering and the hottest regions are selected for feature extraction. Bispectral invariant features are extracted from Radon projections of these images. An Adaboost classifier is used to select and fuse the best features during training and then classify unseen test images into malignant, benign and normal classes. A data set comprising 9 malignant, 12 benign and 11 normal cases is used for evaluation of performance. Malignant cases are detected with 95% accuracy. A variant of the features using the normalized bispectrum, which discards all magnitude information, is shown to perform better for classification between benign and normal cases, with 83% accuracy compared to 66% for the original.

Optimizing MR Imaging Detection of Type 2 Focal Cortical Dysplasia: Best Criteria for Clinical Practice	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							IMPROVES DETECTION; MALFORMATIONS; STEREOELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; CLASSIFICATION; RESECTION; EEG	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Type 2 FCD is one of the main causes of drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Its detection by MR imaging has greatly improved surgical outcomes, but it often remains overlooked. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of typical MR imaging criteria for type 2 FCD, to provide a precise MR imaging pattern, and to optimize its detection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 1.5T MR imaging of 71 consecutive patients with histologically proved type 2 FCD. The protocol included millimetric 3D T1-weighted, 2D coronal and axial T2-weighted, and 2D or 3D FLAIR images. Two experienced neuroradiologists looked for 6 criteria: cortex thickening, cortical and subcortical signal changes, blurring of the GWM interface, the "transmantle" sign, and gyral abnormalities. The frequency of each sign and their combination were assessed. We compared the delay between epilepsy onset and surgery, taking into account the time of type 2 FCD detection by MR imaging. RESULTS: Only 42 patients (59%) had positive MR imaging findings. In this group, a combination of at least 3 criteria was always found. Subcortical signal changes were constant. Three characteristic signs (cortical thickening, GWM blurring, and transmantle sign) were combined in 64% of patients, indicating that MR imaging can be highly suggestive. However, typical features of type 2 FCD were overlooked on initial imaging in 40% of patients, contributing to a delay in referral for surgical consideration (17 versus 11.5 years when initial MR imaging findings were positive). CONCLUSIONS: A combination of 3 major MR imaging signs allows type 2 FCD to be recognized in clinical practice, thereby enabling early identification of candidates for surgery.

Aetiologically, it occurs in three forms: symptomatic, cryptogenic and idiopathic. Objective Estimation of PMD in children with WS according to aetiology. Methods The observed group consisted of 65 children. Age range was between 6 and 30 months. The patients were divided into three groups according to aetiology. All patients underwent psychological examination with Brunet-Lesine test, as well as PMD evaluation based on achieved developmental milestones for the corresponding age. Results Statistically significant better values in the Human Developmental Index (HDI) had patients with idiopathic compared to other forms of WS, at testing after 12 months (93.0+/-8.1 vs. 46.8+/-6.1 vs. 45.6+/-3.8), as well as after 24 months (93.9+/-7.7 vs. 51.9+/-5.5 vs. 50.9+/-4.4). The best values of HDI after 24 months had patients with improvement in PMD with the average of 66.2+/-4.4, which was statistically significant compared to those with unchanged PMD (41.5+/-5.3) and with further regression in PMD (28.3+/-4.4). Significant correlation was obtained between PMD after 12 and 24 months (r=0.477), as well as a considerable improvement in HDI from the 12th to 24th month (49.4+/-4.0 vs. 53.7+/-3.9). Conclusion The patients with idiopathic WS accomplished the best PMD. Improvement in PMD after 12 and 24 months of treatment was associated with improved HDI. Improvement in PMD was observed in all patients after 2 years of follow-up.

Studies had also shown that MI and passive movement (PM) could similarly activate the motor system. Although the idea of calibrating MI-based BCI system from PM data is promising, there is an inherent difference between features extracted from MI and PM. Therefore, there is a need for online learning to alleviate the difference and improve the performance. Hence, in this study we propose an online batch mode semi-supervised learning with KL distance weighting to update the model trained from the calibration session by using unlabeled data from the online test session. In this study, the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) algorithm is used to compute the most discriminative features of the EEG data in the calibration session and is updated iteratively on each band after a batch of online data is available for performing semi-supervised learning. The performance of the proposed method was compared with offline FBCSP, and results showed that the proposed method yielded slightly better results in comparison with offline FBCSP. The results also showed that the use of the model trained from PM for online session-to-session transfer compared to the use of the calibration model trained from MI yielded slightly better performance. The results suggest that using PM, due to its better performance and ease of recording is feasible and performance can be improved by using the proposed method to perform online semi-supervised learning while subjects perform MI.

However, it is unclear how well-suited BCIs are to individuals with CP. Therefore, this study aims to investigate to what extent these users are able to gain control of BCIs. Methods: This study is conducted with 14 individuals with CP attempting to control two standard online BCIs (1) based upon sensorimotor rhythm modulations, and (2) based upon steady state visual evoked potentials. Results: Of the 14 users, 8 are able to use one or other of the BCIs, online, with a statistically significant level of accuracy, without prior training. Classification results are driven by neurophysiological activity and not seen to correlate with occurrences of artifacts. However, many of these users' accuracies, while statistically significant, would require either more training or more advanced methods before practical BCI control would be possible. Conclusions: The results indicate that BCIs may be controlled by individuals with CP but that many issues need to be overcome before practical application use may be achieved. Significance: This is the first study to assess the ability of a large group of different individuals with CP to gain control of an online BCI system. The results indicate that six users could control a sensorimotor rhythm BCI and three a steady state visual evoked potential BCI at statistically significant levels of accuracy (SMR accuracies; mean +/- STD, 0.821 +/- 0.116, SSVEP accuracies; 0.422 +/- 0.069).

Synchrony Dynamics Across Brain Structures in Limbic Epilepsy Vary Between Initiation and Termination Phases of Seizures	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Coherence; empirical mode decomposition (EMD); epilepsy; temporal lobe	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; KAINATE RECEPTORS; HIPPOCAMPAL SLICE; INTRACRANIAL EEG; NEURAL NETWORKS; DEPRESSION; THALAMUS	Neuronal populations in the brain achieve levels of synchronous electrophysiological activity during both normal brain function and pathological states such as epileptic seizures. Understanding how the dynamics of neuronal oscillators in the brain evolve from normal to diseased states is a critical component toward decoding such complex behaviors. In this study, we sought to develop a more in-depth understanding of multisite dynamics underlying seizure evolution in limbic epilepsy by analyzing oscillators in recordings of local field potentials from three brain structures (bilateral hippocampi and anteromedial thalamus) in a kainic acid in vivo rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy extracted using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique. EMD provides an adaptive nonlinear decomposition into a set of finite oscillatory components. Oscillator frequencies, power, and phase synchrony were assessed within and between sites as seizures evolved. Consistent patterns of low-frequency (similar to 35 Hz) synchrony occurred transiently during early-stage ictogenesis between thalamus and both hippocampi; in contrast, higher frequency (similar to 120 Hz) synchrony appeared between thalamus and focal hippocampus as seizures naturally terminated. These multi-site synchrony events may provide a key insight into how synchrony disruption via stimulation could be targeted as well as contribute to a better understanding of how brain synchrony evolves in epilepsy.

A neurally-interfaced hand prosthesis tuned inter-hemispheric communication	RESTORATIVE NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Functional source separation; hand prosthesis; neural interface; inter-hemispheric coherence; neurorehabilitation	FUNCTIONAL SOURCE SEPARATION; PHANTOM-LIMB PAIN; CORTICAL REORGANIZATION; MOTOR EXECUTION; CYBERNETIC HAND; PLASTICITY; SYNCHRONY; AMPUTEES; IMPROVES; NETWORK	Purpose: This work investigates how a direct bidirectional connection between brain and hand prosthesis modifies the bi-hemispheric sensorimotor system devoted to the movement control of the lost limb. Hand prostheses are often unable to satisfy users' expectations, mostly due to the poor performance of their interfacing system. Neural Interfaces implanted inside nerves of the stump offer the advantage of using the bidirectional neural pathways 'naturally' dispatching signals to control proper hand actions and feed-back sensations. Learning to control a neurally-interfaced hand prosthesis and decode sensory information was previously observed to reduce the inter-hemispheric asymmetry of cortical motor maps and the clinical symptoms of phantom limb syndrome. Methods: Electroencephalographic (EEG) data was analysed using Functional Source Separation (FSS), a semi-blind method that incorporates prior knowledge about the signal of interest into data decomposition to give access to cortical patch activities. Results: Bi-hemispheric cortices showed normalization of their activity (topographical and spectral patterns) and of functional connectivity between homologous hand controlling areas, during the delivery of the motor command to the cybernetic prosthesis. Conclusions: The re-establishment of central-peripheral communication with the lost limb induced by a neurally-interfaced hand prosthesis produces beneficial plastic reorganization, not only restructuring contralateral directly-connected control areas, but also their functional balance within the bi-hemispheric system necessary for motor	[Di Pino, G.; Tombini, M.; Assenza, G.; Pellegrino, G.] Campus Biomed Univ, Dept Neurol, Rome, Italy; [Di Pino, G.] Univ Campus Biomed, Biomed Robot & Biomicrosyst Lab, Rome, Italy; [Porcaro, C.; Tecchio, F.] Osped Fatebenefratelli, LETs ISTC CNR, Rome, Italy; [Porcaro, C.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Med, Inst Neurosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Tecchio, F.; Rossini, P.

Visual and gait disturbance with ataxia also developed. Diffusion-weighted MRI showed widespread regions of hyperintensity in the bilateral cerebral cortex. The patient died at 62 after a progressive clinical course of 32 months. Myoclonus, periodic sharp-wave complexes on EEG, and akinetic mutism state were not observed. Neuropathologic examination showed widespread cerebral neocortical involvement with both large confluent vacuole-type, alongside fine vacuole-type spongiform changes. Mild spongiform degeneration was observed in the striatum and lateral thalamus. Severe neuron loss with hypertrophic astrocytosis in the medial thalamus and inferior olivary nucleus was present. Cerebral white matter showed diffusemyelin pallor indicating panencephalopathic-type pathology. In the cerebellar cortex, severe Purkinje neuron loss was observed, but no spongiform degeneration in the molecular layer or neuron loss in the granular cell layer. PrP immunostaining showed widespread perivacuolar-type PrP, irregular plaque-like PrP, and synaptic-type PrP depositions in the cerebral neocortex. Mild PrP deposition was observed in the striatum, lateral thalamus and brainstem, whereas PrP deposition was not apparent in the medial thalamus and inferior olivary nucleus. PrP gene analysis showed no mutations, and methionine homozygosity was observed at codon 129. Western blot analysis of protease-resistant PrP showed type 2 PrP pattern. MRI and cerebral neocortical pathology suggested MM2-cortical-type sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), whereas the clinical course and pathology of the medial thalamus and inferior olivary nucleus suggested MM2-thalamic-type sCJD. We believe this was a combination of MM2-cortical-type and MM2-thalamictype sCJD, which explains the broad spectrum of MM2-type sCJD findings and symptoms.

J	Leutgeb, V; Schafer, A; Schienle, A				Leutgeb, Verena; Schaefer, Axel; Schienle, Anne			Late cortical positivity and cardiac responsitivity in female dental phobics when exposed to phobia-relevant pictures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Dental phobia; EEG; ERP; Heart rate; Late positive potential; Disgust; Fear	FEAR-INDUCING PICTURES; DISGUST SENSITIVITY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; ATTENTIONAL BIAS; SPIDER PHOBICS; BLOOD PHOBIA; ORAL-HEALTH; PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL REACTIONS; DISORDER-RELEVANT; EMOTIONAL IMAGERY	Objectives: Dental phobia is currently classified as a specific phobia of the blood-injection-injury (BII) subtype. In another subtype, animal phobia, enhanced amplitudes of late event-related potentials have consistently been identified for patients during passive viewing of disorder-relevant pictures. However, this has not been shown for BII phobics, and studies with dental phobics are lacking. Findings on cardiac responses in BII phobia during exposure are heterogeneous, as some studies showed a diphasic pattern of heart rate acceleration and deceleration, whereas others observed pure acceleration. In contrast, heart rate increase has consistently been shown for dental phobics, resembling the reaction of animal phobics. Moreover, the BII subtype is characterized by elevated disgust reactivity whereas the role of habitual disgust proneness in dental phobia is unclear. Methods: We recorded the electroencephalogram and the electrocardiogram from 18 dental phobic and 18 healthy women while they watched pictures depicting dental treatment, disgust, fear and neutral items. Results: Phobics relative to controls showed an enhanced late positive potential (300-700 ms) and heart rate acceleration towards phobic material, reflecting motivated attention and fear. Affective ratings revealed that dental phobics experienced significantly higher levels of fear than disgust during exposure to phobia-relevant material. Patients' elevated habitual disgust proneness was restricted to specific domains, such as the oral incorporation of offensive objects. Conclusion: The psychophysiology of dental phobia resembles the fear-dominated subtypes of specific phobia reported in earlier studies. Future studies should continue to investigate whether the current classification of this disorder as BII phobia needs to be reconsidered. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Extracting attempted hand movements from EEGs in people with complete hand paralysis following stroke	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-computer interface; brain-machine interface; stroke; hand paresis; electroencephalograph; decoding; linear-discriminant analysis; Hebbian plasticity		This study examines the feasibility of using electroencephalograms (EEGs) to rapidly detect the intent to open one's hand in individuals with complete hand paralysis following a subcortical ischemic stroke. If detectable, this motor-planning activity could be used in real time to trigger a motorized hand exoskeleton or an electrical stimulation device that opens/closes the hand. While EEG-triggered movement-assist devices could restore function, they may also promote recovery by reinforcing the use of remaining cortical circuits. EEGs were recorded while participants were cued to either relax or attempt to extend their fingers. Linear-discriminant analysis was used to detect onset of finger-extension from the EEGs in a leave-one-trial-out cross-validation process. In each testing trial, the classifier was applied in pseudo-real-time starting from an initial hand-relaxed phase, through movement planning, and into the initial attempted-finger-extension phase (finger-extension phase estimated from typical time-to-movement-onset measured in the unaffected hand). The classifiers detected attempted-finger-extension at a significantly higher rate during both motor-planning and early attempted execution compared to rest. To reduce inappropriate triggering of a movement-assist device during rest, the classification threshold could be adjusted to require more certainty about one's intent to move before triggering a device. Additionally, a device could be set to activate only after multiple time samples in a row were classified as finger-extension events. These options resulted in some sessions with no false triggers while the person was resting, but moderate-to-high true trigger rates during attempted-movements.

Real-Time Decoding of Brain Responses to Visuospatial Attention Using 7T fMRI	PLOS ONE			English	Article							COMPUTER INTERFACE BCI; FUNCTIONAL MRI; VISUAL-CORTEX; SPATIAL ATTENTION; CORTICAL CONTROL; BOLD SIGNAL; COMMUNICATION; FIELD; EEG; MODULATION	Brain-Computer interface technologies mean to create new communication channels between our mind and our environment, independent of the motor system, by detecting and classifying self regulation of local brain activity. BCIs can provide patients with severe paralysis a means to communicate and to live more independent lives. There has been a growing interest in using invasive recordings for BCI to improve the signal quality. This also potentially gives access to new control strategies previously inaccessible by non-invasive methods. However, before surgery, the best implantation site needs to be determined. The blood-oxygen-level dependent signal changes measured with fMRI have been shown to agree well spatially with those found with invasive electrodes, and are the best option for pre-surgical localization. We show, using real-time fMRI at 7T, that eye movement-independent visuospatial attention can be used as a reliable control strategy for BCIs. At this field strength even subtle signal changes can be detected in single trials thanks to the high contrast-to-noise ratio. A group of healthy subjects were instructed to move their attention between three (two peripheral and one central) spatial target regions while keeping their gaze fixated at the center. The activated regions were first located and thereafter the subjects were given real-time feedback based on the activity in these regions. All subjects managed to regulate local brain areas without training, which suggests that visuospatial attention is a promising new target for intracranial BCI. ECoG data recorded from one epilepsy patient showed that local changes in gamma-power can be used to separate the three classes.	[Andersson, Patrik; Pluim, Josien P.

Gamma-Band Activity in Human Prefrontal Cortex Codes for the Number of Relevant Items Maintained in Working Memory	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; LATERAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; PARIETAL CORTEX; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; MOTOR AREA; EEG-ALPHA; TASK	Previous studies in electrophysiology have provided consistent evidence for a relationship between neural oscillations in different frequency bands and the maintenance of information in working memory (WM). While the amplitude and cross-frequency coupling of neural oscillations have been shown to be modulated by the number of items retained during WM, interareal phase synchronization has been associated with the integration of distributed activity during WM maintenance. Together, these findings provided important insights into the oscillatory dynamics of cortical networks during WM. However, little is known about the cortical regions and frequencies that underlie the specific maintenance of behaviorally relevant information in WM. In the current study, we addressed this question with magnetoencephalography and a delayed match-to-sample task involving distractors in 25 human participants. Using spectral analysis and beamforming, we found a WM load-related increase in the gamma band (60-80 Hz) that was localized to the right intraparietal lobule and left Brodmann area 9 (BA9). WM-load related changes were also detected at alpha frequencies (10-14 Hz) in Brodmann area 6, but did not covary with the number of relevant WM-items. Finally, we decoded gamma-band source activity with a linear discriminant analysis and found that gamma-band activity in left BA9 predicted the number of target items maintained in WM. While the present data show that WM maintenance involves activity in the alpha and gammab and, our results highlight the specific contribution of gammab and delay activity in prefrontal cortex for the maintenance of behaviorally relevant items.

Often performed in the context of some common stimulus, MBF aims to facilitate rapid/enhanced collective analysis and decision making, or to assess aggregate characteristics, such as a group emotional index (GEI). The wide range of potential applications may justify an ongoing, distributed program of research into the biometric correlates of conscious and unconscious human cognitive functions (practical intelligence). An example is MBF-enabled joint analysis, which would combine cues from several intelligence analysts who are examining the same visual scene in order to rapidly highlight important features that might not be salient to any individual analyst, and which might be difficult to elicit from the group by conventional means. An experiment in presented in which a GEI is obtained by aggregating the information from two people wearing EMOTIV Epoc (TM) 'neuroheadsets', which collect electroencephalogram (EEG) / electromyogram (EMG) signals from 14 sensors on the scalp. As subjects watch a sequence of slides with emotion-triggering content, their decoded emotions are fused to provide a group emotional response, a collective assessment of the presented information. MBF has the potential to surpass single-brain limitations by accessing and integrating more information than can be usefully shared within even small human groups by means of speech, prosody, facial expression and other nonverbal means One may speculate that the automated aggregation of signals from multiple human brains may open a path to super-human intelligence.

Wavelet-based Gaussian-mixture hidden Markov model for the detection of multistage seizure dynamics: A proof-of-concept study	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EPILEPTIC SEIZURE; HIPPOCAMPAL SLICE; EEG; PREDICTION; EVENTS; ONSET; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; CLASSIFICATION	Background: Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent electrophysiological activities, known as seizures. Without the appropriate detection strategies, these seizure episodes can dramatically affect the quality of life for those afflicted. The rationale of this study is to develop an unsupervised algorithm for the detection of seizure states so that it may be implemented along with potential intervention strategies. Methods: Hidden Markov model (HMM) was developed to interpret the state transitions of the in vitro rat hippocampal slice local field potentials (LFPs) during seizure episodes. It can be used to estimate the probability of state transitions and the corresponding characteristics of each state. Wavelet features were clustered and used to differentiate the electrophysiological characteristics at each corresponding HMM states. Using unsupervised training method, the HMM and the clustering parameters were obtained simultaneously. The HMM states were then assigned to the electrophysiological data using expert guided technique. Minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) analysis and Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) were applied to reduce the effect of over-fitting. The sensitivity, specificity and optimality index of chronic seizure detection were compared for various HMM topologies. The ability of distinguishing early and late tonic firing patterns prior to chronic seizures were also evaluated. Results: Significant improvement in state detection performance was achieved when additional wavelet coefficient rates of change information were used as features. The final HMM topology obtained using mRMR and AICc was able to detect non-ictal (interictal), early and late tonic firing, chronic seizures and postictal activities. A mean sensitivity of 95.7%, mean specificity of 98.9% and optimality index of 0.995 in the detection of chronic seizures was achieved. The detection of early and late tonic firing was validated with experimental intracellular electrical recordings of seizures. Conclusions: The HMM implementation of a seizure dynamics detector is an improvement over existing approaches using visual detection and complexity measures. The subjectivity involved in partitioning the observed data prior to training can be eliminated. It can also decipher the probabilities of seizure state transitions using the magnitude and rate of change wavelet information of the LFPs.	[Chiu, Alan W.

J	Banerjee, A; Pillai, AS; Horwitz, B				Banerjee, Arpan; Pillai, Ajay S.; Horwitz, Barry			Using large-scale neural models to interpret connectivity measures of cortico-cortical dynamics at millisecond temporal resolution	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						EEG; MEG; large-scale networks; information processing; high resolution; timing; decoding; delayed match-to-sample (DMS)	VISUAL WORKING-MEMORY; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DELAYED MATCH; NETWORK INTERACTIONS; PROCESSING PATHWAYS; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BLIND SEPARATION	Over the last two decades numerous functional imaging studies have shown that higher order cognitive functions are crucially dependent on the formation of distributed, large-scale neuronal assemblies (neurocognitive networks), often for very short durations. This has fueled the development of a vast number of functional connectivity measures that attempt to capture the spatiotemporal evolution of neurocognitive networks. Unfortunately, interpreting the neural basis of goal directed behavior using connectivity measures on neuroimaging data are highly dependent on the assumptions underlying the development of the measure, the nature of the task, and the modality of the neuroimaging technique that was used. This paper has two main purposes. The first is to provide an overview of some of the different measures of functional/effective connectivity that deal with high temporal resolution neuroimaging data. We will include some results that come from a recent approach that we have developed to identify the formation and extinction of task-specific, large-scale neuronal assemblies from electrophysiological recordings at a ms-by-ms temporal resolution. The second purpose of this paper is to indicate how to partially validate the interpretations drawn from this (or any other) connectivity technique by using simulated data from large-scale, neurobiologically realistic models. Specifically, we applied our recently developed method to realistic simulations of MEG data during a delayed match-to-sample (DMS) task condition and a passive viewing of stimuli condition using a large-scale neural model of the ventral visual processing pathway. Simulated MEG data using simple head models were generated from sources placed in V1, V4, IT, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) for the passive viewing condition. The results show how closely the conclusions obtained from the functional connectivity method match with what actually occurred at the neuronal network level.

Detecting changes of frequency modulation (FM) within speech is hypothesized as essential for accurate phoneme detection, and thus, for spoken word comprehension. Despite past demonstration of FM auditory evoked response (FMAER) utility in language disorder investigations, it is seldom utilized clinically. This report's purpose is to facilitate clinical use by explaining analytic pitfalls, demonstrating sites of cortical origin, and illustrating potential utility. Results: FMAERs collected from children with language disorders, including Developmental Dysphasia, Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and also normal controls - utilizing multi-channel reference-free recordings assisted by discrete source analysis - provided demonstratrions of cortical origin and examples of clinical utility. Recordings from inpatient epileptics with indwelling cortical electrodes provided direct assessment of FMAER origin. The FMAER is shown to normally arise from bilateral posterior superior temporal gyri and immediate temporal lobe surround. Childhood language disorders associated with prominent receptive deficits demonstrate absent left or bilateral FMAER temporal lobe responses. When receptive language is spared, the FMAER may remain present bilaterally. Analyses based upon mastoid or ear reference electrodes are shown to result in erroneous conclusions. Serial FMAER studies may dynamically track status of underlying language processing in LKS. FMAERs in ASD with language impairment may be normal or abnormal. Cortical FMAERs can locate language cortex when conventional cortical stimulation does not. Conclusion: The FMAER measures the processing by the superior temporal gyri and adjacent cortex of rapid frequency modulation within an auditory stream. Clinical disorders associated with receptive deficits are shown to demonstrate absent left or bilateral responses. Serial FMAERs may be useful for tracking language change in LKS. Cortical FMAERs may augment invasive cortical language testing in epilepsy surgical patients. The FMAER may be normal in ASD and other language disorders when pathology spares the superior temporal gyrus and surround but presumably involves other brain regions. Ear/mastoid reference electrodes should be avoided and multichannel, reference free recordings utilized. Source analysis may assist in better understanding of complex FMAER findings.

B	Cyganek, B	Cyganek, B			Cyganek, Boguslaw	Cyganek, B		Tensor Methods in Computer Vision	OBJECT DETECTION AND RECOGNITION IN DIGITAL IMAGES: THEORY AND PRACTICE			English	Article; Book Chapter							NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE; FACE RECOGNITION; SCALE-SPACE; FRAMEWORK; IMAGE; APPROXIMATION; ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFICATION	This chapter gathers different computer vision techniques which make use of tensors, as well as their decomposition and analysis. As will be shown, the discussed methods have found application in many methods for object detection and recognition in images. Although tensors have been known in mathematics for over a hundred years, their application in computer vision (CV) and pattern recognition (PR) has been a matter of the last two decades. The real power of tensor processing in these areas comes from their natural ability to represent the multidimensional nature of processed data well. Based on the fundamental sampling theorem, continuous signals when sampled with sufficient frequency can be unambiguously represented by their discrete samples [1, 2]. This fundamental property transforms physical measurements with the world of computer processing, since digital signals are just data in computer memory. As will be shown, tensors are the right tools for processing a variety of digital signals, such as sound, vision, seismic, medical electroencephalogram (EEG), as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which opens vast possibilities in medical diagnosis. In MRI, for instance, it is assumed that the motion of water molecules in tissues can be approximated by a Brownian motion in the voxels of the image. However, the Brownian motion is entirely described by a symmetric and positive definite matrix, called the diffusion tensor. Processing and visualization of diffusion tensors is one of the most rapidly growing domains, joining mathematics, physics, medicine, and computer vision. The goal of this chapter is to present different areas of CV and PR which can be well represented and analyzed with tensors. We start with definitions of tensors, as well as basic properties of tensors. The two most pronounced characteristics of tensors are their transformation rules with respect to changes of the coordinate systems. The other is their multidimensionality, which makes them the right tool to process data which depend on many factors, as will be discussed. We present the structural tensor and its variants, as well as the tensor of inertia. The former is based on signal differentiation, whereas the latter is related to the statistical moments computed from the signal. Both are useful to represent local areas, as well as whole objects, in the images. We also discuss methods of filtering of tensor data, as well as their eigendecomposition and invariants. Tensors are also the right tool to represent mutual relations between features of real objects imaged in multiple views. The next part of this chapter is devoted to the second aspect of tensors - their ability to represent and analyze multidimensional data. Presented are the most important tensor decompositions, the Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), best rank-1, as well as best rank-(R-1, ..., R-P), where R1 to RP are the desired ranks of each of the P dimensions of the tensor. Finally, the nonnegative matrix and tensor factorizations, as well as the subspace data representation, are discussed. Apart from a presentation of the mathematical background of the methods, their object-oriented implementations are also presented and discussed. Since implementations are generic, that is they can be used with user specified data types, they can be directly used in other projects. Also, some applications are provided which aim to exemplify the most important features of the methods. The subsequent chapters of the book contain further examples of applications of the presented tensor methods in real computer vision systems (CVS).											178	0	0	0	5	BLACKWELL SCIENCE PUBL	OXFORD	OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0EL, ENGLAND			978-0-470-97637-1				2013							9	188				10.1002/9781118618387		180	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology	Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)	Computer Science; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology	BHD71					2022-08-02	WOS:000325094300003
