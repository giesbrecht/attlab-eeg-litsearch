J	Combrisson, E; Jerbi, K				Combrisson, Etienne; Jerbi, Karim			Exceeding chance level by chance: The caveat of theoretical chance levels in brain signal classification and statistical assessment of decoding accuracy	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						k-Fold cross-validation; Small sample size; Classification; Multi-class decoding; Brain-computer-interfaces (BCIs); Machine learning; Binomial cumulative distribution; Classification significance; Decoding accuracy; MEG; ECoG; Intracranial EEG	COMPUTER-INTERFACE; MOVEMENT DIRECTION; PERMUTATION TESTS; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SIGNALS; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; CLASSIFYING EEG; HAND MOVEMENTS; MOTOR; IMAGERY	Machine learning techniques are increasingly used in neuroscience to classify brain signals. Decoding performance is reflected by how much the classification results depart from the rate achieved by purely random classification. In a 2-class or 4-class classification problem, the chance levels are thus 50% or 25% respectively. However, such thresholds hold for an infinite number of data samples but not for small data sets. While this limitation is widely recognized in the machine learning field, it is unfortunately sometimes still overlooked or ignored in the emerging field of brain signal classification. Incidentally, this field is often faced with the difficulty of low sample size. In this study we demonstrate how applying signal classification to Gaussian random signals can yield decoding accuracies of up to 70% or higher in two-class decoding with small sample sets. Most importantly, we provide a thorough quantification of the severity and the parameters affecting this limitation using simulations in which we manipulate sample size, class number, cross-validation parameters (k-fold, leave-one-out and repetition number) and classifier type (Linear-Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayesian and Support Vector Machine). In addition to raising a red flag of caution, we illustrate the use of analytical and empirical solutions (binomial formula and permutation tests) that tackle the problem by providing statistical significance levels (p-values) for the decoding accuracy, taking sample size into account. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our simulations and statistical tests on real brain data by assessing noise-level classifications in Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and intracranial EEG (iEEG) baseline recordings.

EEG Eye State Identification Using Incremental Attribute Learning with Time-Series Classification	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Eye state identification is a kind of common time-series classification problem which is also a hot spot in recent research. Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used in eye state classification to detect human's cognition state. Previous research has validated the feasibility of machine learning and statistical approaches for EEG eye state classification. This paper aims to propose a novel approach for EEG eye state identification using incremental attribute learning (IAL) based on neural networks. IAL is a novel machine learning strategy which gradually imports and trains features one by one. Previous studies have verified that such an approach is applicable for solving a number of pattern recognition problems. However, in these previous works, little research on IAL focused on its application to time-series problems. Therefore, it is still unknown whether IAL can be employed to cope with time-series problems like EEG eye state classification. Experimental results in this study demonstrates that, with proper feature extraction and feature ordering, IAL can not only efficiently cope with time-series classification problems, but also exhibit better classification performance in terms of classification error rates in comparison with conventional and some other approaches.

In order to increase the number of states classified by a brain-computer interface (BCI), we utilized a motor imagery task where subjects imagined both force and speed of hand clenching. Approach. The BCI utilized simultaneously recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals. The time-phase-frequency feature was extracted from EEG, whereas the HbD [the difference of oxy-hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (Hb)] feature was used to improve the classification accuracy of fNIRS. The EEG and fNIRS features were combined and optimized using the joint mutual information (JMI) feature selection criterion; then the extracted features were classified with the extreme learning machines (ELMs). Main results. In this study, the averaged classification accuracy of EEG signals achieved by the time-phase-frequency feature improved by 7%, to 18%, more than the single-type feature, and improved by 15% more than common spatial pattern (CSP) feature. The HbD feature of fNIRS signals improved the accuracy by 1%, to 4%, more than Hb, HbO, or HbT (total hemoglobin). The EEG-fNIRS feature for decoding motor imagery of both force and speed of hand clenching achieved an accuracy of 89% +/- 2%, and improved the accuracy by 1% to 5% more than the sole EEG or fNIRS feature. Significance. Our novel motor imagery paradigm improves BCI performance by increasing the number of extracted commands. Both the time-phase-frequency and the HbD feature improve the classification accuracy of EEG and fNIRS signals, respectively, and the hybrid EEG-fNIRS technique achieves a higher decoding accuracy for two-class motor imagery, which may provide the framework for future multi-modal online BCI systems.

Decoding neural patterns or its classification is a challenging task. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are non-invasive neuroimaging modalities to capture the brain activity pattern in term of images and electric potential respectively. To get higher spatiotemporal resolution of human brain from these two complementary neuroimaging modalities, simultaneous EEG-fMRI can be helpful. In this paper, we proposed a framework for classifying the brain activity patterns with simultaneous EEG-fMRI. We have acquired five human participants' data with simultaneous EEG-fMRI by showing different object categories. Further, combined analysis of EEG and fMRI data was carried out. Extracted information through combine analysis is passed to support vector machine (SVM) classifier for classification purpose. We have achieved better classification accuracy using simultaneous EEG-fMRI i.e., 81.8% as compared to fMRI data standalone. This shows that multimodal neuroimaging can improve the classification accuracy of brain activity patterns as compared to individual modalities reported in literature.

Such variability complicates the analysis of data from multiple subjects and sessions in a consistent way, and degrades the performance of subject-transfer decoding in a brain-machine interface (BMI). To accommodate the variability in brain signals, we propose 1) a method for extracting spatial bases (or a dictionary) shared by multiple subjects, by employing a signal-processing technique of dictionary learning modified to compensate for variations between subjects and sessions, and 2) an approach to subject-transfer decoding that uses the resting-state activity of a previously unseen target subject as calibration data for compensating for variations, eliminating the need for a standard calibration based on task sessions. Applying our methodology to a dataset of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during a selective visual-spatial attention task from multiple subjects and sessions, where the variability compensation was essential for reducing the redundancy of the dictionary, we found that the extracted common brain activities were reasonable in the light of neuroscience knowledge. The applicability to subject-transfer decoding was confirmed by improved performance over existing decoding methods. These results suggest that analyzing multisubject brain activities on common bases by the proposed method enables information sharing across subjects with low-burden resting calibration, and is effective for practical use of BMI in variable environments.

Specifically, spectral power densities in four classical frequency bands: Delta (0.5-3 Hz), Theta (4-7 Hz), Alpha (8-12 Hz) and Beta (14-25 Hz) were extracted for each electrode as features, and fed to three classification algorithms including logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensions of the feature space. The results demonstrated that SVM and Lasso evidenced better performance (maximal accuracy = 80.68 +/- 2.01% by SVM and 77.82 +/- 2.11% by Lasso) when applied to original feature space, but LR yielded the best performance with PCA (80.72 +/- 1.73%). The accuracy of binary classification exhibited a decreasing trend with diminishing chronological gaps between the groups.

In controlled laboratory settings this classification approach works well; however, transitioning these approaches into more dynamic, unconstrained environments will present several significant challenges. One such challenge is an increase in temporal variability in measured behavioral and neural responses, which often results in suboptimal classification performance. Previously, we reported a novel classification method designed to account for temporal variability in the neural response in order to improve classification performance by using sliding windows in hierarchical discriminant component analysis (HDCA), and demonstrated a decrease in classification error by over 50% when compared to the standard HDCA method (Marathe et al., 2013). Here, we expand upon this approach and show that embedded within this new method is a novel signal transformation that, when applied to EEG signals, significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio and thereby enables more accurate single-trial analysis. The results presented here have significant implications for both brain-computer interaction technologies and basic science research into neural processes.

J	Lotte, F				Lotte, Fabien			Signal Processing Approaches to Minimize or Suppress Calibration Time in Oscillatory Activity-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces (BCI); calibration; electroencephalography (EEG); machine learning; signal processing; small sample settings	COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERN; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MOTOR IMAGERY; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; CLASSIFICATION; SUBJECT; PERFORMANCE; REHABILITATION; FRAMEWORK; IMPROVE	One of the major limitations of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) is their long calibration time, which limits their use in practice, both by patients and healthy users alike. Such long calibration times are due to the large between-user variability and thus to the need to collect numerous training electroencephalography (EEG) trials for the machine learning algorithms used in BCI design. In this paper, we first survey existing approaches to reduce or suppress calibration time, these approaches being notably based on regularization, user-to-user transfer, semi-supervised learning and a priori physiological information. We then propose new tools to reduce BCI calibration time. In particular, we propose to generate artificial EEG trials from the few EEG trials initially available, in order to augment the training set size. These artificial EEG trials are obtained by relevant combinations and distortions of the original trials available. We propose three different methods to do so. We also propose a new, fast and simple approach to perform user-to-user transfer for BCI. Finally, we study and compare offline different approaches, both old and new ones, on the data of 50 users from three different BCI data sets. This enables us to identify guidelines about how to reduce or suppress calibration time for BCI.

It is crucial to select suitable features from EEG signals. This paper proposed a feature selection method which combing independent component analysis (ICA) and common spatial patterns (CSP) to improve the performances of classification. Firstly, EEG signals were filtered with 8-30HZ bandpass filter. Secondly, relative frequency band signals were decomposed into independent components to obtain the solution matrix by ICA, and then the EEG signals were reconstructed from the main components to improve the signal-to-noise ratios. CSP was used to extract the features of EEG signals. Finally, linear discriminate analysis classifier (LDA) and support vector machines (SVM) were used to classify the EEG feature signals. The experiment results showed that the average accuracy achieved by the proposed method were higher, compared common CSP method.

For the importance of making the right decision, the proposed method was performed to be able to get better features of the EEG signals. The proposed method was consisted of two stages: feature extraction by 1D-LBP and classification by classifier algorithms with features extracted. On the classification stage, the several machine learning methods were employed to uniform and non-uniform 1D-LBP features. The proposed method was also compared with other existing techniques in the literature to find out benchmark for an epileptic data set. The implementation results showed that the proposed technique could acquire high accuracy in classification of epileptic EEG signals. Also, the present paper is an attempt to develop a general-purpose feature extraction scheme, which can be utilized to extract features from different categories of EEG signals.

However, effective analysis and modeling of EEG data has been limited by its poor spatial resolution. EEG's low amplitude, brief and sporadic nature, compounded by extra-cranial noise, contribute to the difficulty of this problem. This systematic analysis provides strong evidence to guide future research in machine learning applied to real-time analysis of brain states using EEGs. The main goal of this research is to understand how the construction of data sets used in training models affects the accuracy of prominent machine learning algorithms, specifically: Random Forest, Boosting, Naive Bayesian Classifier, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Herein, we present a systematic method (N = 153) to test the accuracy of prominent machine learning algorithms when varying three main components of the training data set: the permutations of subjects, the number of unique data sets used to generate the training data set, and the number of samples in each training data set. Our results strongly indicate that Random Forest consistently yields superior results when analyzing EEG data compared to other prominent machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, a pilot investigation was conducted on a mean-normalized feature for EEG data analysis. The pilot analysis (N = 28) confirmed Random Forest's analytical superiority in EEG data, shows signs of improved accuracy, and identifies a distinctive correlation between beta and delta waves and their respective active or idle brain states.

These rhythms reveal spectral changes in alpha and beta bands induced by movements of different body parts, e.g., hands and limbs, in electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, less can be revealed in them about movements of different fine body parts that activate adjacent brain regions, such as individual fingers from one hand. Several studies have reported spatial and temporal couplings of rhythmic activities at different frequency bands, suggesting the existence of well-defined spectral structures across multiple frequency bands. In the present study, spectral principal component analysis (PGA) was applied on EEG data, obtained from a finger movement task, to identify cross-frequency spectral structures. Features from identified spectral structures were examined in their spatial patterns, cross-condition pattern changes, detection capability of finger movements from resting, and decoding performance of individual finger movements in comparison to classic mu/beta rhythms. These new features reveal some similar, but more different spatial and spectral patterns as compared with classic mu/beta rhythms. Decoding results further indicate that these new features (91%) can detect finger movements much better than classic mu/beta rhythms (75.6%). More importantly, these new features reveal discriminative information about movements of different fingers (fine body-part movements), which is not available in classic mu/beta rhythms. The capability in decoding fingers (and hand gestures in the future) from EEG will contribute significantly to the development of non-invasive BCI and neuroprosthesis with intuitive and flexible controls.

Many epilepsy patients undergo electroencephalography (EEG) continuously for days to weeks in a hospital to have seizures that might help doctors identify the anatomical focus of those seizures. But screening days to weeks of iEEG for seizures that can happen anytime or not at all is a time-consuming clinical burden for clinicians and staff. Thus, a computerized method to perform this duty objectively in lieu of subjective manual labor is highly beneficial toward robust timely clinical care of patients. I present such a method using two unsupervised machine learning techniques applied to cross-frequency coupling measures, comparing the classification performance of the methods. The methods perform similarly in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and selectivity (positive predictive value). Overall a proof-of-concept for a new approach is made. With more development, either approach could be used in practical clinical settings.

Development of electroencephalographic pattern classifiers for real and imaginary thumb and index finger movements of one hand	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Symbolic regression; Support vector machine; Artificial neural network; Motor imagery; Finger movements; Brain-computer interface	EEG; IMAGERY; CLASSIFICATION; TIME; BCI	Objective: This study aimed to find effective approaches to electroencephalographic (EEG) signal analysis and resolve problems of real and imaginary finger movement pattern recognition and categorization for one hand. Methods and materials: Eight right-handed subjects (mean age 32.8 [SD = 3.3] years) participated in the study, and activity from sensorimotor zones (central and contralateral to the movements/imagery) was recorded for EEG data analysis. In our study, we explored the decoding accuracy of EEG signals using real and imagined finger (thumb/index of one hand) movements using artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms for future brain-computer interface (BC!) applications. Results: The decoding accuracy of the SVM based on a Gaussian radial basis function linearly increased with each trial accumulation (mean: 45%, max: 62% with 20 trial summarizations), and the decoding accuracy of the ANN was higher when single-trial discrimination was applied (mean: 38%, max: 42%). The chosen approaches of EEG signal discrimination demonstrated differential sensitivity to data accumulation. Additionally, the time responses varied across subjects and inside sessions but did not influence the discrimination accuracy of the algorithms. Conclusion: This work supports the feasibility of the approach, which is presumed suitable for one-hand finger movement (real and imaginary) decoding. These results could be applied in the elaboration of multiclass BCI systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This is usually achieved by looking at the pattern of brain activity across many trials while the subject is imagining the performance of an instructed action - the process known as motor imagery. Nevertheless, existing motor imagery classification algorithms do not always achieve good performances because of the noisy and non-stationary nature of the EEG signal and inter-subject variability. Thus, current EEG BCI takes a considerable upfront toll on patients, who have to submit to lengthy training sessions before even being able to use the BCI. In this study, we developed a data-efficient classifier for left/right hand motor imagery by combining in our pattern recognition both the oscillation frequency range and the scalp location. We achieve this by using a combination of Morlet wavelet and Common Spatial Pattern theory to deal with non-stationarity and noise. The system achieves an average accuracy of 88% across subjects and was trained by about a dozen training (10-15) examples per class reducing the size of the training pool by up to a 100-fold, making it very data-efficient way for EEG BCI.

To diagnose these seizures for treatment, a patient typically stays in the hospital for days while a clinical staff must manually screen hours of electroencephalograph (EEG) data for electroencephalographic and behavioral seizures, a very time-consuming, tedious, and subjective process for humans. While decades of research have been dedicated to algorithms for alleviating this clinical procedural burden, there is still room for improvement in seizure detection techniques. Moreover, most seizure detection strategies use supervised machine learning, which requires subjective human involvement for training data. This research examines seizure detection performance for 24 patients using k-means, k-mediod, and hierarchical clustering, a Gaussian mixture model, and a hidden Markov model after using principal component analyses to reduce 45 measures to 2 measures. This work differs from past unsupervised methods, which were tested using very experimentally controlled seizure and non-seizure EEG signals: analyzing continuous EEG spanning 60 seconds pre-seizure to 60 seconds post-seizure in overlapping sliding windows rather than a single point for each seizure and non-seizure epoch. The 'best' combination of classifier accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, selectivity, and rejectivity is found with k-means and k-mediod algorithms.

Neural decoding of expressive human movement from scalp electroencephalography (EEG)	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; neural classification; mobile neuroimaging; neural decoding; dance; Laban Movement Analysis	TREADMILL WALKING; DANCE; INFORMATION; MOTION; SPACE; TIME; LIMB	Although efforts to characterize human movement through electroencephalography (EEG) have revealed neural activities unique to limb control that can be used to infer movement kinematics, it is still unknown the extent to which EEG can be used to discern the expressive qualities that influence such movements. In this study we used EEG and inertial sensors to record brain activity and movement of five skilled and certified Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) dancers. Each dancer performed whole body movements of three Action types: movements devoid of expressive qualities ("Neutral"), non-expressive movements while thinking about specific expressive qualities ("Think"), and enacted expressive movements ("Do"). The expressive movement qualities that were used in the "Think" and "Do" actions consisted of a sequence of eight Laban Effort qualities as defined by LMA a notation system and language for describing, visualizing, interpreting and documenting all varieties of human movement. We used delta band (0.2-4 Hz) EEG as input to a machine learning algorithm that computed locality-preserving Fisher's discriminant analysis (LFDA) for dimensionality reduction followed by Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to decode the type of Action. We also trained our LFDA-GMM models to classify all the possible combinations of Action Type and Laban Effort quality (giving a total of 17 classes). Classification accuracy rates were 59.4 +/- 0.6% for Action Type and 88.2 +/- 0.7% for Laban Effort quality Type. Ancillary analyses of the potential relations between the EEG and movement kinematics of the dancer's body, indicated that motion-related artifacts did not significantly influence our classification results. In summary, this research demonstrates that EEG has valuable information about the expressive qualities of movement. These results may have applications for advancing the understanding of the neural basis of expressive movements and for the development of neuroprosthetics to restore movements.

We propose a sparsity-aware method to data selection from a set of multiple EEG recordings during motor-imagery tasks, aiming at brain machine interfaces (BMIs). Instead of empirical averaging over sample co-variance matrices for multiple trials including low-quality data, which can lead to poor performance in BMI classification, we introduce weighted averaging with weight coefficients that can reject such trials. The weight coefficients are determined by the l(1)-minimization problem that lead to sparse weights such that almost zero-values are allocated to low-quality trials. The proposed method was successfully applied for estimating co-variance matrices for the so-called common spatial pattern (CSP) method, which is widely used for feature extraction from EEG in the two-class classification. Classification of EEG signals during motor imagery was examined to support the proposed method. It should be noted that the proposed data selection method can be applied to a number of variants of the original CSP method.

In this paper, we propose a pattern recognition system for discriminating the true and false memories in case of short-term memory (STM) for 3D and 2D educational contents by analyzing EEG signals. The EEG signals are converted to scalp-maps (topomaps) and city-block distance is applied to reduce the redundancy and select the most discriminative topomaps. Finally, statistical features are extracted from selected topomaps and passed to Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict brain states corresponding to true and false memories. A sample of thirty four healthy subjects participated in the experiments, which consist of two tasks: learning and memory recall. In the learning task, half of the participants watched 2D educational contents and half of them watched the same contents in 3D mode. After 30 minutes of retention, they were asked to perform memory recall task, in which EEG signals were recorded. The classification accuracy of 97.5% was achieved for 3D as compared to 96.5% for 2D. The statistical analysis of the results suggest that there is no significant difference between 2D and 3D educational contents on STM in terms of true and false memory assessment.

Electroencephalography is an efficient method used to capture signals from the brain. K nearest neighbor is one of the simplest methods used for classifying epilepsy patterns. Classification of the epilepsy signal from normal pattern will be primarily based on features extracted from brain signals. This paper discusses statistical based linear feature extraction methods such as Root Mean Square, Variance and Linear Prediction Coefficient. This paper also focuses influence of decision rules such as consensus and majority rule in the classification of epilepsy data set.

However, the use of EEG and NIRS involves certain inherent problems. EEG signals are generally a mixture of neural activity from broad areas, some of which may not be related to the task targeted by BMI, hence impairing BMI performance. NIRS has an inherent time delay as it measures blood flow, which therefore detracts from practical real-time BMI utility. To try to improve real environment EEG-NIRS-based BMIs, we propose here a novel methodology in which the subjects' mental states are decoded from cortical currents estimated from EEG, with the help of information from NIRS. Using a Variational Bayesian Multimodal EncephaloGraphy (VBMEG) methodology, we incorporated a novel form of NIRS-based prior to capture event related desynchronization from isolated current sources on the cortical surface. Then, we applied a Bayesian logistic regression technique to decode subjects' mental states from further sparsified current sources. Applying our methodology to a spatial attention task, we found our EEG-NIRS-based decoder exhibited significant performance improvement over decoding methods based on EEG sensor signals alone. The advancement of our methodology, decoding from current sources sparsely isolated on the cortex, was also supported by neuroscientific considerations; intraparietal sulcus, a region known to be involved in spatial attention, was a key responsible region in our task. These results suggest that our methodology is not only a practical option for EEG-NIRS-based BMI applications, but also a potential tool to investigate brain activity in non-laboratory and naturalistic environments.

Common spatial patterns (CSP) or its probabilistic counterpart, PCSP, is a popular discriminative feature extraction method for EEG classification. Models in CSP or PCSP are trained on a subject-by-subject basis so that inter-subject information is neglected. In the case of multi-subject EEG classification, however, it is desirable to capture inter-subject relatedness in learning a model. This paper outlines a brief overview of our recent work on how Bayesian multi-task learning is applied to multi-subject EEG classification, treating subjects as tasks to capture inter-subject relatedness in Bayesian treatment of PCSP.

Feature extraction and representation plays a crucial role in EEG-based automatic classification of sleep stages. Sparse representation (SR) is a state-of-the-art unsupervised feature learning method suitable for EEG feature representation. New method: Collaborative representation (CR) is an effective data coding method used as a classifier. Here we use CR as a data representation method to learn features from the EEG signal. A joint collaboration model is established to develop a multi-view learning algorithm, and generate joint CR (JCR) codes to fuse and represent multi-channel EEG signals. A two-stage multi-view learning-based sleep staging framework is then constructed, in which JCR and joint sparse representation (JSR) algorithms first fuse and learning the feature representation from multi-channel EEG signals, respectively. Multi-view JCR and JSR features are then integrated and sleep stages recognized by a multiple kernel extreme learning machine (MK-ELM) algorithm with grid search. Results: The proposed two-stage multi-view learning algorithm achieves superior performance for sleep staging. With a K-means clustering based dictionary, the mean classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are 81.10 +/- 0.15%, 71.42 +/- 0.66% and 94.57 +/- 0.07%, respectively; while with the dictionary learned using the submodular optimization method, they are 80.29 +/- 0.22%, 71.26 +/- 0.78% and 94.38 +/- 0.10%, respectively. Comparison with existing methods: The two-stage multi-view learning based sleep staging framework outperforms all other classification methods compared in this work, while JCR is superior to JSR Conclusions: The proposed multi-view learning framework has the potential for sleep staging based on multi-channel or multi-modality polysomnography signals.

One of the challenges is to distinguish rhythmic discharges from nonstationary patterns occurring during seizures. The proposed approach is based on an adaptive and localized time-frequency representation of EEG signals by means of rational functions. The corresponding rational discrete short-time Fourier transform (DSTFT) is a novel feature extraction technique for epileptic EEG data. A multilayer perceptron classifier is fed by the coefficients of the rational DSTFT in order to separate seizure epochs from seizure-free epochs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is compared with several state-of-art feature extraction algorithms used in offline epileptic seizure detection. The results of the comparative evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms competing techniques in terms of classification accuracy. In addition, it provides a compact representation of EEG time-series.

Electrical brain activity recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) can be interpreted into software commands by various classification algorithms according to the descriptive features of the signal. In this paper we propose a novel EEG BCI feature extraction method employing EEG source reconstruction and Filter Bank Common Spatial Patterns (FBCSP) based on Joint Approximate Diagonalization (JAD). The proposed method is evaluated by the commonly used reference EEG dataset yielding an average classification accuracy of 77.1 +/- 10.1 %. It is shown that FBCSP feature extraction applied to reconstructed source components outperforms conventional CSP and FBCSP feature extraction methods applied to signals in the sensor domain.

Behavioral studies show that humans impute structure into simple learning problems, even when this tendency affords no behavioral advantage. Here we used electroencephalography to investigate the neural dynamics indicative of such incidental latent structure. Event-related potentials over lateral prefrontal cortex, typically observed for instructed task rules, were stratified according to individual participants' constructed rule sets. Moreover, this individualized latent rule structure could be independently decoded from multielectrode pattern classification. Both neural markers were predictive of participants' ability to subsequently generalize rule structure to new contexts. These EEG dynamics reveal that the human brain spontaneously constructs hierarchically structured representations during learning of simple task rules.	[Collins, Anne G.

J	Liu, Y; Zhao, QN; Zhang, LQ				Liu, Ye; Zhao, Qibin; Zhang, Liqing			Uncorrelated Multiway Discriminant Analysis for Motor Imagery EEG Classification	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Brain computer interface (BCI); electroencephalography; classification; tensor Factorization	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; STROKE PATIENTS; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; BCI; REORGANIZATION; RECOVERY; FILTERS; SET	Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) training has been proved to be an effective communication system between human brain and external devices. A practical problem in BCI-based systems is how to correctly and efficiently identify and extract subject-specific features from the blurred scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and translate those features into device commands in order to control external devices. In real BCI-based applications, we usually define frequency bands and channels configuration that related to brain activities beforehand. However, a steady configuration usually loses effects due to individual variability among different subjects in practical applications. In this study, a robust tensor-based method is proposed for a multiway discriminative subspace extraction from tensor-represented EEG data, which performs well in motor imagery EEG classification without the prior neurophysiologic knowledge like channels configuration and active frequency bands. Motor imagery EEG patterns in spatial-spectral-temporal domain are detected directly from the multidimensional EEG, which may provide insights to the underlying cortical activity patterns. Extensive experiment comparisons have been performed on a benchmark dataset from the famous BCI competition III as well as self-acquired data from healthy subjects and stroke patients. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over the contemporary methods.

EEG of 29 epileptic dogs and 17 control dogs was recorded. Normal patterns, interictal epileptiform, and non-epileptiform abnormalities were interpreted using visual analysis by board-certified epileptologists. Results revealed that 34% of the dogs with epilepsy did not show discernible abnormalities on their EEG recordings. Approximately 38% of the epileptic dogs presented interictal epileptiform discharges, 28% had only non-epileptiform discharges, and 24% had both abnormalities. Sixteen of the control dogs had normal EEG pattern while one of them had non-epileptiform pattern. To identify the interictal epileptiform discharges, EEG had 37.93% sensitivity and 100% specificity for the epilepsy group compared with the normal dogs. The interictal scalp EEG, as a result, had high specificity for supporting the diagnosis of epilepsy in dogs. Moreover, administration of 5-8 mcg/kg of dexmedetomidine via the intravenous (IV) route was recommended for canine EEG study because it provided non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep EEG, together with awake period in each tracing which was valuable for EEG interpretation. EEG, as a result, is one of the considerably useful tools to evaluate cerebral functions and epileptiform discharges. Therefore, our study suggested that EEG should be a routine diagnostic tool for ruling in canine epilepsy.

However, decoding accuracies have reached a plateau and therefore novel classification techniques should be evaluated. This paper proposes the use of Lattice Neural Networks with Dendritic Processing (LNND) for the classification of hand movements from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. The performance of this technique was evaluated and compared with classical classifiers using EEG signals recorded form participants performing motor tasks. The result showed that LNND provides: (i) the higher decoding accuracies in experiments using one electrode (DA = 80% and DA = 80% for classification of motor execution and motor imagery, respectively); (ii) distributions of decoding accuracies significantly different and higher than the chance level (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) in experiments using one, two, four and six electrodes. These results shows that LNND could be a powerful technique for the recognition of motor tasks in BCIs.

Applications of BCI include neurorehabilitation after stroke and control of limb prostheses. Until now, most studies have tested simple movement trajectories in two dimensions by using constant velocity profiles. However, most real-world scenarios require much more complex movement trajectories and velocity profiles. In this study, we decoded motor commands in three dimensions from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings while the subjects either executed or observed/imagined complex upper limb movement trajectories. We compared the accuracy of simple linear methods and nonlinear methods. In line with previous studies our results showed that linear decoders are an efficient and robust method for decoding motor commands. However, while we took the same precautions as previous studies to suppress eye-movement related EEG contamination, we found that subtracting residual electro-oculogram activity from the EEG data resulted in substantially lower motor decoding accuracy for linear decoders. This effect severely limits the transfer of previous results to practical applications in which neural activation is targeted. We observed that nonlinear methods showed no such drop in decoding performance. Our results demonstrate that eye-movement related contamination of brain signals constitutes a severe problem for decoding motor signals from EEG data. These results are important for developing accurate decoders of motor signal from neural signals for use with BCI-based neural prostheses and neurorehabilitation in real-world scenarios.

Nevertheless, CSP suffers from the problems of sensitivity to noise and overfitting. To overcome these issues, the regularized CSP (RCSP) has been proposed recently. In addition, CSP was originally designed for two-class classification. However, a practical BCI usually needs four-class commands to be able to operate. Thus, there is a high demand for increasing the performance of multi-class BCI. In this paper, we provide a complete study of classification accuracy in multi-class BCI using regularization theory, and compare it with the standard CSP to determine the suitable method for feature extraction in BCI learning. Besides CSP, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) has shown its robust and widespread use for machine learning in BCI. LDA estimates covariance matrices from extracted features. But for high-dimensional features with only a small amount of training data given, the estimation may become imprecise. In the attempt of clarifying the regularizing effects in BCI, this paper also provides the classification results of the regularized LDA (RLDA). The performance evaluation of this work was taken on data from 9 subjects, from BCI competition datasets. Results show that the combination of standard CSP and LDA has a slightly better accuracy than the regularizing methods.

We considered five classification tasks to test the validity of such approach. In all five tasks, the joint use of the components of the EF and the SL outperformed the scalar potential. The smallest effect occurred in the classification of a mental task, wherein the average classification rate was improved by 0.5 standard deviations. The largest effect was obtained in the classification of visual stimuli and corresponded to an improvement of 2.1 standard deviations.	[Carvalhaes, C.

Any specific mental state or thinking activity results in specific pattern of brain signals. In this paper, a method has been proposed that combines recent advances in brain imaging and machine learning techniques to predict the cognitive state of the subjects whether they are feeling themselves in a safe or dangerous environment. This method is based on the mechanism of neuroception. The changes in this state are correlated with power modulations of oscillatory rhythms in the human EEG called ERD / ERS (Event-related De-synchronization / Synchronization). In order to predict these changes, it is of high significance to find the spatio-temporal distribution of EEG band-power modulations induced by the feeling of fear or danger.

J	Kang, H; Choi, S				Kang, Hyohyeong; Choi, Seungjin			Bayesian common spatial patterns for multi-subject EEG classification	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Common spatial patterns; EEG classification; Indian Buffet processes; Nonparametric Bayesian methods	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; COMPETITION; FILTERS	Multi-subject electroencephalography (EEG) classification involves algorithm development for automatically categorizing brain waves measured from multiple subjects who undergo the same mental task. Common spatial patterns (CSP) or its probabilistic counterpart, PCSP, is a popular discriminative feature extraction method for EEG classification. Models in CSP or PCSP are trained on a subject-by-subject basis so that inter-subject information is neglected. In the case of multi-subject EEG classification, however, it is desirable to capture inter-subject relatedness in learning a model. In this paper we present a non-parametric Bayesian model for a multi-subject extension of PCSP where subject relatedness is captured by assuming that spatial patterns across subjects share a latent subspace. Spatial patterns and the shared latent subspace are jointly learned by variational inference. We use an infinite latent feature model to automatically infer the dimension of the shared latent subspace, placing Indian Buffet process (IBP) priors on our model. Numerical experiments on BCI competition III IVa and IV 2a dataset demonstrate the high performance of our method, compared to PCSP and existing Bayesian multi-task CSP models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to develop a smart system supporting volitional control of prostheses directly from user' thought without any interface manipulation. An ultra-portable, wireless-enabled, and low powered device prototype was developed to amplify and process multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals in real-time. Signal processing and machine learning algorithms were designed to decode user's volition from EEG signals and subsequently to command prosthetic devices. A feasibility test was conducted on an amputee user with right leg amputation. Preliminary results showed that the amputee user was able to volitionally control a knee-locker installed on the prosthetic leg at a sensitive rate of 83.5% with zero false positive detections in real-time. Future study will be directed to support multifunctional, volitional control of robotic prostheses.

Benefiting from the abundant contents of movement information, electroencephalography (EEG) has become a promising information source for rehabilitation robots control. Although the multiple linear regression model was used as the decoding model of EEG signals in some researches, it has been considered that it cannot reflect the nonlinear components of EEG signals. In order to overcome this shortcoming, we propose a nonlinear decoding model, the particle filter model. Two- and three-dimensional decoding experiments were performed to test the validity of this model. In decoding accuracy, the results are comparable to those of the multiple linear regression model and previous EEG studies. In addition, the particle filter model uses less training data and more frequency information than the multiple linear regression model, which shows the potential of nonlinear decoding models. Overall, the findings hold promise for the furtherance of EEG-based rehabilitation robots.

There are two principle challenges. The first is the variability in the recorded EEG data, which manifests across trials as well as across individuals. Consequently, features that are more discriminative need to be identified before any pattern recognition technique can be applied. The second challenge is in the pattern recognition domain. The number of data samples in a class of interest, e.g. a specific action, is a small fraction of the total data, which is composed of samples corresponding to all actions of all users. Building a robust classifier when learning from a highly unbalanced dataset is very difficult; minimizing the classification error typically causes the larger class to overwhelm the smaller one. We show that the combination of 'classifiability' for selecting the optimal frequency band and the use of the Twin Support Vector Machine (Twin SVM) for classification, yields significantly improved generalization. On benchmark BCI Competition datasets, the proposed approach often yields up to 20% improvement over the state-of-the-art. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most of machine learning approaches that have been attempted to address this issue are based on knowledge transfer between different BCIs users. Assuming that there is a common underlying data generating process, they try to learn a subject-independent classification model from multiple users in order to classify data of future users. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that allows inter-subjects classification of EEG signals without relying on the strong assumptions considered in previous work. It consists of learning a prediction model of a new BCI user through an ensemble of classifiers where base classifiers are trained on data from other users separately and weighted according to the performance of the ensemble on few labeled data of the new user. Evaluation on real EEG data showed that our approach allows achieving good classification accuracy when the size of calibration set is small.

The present study proposes a new method for real-time pattern classification and neurofeedback of brain states from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. It involves the creation of a fused classification model based on the method of Common Spatial Patterns (CSPs) from data of several healthy individuals. The subject-independent model is then used to classify EEG data in real-time and provide feedback to new individuals. In a series of offline experiments involving training and testing of the classifier with individual data from 27 healthy subjects, a mean classification accuracy of 75.30% was achieved, demonstrating that the classification system at hand can reliably decode two types of imagery used in our experiments, i.e., happy emotional imagery and motor imagery. In a subsequent experiment it is shown that the classifier can be used to provide neurofeedback to new subjects, and that these subjects learn to "match" their brain pattern to that of the fused classification model in a few days of neurofeedback training. This finding can have important implications for future studies on neurofeedback and its clinical applications on neuropsychiatric disorders.

EEG Based Brain Activity Monitoring using Artificial Neural Networks	2014 7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HUMAN SYSTEM INTERACTIONS (HSI)	Conference on Human System Interaction		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Human System Interactions (HSI)	JUN 16-18, 2014	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Inst Dev New Technologies, Nova Univ Lisbon, Fac Sci & Technol		Brain Computer Interface; Emotiv EPOC; EEG; SOM; ANN		Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) have gained significant interest over the last decade as viable means of human machine interaction. Although many methods exist to measure brain activity in theory, Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most used method due to the cost efficiency and ease of use. However, thought pattern based control using EEG signals is difficult due two main reasons; 1) EEG signals are highly noisy and contain many outliers, 2) EEG signals are high dimensional. Therefore the contribution of this paper is a novel methodology for recognizing thought patterns based on Self Organizing Maps (SOM). The presented thought recognition methodology is a three step process which utilizes SOM for unsupervised clustering of pre-processed EEG data and feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for classification. The presented method was tested on 5 different users for identifying two thought patterns; "move forward" and "rest". EEG Data acquisition was carried out using the Emotiv EPOC headset which is a low cost, commercial-off-the-shelf, noninvasive EEG signal measurement device.

Using a Noninvasive Decoding Method to Classify Rhythmic Movement Imaginations of the Arm in Two Planes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; electroencephalography (EEG); movement decoding; movement imagery	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; PARTIAL LEAST-SQUARES; NEUROPROSTHESIS CONTROL; HAND; SIGNALS; HUMANS; EEG; MEG; TRAJECTORIES	A brain-computer interface (BCI) can help to overcome movement deficits in persons with spinal-cord injury. Ideally, such a BCI detects detailed movement imaginations, i.e., trajectories, and transforms them into a control signal for a neuroprosthesis or a robotic arm restoring movement. Robotic arms have already been controlled successfully by means of invasive recording techniques, and executed movements have been reconstructed using noninvasive decoding techniques. However, it is unclear if detailed imagined movements can be decoded noninvasively using electroencephalography (EEG). We made progress toward imagined movement decoding and successfully classified horizontal and vertical imagined rhythmic movements of the right arm in healthy subjects using EEG. Notably, we used an experimental design which avoided muscle and eye movements to prevent classification results being affected. To classify imagined movements of the same limb, we decoded the movement trajectories and correlated them with assumed movement trajectories (horizontal and vertical). We then assigned the decoded movements to the assumed movements with the higher correlation. To train the decoder, we applied partial least squares, which allowed us to interpret the classifier weights although channels were highly correlated. To conclude, we showed the classification of imagined movements of one limb in two different movement planes in seven out of nine subjects. Furthermore, we found a strong involvement of the supplementary motor area. Finally, as our classifier was based on the decoding approach, we indirectly showed the decoding of imagined movements.

Binary classifications developed to categories the eye state in the classes open and closed. Feature subset selection is one of the important steps in classification. The present work is for finding feature subset selection named as Incremental Feature Reordering (IFR), it gives most non dominant feature (MND) for Electroencephalography (EEG) signal corpus and create reorder set. The removal of MND gives optimal subset feature and it increases the classifier accuracy and efficiency. The data structure used here is a two way doubly linked list, it creates dynamic environment for reordering the ordered set.	[Sahu, Mridu; Nagwani, N.

Materials and Methods: The EMD is used to extract features from intracranial electroencephalography (EEG). A machine-learning algorithm is used as a classifier to discriminate between seizure and nonseizure intracranial EEG epochs. A postprocessing algorithm is proposed to reject artifacts and increase the robustness of the method. The proposed method was evaluated using 463 hours of intracranial EEG recordings from 17 patients with a total of 51 seizures in the Freiburg EEG database. Results: The proposed method had better performance than most of the existing seizure detection systems, including an average sensitivity of 92%, false detection rate (FDR) of 0.17/hour, and time delay (TD) of 12 sec. Moreover, the FDR could be further reduced by a TD extension. Conclusions: Given its high sensitivity and low FDR, the proposed patient-specific seizure detection method can greatly assist clinical staff with automatically marking seizures in long-term EEG or detecting seizure onset online with high performance. Early and accurate seizure detection using this method may serve as a practical tool for planning epilepsy interventions.

Due to correlation between these patterns and some diseases, it is necessary to develop algorithms to detect them. In this study, a new method is used to detect K-complexes automatically. 10 time-series and chaotic features were used in order to extract the K-complex waves from stage 2 sleep. To use the most effective features, feature space dimension is reduced with Sequential Forward Selection method. The reduced feature space is classified using Generalized Radial Basis Function Extreme Learning Machine (MELM-GRBF) algorithm. GRBFs make the modification of the RBF possible by adjusting a new parameter t. We're applied this methodology to K-complex classification for the first time. The classifier gives noticeably better results compared to ELM-RBF method for sensitivity and accuracy 61.00 +/- 6.6 and 96.15 +/- 3.7, respectively.

Effective and accurate classification of Electroencephalography (EEG) signals is important in performance of BCI systems. In this paper, a mental task classification approach based on sparse representation is proposed. A dictionary is used for classification, which is the combination of power spectral density calculated from EEG signal and common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm. L1 minimization was used to classify EEG signals. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides higher classification performance compared to SVM and KNN classifiers. Based on the results average accuracy rates are as follows: 91.50%, 82.83%, 77.50% and 74%, for two, three, four and five classes, respectively.

Predictive classification of self-paced upper-limb analytical movements with EEG	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Electroencephalography; Voluntary movements; Genetic algorithms; Data mining	EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; HUMAN VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; SPATIOTEMPORAL PATTERNS; BRAIN; INTENTION; SIGNALS; HAND; SYNCHRONIZATION; OSCILLATIONS	The extent to which the electroencephalographic activity allows the characterization of movements with the upper limb is an open question. This paper describes the design and validation of a classifier of upper-limb analytical movements based on electroencephalographic activity extracted from intervals preceding self-initiated movement tasks. Features selected for the classification are subject specific and associated with the movement tasks. Further tests are performed to reject the hypothesis that other information different from the task-related cortical activity is being used by the classifiers. Six healthy subjects were measured performing self-initiated upper-limb analytical movements. A Bayesian classifier was used to classify among seven different kinds of movements. Features considered covered the alpha and beta bands. A genetic algorithm was used to optimally select a subset of features for the classification. An average accuracy of 62.9 +/- 7.5 % was reached, which was above the baseline level observed with the proposed methodology (30.2 +/- 4.3 %). The study shows how the electroencephalography carries information about the type of analytical movement performed with the upper limb and how it can be decoded before the movement begins. In neurorehabilitation environments, this information could be used for monitoring and assisting purposes.	[Ibanez, Jaime; Pons, J.

Considering this difficulty in the diagnosis it is also very complicated to establish the prognosis of patients who present PA-EEG. The goal of this paper is to propose a method capable of determining patient prognosis based on characteristics of the PA-EEG activity.

We review the principles and approaches we have taken to develop a sensorimotor rhythm electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). The methods include developing BCI systems incorporating the control of physical devices to increase user engagement, improving BCI systems by inversely mapping scalp-recorded EEG signals to the cortical source domain, integrating BCI with noninvasive neuromodulation strategies to improve learning, and incorporating mind-body awareness training to enhance BCI learning and performance. The challenges and merits of these strategies are discussed, together with recent findings. Our work indicates that the sensorimotor-rhythm-based noninvasive BCI has the potential to provide communication and control capabilities as an alternative to physiological motor pathways.

For example, in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks, the subject is presented with a continuous stream of images containing rare target images among standard images, while the algorithm has to detect brain activity associated with target images. Here, we continue our previous work, presenting a deep neural network model for the use of single trial EEG classification in RSVP tasks. Deep neural networks have shown state of the art performance in computer vision and speech recognition and thus have great promise for other learning tasks, like classification of EEG samples. In our model, we introduce a novel spatio-temporal regularization for BEG data to reduce overfitting. We show improved classification performance compared to our earlier work on a five categories RSVP experiment. In addition, we compare performance on data from different sessions and validate the model on a public benchmark data set of a P300 speller task. Finally, we discuss the advantages of using neural network models compared to manually designing feature extraction algorithms.

The major goal of BCI research is to develop a system that allows disabled people to communicate with other people, to control artificial limbs, or to control their environment. BCI is a challenging topic of computer vision research. It is extensively used by disabled people to communicate with other persons and helps to interact with the external environments. This paper provides an insight into object recognition by analyzing EEG signals in real-time. Three machine learning algorithms are implemented which are used for classification by supervised learning, namely Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine (SVM), multiple training sets and users are taken into account during the experiment and the efficiency of each algorithm is compared to suggest the best suited algorithm for this purpose.

Electroencephalography (EEG), Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are the most common neuroimaging techniques to elicit brain behavior. By using these techniques different activity patterns can be measured within the brain to decode the content of mental processes especially the visual and auditory content. This paper discusses the models and imaging techniques used in visual decoding to investigate the different conditions of brain along with recent advancements in brain decoding. This paper concludes that it's not possible to extract all the information from the brain, however careful experimentation, interpretation and powerful statistical tools can be used with the neuroimaging techniques for better results.

Electrical brain activity recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) can be automatically interpreted by supervised learning classifiers according to the descriptive features of the signal. This paper investigates the performance of novel feature extraction based on a signal source localization and Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) methods. The proposed approach was evaluated by the reference EEG dataset yielding an average classification accuracy of 74.6 % for a chosen group of subjects. It is shown that CSP feature extraction performs significantly better when applied to source components compared to features from the original sensor domain.

HEADACHE			English	Article						EEG electroencephalography; ICHD International Classification of Headache Disorders; MRI magnetic resonance imaging	HEADACHE; REVISION; CALL	Background.-The concept of migralepsy refers to visual migraine auras that seemingly evolve into epileptic seizures. It was discussed controversially ever since and scientific proof for this entity is scarce. Methods.-We report two patients with visual aura fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for migralepsy. In both patients, habitual attacks were recorded during long-term video electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring. Case results.-Both patients demonstrated unilateral occipital EEG seizure patterns during their long-lasting visual aura, which eventually evolved into versive seizures. Conclusion.-Here, we prove the epileptic origin of the visual auras, which have been misdiagnosed as migraine or migralepsy before. Additional evaluation should be considered in patients with visual aura and hints for an epileptic origin as occipital lobe epilepsy might be missed in patients diagnosed with migraine. Based on our patients, we suggest to challenge the concept of migralepsy in current classifications.

EEG was recorded from a large sample of subjects (n = 289) who had answered questionnaires measuring personality trait scores of the five dimensions as well as the 10 subordinate aspects of the Big Five. Machine learning algorithms were used to build a classifier to predict each personality trait from power spectra of the resting state EEG data. The results indicate that the five dimensions as well as their subordinate aspects could not be predicted from the resting state EEG data. Finally, to demonstrate that this result is not due to systematic algorithmic or implementation mistakes the same methods were used to successfully classify whether the subject had eyes open or closed. These results indicate that the extraction of personality traits from the power spectra of resting state EEG is extremely noisy, if possible at all.

Currently used diagnostic approaches include the traditional neuropsychological tests, and recently more objective biomarkers, such as those obtained from cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), magnetic imaging resonance (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). Electroencephalography (EEG), a lower cost and non-invasive alternative, has been previously tried but with mixed success. In this effort, we attempt a more comprehensive analysis and comparison of machine learning approaches using EEG based features to determine diagnostic utility of the EEG. We compared support vector machine (SVM), naive Bayes, multilayer perceptron (MLP), CART trees, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and AdaBoost on various sets of features extracted from event related potentials (ERP) of the EEG. Our analysis suggests that there is indeed diagnostically useful information in the ERP of the EEG for early diagnosis of AD.

Multimodal data and machine learning for surgery outcome prediction in complicated cases of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Mesial temporal epilepsy; Surgical outcome prediction; Supervised learning; Mutual information	VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; FEATURE-SELECTION; PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; SEIZURE-ONSET; DIAGNOSIS; SCLEROSIS; EEG; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; CLASSIFICATION; ATROPHY	Background: This study sought to predict postsurgical seizure freedom from pre-operative diagnostic test results and clinical information using a rapid automated approach, based on supervised learning methods in patients with drug-resistant focal seizures suspected to begin in temporal lobe. Method: We applied machine learning, specifically a combination of mutual information-based feature selection and supervised learning classifiers on multimodal data, to predict surgery outcome retrospectively in 20 presurgical patients (13 female; mean age +/- SD, in years 33 +/- 9.7 for females, and 353 +/- 9.4 for males) who were diagnosed with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and subsequently underwent standard anteromesial temporal lobectomy. The main advantage of the present work over previous studies is the inclusion of the extent of ipsilateral neocortical gray matter atrophy and spatiotemporal properties of depth electrode-recorded seizures as training features for individual patient surgery planning. Results: A maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) feature selector identified the following features as the most informative predictors of postsurgical seizure freedom in this study's sample of patients: family history of epilepsy, ictal EEG onset pattern (positive correlation with seizure freedom), MRI-based gray matter thickness reduction in the hemisphere ipsilateral to seizure onset, proportion of seizures that first appeared in ipsilateral amygdala to total seizures, age, epilepsy duration, delay in the spread of ipsilateral ictal discharges from site of onset, gender, and number of electrode contacts at seizure onset (negative correlation with seizure freedom). Using these features in combination with a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier compared to other commonly used classifiers resulted in very high surgical outcome prediction accuracy (95%). Conclusions: Supervised machine learning using multimodal compared to unimodal data accurately predicted postsurgical outcome in patients with atypical MTLE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The time-frequency-phase features are extracted from mu rhythm and beta rhythms, and the features are optimized using three process methods: no-scaled feature using "MIFS" feature selection criterion, scaled feature using "MIFS" feature selection criterion, and scaled feature using "mRMR" feature selection criterion. Support vector machines (SVMs) and extreme learning machines (ELMs) are compared for classification between clench speed and clench force motor imagery using the optimized feature. Our results show that no significant difference in the classification rate between SVMs and ELMs is found. The scaled feature combinations can get higher classification accuracy than the no-scaled feature combinations at significant level of 0.01, and the "mRMR" feature selection criterion can get higher classification rate than the "MIFS" feature selection criterion at significant level of 0.01. The time-frequency-phase feature can improve the classification rate by about 20% more than the time-frequency feature, and the best classification rate between clench speed motor imagery and clench force motor imagery is 92%. In conclusion, the motor parameter imagery paradigm has the potential to increase the direct control commands for BCI control and the time-frequency-phase feature has the ability to improve BCI classification accuracy.

In this paper, a novel algorithm termed spatio-temporally regularized common spatial patterns (STR-CSP) is proposed to enhance CSP such that discriminative spatio-temporal EEG patterns can be extracted. Unlike most previous CSP-based spatio-temporal filtering algorithms in which spatial and temporal filters are optimized in a sequential manner, STR-CSP optimizes spatio-temporal filters simultaneously under a unified criterion with analytical solutions. Moreover, the algorithm enables us to alleviate the over-fitting problem by l2-norm regularization. Successful application to the analysis of a BCI competition EEG data set comprising 18 subsets demonstrates the superiority of STR-CSP over contemporary methods.

Efficient Labeling of EEG Signal Artifacts using Active Learning	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC 2015): BIG DATA ANALYTICS FOR HUMAN-CENTRIC SYSTEMS	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 09-12, 2015	City Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc, Hong Kong Polytechn Univ, K C Wong Fdn	City Univ Hong Kong	EEG; Artifacts; Active Learning; Support Vector Machine; Autoregressive Model	CLASSIFICATION	Electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely used in a variety of contexts, including medical monitoring of subjects as well as performance monitoring in healthy individuals. Recent technological advances have now enabled researchers to quickly record and collect EEG on a wide scale. Although EEG is fairly easy to record, it is highly susceptible to noise sources called artifacts which can occur at amplitudes several times greater than the EEG signal of interest. Because of this, users must manually annotate the EEG signal to identify artifact regions in the data prior to any downstream processing. This can be time-consuming and impractical for large data collections. In this paper we present a method which uses Active Learning (AL) to improve the reliability of existing EEG artifact classifiers with minimal amounts of user interaction. Our results show that classification accuracy equivalent to classifiers trained on full data annotation can be obtained while labeling less than 25% of the data. This suggests significant time savings can be obtained when manually annotating artifacts in large EEG data collections.

Past studies present some unique features revealed from spectral principal component analysis (PCA) on electrophysiological data recorded in both the surface of the brain (electrocorticography, ECoG) and the scalp (electroencephalography, EEG). These features contain discriminable information about fine individual finger movements from one hand. However, the efficacy of these spectral features has not been well investigated under the application of various classifiers. In the present study, we set out to investigate the topic using noninvasive human EEG. Several classifiers were chosen to explore their capability in capturing the spectral PC features to decode individual finger movements pairwisely from one hand using noninvasive EEG, aiming to investigate the efficacy of these spectral features in a decoding task.

Spatiotemporal Representations of Rapid Visual Target Detection: A Single-Trial EEG Classification Algorithm	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain computer interface (BCI); classification; electroencephalography (EEG); rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; SPATIAL FILTERS	Brain computer interface applications, developed for both healthy and clinical populations, critically depend on decoding brain activity in single trials. The goal of the present study was to detect distinctive spatiotemporal brain patterns within a set of event related responses. We introduce a novel classification algorithm, the spatially weighted FLD-PCA (SWFP), which is based on a two-step linear classification of event-related responses, using fisher linear discriminant (FLD) classifier and principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. As a benchmark algorithm, we consider the hierarchical discriminant component Analysis (HDCA), introduced by Parra, et al. 2007. We also consider a modified version of the HDCA, namely the hierarchical discriminant principal component analysis algorithm (HDPCA). We compare single-trial classification accuracies of all the three algorithms, each applied to detect target images within a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP, 10 Hz) of images from five different object categories, based on single-trial brain responses. We find a systematic superiority of our classification algorithm in the tested paradigm. Additionally, HDPCA significantly increases classification accuracies compared to the HDCA. Finally, we show that presenting several repetitions of the same image exemplars improve accuracy, and thus may be important in cases where high accuracy is crucial.

Since the inception of EEG technology physicians have successfully developed an eye to undercover the intrinsic patterns of EEG, scouring for hints of diseases and pathologies. This works approaches the BCI problem following this direction, by translating each signal into a 2D plotted image, and mimicking the physician approach though using an image processing technique, the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) classification. Is it possible to discriminate EEG signals based on their plots? In this paper we aim to take the first steps to answer this question, and we show the results of applying this method to two different datasets.	[Ramele, R.; Villar, A. J.; Santos, J.

Improved Detection and Force Decoding through Combined Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Electroencephalographic Measurements	REPLACE, REPAIR, RESTORE, RELIEVE - BRIDGING CLINICAL AND ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS IN NEUROREHABILITATION	Biosystems and Biorobotics		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on NeuroRehabilitation (ICNR)	JUN 24-26, 2014	Aalborg, DENMARK				BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; STROKE	Stroke is the leading cause of acquired disability worldwide. Therefore, several techniques have been suggested for the rehabilitation such as brain-computer interface technology combined with assistive technology. To control the assistive technology, the brain activity should be decoded to determine when the patient intends to initiate a movement, moreover, the kinetic information should be decoded. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded simultaneously with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to determine whether the detection of foot movements and force decoding could be improved using a hybrid approach (combination of EEG and NIRS). Fourteen healthy subjects performed foot movements associated with two levels of force (20 % and 60 % maximum voluntary contraction, MVC) from which subject independent features were extracted and classified using linear discriminant analysis. The detection accuracy was 76 +/- 10 % and force decoding was 81 +/- 15 % when using the hybrid approach. The performance was on average improved with more than 10 percentage points. It was found that EEG and NIRS were almost as good as the hybrid approach for movement detection and force decoding, respectively. This study showed that BCI performance may be improved with simultaneous recordings of EEG and NIRS.

This paper introduces a novel method to discriminate 2-class motor imagery states (left and right hand) using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), common spatial pattern (CSP) and random forest. Conventionally CSP is used after extracting frequency band segment of EEG signal, which is called bandpass-filtered CSP (BPCSP). Especially filter bank CSP (FBCSP) has been extensively used to extract feature vectors from EEG data. However in these methods, the range of frequency band needed to be specified in advance and the performance depends on the selected frequency band. Our new method can decide the frequency band automatically by using NMF (NMFCSP). After the feature vectors were extracted from EEG data, random forests (RF) method was adopted as a classification algorithm. The mean accuracy rate of 2-class classifier using NMFCSP was 78.8 +/- 3.27%. This is higher than the accuracy rate of BPCSP (64.4 +/- 8.53%) and FBCSP (68.4 +/- 6.81%).

Your Brain on Art: Emergent Cortical Dynamics During Aesthetic Experiences	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; machine learning; functional connectivity (FC); aesthetics; freely moving	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; DECISION-MAKING; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; APPRECIATION; POTENTIALS; NETWORKS; DELTA	The brain response to conceptual art was studied with mobile electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the neural basis of aesthetic experiences. In contrast to most studies of perceptual phenomena, participants were moving and thinking freely as they viewed the exhibit The Boundary of Life is Quietly Crossed by Dario Robleto at the Menil Collection-Houston. The brain activity of over 400 subjects was recorded using dry electrode and one reference gel based EEG systems over a period of 3 months. Here, we report initial findings based on the reference system. EEG segments corresponding to each art piece were grouped into one of three classes (complex, moderate, and baseline) based on analysis of a digital image of each piece. Time, frequency, and wavelet features extracted from EEG were used to classify patterns associated with viewing art, and ranked based on their relevance for classification. The maximum classification accuracy was 55% (chance = 33%) with delta and gamma features the most relevant for classification. Functional analysis revealed a significant increase in connection strength in localized brain networks while subjects viewed the most aesthetically pleasing art compared to viewing a blank wall. The direction of signal flow showed early recruitment of broad posterior areas followed by focal anterior activation. Significant differences in the strength of connections were also observed across age and gender. This work provides evidence that EEG, deployed on freely behaving subjects, can detect selective signal flow in neural networks, identify significant differences between subject groups, and report with greater-than-chance accuracy the complexity of a subject's visual percept of aesthetically pleasing art. Our approach, which allows acquisition of neural activity "in action and context," could lead to understanding of how the brain integrates sensory input and its ongoing internal state to produce the phenomenon which we term aesthetic experience.

Recent studies have provided evidence that temporal envelope driven speech decoding from high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography recordings can identify the attended speech stream in a multi-speaker scenario. The present work replicated the previous high density EEG study and investigated the necessary technical requirements for practical attended speech decoding with EEG. Approach. Twelve normal hearing participants attended to one out of two simultaneously presented audiobook stories, while high density EEG was recorded. An offline iterative procedure eliminating those channels contributing the least to decoding provided insight into the necessary channel number and optimal cross-subject channel configuration. Aiming towards the future goal of near real-time classification with an individually trained decoder, the minimum duration of training data necessary for successful classification was determined by using a chronological cross-validation approach. Main results. Close replication of the previously reported results confirmed the method robustness. Decoder performance remained stable from 96 channels down to 25. Furthermore, for less than 15 min of training data, the subject-independent (pre-trained) decoder performed better than an individually trained decoder did. Significance. Our study complements previous research and provides information suggesting that efficient low-density EEG online decoding is within reach.

Global cortical activity predicts shape of hand during grasping	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						grasping; electroencephalography; decoding; brain-machine interfaces	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; BRAIN-MACHINE INTERFACES; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC SIGNALS; COMPUTER INTERFACE; AREA F5; MOVEMENTS; REACH; KINEMATICS; PREMOTOR	Recent studies show that the amplitude of cortical field potentials is modulated in the time domain by grasping kinematics. However, it is unknown if these low frequency modulations persist and contain enough information to decode grasp kinematics in macro-scale activity measured at the scalp via electroencephalography (EEG). Further, it is unclear as to whether joint angle velocities or movement synergies are the optimal kinematics spaces to decode. In this offline decoding study, we infer from human EEG, hand joint angular velocities as well as synergistic trajectories as subjects perform natural reach-to-grasp movements. Decoding accuracy, measured as the correlation coefficient (r) between the predicted and actual movement kinematics, was r = 0.49 +/- 0.02 across 15 hand joints. Across the first three kinematic synergies, decoding accuracies were r = 0.59 +/- 0.04, 0.47 +/- 0.06, and 0.32 +/- 0.05. The spatial-temporal pattern of EEG channel recruitment showed early involvement of contralateral frontal-central scalp areas followed by later activation of central electrodes over primary sensorimotor cortical areas. Information content in EEG about the grasp type peaked at 250 ms after movement onset. The high decoding accuracies in this study are significant not only as evidence for time-domain modulation in macro-scale brain activity, but for the field of brain-machine interfaces as well. Our decoding strategy, which harnesses the neural "symphony" as opposed to local members of the neural ensemble (as in intracranial approaches), may provide a means of extracting information about motor intent for grasping without the need for penetrating electrodes and suggests that it may be soon possible to develop non-invasive neural interfaces for the control of prosthetic limbs.

These activities are generally measured by Electroencephalography (EEG). BCI uses pattern recognition approach in which features are extracted from EEG signals which are used to identify the user's mental state. BCI commonly used feature extraction method is Common Spatial Pattern (CSP). Despite of its effective usefulness, it suffers from intrinsic variations and nonstationarity of EEG data as CSP ignores the within class dissimilarities. Also, the formulation of CSP criteria is based on variance using L2-norm, which makes it sensitive to outliers too. A new PCA plus LDA method based on L1-norm has been proposed alternative to CSP which efficiently considers between the classes and within the class dissimilarities. Also the objective function is reformulated using L1-norm to suppress the effect of outliers. The optimal spatial pattern of given method are obtained by introducing an iterative algorithm. The proposed method was evaluated against Dataset IIa of BCI Competition IV. The result showed that the proposed method outperformed in almost all the cases with low mis-classification rate and results in average kappa value 0.3482.

J	Correia, JM; Jansma, B; Hausfeld, L; Kikkert, S; Bonte, M				Correia, Joao M.; Jansma, Bernadette; Hausfeld, Lars; Kikkert, Sanne; Bonte, Milene			EEG decoding of spoken words in bilingual listeners: from words to language invariant semantic-conceptual representations	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						EEG decoding; EEG oscillations; speech perception; spoken word recognition; bilinguals; semantic representations; conceptual representation	ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; TIME-COURSE; PATTERN-ANALYSIS; SPEECH; INTEGRATION; RESPONSES; MEMORY; VOICE	Spoken word recognition and production require fast transformations between acoustic, phonological, and conceptual neural representations. Bilinguals perform these transformations in native and non-native languages, deriving unified semantic concepts from equivalent, but acoustically different words. Here we exploit this capacity of bilinguals to investigate input invariant semantic representations in the brain. We acquired EEG data while Dutch subjects, highly proficient in English listened to four monosyllabic and acoustically distinct animal words in both languages (e.g., "paard" - "horse"). Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was applied to identify EEG response patterns that discriminate between individual words within one language (within-language discrimination) and generalize meaning across two languages (across-language generalization). Furthermore, employing two EEG feature selection approaches, we assessed the contribution of temporal and oscillatory EEG features to our classification results. MVPA revealed that within-language discrimination was possible in a broad time-window (similar to 50-620 ms) after word onset probably reflecting acoustic-phonetic and semantic-conceptual differences between the words. Most interestingly, significant across-language generalization was possible around 550-600 ms, suggesting the activation of common semantic-conceptual representations from the Dutch and English nouns. Both types of classification, showed a strong contribution of oscillations below 12 Hz, indicating the importance of low frequency oscillations in the neural representation of individual words and concepts. This study demonstrates the feasibility of MVPA to decode individual spoken words from EEG responses and to assess the spectro-temporal dynamics of their language invariant semantic-conceptual representations. We discuss how this method and results could be relevant to track the neural mechanisms underlying conceptual encoding in comprehension and production.

In this scheme, the discrete wavelet transform is applied on EEG signals and the relative wavelet energy is calculated in terms of detailed coefficients and the approximation coefficients of the last decomposition level. The extracted relative wavelet energy features are passed to classifiers for the classification purpose. The EEG dataset employed for the validation of the proposed method consisted of two classes: (1) the EEG signals recorded during the complex cognitive task-Raven's advance progressive metric test and (2) the EEG signals recorded in rest condition-eyes open. The performance of four different classifiers was evaluated with four performance measures, i.e., accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision values. The accuracy was achieved above 98 % by the support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron and the K-nearest neighbor classifiers with approximation (A4) and detailed coefficients (D4), which represent the frequency range of 0.53-3.06 and 3.06-6.12 Hz, respectively. The findings of this study demonstrated that the proposed feature extraction approach has the potential to classify the EEG signals recorded during a complex cognitive task by achieving a high accuracy rate.

J	Liao, K; Xiao, R; Gonzalez, J; Ding, L				Liao, Ke; Xiao, Ran; Gonzalez, Jania; Ding, Lei			Decoding Individual Finger Movements from One Hand Using Human EEG Signals	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; ONLINE CLASSIFICATION; MOTOR IMAGERY; MEG; COMMUNICATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; DISCRIMINATION; EXECUTION; FEATURES; TRIALS	Brain computer interface (BCI) is an assistive technology, which decodes neurophysiological signals generated by the human brain and translates them into control signals to control external devices, e. g., wheelchairs. One problem challenging noninvasive BCI technologies is the limited control dimensions from decoding movements of, mainly, large body parts, e. g., upper and lower limbs. It has been reported that complicated dexterous functions, i.e., finger movements, can be decoded in electrocorticography (ECoG) signals, while it remains unclear whether noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals also have sufficient information to decode the same type of movements. Phenomena of broadband power increase and low-frequency-band power decrease were observed in EEG in the present study, when EEG power spectra were decomposed by a principal component analysis (PCA). These movement-related spectral structures and their changes caused by finger movements in EEG are consistent with observations in previous ECoG study, as well as the results from ECoG data in the present study. The average decoding accuracy of 77.11% over all subjects was obtained in classifying each pair of fingers from one hand using movement-related spectral changes as features to be decoded using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The average decoding accuracy in three epilepsy patients using ECoG data was 91.28% with the similarly obtained features and same classifier. Both decoding accuracies of EEG and ECoG are significantly higher than the empirical guessing level (51.26%) in all subjects (p<0.05). The present study suggests the similar movement-related spectral changes in EEG as in ECoG, and demonstrates the feasibility of discriminating finger movements from one hand using EEG. These findings are promising to facilitate the development of BCIs with rich control signals using noninvasive technologies.

This research concentrates on developing new augmentative communication and control technologies for those with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as stroke and spinal cord injury. Most BCIs decode the intent of the user from the brain's electrical activity as recorded from the scalp (electroencephalography, EEG). The EEG signal is very difficult to process, but many advances have been made to translate the signal into commands. At The University of Auckland, EEG-based BCIs have been under development for the past few years. Our laboratory has produced excellent results including an EEG controlled video game, an EEG phone dialing system, and an EEG active rehabilitation exercise. Research is ongoing in this area, with new projects starting for control of prostheses or rehabilitation robots in clinical trials.

These pattern recognition based methods present clear benefits over classical (univariate) techniques, by providing predictions for unseen data, as well as the weights of each feature in the model. Machine learning methods have been applied to a range of data, from MRI to EEG. However, these multivariate techniques have scarcely been applied to electrocorticography (ECoG) data to investigate cognitive neuroscience questions.

The paper investigates the presence of autism using the functional brain connectivity measures derived from electro-encephalogram (EEG) of children during face perception tasks. Approach. Phase synchronized patterns from 128-channel EEG signals are obtained for typical children and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The phase synchronized states or synchrostates temporally switch amongst themselves as an underlying process for the completion of a particular cognitive task. We used 12 subjects in each group (ASD and typical) for analyzing their EEG while processing fearful, happy and neutral faces. The minimal and maximally occurring synchrostates for each subject are chosen for extraction of brain connectivity features, which are used for classification between these two groups of subjects. Among different supervised learning techniques, we here explored the discriminant analysis and support vector machine both with polynomial kernels for the classification task. Main results. The leave one out cross-validation of the classification algorithm gives 94.7% accuracy as the best performance with corresponding sensitivity and specificity values as 85.7% and 100% respectively. Significance. The proposed method gives high classification accuracies and outperforms other contemporary research results. The effectiveness of the proposed method for classification of autistic and typical children suggests the possibility of using it on a larger population to validate it for clinical practice.

J	Song, XM; Yoon, SC				Song, Xiaomu; Yoon, Suk-Chung			Improving brain-computer interface classification using adaptive common spatial patterns	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Common spatial patterns; Electroencephalography; Adaptive; Nonstationarity	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; FILTERS	Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) is a widely used spatial filtering technique for electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). It is a two-class supervised technique that needs subject-specific training data. Due to EEG nonstationarity, EEG signal may exhibit significant intra- and inter-subject variation. As a result, spatial filters learned from a subject may not perform well for data acquired from the same subject at a different time or from other subjects performing the same task. Studies have been performed to improve CSP's performance by adding regularization terms into the training. Most of them require target subjects' training data with known class labels. In this work, an adaptive CSP (ACSP) method is proposed to analyze single trial EEG data from single and multiple subjects. The method does not estimate target data's class labels during the adaptive learning and updates spatial filters for both classes simultaneously. The proposed method was evaluated based on a comparison study with the classic CSP and several CSP-based adaptive methods using motor imagery EEG data from BCI competitions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can improve the classification performance as compared to the other methods. For circumstances where true class labels of target data are not instantly available, it was examined if adding classified target data to training data would improve the ACSP learning. Experimental results show that it would be better to exclude them from the training data. The proposed ACSP method can be performed in real-time and is potentially applicable to various EEG-based BCI applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

EEG based Neurofeedback (NFB) works by reinforcing desired brainwave patterns and shows great promise for enhancing performance and treating mental disorders. Yet, both clinical and at-home efficacies remain low. We propose a novel Self-Calibrating Protocol (SCP) which can robustly classify brain states when coupled with five standard machine learning algorithms. Our results indicate that commercially available, wearable EEG sensors provide sufficient data fidelity at fast enough rates to differentiate between arbitrary, user-defined states in real time. We conclude that SCP allows for the first time to completely bypass the pitfalls of using "normed" neurophysiological states and leads off to individualized therapeutics and bespoke performance enhancement applications.

NeuCube is a three dimensional brain-like model of evolving spiking neurons that can be trained with SSTD such as fMRI, EEG and other brain data. This SSTD is mapped, analyzed, modeled and trained, and the result from these processes can be used to better understand the brain processes and to better recognize brain patterns, and thus to extract new knowledge that may reside within the SSTD. From the experimental results we can conclude that the NeuCube architecture is capable of producing significantly more accurate classification results when compared with standard machine learning methods such as SVM and MLP. Moreover, the NeuCube method facilitates deep learning of the SSTD and deeper analysis of the spatio-temporal characteristics and patterns in the fMRI SSTD.

J	Cecotti, H; Eckstein, MP; Giesbrecht, B				Cecotti, Hubert; Eckstein, Miguel P.; Giesbrecht, Barry			Single-Trial Classification of Event-Related Potentials in Rapid Serial Visual Presentation Tasks Using Supervised Spatial Filtering	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); common spatial patterns (CSP); convolution; electroencephalogram (EEG); neural networks; rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP); spatial filters	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; EEG; P300; VISION; MODEL	Accurate detection of single-trial event-related potentials (ERPs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) is a difficult problem that requires efficient signal processing and machine learning techniques. Supervised spatial filtering methods that enhance the discriminative information in EEG data are commonly used to improve single-trial ERP detection. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a layer dedicated to spatial filtering for the detection of ERPs and with training based on the maximization of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The CNN is compared with three common classifiers: 1) Bayesian linear discriminant analysis; 2) multilayer perceptron (MLP); and 3) support vector machines. Prior to classification, the data were spatially filtered with xDAWN (for the maximization of the signal-to-signal-plus-noise ratio), common spatial pattern, or not spatially filtered. The 12 analytical techniques were tested on EEG data recorded in three rapid serial visual presentation experiments that required the observer to discriminate rare target stimuli from frequent nontarget stimuli. Classification performance discriminating targets from nontargets depended on both the spatial filtering method and the classifier. In addition, the nonlinear classifier MLP outperformed the linear methods. Finally, training based AUC maximization provided better performance than training based on the minimization of the mean square error. The results support the conclusion that the choice of the systems architecture is critical and both spatial filtering and classification must be considered together.

Defining the clinical significance of these patterns requires standardized terminology with high interrater agreement (IRA). We sought to evaluate IRA for the final, published American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS)-approved version of the critical care EEG terminology (2012 version). Our evaluation included terms not assessed previously and incorporated raters with a broad range of EEG reading experience. MethodsAfter reviewing a set of training slides, 49 readers independently completed a Web-based test consisting of 11 identical questions for each of 37 EEG samples (407 questions). Questions assessed whether a pattern was an electrographic seizure; pattern location (main term 1), pattern type (main term 2); and presence and classification of eight other key features (plus modifiers, sharpness, absolute and relative amplitude, frequency, number of phases, fluctuation/evolution, and the presence of triphasic morphology). ResultsIRA statistics ( values) were almost perfect (90-100%) for seizures, main terms 1 and 2, the +S modifier (superimposed spikes/sharp waves or sharply contoured rhythmic delta activity), sharpness, absolute amplitude, frequency, and number of phases. Agreement was substantial for the +F (superimposed fast activity) and +R (superimposed rhythmic delta activity) modifiers (66% and 67%, respectively), moderate for triphasic morphology (58%), and fair for evolution (21%). SignificanceIRA for most terms in the ACNS critical care EEG terminology is high. These terms are suitable for multicenter research on the clinical significance of critical care EEG patterns.

Also, the design and implementation of 3D virtual environments for BCI training purposes has proven to be effective due to the high interaction with the end user and the assistance for recreating a specific type of signal or behavior. The aim of this paper is to present a method and the results of applying a binary Density Based Support Vector Machine (DBSVM) Classifier in a 3D virtual environment designed for interacting with EEG predefined signal patterns. The environment trains the classifier by taking 180 second EPOCHs and classifying them into a successful/unsuccessful attempt per test subject. The applications can be extended for implementing a mind-wave pattern password or tracing a specific set of mind-based commands for virtual path tracing purposes. The tested SVM had a success rate of 60%. Further work includes the study of different classifier features and implementation of a dynamic classifier.

There are many kinds of physiological signal can operate BCI systems. Motor imagery (MI) has been demonstrated to be a good way to operate a BCI system. In some recent studies about MI based BCI systems, low accuracy rate and time consuming are common problems. In this thesis, a novel motor imagery algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy rate and computational efficiency at the same time. The architecture of many BCI system is quite complex and they involve time consuming processing. The electroencephalography (EEG) signal is the most commonly used inputs for BCI applications but EEG is often contaminated with noise. To overcome such drawbacks, in this paper we use the common spatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction from EEG and the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for motor imagery classification. In this study, CSP and LDA have been used to reduce the artifact and classify MI-based EEG signal. We have used two-level cross validation scheme to determine the subject specific best time window and number of CSP features. We have compared the performance of our system with BCI competition results. This novel algorithm with high accuracy rate and efficiency can be applied to real time BCI system in real-life applications.

In motor control applications, these challenges can include identifying brain areas that respond considerably differently to resting state versus limb motion tasks or real motion versus imaginary motion. The eLORETA (exact low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography) source localization algorithm is a potent technique to pinpoint cortical areas using brain signals but it has not yet been applied for motor control applications. In a pilot study, we analyzed human EEG (electroencephalography) during real and imagined movements of upper and lower limbs using the eLORETA algorithm after computing eight selected spectral EEG measures. For certain tasks and movement types, we observed statistically significant differences (p<0.001) in spectral measures. Subsequently, we performed pattern classification to discern real vs. imaginary movement in the eLORETA brain areas as a proof of principle for BCI uses.

Eight elementary school students (4 male and 4 female) were recruited as participants to see some emotion pictures in international affective picture system (IAPS), and to collect their affective information-attention, meditation, electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and SpO2 for developing the affective norm recognition system. These bio-physiology signals were extracted important features selection (Factor analysis) to serve as the input variables for radial basis function (RBF) neural network model. The results showed that all types of factor analysis did not perform well in our emotion norm database. Factor analysis with covariance extraction has higher accumulative variances than correlation extraction. This study suggested that future research can adopt more nonlinear feature selection methods to develop a high accuracy support vector machine based emotion recognition system.

Revealing hidden states in visual working memory using electroencephalography	FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; multivariate pattern analysis; dynamic coding; hidden state; visual working memory	POPULATION VECTOR ANALYSIS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; REPRESENTATIONS; INFORMATION; MECHANISMS; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; OBJECTS	It is often assumed that information in visual working memory (vWM) is maintained via persistent activity. However, recent evidence indicates that information in vWM could be maintained in an effectively "activity-silent" neural state. Silent vWM is consistent with recent cognitive and neural models, but poses an important experimental problem: how can we study these silent states using conventional measures of brain activity? We propose a novel approach that is analogous to echolocation: using a high-contrast visual stimulus, it may be possible to drive brain activity during vWM maintenance and measure the vWM-dependent impulse response. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) while participants performed a vWM task in which a randomly oriented grating was remembered. Crucially, a high-contrast, task-irrelevant stimulus was shown in the maintenance period in half of the trials. The electrophysiological response from posterior channels was used to decode the orientations of the gratings. While orientations could be decoded during and shortly after stimulus presentation, decoding accuracy dropped back close to baseline in the delay. However, the visual evoked response from the task-irrelevant stimulus resulted in a clear re-emergence in decodability. This result provides important proof-of-concept for a promising and relatively simple approach to decode "activity-silent" vWM content using non-invasive EEG.

Movie clips are used as stimuli to evoke positive, neutral and negative emotions of subjects. We introduce a new effective classifier named discriminative graph regularized extreme learning machine (GELM) for EEG-based emotion recognition. The average classification accuracy of GELM using differential entropy (DE) features on the whole five frequency bands is 80.25%, while the accuracy of SVM is 76.62%. These results indicate that GELM is more suitable for emotion recognition than SVM. Additionally, the accuracies of GELM using DE features on Beta and Gamma bands are 79.07%, 79.93% respectively. This suggests that these two bands are more relevant to emotion. The experimental results indicate that the EEG patterns for emotion are generally stable among different experiments and subjects. By using minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance (MRMR) algorithm and correlation coefficients to select effective features, we get the distribution of top 20 subject-independent features and build a manifold model to monitor the trajectory of emotion changes with time.

To overcome the failure of standard classifiers at generalizing the patterns for such signals, we have proposed an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy based Adaptive neural fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). Through the introduction IT2F system, we have aimed at improving the uncertainty management of the fuzzy inference system. Besides that using DE in forward and backward pass and improving the forward pass function we have improved the parameter update on wide range of nodal functions without any quadratic approximation in forward pass. The proposed algorithm is tested on a standard electroencephalography (EEG) dataset and it is noted that the proposed algorithm performs better than other standard classifiers including the classical ANFIS algorithm.

However, it is still a challenge to effectively fuse and represent multi-channel EEG features. The coding based feature representation methods, such as sparse representation (SR), have achieved great success in computer vision and pattern recognition. Collaborative representation (CR) is a new coding method, which effectively works as a classifier. In this work, we first employ CR as a feature representation method. Moreover, a new joint CR (JCR) model is proposed for fusing multi-view data, which can represent not only the individual view information, but also the inner-correlative information between multi-views. JCR method is then applied to fuse and represent the features of multi-channel EEG signals for the classification of sleep stages. The experimental results indicate that CR feature outperforms SR feature, and JCR achieves best performance for sleep stage classification by effectively fusing multi-channel EEG signals.

The usage of BCI is severely limited due to the inconvenience of large number of channels used in recording devices. Moreover, Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) is a very well-known algorithm for its efficiency, but it just can extract the spatial information of the brain signals. To address these issues, we introduce the RMCSP method that exploits data in spectral, temporal and spatial domains in order to increase the classification accuracy in BCI. In addition, RMCSP is designed to handle EEG with small number of channels. To verify the efficacy of our approach, we rigorously tested the performances of the method in 17 subjects, from BCI competition datasets, in both two-class and four-class problems. Results show that RMCSP approach can outperform normal CSP method by nearly 10% in terms of median classification accuracy. It also enables us to significantly reduce the number of channels used in the datasets without decreasing the performances of the subjects.

It plays a very important role in establishing human computer interface. We as humans are able to understand the emotions of other person but it is literally impossible for the computer to do so. The present work is to achieve the same as accurately as possible. Emotion detection can be done either through text, speech, facial expression or gesture. In the present work the emotions are detected using Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. EEG records the electrical activity within the neurons of the brain. The main advantage of using EEG signals is that it detects real emotions arising straight from our mind and ignores external features like facial expressions or gesture. Hence EEG can act as real indicator of the emotion depicted by the subject. We have employed Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Machine Learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to classify EEG signals into seven different emotions. The accuracy achieved with both the algorithms is computed and compared. We are able to recognize seven emotions using the two algorithms, SVM and LDA with an average overall accuracy of 74.13% and 66.50% respectively. This accuracy was achieved after performing a 4-fold cross-validation. Future applications of emotion detection includes neuro-marketing, market survey, EEG based music therapy and music player.

In this work it is shown that index finger positions can be differentiated from non-invasive electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in healthy human subjects. Using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation procedure, a random forest distinguished different index finger positions on a numerical keyboard above chance-level accuracy. Among the different spectral features investigated, high beta-power (20-30 Hz) over contralateral sensorimotor cortex carried most information about finger position. Thus, these findings indicate that finger position is in principle decodable from non-invasive features of brain activity that generalize across individuals.

We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate long-term training effects across 10 sessions using a 2-class (right hand and feet) MI-based BCI in fifteen subjects. In the course of the training a significant enhancement of activation pattern emerges, represented by an [oxy-Hb] increase in fNIRS and a stronger event-related desynchronization in the upper beta-frequency band in the EEG. These effects were only visible in participants with relatively low BCI performance (mean accuracy <= 70%). We found that training with an MI-based BCI affects cortical activation patterns especially in users with low BCI performance. Our results may serve as a valuable contribution to the field of BCI research and provide information about the effects that training with an MI-based BCI has on cortical activation patterns. This might be useful for clinical applications of BCI which aim at promoting and guiding neuroplasticity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The objective is to investigate the effects of weight initialization in the neural network and to propose the best settings. Special operators like geometric ranking selection, blend-alpha crossover and non-uniform mutation are employed. For the initialization of the chromosomes the effect of the Nguyen-Widrow weight initialization and the random initialization on the training performance are compared. For the EEG corpus it is shown that the Nguyen-Widrow algorithm is more effective than the random method weight initialization when it is used with a stochastic training method. Compared to a previous study which used backpropagation as a training method, the error rate is decreased by around 10 percent if the GA is used as a training method.

Its diagnosis is generally performed using electroencephalography (EEG). But, the process of visually inspecting the EEG signals to trance out the seizure patterns has always been very time consuming and difficult. Researchers have continuously tried to automate the process of recognizing ictal patterns. But, the complexity and high erroneous outcomes from most of the deployed expert systems continues to limit practical realization. In this study, authors have presented a simple yet novel methodology to detect ictal patterns in EEG signals. The proposed model used intrinsic mode functions to plot 3D phase trajectories. The mean values of Euclidean distances calculated from these trajectories were used as input feature vectors to probabilistic neural network classifier. The outcomes from the classifier discriminated between the seizure and seizure-free patterns with similar to 98 % accuracy. The model achieved similar statistical performance in <0.03 s. Thus, attesting the design for application in practical settings.

One of the most frequently used approaches is the self regulation of oscillatory signals recorded with electroencephalography (EEG). Many patients are, however, unable to achieve sufficient voluntary control of brain activity. This could be due to the specific anatomical and physiological changes of the patient's brain after the lesion, as well as to methodological issues related to the technique chosen for recording brain signals. Methods: A patient with an extended ischemic lesion of the cortex did not gain volitional control of sensorimotor oscillations when using a standard EEG-based approach. We provided him with neurofeedback of his brain activity from the epidural space by electrocorticography (ECoG). Results: Ipsilesional epidural recordings of field potentials facilitated self-regulation of brain oscillations in an online closed-loop paradigm and allowed reliable neurofeedback training for a period of 4 weeks. Conclusion: Epidural implants may decode and train brain activity even when the cortical physiology is distorted following severe brain injury. Such practice would allow for reinforcement learning of preserved neural networks and may well provide restorative tools for those patients who are severely afflicted.

Then, the trained algorithms are used to predict the sleep stages of real human patients. Extended comparison results are demonstrated which indicate that both classifiers could be utilized as a basis for an unobtrusive sleep quality assessment.

Conventionally the most of BMI systems only accept EEG data when a subject performs some kind of task, such as motor imagery and gaze at visual stimuli. However, performing task causes fatigue of the subject. It is therefore important to develop classification algorithm for BMI system that utilizes rest state-EEG as one of the classes. The 3 classes we defined in this experiment were: (1) motor imagery of moving right hand; (2) motor imagery of moving left hand; and (3) rest state. And, we also measured EEG in an actual moving task (finger tapping) to ascertain validity of algorithm. We extracted feature vector using Finite Impulse Response (FIR) digital filter Filter Bank and multi-class Common Spatial Filter (mCSP) from EEG data, selected the feature by Mutual Information (MI), and made three 3-class classifiers using Random Forest (RF). The mean classification rate was 56.7 +/- 4.43% at motor imagery task and 88.7 +/- 4.54% at actual finger tapping task. And we compared the time required to extract features and compute classifiers with those of other methods. Our method is effective to some extent. (1) parameter selection time was better than choosing single band-pass filter that best discriminate classes among possible options of frequency bands; and (2) accuracy rate was better than our previous method using majority vote.

The novelty of this study mainly lies in the use of very cost effective consumer grade wireless EEG devices. Three cognitive tasks were considered: text reading and writing, Math problem solving and watching videos. Twelve subjects were used in this experiment. Initial features were calculated from Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) of raw EEG signals. After application of appropriate dimensionality reduction, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used for classification of tasks. DWT + Kernel PCA with SVM based classifier showed 86.09 % accuracy.

The main aim of this paper is to evaluate and validate a novel approach, which is a computer-based quantitative EEG analyzing method and based on grey systems, aimed to help decision-maker. In this study, 1D-LBP, which utilizes all data points, was employed for extracting features in raw EEG signals, Fisher score (FS) was employed to select the representative features, which can also be determined as hidden patterns. Additionally, GRA is performed to classify EEG signals through these Fisher scored features. The experimental results of the proposed approach, which was employed in a public dataset for validation, showed that it has a high accuracy in identifying epileptic EEG signals. For various combinations of epileptic EEG, such as A-E, B-E, C-E, D-E, and A-D clusters, 100, 96, 100, 99.00 and 100 % were achieved, respectively. Also, this work presents an attempt to develop a new general-purpose hidden pattern determination scheme, which can be utilized for different categories of time-varying signals.

Typically, readout of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals would dominate the energy of such a system, due to the precision (noise, linearity) requirements. The presented system performs data conversion and analog multiplication for EEG feature extraction via simple circuits to demonstrate that feature errors can be overcome by appropriate retraining of a classification model, using a machine-learning algorithm. This precludes the need to design a high-precision frontend. The prototype, in 32nm CMOS, results in features whose RMS error normalized to their ideal values is 1.16 (i.e. errors arc larger than ideal values). An ideal implementation of the seizure detector exhibits sensitivity, latency, false alarms of 5/5, 2.0 sec., 8, respectively. The feature errors degrade this to 5/5, 3.6 sec., 443, causing high false alarms; but retraining of the classification model restores this to 5/5, 3.4 sec., 4.

During last few years lot of work has been done in the field of computer assisted analysis to detect an epileptic activity in an EEG. Still there is a significant amount of need to make these computer assisted EEG analysis systems more convenient and informative for a neurologist. After briefly discussing some of the existing work we have suggested an approach which can make these systems more helpful, detailed and precise for the neurologist. In our proposed approach we have handled each epoch of each channel for each type of epileptic pattern exclusive to each other. In our approach feature extraction starts with an application of multilevel Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) on each 1 sec non-overlapping epochs. Then we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the effect of redundant and noisy data. Afterwards we apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify these epochs as Epileptic or not. In our system a user can mark any mistakes he encounters. The concept behind the inclusion of the retraining is that, if there is more than one example with same attributes but different labels, the classifier is going to get trained to the one with most population. These corrective marking will be saved as examples. On retraining the classifier will improve its classification, hence it will tries to adapt the user. In the end we have discussed the results we have acquired till now. Due to limitation in the available data we are only able to report the classification performance for generalised absence seizure. The reported accuracy is resulted on very versatile dataset of 21 patients from Punjab Institute of Mental Health (PIMH) and 21 patients from Children Hospital Boston (CHB) which have different number of channel and sampling frequency. This usage of the data proves the robustness of our algorithm.

Classification of Finger Vibrotactile Input using Scalp EEG	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			AFFERENT INPUTS; REPRESENTATION; MOVEMENTS; DISCRIMINATION; INTERFACE	While there are many output brain-computer interface (output BCIs) studies, few have examined the input pathway, namely decoding the sensory input. To examine the possibility of building a BCI with sensory input using scalp electroencephalography (EEG), this study builds a classifier based on Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis (LFDA) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to classify neural activity generated by vibrotactile sensory stimuli delivered to the fingers. Small vibrators were placed on the fingertips of the participant. They vibrated one by one in a random sequence while the participant sat still with eyes closed. EEG data were recorded and later used to classify which finger was vibrated. There were two tasks: one focusing on differentiating between ipsilateral fingers, the other one focusing on differentiating contralateral fingers. Decoding accuracies were high in both tasks: 97.6% and 99.3% respectively. Event-related EEG features in both amplitude and power domain are discussed.

Resting State EEG-Based Biometrics for Individual Identification Using Convolutional Neural Networks	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				Biometrics is a growing field, which permits identification of individuals by means of unique physical features. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based biometrics utilizes the small intra-personal differences and large inter-personal differences between individuals' brainwave patterns. In the past, such methods have used features derived from manually-designed procedures for this purpose. Another possibility is to use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automatically extract an individual's best and most unique neural features and conduct classification, using EEG data derived from both Resting State with Open Eyes (REO) and Resting State with Closed Eyes (REC). Results indicate that this CNN-based joint-optimized EEG-based Biometric System yields a high degree of accuracy of identification (88 %) for 10-class classification. Furthermore, rich inter-personal difference can be found using a very low frequency band (0-2Hz). Additionally, results suggest that the temporal portions over which subjects can be individualized is less than 200 ms.

Researchers continue to seek an optimal machine learning-based pipeline to characterize the associations between complex spatio-spectral EEG dynamics and implicit emotional responses. However, toward a real-life application, addressing the inherent day-to-day variability in EEG signals is also of urgent importance, yet was less concerned in the literature. This study explored the day-to-day EEG variability and tested the feasibility of developing an emotion-classification pipeline that can account for such variability. The empirical results of this study showed that the use of a proper feature extraction, e.g., band-power asymmetries over the fronto-posterior regions, in conjunction with an effective artifact removal method, e.g., independent component analysis, could alleviate the impacts of inter-day variability and improve the classification performance.

To address this issue, this paper proposed 2 approaches to systematically select discriminative channels for EEG-based MI-BCI. The proposed Discriminative Channel Addition (DCA) approach and the Discriminative Channel Reduction (DCR) approach selects subject-specific discriminative channels by iteratively adding or removing channels based on the cross-validation classification accuracies obtained using the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern algorithm. The performances of the proposed approaches were evaluated on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a. The results on 2-class and 4-class MI data showed that DCA, which iteratively adds channels, selected 13 similar to 14 channels that consistently yielded better cross-validation accuracies on the training data and session-to-session transfer accuracies on the evaluation data compared to the use of a full 22-channel setup. Hence, this results in a reduced channel setup that could improve the classification accuracy of the MI-BCI after removing less discriminative channels.

Machine learning on encephalographic activity may predict opioid analgesia	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL PAIN MODELS; PERSONALIZED MEDICINE; POSTOPERATIVE PAIN; MORPHINE; SENSITIVITY; EFFICACY; PERCEPTION; OXYCODONE; RESPONSES; POWER	BackgroundOpioids are used for the treatment of pain. However, 30-50% of patients have insufficient effect to the opioid initially selected by the physician, and there is an urgent need for biomarkers to select responders to the most appropriate drug. Since opioids mediate their effect in the central nervous system, this study aimed to investigate if electroencephalography (EEG) during rest or pain before treatment could predict the analgesic response. MethodsEEG from 62 channels was recorded in volunteers during rest and tonic pain (cold pressor test). Morphine (30mg) or placebo was then administered, and the pain test repeated 60min after. Washout period between drugs was 7days. Based on pain ratings, subjects were stratified into responders and non-responders. Spectral analysis was performed on the EEG. Conventional statistics on group basis were used and, furthermore, the most discriminative EEG features were subjected to support vector machine classification to predict the response for the individual subjects. ResultsConventional statistics on the frequency bands revealed no differences between responders and non-responders. On the individual basis, no differences between groups were found using resting EEG. However, EEG during cold pain was able to classify responders with an accuracy of 72% (p=0.01) and the result was reproducible using baseline data from both study days. ConclusionsMachine learning based on EEG before treatment enabled separation between responders and non-responders. This study represents the first step towards the prediction of opioid analgesia based on EEG features prior to drug administration, and advocates for the use of machine learning in future studies.

Seizure prediction is widely acknowledged as an important problem in the neurological domain, as it holds promise to improve the quality of life for patients with epilepsy. A noticeable number of clinical studies showed evidence of symptoms (patterns) before seizures and thus, there is large research on predicting seizures. There is very little existing literature that systematically illustrates the steps in machine learning for seizure prediction, limited training data and class imbalance are a few challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel way to overcome these challenges. We present the improved results for various classification algorithms. An average of 21.71% improvement in accuracy is attained using our approach.

Most recent BCI studies have demonstrated that the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is a powerful tool in extracting features for multiple-class motor imagery. However, since the CSP algorithm requires multi-channel information, it is not suitable for a few-or single-channel system. In this study, we applied a short-time Fourier transform to decompose a single-channel electroencephalography signal into the time-frequency domain and construct multi-channel information. Using the reconstructed data, the CSP was combined with a support vector machine to obtain high classification accuracies from channels of both the sensorimotor and forehead areas. These results suggest that motor imagery can be detected with a single channel not only from the traditional sensorimotor area but also from the forehead area.

Common spatial patterns (CSP) is frequently used for spatial filtering and feature extraction in electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI. It performs a supervised and subject-specific learning of EEG data acquired in two different task conditions. Incremental learning has been used in CSP to adapt to a target subject's data by including classified data in training data and re-estimating spatial filters. In practical circumstances where no user feedback is instantly available to provide true class labels of target trials. mis-classified EEG trials will be added to the training data of a wrong class. and potentially influence the training of spatial filters and feature extraction. In this study. incremental and non-incremental learning were investigated based on a recently developed adaptive CSP (ACSP) method using multi-subject EEG data. Their performances were compared in terms of intra- and inter-subject classification performances. Experimental results indicate that the non-incremental learning is a better option when true class labels of target data are not provided.

In our study, the electroencephalography signals of a subject are recorded from only one active channel Cz with eyes closed and without any external stimulations. The original signals are preprocessed by Haar wavelet transformation; then a number of features are extracted from the preprocessed signals; and then a classifier with local probability centers are employed to assign the signals to the right person according to the features extracted. By this method we have achieved an average identification accuracy of 96.21 % for a dataset of 11 subjects' electroencephalography patterns and the high F-measure values of different persons has shown that this method performed robustly and effectively for various subjects. In addition, we have studied the variation of recognition accuracy with the time length of electroencephalography sessions and found that a longer electroencephalography session is usually more effective for individual identification. These results are in agreement to the previous research and show the evidence that the electroencephalography carries identity information and a longer electroencephalography session usually carries more identity information. With the simple implementation and good performance, we consider our proposed approach to be suitable for development and implementation in a 'unimodal' biometric identification system or may be combined with other biometric methods to form a 'multimodal' biometric identification system.

Decoding covert shifts of attention induced by ambiguous visuospatial cues	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						visuospatial attention; cues; decoding; electroencephalography; brain-computer interface; spatial filtering	VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; EEG; SELECTION; BRAIN; BIAS; BCI; MEG	Simple and unambiguous visual cues (e.g., an arrow) can be used to trigger covert shifts of visual attention away from the center of gaze. The processing of visual stimuli is enhanced at the attended location. Covert shifts of attention modulate the power of cerebral oscillations in the alpha band over parietal and occipital regions. These modulations are sufficiently robust to be decoded on a single trial basis from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. It is often assumed that covert attention shifts are under voluntary control, and that they also occur in more natural and complex environments, but there is no direct evidence to support this assumption. We address this important issue by using random-dot stimuli to cue one of two opposite locations, where a visual target is presented. We contrast two conditions, one in which the random-dot motion is predictive of the target location, and the other, in which it provides ambiguous information. Behavioral results show attention shifts in anticipation of the visual target, in both conditions. In addition, using the common spatial patterns (CSPs) algorithm, we extract EEG power features in the alpha-band (around 10 Hz) that best discriminate the attended location in single trials. We obtain a significant decoding accuracy in 7/10 subjects using a cross-validation procedure applied in the predictive condition. Interestingly, similar accuracy (significant in 5/10 subjects) is obtained when the CSPs trained in the predictive condition are tested in the ambiguous condition. In agreement with this result, we find that the CSPs show very similar topographies in both conditions. These results shed a new light on the behavioral and EEG correlates of visuospatial attention in complex visual environments. This study demonstrates that alpha-power features could be used in brain computer interfaces to decode covert attention shifts in an environment containing ambiguous spatial information.

However, today's non-invasive BCIs can only detect simply qualities of MI, like what body part is subjected to MI. More advanced future non-invasive BCIs should be able to detect many qualities of MI to allow a natural control of a neuroprosthesis. In this preliminary study, we decoded movement targets during a self-paced center-out reaching task, and calculated corresponding spatial patterns in the source space. We were able to decode the movement targets with significant classification accuracy from one out of three subjects during the movement planning phase. This subject showed a distinct spatial pattern over the central motor area.

Such technology can effectively enhance the performance of the human-machine interaction and the learning process. When designing workload estimation algorithms, a crucial signal processing component is the feature extraction step. Despite several studies on this field, the spatial properties of the EEG signals were mostly neglected. Since EEG inherently has a poor spacial resolution, features extracted individually from each EEG channel may not be sufficiently efficient. This problem becomes more pronounced when we use low-cost but convenient EEG sensors with limited stability which is the case in practical scenarios. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce a filter bank common spatial patterns algorithm combined with a feature selection method to extract spatio-spectral features discriminating different mental workload levels. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we carry out a comparative analysis between two representative types of working memory tasks using data recorded from an Emotiv EPOC headset which is a mobile low-cost EEG recording device. The experimental results showed that the proposed spatial filtering algorithm outperformed the state-of-the algorithms in terms of the classification accuracy.

J	Lampert, T; Plano, A; Austin, J; Platt, B				Lampert, Thomas; Plano, Andrea; Austin, Jim; Platt, Bettina			On the identification of sleep stages in mouse electroencephalography time-series	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						EEG; Support vector machine; Multi-classifier system; Time-series; Sleep stage; Fourier transform; Welch transform	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; MICE; SELECTION	The automatic identification of sleep stages in electroencephalography (EEG) time-series is a long desired goal for researchers concerned with the study of sleep disorders. This paper presents advances towards achieving this goal, with particular application to EEG time-series recorded from mice. Approaches in the literature apply supervised learning classifiers, however, these do not reach the performance levels required for use within a laboratory. In this paper, detection reliability is increased, most notably in the case of REM stage identification, by naturally decomposing the problem and applying a support vector machine (SVM) based classifier to each of the EEG channels. Their outputs are integrated within a multiple classifier system. Furthermore, there exists no general consensus on the ideal choice of parameter values in such systems. Therefore, an investigation into the effects upon the classification performance is presented by varying parameters such as the epoch length; features size; number of training samples; and the method for calculating the power spectral density estimate. Finally, the results of these investigations are brought together to demonstrate the performance of the proposed classification algorithm in two cases: intra-animal classification and inter-animal classification. It is shown that, within a dataset of 10 EEG recordings, and using less than 1% of an EEG as training data, a mean classification errors of Awake 6.45%, NREM 5.82%, and REM 6.65% (with standard deviations less than 0.6%) are achieved in intra-animal analysis and, when using the equivalent of 7% of one EEG as training data, Awake 10.19%, NREM 7.75%, and REM 17.43% are achieved in inter-animal analysis (with mean standard deviations of 6.42%, 2.89%, and 9.69% respectively).

This paper uses approximate entropy and sample entropy based on wavelet package decomposition as the feature exaction methods and employs support vector machine and extreme learning machine as the classifiers. Experiments are performed in epileptic EEG data and five mental tasks, respectively. Experimental results show that the combination strategy of sample entropy and extreme learning machine has shown great performance, which obtains good classification accuracy and low training time.

One of the most studied frameworks related to the way affect is reflected in EEG is based on frontal hemispheric asymmetry. Our results indicate that a simple replication of the methods derived from this hypothesis might not be sufficient. However, using a data-driven approach based on feature engineering and machine learning, we describe a method that can reliably measure valence with the EPOC device.

Learned EEG-based brain self-regulation of motor-related oscillations during application of transcranial electric brain stimulation: feasibility and limitations	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-machine interface (BMI) control; motor imagery; EEG; transcranial electric stimulation (TES); stimulation artifacts	INTERFACE BCI SYSTEM; COMPUTER INTERFACE; SKILL ACQUISITION; CHRONIC STROKE; MODULATION; CORTEX; EXCITABILITY; PERFORMANCE; PLASTICITY; MOVEMENT	Objective: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) improves motor learning and can affect emotional processing and attention. However, it is unclear whether learned electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-machine interface (BMI) control during tDCS is feasible, how application of transcranial electric currents during BMI control would interfere with feature-extraction of physiological brain signals and how it affects brain control performance. Here we tested this combination and evaluated stimulation-dependent artifacts across different EEG frequencies and stability of motor imagery-based BMI control. Approach: Ten healthy volunteers were invited to two BMI-sessions, each comprising two 60-trial blocks. During the trials, learned desynchronization of mu-rhythms (8-15 Hz) associated with motor imagery (MI) recorded over C4 was translated into online cursor movements on a computer screen. During block 2, either sham (session A) or anodal tDCS (session B) was applied at 1 mA with the stimulation electrode placed 1 cm anterior of C4. Main results: tDCS was associated with a significant signal power increase in the lower frequencies most evident in the signal spectrum of the EEG channel closest to the stimulation electrode. Stimulation-dependent signal power increase exhibited a decay of 12 dB per decade, leaving frequencies above 9 Hz unaffected. Analysis of BMI control performance did not indicate a difference between blocks and tDCS conditions. Conclusion: Application of tDCS during learned EEG-based self-regulation of brain oscillations above 9 Hz is feasible and safe, and might improve applicability of BMI systems.

EEG for imagined speech reproduction and observation of brain response to audio stimuli are active areas of research. In this paper, we consider the case of imagined and mouthed non-audible speech recorded with EEG electrodes. We analyze different feature extraction techniques such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), log variance Auto Regressive (AR) coefficients. Based on these extracted features, we perform a pairwise classification of vowels using three different classification models based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and k-nn classifier. The proposed methodology is applied on four different data sets with some preprocessing techniques such as Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) filtering. The data sets principally comprised of either mouthing or solely imagining 5 vowel sounds without speaking or making any muscle movement.

Excellent classification results of 100% test accuracy have been achieved and these have also been compared with traditional machine learning techniques. Outputs confirmed that the NeuCube is better suited to model, classify, interpret and understand EEG data and the brain processes involved.

Brain decoding is nowadays possible thanks to advanced brain recording devices (fMRI, EEG, MEG), and the use of appropriate signal processing and machine learning techniques. Current systems based on the detection of brain responses during rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks use EEG recording. We propose to evaluate the performance of single-trial detection with signal recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) during an RSVP task where participants were asked to detect images containing a person. We compare several classifiers (LDA, BLDA, k-nearest neighbor, support-vector machines) with spatial filtering, and with different sets of channels (magneto-meters, gradio-meters, all the channels). The results suggest that single-trial detection can be obtained with an AVC superior to 0.95, while typical studies based on EEG recordings using the same type of tasks, the AVC is often around 0.8. The present results show that MEG can be successfully used for target detection during a difficult RSVP task.

Electrode replacement does not affect classification accuracy in dual-session use of a passive brain-computer interface for assessing cognitive workload	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						passive brain computer interface; cognitive state; electroencephalography; machine learning; non-stationarity	FUNCTIONAL-STATE CLASSIFICATION; HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES; ADAPTIVE AUTOMATION; DETECTION ALGORITHM; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; TASK-DIFFICULTY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MOTOR IMAGERY; SYSTEM	The passive brain-computer interface (pBCI) framework has been shown to be a very promising construct for assessing cognitive and affective state in both individuals and teams. There is a growing body of work that focuses on solving the challenges of transitioning pBCI systems from the research laboratory environment to practical, everyday use. An interesting issue is what impact methodological variability may have on the ability to reliably identify (neuro)physiological patterns that are useful for state assessment. This work aimed at quantifying the effects of methodological variability in a pBCI design for detecting changes in cognitive workload. Specific focus was directed toward the effects of replacing electrodes over dual sessions (thus inducing changes in placement, electromechanical properties, and/or impedance between the electrode and skin surface) on the accuracy of several machine learning approaches in a binary classification problem. In investigating these methodological variables, it was determined that the removal and replacement of the electrode suite between sessions does not impact the accuracy of a number of learning approaches when trained on one session and tested on a second. This finding was confirmed by comparing to a control group for which the electrode suite was not replaced between sessions. This result suggests that sensors (both neurological and peripheral) may be removed and replaced over the course of many interactions with a pBCI system without affecting its performance. Future work on multi-session and multi-day pBCI system use should seek to replicate this (lack of) effect between sessions in other tasks, temporal time courses, and data analytic approaches while also focusing on non-stationarity and variable classification performance due to intrinsic factors.

This study employed the robust principal component analysis (RPCA) to address the problem with a posed hypothesis that background or emotion-irrelevant EEG perturbations lead to certain variability across days and somehow submerge emotion-related EEG dynamics. The empirical results of this study evidently validated our hypothesis and demonstrated the RPCA's feasibility through the analysis of a five-day dataset of 12 subjects. The RPCA allowed tackling the sparse emotion-relevant EEG dynamics from the accompanied background perturbations across days. Sequentially, leveraging the RPCA-purified EEG trials from more days appeared to improve the emotion-classification performance steadily, which was not found in the case using the raw EEG features. Therefore, incorporating the RPCA with existing emotion-aware machine-learning frameworks on a longitudinal dataset of each individual may shed light on the development of a robust affective brain-computer interface	[Jao, Ping-Keng; Lin, Yuan-Pin; Yang, Yi-Hsuan; Jung, Tzyy-Ping] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Informat Technol Innovat, Taipei, Taiwan		Jao, PK (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Informat Technol Innovat, Taipei, Taiwan.	nafraw@citi.sinica.edu.tw; yplin@sccn.ucsd.edu; yang@citi.sinica.edu.tw; jung@sccn.ucsd.edu	Lin, Yuan-Pin/P-7429-2015	Lin, Yuan-Pin/0000-0002-3434-9118					14	6	6	2	5	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1557-170X	1558-4615	978-1-4244-9270-1	IEEE ENG MED BIO			2015							570	573						4	Engineering, Biomedical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BE4HD	26736326				2022-08-02	WOS:000371717200145

Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are the primary choice as the sources of interpreting the intention of the human subject. EEG signals have a long history of being used in human health for the purposes of studying brain activities and medical diagnosis. EEG signals are very weak and are subject to the contamination from many artifact signals. For the applications in human health, true EEG signals, without the contamination, is highly desirable. However, for the purposes of BCI, where stable patterns from the source signals are critical, the origins of the signals are of less concern. In this paper, we propose a BCI, which is simple to implement and easy to use, by taking the advantage of EEG artifacts, generated by a number of purposely designed voluntary facial muscle movements.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is an inexpensive and non-invasive procedure with very high temporal resolution which enables analysis of short and fast swallowing events, as well as an analysis of the organizational and behavioral aspects of cortical motor preparation, swallowing execution and swallowing regulation. EEG is a powerful technique which can be used alone or in combination with other techniques for monitoring swallowing, detection of swallowing motor imagery for diagnostic or biofeedback purposes, or to modulate and measure the effects of swallowing rehabilitation. This paper provides a review of the existing literature which has deployed EEG in the investigation of oropharyngeal swallowing, smell, taste and texture related to swallowing, cortical pre-motor activation in swallowing, and swallowing motor imagery detection. Furthermore, this paper provides a brief review of the different modalities of brain imaging techniques used to study swallowing brain activities, as well as the EEG components of interest for studies on swallowing and on swallowing motor imagery. Lastly, this paper provides directions for future swallowing investigations using EEG.

A general framework for time series data mining based on event analysis: Application to the medical domains of electroencephalography and stabilometry	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Medical data mining; Time series analysis; Event; Classification; Electroencephalography; Stabilometry	NEURAL-NETWORK; TEMPORAL ABSTRACTION; CLASSIFICATION; INFERENCE; MODELS; IDENTIFICATION; CLASSIFIERS; DISCOVERY; PATTERNS; BAYES	There are now domains where information is recorded over a period of time, leading to sequences of data known as time series. In many domains, like medicine, time series analysis requires to focus on certain regions of interest, known as events, rather than analyzing the whole time series. In this paper, we propose a framework for knowledge discovery in both one-dimensional and multidimensional time series containing events. We show how our approach can be used to classify medical time series by means of a process that identifies events in time series, generates time series reference models of representative events and compares two time series by analyzing the events they have in common. We have applied our framework on time series generated in the areas of electroencephalography (EEG) and stabilometry. Framework performance was evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, and the results confirmed that the proposed schema has potential for classifying EEG and stabilometric signals. The proposed framework is useful for discovering knowledge from medical time series containing events, such as stabilometric and electroencephalographic time series. These results would be equally applicable to other medical domains generating iconographic time series, such as, for example, electrocardiography (ECG). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Sitt et al. assess the suitability of putative electrophysiological markers of consciousness for distinguishing patients in a vegetative state from those in a minimally conscious or conscious state. Low-frequency power, EEG complexity, and information exchange constitute reliable, partially independent, markers of consciousness.In recent years, numerous electrophysiological signatures of consciousness have been proposed. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of these electroencephalography markers by quantifying their efficiency in differentiating patients in a vegetative state from those in a minimally conscious or conscious state. Capitalizing on a review of previous experiments and current theories, we identify a series of measures that can be organized into four dimensions: (i) event-related potentials versus ongoing electroencephalography activity; (ii) local dynamics versus inter-electrode information exchange; (iii) spectral patterns versus information complexity; and (iv) average versus fluctuations over the recording session. We analysed a large set of 181 high-density electroencephalography recordings acquired in a 30 minutes protocol. We show that low-frequency power, electroencephalography complexity, and information exchange constitute the most reliable signatures of the conscious state. When combined, these measures synergize to allow an automatic classification of patients' state of consciousness.

The EMD-ICA method includes the following steps: Firstly, EEG signals from single or multiple channels are decomposed into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using EMD. Each IMF can be approximately used as an input channel of the ICA, and these IMFs constitute the input matrix of the ICA. Then, the input matrix is separated into a set of statistics independent components (ICs) by ICA. Furthermore, each of statistics ICs is analyzed by using the method of sample entropy to automatically determine whether it is artifact signal. Finally, the ICs determined as artifacts are eliminated and the remaining ICs are reconstructed. The reconstructed EEG is used in the following feature extraction and classification. To evaluate the effect of the proposed method, common spatial patterns (CSP) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm are used to extract and classify the EEG data from two datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method can remove various kinds of artifacts effectively, and improve the recognition accuracy greatly.

EEG-based decoding of error-related brain activity in a real-world driving task	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface; EEG; driving tasks; online decoding; error-related potential	MACHINE INTERFACES; POTENTIALS; THETA	Objectives. Recent studies have started to explore the implementation of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) as part of driving assistant systems. The current study presents an EEG-based BCI that decodes error-related brain activity. Such information can be used, e.g., to predict driver's intended turning direction before reaching road intersections. Approach. We executed experiments in a car simulator (N = 22) and a real car (N = 8). While subject was driving, a directional cue was shown before reaching an intersection, and we classified the presence or not of an error-related potentials from EEG to infer whether the cued direction coincided with the subject's intention. In this protocol, the directional cue can correspond to an estimation of the driving direction provided by a driving assistance system. We analyzed ERPs elicited during normal driving and evaluated the classification performance in both offline and online tests. Results. An average classification accuracy of 0.698 +/- 0.065 was obtained in offline experiments in the car simulator, while tests in the real car yielded a performance of 0.682 +/- 0.059. The results were significantly higher than chance level for all cases. Online experiments led to equivalent performances in both simulated and real car driving experiments. These results support the feasibility of decoding these signals to help estimating whether the driver's intention coincides with the advice provided by the driving assistant in a real car. Significance. The study demonstrates a BCI system in real-world driving, extending the work from previous simulated studies. As far as we know, this is the first online study in real car decoding driver's error-related brain activity. Given the encouraging results, the paradigm could be further improved by using more sophisticated machine learning approaches and possibly be combined with applications in intelligent vehicles.

Classification of EEG abnormalities in partial epilepsy with simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						IED; EEG-fMRI; Automatic classification; Focal epilepsy; icEEG	SIMULTANEOUS INTRACRANIAL EEG; INTERICTAL SPIKES; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; LOCALIZATION; DISCHARGES; NETWORKS; ARTIFACT; IMPROVE; EVENTS	Scalp EEG recordings and the classification of interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) in patients with epilepsy provide valuable information about the epileptogenic network, particularly by defining the boundaries of the "irritative zone" (IZ), and hence are helpful during pre-surgical evaluation of patients with severe refractory epilepsies. The current detection and classification of epileptiform signals essentially rely on expert observers. This is a very time-consuming procedure, which also leads to inter-observer variability. Here, we propose a novel approach to automatically classify epileptic activity and show how this method provides critical and reliable information related to the IZ localization beyond the one provided by previous approaches. We applied Wave_clus, an automatic spike sorting algorithm, for the classification of IED visually identified from pre-surgical simultaneous Electroencephalogram-functional Magnetic Resonance Imagining (EEG-fMRI) recordings in 8 patients affected by refractory partial epilepsy candidate for surgery. For each patient, two fMRI analyses were performed: one based on the visual classification and one based on the algorithmic sorting. This novel approach successfully identified a total of 29 IED classes (compared to 26 for visual identification). The general concordance between methods was good, providing a full match of EEG patterns in 2 cases, additional EEG information in 2 other cases and, in general, covering EEG patterns of the same areas as expert classification in 7 of the 8 cases. Most notably, evaluation of the method with EEG-fMRI data analysis showed hemodynamic maps related to the majority of LED classes representing improved performance than the visual IED classification-based analysis (72% versus 50%). Furthermore, the IED-related BOLD changes revealed by using the algorithm were localized within the presumed IZ for a larger number of IED classes (9) in a greater number of patients than the expert classification (7 and 5, respectively). In contrast, in only one case presented the new algorithm resulted in fewer classes and activation areas. We propose that the use of automated spike sorting algorithms to classify IED provides an efficient tool for mapping IED-related fMRI changes and increases the EEG-fMRI clinical value for the pre-surgical assessment of patients with severe epilepsy.

Deep learning is a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network algorithm. Deep learning has the advantage of approximating the complicated function and alleviating the optimization difficulty associated with deep models. Multilayer extreme learning machine (MLELM) is a learning algorithm of an artificial neural network which takes advantages of deep learning and extreme learning machine. Not only does MLELM approximate the complicated function but it also does not need to iterate during the training process. We combining with MLELM and extreme learning machine with kernel (KELM) put forward deep extreme learning machine (DELM) and apply it to EEG classification in this paper. This paper focuses on the application of DELM in the classification of the visual feedback experiment, using MATLAB and the second brain-computer interface (BCI) competition datasets. By simulating and analyzing the results of the experiments, effectiveness of the application of DELM in EEG classification is confirmed.

Speech-imagery BCIs on the other hand, are a more recent type of BCIs in which imagination of a vowel, sound or word is detected from EEG measurements. Since the performance of CSP highly depends on the spectral filters which are previously applied to the signal, finding the appropriate frequency band seems to be a major concern. In order to overcome this problem, the novel evidential multi-band common spatial pattern (EMBCSP) is proposed. In EMBCSP, features are extracted using CSP after multiple band-pass filtering. The preliminary classification results are later given to a fusion system and then the features are labeled regarding the larger combined probability value. The performance of this method has been assessed using speech-imagery-based EEG measurements and has also been compared with some prevalent methods. The results suggest the outperforming of EMBCSP with accuracies between 75 to 96.67 percent and give rise to opportunities to apply such a method to other common types of BCIs.

Real-time information of ongoing brain states acquired through BCI might be exploited for controlling data presentation in virtual environments. Brain states discrimination during mixed reality experience is thus critical for adapting specific data features to contingent brain activity. In this study we recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) data while participants experienced MR scenarios implemented through the eXperience Induction Machine (XIM). The XIM is a novel framework modeling the integration of a sensing system that evaluates and measures physiological and psychological states with a number of actuators and effectors that coherently reacts to the user's actions. We then assessed continuous EEG-based discrimination of spatial navigation, reading and calculation performed in MR, using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Dynamic single trial classification showed high accuracy of LDA and SVM classifiers in detecting multiple brain states as well as in differentiating between high and low mental workload, using a 5s time-window shifting every 200 ms. Our results indicate overall better performance of LDA with respect to SVM and suggest applicability of our approach in a BCI-controlled MR scenario. Ultimately, successful prediction of brain states might be used to drive adaptation of data representation in order to boost information processing in MR.

In this paper one-dimensional local binary pattern (1D-LBP) based features are used for classification of seizure and seizure-free electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The proposed method employs a bank of Gabor filters for processing the EEG signals. The processed EEG signal is divided into smaller segments and histograms of 1D-LBPs of these segments are computed. Nearest neighbor classifier utilizes the histogram matching scores to determine whether the acquired EEG signal belongs to seizure or seizure-free category. Experimental results on publicly available database suggest that the proposed features effectively characterize local variations and are useful for classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals with a classification accuracy of 98.33%. This result demonstrates the superiority of our approach for classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals over recently proposed approaches in the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Emotion classification in Parkinson's disease by higher-order spectra and power spectrum features using EEG signals: A comparative study	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; emotion; Parkinson's disease; bispectrum; power spectrum; pattern classification	FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION; SPEECH; MUSIC; DISCRIMINATION; STATES; PERSPECTIVES; METAANALYSIS; PROGRESSION; PERCEPTION; PICTURES	Deficits in the ability to process emotions characterize several neuropsychiatric disorders and are traits of Parkinson's disease (PD), and there is need for a method of quantifying emotion, which is currently performed by clinical diagnosis. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, being an activity of central nervous system (CNS), can reflect the underlying true emotional state of a person. This study applied machine-learning algorithms to categorize EEG emotional states in PD patients that would classify six basic emotions (happiness and sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust) in comparison with healthy controls (HC). Emotional EEG data were recorded from 20 PD patients and 20 healthy age-, education level- and sex-matched controls using multimodal (audio-visual) stimuli. The use of nonlinear features motivated by the higher-order spectra (HOS) has been reported to be a promising approach to classify the emotional states. In this work, we made the comparative study of the performance of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers using the features derived from HOS and from the power spectrum. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that power spectrum and HOS based features were statistically significant among the six emotional states (p < 0.0001). Classification results shows that using the selected HOS based features instead of power spectrum based features provided comparatively better accuracy for all the six classes with an overall accuracy of 70.10% +/- 2.83% and 77.29% +/- 1.73% for PD patients and HC in beta (13-30 Hz) band using SVM classifier. Besides, PD patients achieved less accuracy in the processing of negative emotions (sadness, fear, anger and disgust) than in processing of positive emotions (happiness, surprise) compared with HC. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of applying machine learning techniques to the classification of emotional states in PD patients in a user independent manner using EEG signals. The accuracy of the system can be improved by investigating the other HOS based features. This study might lead to a practical system for noninvasive assessment of the emotional impairments associated with neurological disorders.

In this study, we characterized the electroencephalography (EEG) of various sleep stages in NC versus controls. Methods: EEG power spectral density (PSD) was computed in 136 NC patients and 510 sex-and agematched controls. Features reflecting differences in PSD curves were computed. A Lasso-regularized regression model was used to find an optimal feature subset, which was validated on 19 NC patients and 708 non-NC patients from a sleep clinic. Reproducible features were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: Thirteen features were selected based on the training dataset. Three were applicable in the validation dataset, indicating that NC patients show (1) increased alpha power in REM sleep, (2) decreased sigma power in wakefulness, and (3) decreased delta power in stage N1 versus wakefulness. Sensitivity of these features ranged from 4% to 10% with specificity around 98%, and it did not vary substantially with and without treatment. Conclusions: EEG spectral analysis of REM sleep, wake, and differences between N1 and wakefulness contain diagnostic features of NC. These traits may represent sleepiness and dissociated REM sleep in patients with NC. However, the features are not sufficient for differentiating NC from controls, and further analysis is needed to completely evaluate the diagnostic potential of these features. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Brain-Computer Interface With Language Model-Electroencephalography Fusion for Locked-In Syndrome	NEUROREHABILITATION AND NEURAL REPAIR			English	Article						brain-computer interface; locked-in syndrome; language model; electroencephalography (EEG); neuroengineering	ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION; REHABILITATION; TECHNOLOGY; IMPAIRMENT; KEYBOARD; PEOPLE; ACCESS; HEAD	Background. Some noninvasive brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are currently available for locked-in syndrome (LIS) but none have incorporated a statistical language model during text generation. Objective. To begin to address the communication needs of individuals with LIS using a noninvasive BCI that involves rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of symbols and a unique classifier with electroencephalography (EEG) and language model fusion. Methods. The RSVP Keyboard was developed with several unique features. Individual letters are presented at 2.5 per second. Computer classification of letters as targets or nontargets based on EEG is performed using machine learning that incorporates a language model for letter prediction via Bayesian fusion enabling targets to be presented only 1 to 4 times. Nine participants with LIS and 9 healthy controls were enrolled. After screening, subjects first calibrated the system, and then completed a series of balanced word generation mastery tasks that were designed with 5 incremental levels of difficulty, which increased by selecting phrases for which the utility of the language model decreased naturally. Results. Six participants with LIS and 9 controls completed the experiment. All LIS participants successfully mastered spelling at level 1 and one subject achieved level 5. Six of 9 control participants achieved level 5. Conclusions. Individuals who have incomplete LIS may benefit from an EEG-based BCI system, which relies on EEG classification and a statistical language model. Steps to further improve the system are discussed.

The main contributions of this paper are twofold. a) We investigate sixteen eye movements related to emotions and identify the intrinsic patterns of these eye movements for three emotional states: positive, neutral and negative. b) We examine various modality fusion strategies for integrating users external subconscious behaviors and internal cognitive states and reveal that the characteristics of eye movements and EEG are complementary to emotion recognition. Experiment results demonstrate that modality fusion could significantly improve emotion recognition accuracy in comparison with single modality. The best accuracy achieved by fuzzy integral fusion strategy is 87.59%, whereas the accuracies of solely using eye movements and EEG data are 77.80% and 78.51%, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a processing framework to address non-stationarity, as well as handle spectral, temporal, and spatial characteristics associated with execution of motor tasks. Stacked generalization is used to exploit the power of classifier ensembles for combining information coming from multiple sources and reducing the existing uncertainty in EEG signals. The outputs of several regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) models are combined to account for temporal, spatial, and spectral information. The resultant algorithm is called stacked RLDA (SRLDA). Additionally, an adaptive processing stage is introduced before classification to reduce the harmful effect of intersession non-stationarity. The benefits of the proposed method are evaluated on the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a. We demonstrate its effectiveness in binary and multiclass settings with four different motor imagery tasks: left-hand, right-hand, both feet, and tongue movements. The results show that adaptive SRLDA outperforms the winner of the competition and other approaches tested on this multiclass dataset.

Three types of imaginary fist movements have been decoded: sustained opening and closing of right fist, sustained opening and closing of left fist and rest. Initially, the registers were band-pass filtered to separate frequency ranges given by mu rhythms (7.5-12.5 Hz), beta rhythms (12.5-30 Hz), mu& beta rhythms, and a broad range of 0.5-30 Hz. Afterward, the signals of the separated subbands were epoched in time windows of 0-0.5, 0-1, 0-1.5 and 0-2 seconds, as well as preprocessed with two techniques of spatial filtering: common spatial patterns and independent component analysis. In both cases, a set of selected channels was established for feature extraction, by calculation of the logarithms of the variance in the time series corresponding to each preprocessed and selected channel. The classification stage was based on linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines. The results showed that the combination given by common spatial patterns and support vector machines allowed to reach a mean decoding accuracy close to 99.9%, where epoching and filtering to separate subbands did not influence the results in a noticeable way.

Ten able-bodied subjects participated in two tasks: an isometric force production task and a grasp-and-lift task using unconstrained and constrained grasps. We found that EEG electrodes spanning central areas of the scalp were highly correlated to force rate trajectories. Moreover, EEG grand averages in central sites resembled force rate trajectories as opposed to force trajectories. The grasp-and-lift task resulted in higher decoding accuracies than the isometric force production task: across nine subjects, median accuracies for the isometric force production task were r=0.35 whereas median accuracies for unconstrained grasping were r=0.51 and for constrained grasping were r=0.50. Such results could lead to an understanding of the neural representation behind the control of hand forces and could be implemented in the neural control of closed-loop hand-based neuroprostheses.

Accordingly, people suffering from neuromuscular diseases can highly benefit from these technologies, since a computer could allow them to perform multiple tasks, such as accessing computer-based entertainment (videos, games, books, music, movies, etc.), communication (Internet, VoIP, e-mails, text processors, speech synthesis, etc.) and means of research (computational capacity, programming languages, simulation applications, etc.). Moreover, nowadays a computer can control various electronic devices, from TVs, DVD and CD players to electric wheel chairs, elevators, doors and lights. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the concept of brain computer interface (BCI) along with presenting its definition, description, and classification of BCI systems. Also, provides insights on the Neuroimaging modalities for BCI systems such as Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrocorticography (ECoG), and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) approaches. Moreover, this chapter addresses EEG signal processing for BCI from the different perspectives of preprocessing techniques that deal with EOG/EMG artifacts, feature extraction approaches for BCI designs, classification methods and Post-processing. Furthermore, the chapter gives a brief survey of classifiers used in BCI research along with classification performance metrics utilized for BCI systems. Finally, the chapter concludes with outlining ongoing research directions for Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems.

Here we used power of LFP recorded from area MT of a macaque monkey to decode where the animal covertly attended. Support vector machines (SVM) were used to learn the pattern of power at different frequencies for attention to two possible positions. We found that LFP power at both low (<9 Hz) and high (31-120 Hz) frequencies contains sufficient information to decode the focus of attention. Highest decoding performance was found for gamma frequencies (31-120 Hz) and reached 82%. In contrast low frequencies (<9 Hz) could help the classifier reach a higher decoding performance with a smaller amount of training data. Consequently, we suggest that low frequency LFP can provide fast but coarse information regarding the focus of attention, while higher frequencies of the LFP deliver more accurate but less timely information about the focus of attention.

In this paper, we present a novel scheme to extract spatial spectral features for the motor imagery-based BCI. The learning task is formulated by maximizing the mutual information between spatial spectral features (MMISS) and class labels, by which a unique objective function directly related to Bayes classification error is optimized. The spatial spectral features are assumed to follow a parametric Gaussian distribution, which has been validated by the normal distribution Mardia's test, and under this assumption the estimation of mutual information is derived. We propose a gradient based alternative and iterative learning algorithm to optimize the cost function and derive the spatial and spectral filters simultaneously. The experimental results on dataset IVa of BCI competition III and dataset IIa of BCI competition IV show that the proposed MMISS is able to efficiently extract discriminative features from motor imagery-based EEG signals to enhance the classification accuracy compared to other existing algorithms.

In this paper, we proposed a multi-ganglion artificial neural network based feature learning (ANNFL) method to extract a deep feature structure of single-trial multi-channel ERP signals and improve classification accuracy. Five subjects took part in the Imitating-Reading ERP experiments. We recorded the target electroencephalography (EEG) samples (elicited by target stimuli) and non-target samples (elicited by non-target stimuli) for each subjects. Then we applied ANNFL method to extract the feature vectors and classified them by using support vector machine (SVM). The ANNFL method outperforms the principal component analysis (PCA) method and conventional three-layer auto-encoder, and then leads to higher classification accuracies of five subjects' BCI signals than using the single-channel temporal features. ANNFL is an unsupervised feature learning method, which can automatically learn feature vector from EEG data and provide more effective feature representation than PCA method and single-channel temporal feature extraction method.

Multi-level local patterns are computed for each of these IMFs by performing comparisons in the local neighborhood of a sample value of the signal. Finally, a feature set is formed by computation of histograms of MLPs. In order to classify the EEG signal based on these features, we employ the nearest neighbor (NN) classifier, which utilizes scores computed from matching of histogram features of MLPs to determine the category of the EEG signal. Experimental evaluation of this approach on publicly available EEG dataset yielded improved classification accuracies as compared to the existing approaches in the literature. The best average classification accuracy of the proposed approach is 98.67%, which demonstrates the discriminatory capability of the proposed multi-level local patterns.	[Kumar, T.

An Iterative Optimization Technique for Robust Channel Selection in Motor Imagery based Brain Computer Interface	2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 05-08, 2014	San Diego, CA	IEEE		Brain Computer Interface; Channel Selection; Motor Imagery; Event related Synchronization/Desynchronization	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MUTUAL INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION	Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) provides a direct communication pathway between brain and computer/machine bypassing the conventional pathway of nerves and muscles. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most commonly used brain signal acquisition technique in BCI systems. The use of motor imagery (MI) patterns in EEG-based BCI has been proven as an effective method to translate the user's movement intention to commands for controlling external devices. To obtain high classification accuracy of MI, conventional EEG based BCI employ a large number of scalp electrodes. However, this is inconvenient in the clinical scenarios where preparation time is of paramount importance. This paper proposes a channel selection method which utilizes a priori information of the MI task and iteratively optimizes the number of relevant channels, thereby improving the classification accuracy. The proposed method is employed in BCI Competition III dataset IVa and BCI Competition IV, dataset 2a to classify hand and foot MI tasks. The proposed method results in better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods with a significant reduction in the number of channels.	[Shenoy, H.

Sitting and standing intention can be decoded from scalp EEG recorded prior to movement execution	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; electroencephalography; movement-related cortical potentials; classification; brain-machine; interface; mobile neuroimaging; lower extremity	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; SINGLE-TRIAL CLASSIFICATION; HUMAN VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; TREADMILL WALKING; MOTOR IMAGERY; FEATURE-SELECTION; POTENTIALS; HAND; DISCRIMINATION; GAIT	Low frequency signals recorded from non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG), in particular movement-related cortical potentials (MRPs), are associated with preparation and execution of movement and thus present a target for use in brain-machine interfaces. We investigated the ability to decode movement intent from delta-band (0.1-4 Hz) EEG recorded immediately before movement execution in healthy volunteers. We used data from epochs starting 1.5 s before movement onset to classify future movements into one of three classes: stand-up, sit-down, or quiet. We assessed classification accuracy in both externally triggered and self-paced paradigms. Movement onset was determined from electromyography (EMG) recordings synchronized with EEG signals. We employed an artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR) algorithm to eliminate high amplitude noise before building our time-embedded EEG features. We applied local Fisher's discriminant analysis to reduce the dimensionality of our spatio-temporal features and subsequently used a Gaussian mixture model classifier for our three class problem. Our results demonstrate significantly better than chance classification accuracy (chance level = 33.3%) for the self-initiated (78.0 2.6%) and triggered (74.7 5.7%) paradigms. Surprisingly, we found no significant difference in classification accuracy between the self-paced and cued paradigms when using the full set of non-peripheral electrodes. However, accuracy was significantly increased for self-paced movements when only electrodes over the primary motor area were used. Overall, this study demonstrates that delta-band EEG recorded immediately before movement carries discriminative information regarding movement type. Our results suggest that EEG-based classifiers could improve lower-limb neuroprostheses and neurorehabilitation techniques by providing earlier detection of movement intent, which could be used in robot-assisted strategies for motor training and recovery of function.

A BCI provides an arena for a human brain to communicate with a computer directly without the normal neurophysiologic pathways. The electrical signals of the brain, with their fast responsivity with cognitive processes are most suitable as non-motor control mediation between the human and a computer. This can serve as a communication and control channel for various applications. One of the most intriguing uses of EEG is in forensic investigation, used as a tool in lie detection. Lie detection technology has been applied increasingly to investigate and solve criminal cases. Though the contributions of neurobiological research to forensic technology remain largely hypothetical, the evidences appear promising and further research is both feasible and warranted. The brain based lie detection may veritably give solution to many complicated investigation. This paper explores the evolvement of lie detection technology, their working principles, the latest development, and the prospect of their application in forensic science.

One of the strategies for feature selection that is often applied by BCI researchers is based on genetic algorithms (GAs). The two types of GAs that are most commonly used in BCI research are the classic algorithm and the Culling algorithm. This paper presents both algorithms and their application for selecting features crucial for the correct classification of EEG signals recorded during imagery movements of the left and right hand. The results returned by both algorithms are compared to those returned by an algorithm with aggressive mutation and an algorithm with melting individuals, both of which have been proposed by the author of this paper. While the aggressive mutation algorithm has been published previously, the melting individuals algorithm is presented here for the first time.

In the present study, an experimental hybrid near-infrared spectroscopy-electroencephalography(NIRS-EEG) technique was used to extract and decode four different types of brain signals. The NIRS setup was positioned over the prefrontal brain region, and the EEG over the left and right motor cortex regions. Twelve subjects participating in the experiment were shown four direction symbols, namely,"forward," " backward," " left," and "right." The control commands for forward and backward movement were estimated by performing arithmetic mental tasks related to oxy-hemoglobin(HbO) changes. The left and right directions commands were associated with right and left hand tapping, respectively. The high classification accuracies achieved showed that the four different control signals can be accurately estimated using the hybrid NIR-SEEG technology.	[Khan, M.

As a first step towards better understanding this interpretation process, our research focuses on quantitative monitoring of interpreters' brain responses associated with geoscientific target spotting. This paper presents a method that profiles brain responses using electroencephalography (EEG) to detect P300-like responses that are associated with target spotting for complex geoscientific data. In our experiment, eight interpreters with varying levels of expertise and experience were asked to detect features, which are likely to be copper-gold rich porphyry systems within magnetic geophysical data. The target features appear in noisy background and often have incomplete shape. Magnetic images with targets and without targets were shown to participants using the "oddball" paradigm. Event related potentials were obtained by averaging the,EEG epochs across multiple trials and the results show delayed P3 response to the targets, likely due to the complexity of the task. EEG epochs were classified and the results show reliable single trial classification of EEG responses with an average accuracy of 83%. The result demonstrated the usability of the P300-like responses to quantify the geoscientific target spotting performances. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the disconnected condition of these patients also blocks kinaesthetic feedback from the periphery, which has been shown to regulate centrally generated output responsible for accurate motor control. Here, we tested how well motor commands are generated in the absence of kinaesthetic feedback by decoding hand movements from human scalp electroencephalography in three conditions: unimpaired movement, imagined movement, and movement attempted during temporary disconnection of peripheral afferent and efferent nerves by ischemic nerve block. Our results suggest that the recall of cortical motor commands is impoverished in the absence of kinaesthetic feedback, challenging the possibility of precise naturalistic cortical prosthetic control.

We report on a 17-year-old male with drug-resistant focal epilepsy and idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). He began to experience generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) at the age of 3 years, with a good response to phenobarbital. At the age of 14 years, he began to experience complex partial seizures (CPS). Video-electroencephalography (video-EEG) telemetry showed the coexistence of right temporal spikes and bursts of generalized spike-wave (GSW). The ictal EEG showed a unique EEG pattern characterized by a 4- to 5-second burst of GSW followed by rhythmic delta activity over the right temporal region. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed right hippocampal sclerosis. The patient underwent a right temporal lobectomy that significantly improved his seizure control. He was rendered seizure free of the complex partial seizures and improvement of the GTCS. This case illustrates a very uncommon ictal EEG pattern, and shows that the decision for surgery in patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy should not be affected by coexistent generalized epilepsy.

If the MI tasks are reliably distinguished through identifying typical patterns in electroencephalography (EEG) data, a motor disabled people could communicate with a device by composing sequences of these mental states. In our earlier study, we developed a cross-correlation based logistic regression (CC-LR) algorithm for the classification of MI tasks for BCI applications, but its performance was not satisfactory. This study develops a modified version of the CC-LR algorithm exploring a suitable feature set that can improve the performance. The modified CC-LR algorithm uses the C3 electrode channel (in the international 10-20 system) as a reference channel for the crosscorrelation (CC) technique and applies three diverse feature sets separately, as the input to the logistic regression (LR) classifier. The present algorithm investigates which feature set is the best to characterize the distribution of MI tasks based EEG data. This study also provides an insight into how to select a reference channel for the CC technique with EEG signals considering the anatomical structure of the human brain. The proposed algorithm is compared with eight of the most recently reported well-known methods including the BCI III Winner algorithm.

J	Tzovara, A; Chavarriaga, R; De Lucia, M				Tzovara, Athina; Chavarriaga, Ricardo; De Lucia, Marzia			Quantifying the time for accurate EEG decoding of single value-based decisions	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Decision-making; Accumulation; Decoding; Single-trial; EEG; Drift diffusion model	PERCEPTUAL DECISION; EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION; FLUCTUATIONS; POTENTIALS; EMERGENCE; CORTEX; MODEL	BACKGROUND: Recent neuroimaging studies suggest that value-based decision-making may rely on mechanisms of evidence accumulation. However no studies have explicitly investigated the time when single decisions are taken based on such an accumulation process. NEW METHOD: Here, we outline a novel electroencephalography (EEG) decoding technique which is based on accumulating the probability of appearance of prototypical voltage topographies and can be used for predicting subjects' decisions. We use this approach for studying the time-course of single decisions, during a task where subjects were asked to compare reward vs. loss points for accepting or rejecting offers. RESULTS: We show that based on this new method, we can accurately decode decisions for the majority of the subjects. The typical time-period for accurate decoding was modulated by task difficulty on a trial-by-trial basis. Typical latencies of when decisions are made were detected at similar to 500 ms for 'easy' vs. similar to 700 ms for 'hard' decisions, well before subjects' response (similar to 340 ms). Importantly, this decision time correlated with the drift rates of a diffusion model, evaluated independently at the behavioral level. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): We compare the performance of our algorithm with logistic regression and support vector machine and show that we obtain significant results for a higher number of subjects than with these two approaches. We also carry out analyses at the average event-related potential level, for comparison with previous studies on decision-making. Conclusions: We present a novel approach for studying the timing of value-based decision-making, by accumulating patterns of topographic EEG activity at single-trial level. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The main idea is applying linear discriminant analysis on each subset of the training samples generated by bootstrapping. By this way, a subset of the larger diversities can be got, which increases the diversity between each machine and reduces the ensemble generalization error and redundant data. Wavelet packet is used to extract features, and the proposed algorithm is used for EEG signal classification. The experiments results with the UCI datasets and another publicly available datasets show that compared with traditional methods and others, the proposed method can significantly improve the classification accuracy and stability, and produce better generalization performance.

The process involves EEG data acquisition, feature extraction, and stress level classification. Psychologists have developed over a period of time, questionnaires that cover a wide range of symptoms associated with stress. In the first step, stress level of each participant was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) questionnaire. EEG signals of twenty eight participants were recorded using a single channel EEG headset for duration of three minutes. Feature vector based on frequency sub bands is used to train three different machine learning algorithms, to classify the stress level of participants. It is evident from results that psychological stress level can be measured by single channel EEG headset using machine learning algorithms with considerable accuracy. Moreover, increased Beta activity of subjects with high stress has been observed as compared to the subjects with no stress. This fact can be used as a key factor in classifying psychological stress with single channel EEG headset.

These studies verified that neurophysiological characteristics could be used for detection of emergency situations during simulated driving. However, it is hard to develop the braking assistant system which could control the vehicle continuously using this approach. In this article, the method for decoding of driver's braking intention based on analysis of neural correlates is proposed to control the braking of vehicle continuously. The participants' braking intention is decoded by kernel ridge regression (KRR) model to overcome the limitation of classification approach. In addition, the combination of three different features is employed to enhance the decoding performance. The decoding performances are evaluated by the correlation coefficient (r-value) and the normalized root-mean square error (NRMSE).

ElectroEncephalography (EEG) appears as a non-invasive and repeatable technique to diagnose brain abnormalities. Despite technical advances, the analysis of EEG spectra is usually carried out by experts that must manually perform laborious interpretations. Computational methods may lead to a quantitative analysis of these signals and hence to characterize EEG time series. The aim of this work is to achieve an automatic patients classification from the EEG biomedical signals involved in AD and MCI in order to support medical doctors in the right diagnosis formulation. The analysis of the biological EEG signals requires effective and efficient computer science methods to extract relevant information. Data mining, which guides the automated knowledge discovery process, is a natural way to approach EEG data analysis. Specifically, in our work we apply the following analysis steps: (i) pre-processing of EEG data; (ii) processing of the EEG-signals by the application of time-frequency transforms; and (iii) classification by means of machine learning methods. We obtain promising results from the classification of AD, MCI, and control samples that can assist the medical doctors in identifying the pathology.

Robot-assisted walking devices have been used during rehabilitation of patients with these ailments for regaining and improving walking ability. Previous studies showed the advantage of brain-computer interface (BCI) based robot-assisted training combined with physical therapy in the rehabilitation of the upper limb after stroke. Therefore, stroke patients with walking disorders might also benefit from using BCI robot-assisted training protocols. In order to develop such BCI, it is necessary to evaluate the feasibility to decode walking intention from cortical patterns during robot-assisted gait training. Spectral patterns in the electroencephalogram (EEG) related to robot-assisted active and passive walking were investigated in 10 healthy volunteers (mean age 32.3 +/- 10.8, six female) and in three acute stroke patients (all male, mean age 46.7 +/- 16.9, Berg Balance Scale 20 +/- 12.8). A logistic regression classifier was used to distinguish walking from baseline in these spectral EEG patterns. Mean classification accuracies of 94.0 +/- 5.4% and 93.1 +/- 7.9%, respectively, were reached when active and passive walking were compared against baseline. The classification performance between passive and active walking was 83.4 +/- 7.4%. A classification accuracy of 89.9 +/- 5.7% was achieved in the stroke patients when comparing walking and baseline. Furthermore, in the healthy volunteers modulation of low gamma activity in central midline areas was found to be associated with the gait cycle phases, but not in the stroke patients. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of BCI-based robotic-assisted training devices for gait rehabilitation.

Nevertheless, the instantaneous mixing model of ICA cannot properly describe spatio-temporal dynamics, such as those related to traveling waves of neural activity. In this work, we exploit the application of the Complex ICA (cICA) to describe the underlying brain activities in time and frequency domain. In particular, we show how to effectively extract the most significant timefrequency structure of cortical activity in order to solve a compelling EEG-based pattern classification problem. The crucial step of independent component selection among frequencies is performed using an objective computational method based on template matching techniques with physiologically-plausible activations. Experimental results are obtained using on-line EEG data from the BCI Competition 2003 and are expressed in terms of confusion matrix after leave-one-out validation procedure. A comparative analysis between ICA and cICA models reveals that cICA estimation gives powerful information and allows to achieve a higher classification accuracy with respect to instantaneous ICA.

The common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is a cIassic and powerful tool for extraction of features for motor imagery in BCI systems. However, previous studies show that this algorithm is not suitable for few-channel systems. In this study, phase space reconstruction (PSR) was used to decompose few-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals into multichannel information. Using the reconstructed data, CSP and a support vector machine (SVM) were combined to obtain high cIassification accuracies from a small number of channels. The mean accuracy for the EEG signals from three channels was 0.74 for PSR + CSP + SVM, while this accuracy was only 0.43 for CSP + SVM, which suggests that PSR + CSP + SVM is practicable for few-channel BCI systems.

There are several stable physiological stages that the human brain goes through during sleep. Nowadays, many biomedical signals such as EEG, ECG, EMG, and EOG offer useful details for clinical setups that are used in identifying sleep disorders. In this work, we propose an efficient technique that could be implemented in hardware to differentiate sleep stages which will assist physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of related sleep disorders. This study depends on different EEG datasets from PhysioNet using the Sleep-EDF [Expanded] Database that were acquired and described by scientists for the analysis and diagnosis of sleep stages. Generally, the EEG signal is decomposed into five bands: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma to define the change in brain state. In this work, Butterworth band-pass filters are designed to filter and decompose EEG into the above frequency sub-bands. In addition, various discriminating features including energy, standard deviation and entropy are computed and extracted from each delta, square, alpha, beta and gamma sub-band. Furthermore, the extracted features are then fed to a supervised learning classifier; support vector machine (SVM) to be able to recognize the sleep stages state and identify if the acquired signal is corresponding to wake or stage 1 of sleep, according to the purpose of this research. The key novelty of this work is to identify the sleep stages from a publicly available EEG signal dataset by using a feasible set of features, easily implementable filters in any microcontroller device, and an efficient classification method. Therefore, physicians can track these sleep stages to identify certain patterns such as detecting fatigue, drowsiness, and/or various sleep disorders such as sleep apnea.

This paper describes a non-invasive brain-actuated manipulator experiment, which defined a paradigm for the motion control of a serial manipulator based on motor imagery and shared control. The techniques of component selection, spatial filtering and classification of motor imagery were involved. Small-world neural network (SWNN) was used to classify five brain states. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed classifier, we replace the SWNN classifier by a radial basis function (RBF) networks neural network, a standard multi-layered feed-forward backpropagation network (SMN) and a multi-SVM classifier, with the same features for the classification. The results also indicate that the proposed classifier achieves a 3.83% improvement over the best results of other classifiers. We proposed a shared control method consisting of two control patterns to expand the control of BMI from the software angle. The job of path building for reaching the 'end' point was designated as an assessment task. We recorded all paths contributed by subjects and picked up relevant parameters as evaluation coefficients. With the assistance of two control patterns and series of machine learning algorithms, the proposed BMI originally achieved the motion control of a manipulator in the whole workspace. According to experimental results, we confirmed the feasibility of the proposed BMI method for 3D motion control of a manipulator using EEG during motor imagery. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The present work aims to classify object shapes from EEG signals and tactile pressure signals obtained from a capacitive tactile sensor while exploring objects of different shapes; thereby drawing a mutual relation or dependence between these two sources of haptic information in response to the same tactile stimuli. It is evident from the classification results that object-shapes can be classified efficiently from both EEG and tactile signals with mean classification accuracy of 74.21% and 97.12% respectively. Correlation analysis using various metrics show that EEG and tactile signals are non-linearly correlated and only a very small amount of non linear correlation exists. The polynomial fitting of EEG signals on tactile signals depicts that in absence of brain signals tactile signals can successfully predict the corresponding EEG signals.

Beyond this original medical motivation the fusion of multiple modalities has created successful interesting research opportunities that have furthered our understanding of the brain and cognition[15]. In BCI recently multimodal fusion concepts have received great attention under the label hybrid BCI[13]. Fusing information has also been a very common practice in the sciences and engineering [17]. Recently a family of novel multimodal data analysis methods have emerged that can extract nonlinear relations between data[1,2,5-10]. They are rooted in the modern machine learning and signal processing techniques that are now available for analysing EEG, for decoding mental states etc[3,11,12,14,16]. The talk will first discuss recent multimodal analysis techniques such as SPoC[5-7]. Furthermore if time permits we will discuss a novel reliable method for estimating the Hurst exponent, a quantity that has recently become popular for describing network properties and is being used for diagnostic purposes [4]. Both nonlinear techniques allow for a better and more reliable and robust analysis of complex phenomena in neurophysiological data.

Extracting and Selecting Distinctive EEG Features for Efficient Epileptic Seizure Prediction	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Amplitude and frequency modulation features; electroencephalogram (EEG) signal representation; epileptic seizure prediction; feature selection	INSTANTANEOUS AMPLITUDE; NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; FREQUENCY; METHODOLOGY; PATTERNS; MACHINE; SIGNAL; STATE	This paper presents compact yet comprehensive feature representations for the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal to achieve efficient epileptic seizure prediction performance. The initial EEG feature vectors are formed by acquiring the dominant amplitude and frequency components on an epoch-by-epoch basis from the EEG signals. These extracted parameters can reveal the intrinsic EEG signal changes as well as the underlying stage transitions. To improve the efficacy of feature extraction, an elimination-based feature selection method has been applied on the initial feature vectors. This diminishes redundant and noisy points, providing each patient with a lower dimensional and independent final feature form. In this context, our study is distinguished from that of others currently prevailing. Usually, these latter approaches adopted feature extraction processes, which employed time-consuming high-dimensional parameter sets. Machine learning approaches that are considered as state of the art have been employed to build patient-specific binary classifiers that can divide the extracted feature parameters into preictal and interictal groups. Through out-of-sample evaluation on the intracranial EEG recordings provided by the publicly available Freiburg dataset, promising prediction performance has been attained. Specifically, we have achieved 98.8% sensitivity results on the 19 patients included in our experiment, where only one of 83 seizures across all patients was not predicted. To make this investigation more comprehensive, we have conducted extensive comparative studies with other recently published competing approaches, in which the advantages of our method are highlighted.

Electrical activity of the brain is referred as Electroencephalogram (EEG). EEG signal acts as an important tool for diagnosis of neural diseases. The problem of EEG signal classification is a pattern recognition problem using extracted features. Observing EEG signals for seizure detection all times is a difficult task. So to make the detection easier, increase the accuracy and speed of analysis & classification it is necessary to invent different techniques. In this paper, to extract characteristics from given EEG data different methods of feature extraction have been applied. Features have been extracted by computing Fourier transform, discrete wavelet transform (DWT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD) & bispectrum analysis and seizure detection pattern is investigated for classification. The database which is publicly available at Bonn University is taken.

Cerebral function monitors use a reduced number of electrodes from the standard 10-20 montage and displays both an EEG and aEEG trace from one or two channels. Sleep-wake cycling is defined as a state of continuous normal voltage and the presence of both wakefulness or active sleep and quiet sleep with a minimum of two or three consecutive sleep state changes on aEEG for a duration of twenty minutes during a three-four hour period. Sleep-wake cycling in infants is often used as an indicator of the patient's neurological development and response to brain injury. There has been complete absence of algorithm development for the automated detection of changes in normal neonatal sleep-wake cycling patterns displayed by cerebral function monitor. This study will incorporate a unique, robust algorithm for incorporation into a multidimensional data analysis environment, which is capable of capturing multiple individual streams of physiological data from bedside monitors and processing them. The framework supports the acquisition, collection, transmission, real-time processing, storage and retrospective analysis of wave form and physiological data streams combined with supporting clinical information including clinical observations and the results of laboratory investigations. The development of a robust, accurate and reliable algorithm that detects sleep-wake cycling in newborn infants greater than 29 weeks gestational age should provide valuable information for meaningful clinical decision support for physicians caring for critically ill neonates. This paper describes the development and results of the algorithm, its upper and lower boundary detection, low pass filtration, and threshold classification on an individual patient's data set.

This often leads to lowered productivity and increased safety risks. In this study, we developed a functional-connectivity based mental fatigue monitoring method. Twenty-six subjects underwent a 20-min mentally demanding test of sustained attention with high-resolution EEG monitoring. Functional connectivity patterns were obtained on the cortical surface via source localization of cortical activities in the first and last 5-min quartiles of the experiment. Multivariate pattern analysis was then adopted to extract the highly discriminative functional connectivity information. The algorithm used in the present study demonstrated an overall accuracy of 81.5% (p < 0.0001) for fatigue classification through leave-one-out cross validation. Moreover, we found that the most discriminative connectivity features were located in or across middle frontal gyrus and several motor areas, in agreement with the important role that these cortical regions play in the maintenance of sustained attention. This work therefore demonstrates the feasibility of a functional-connectivity-based mental fatigue assessment method, opening up a new avenue for modeling natural brain dynamics under different mental states. Our method has potential applications in several domains, including traffic and industrial safety.

After development and delivery of these systems there is no simple mechanism for these clinicians to improve the system's classification while encountering any false classification by the system. So the improvement process of the system's classification after initial training (during development) can be termed as 'dead'. We consider neurologist as the best available benchmark for system's learning. In this article, we propose an 'alive' system, capable of improving its performance by taking clinician's feedback into consideration. The system is based on taking DWT transform which has been shown to be very effective for EEG signal analysis. PCA is applied on the statistical features which are extracted from DWT coefficients before classification by an SVM classifier.

A Generalizable Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Using Machine Learning for Feature Discovery	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MOTOR IMAGERY; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; PLASTICITY	This work describes a generalized method for classifying motor-related neural signals for a brain-computer interface (BCI), based on a stochastic machine learning method. The method differs from the various feature extraction and selection techniques employed in many other BCI systems. The classifier does not use extensive a-priori information, resulting in reduced reliance on highly specific domain knowledge. Instead of pre-defining features, the time-domain signal is input to a population of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) in order to perform a stochastic search for the best structure. The results showed that the average performance of the new algorithm outperformed other published methods using the Berlin BCI IV (2008) competition dataset and was comparable to the best results in the Berlin BCI II (2002-3) competition dataset. The new method was also applied to electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded from five subjects undertaking a hand squeeze task and demonstrated high levels of accuracy with a mean classification accuracy of 78.9% after five-fold cross-validation. Our new approach has been shown to give accurate results across different motor tasks and signal types as well as between subjects.

The detectors rely on a common spatial pattern (CSP)-based feature enhancement stage that increases the variance between seizure and nonseizure scalp electroencephalography (EEG). The proposed feature enhancement stage enables better discrimination between seizure and nonseizure features. The first detector adopts a conventional classification stage using a support vector machine (SVM) that feeds the energy features extracted from different subbands to an SVM for seizure onset detection. The second detector uses logical operators to pool SVM seizure onset detections made independently across different EEG spectral bands. The proposed detectors exhibit an improved performance, with respect to sensitivity and detection latency, compared with the state-of-the-art detectors. Experimental results have demonstrated that the first detector achieves a sensitivity of 95.2%, detection latency of 6.43 s, and false alarm rate of 0.59 per hour. The second detector achieves a sensitivity of 100%, detection latency of 7.28 s, and false alarm rate of 1.2 per hour for the MAJORITY fusion method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The same applies for the wake state which also comprises distinct global functional states (called vigilance stages). However, various terms and concepts have been introduced describing different aspects of wakefulness, and accordingly several methods of assessment exist, e.g. sleep laboratory assessments (Multiple Sleep Latency Test, Maintenance of Wakefulness Test), questionnaires (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale), behavioural tasks (Psychomotor Vigilance Test) or electroencephalography (EEG)-based assessments (Alpha Attenuation Test, Karolinska Drowsiness Test). Furthermore, several theoretical concepts about the regulation of sleep and wakefulness have been put forward, and physiological correlates have been identified. Most relevant for healthy functioning is the regulation of brain arousal and the adaption of wakefulness to the environmental and situational needs so that the optimal balance between energy conservation and responsiveness can be obtained. Since one approach to the assessment of brain arousal regulation is the classification of EEG vigilance stages, a computer-based algorithm (Vigilance Algorithm Leipzig) has been introduced, allowing classification of EEG vigilance stages in EEG recordings under resting conditions. The time course of EEG vigilance stages in EEGs of 15-20 min duration allows estimation of the individual arousal regulation (hyperstable, adaptive, or unstable vigilance pattern). The vigilance model of affective disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder links a disturbed arousal regulation to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders and accordingly helps to explain and possibly also predict treatment effects of pharmacological and non pharmacological interventions for these conditions.

One of the strategies used, is to decode the motor imagery of the subject, which can modify the neuronal activity in the sensory-motor areas in a similar way to which it is observed in real movement. The present study shows the activation patterns that are registered in motor and motor imagery tasks of right and left hand movement in a sample of young healthy subjects of Mexican nationality. By means of frequency analysis it was possible to determine the difference conditions of motor imagery and movement. Using U Mann-Whitney tests, differences with statistical significance (p < 0.05) where obtained, in the EEG channels C3, Cz, C4, T3 and P3 in the mu and beta rhythms, for subjects with similar characteristics (age, gender, and education). With these results, it would be possible to define a classifier or decoder by gender that improves the performance rate and diminishes the training time, with the goal of designing a functional BCI system that can be transferred from the laboratory to the clinical application in patients with motor disabilities.

An interval type-2 fuzzy approach for real-time EEG-based control of wrist and finger movement	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Interval type-2 fuzzy systems; Motor imagination; Extreme energy ratio; Wrist movement and grasping	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; CLASSIFICATION; IMAGERY; INTERFACES; BCI	Feature extraction and automatic classification of mental states is an interesting and open area of research in the field of brain-computer interfacing (BCI). A well-trained classifier would allow the BCI system to control an external assistive device in real world problems. Sometimes, standard existing classifiers fail to generalize the components of a non-stationary signal, like Electroencephalography (EEG) which may pose one or more problems during real-time usage of the BC! system. In this paper, we aim to tackle this issue by designing an interval type-2 fuzzy classifier which deals with the uncertainties of the EEG signal over various sessions. Our designed classifier is used to decode various movements concerning the wrist (extension and flexion) and finger (opening and closing of a fist). For this purpose, we have employed extreme energy ratio (EER) to construct the feature vector. The average classification accuracy achieved during offline training and online testing over eight subjects are 86.45% and 78.44%, respectively. On comparison with other related works, it is shown that our designed IT2FS classifier presents a better performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Brain signals can be translated into control commands. Electroencephalography (EEG) is considered in this work, EEG is a low-cost non-invasive technique. A big challenge is faced due to the poor signal-to-noise ratio of EEG signals. The dataset used in this work is based on asynchronous or self-paced motor imagery problem. The used self-paced Brain Computer Interface (BCI) problem poses a considerable challenge by introducing an additional class, a relax class, or non-intentional control periods that are not included in the training set and should be classified. In this work, a number of subject dependent parameters and their values are determined. These parameters are: the best frequency range, the best Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) channels, and the number of these CSP channels. System parameters are determined dynamically in the offline training phase. Energy based features are extracted afterwards from the best selected signals. The Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier is used as a classification back end. Results of the proposed system show superiority over the previously introduced systems in terms of the Mean Square Error (MSE) when tested on the Berlin BCI (BBCI) competition IV dataset 1.

Decoding of Attentional Selection in a Cocktail Party Environment from Single-Trial EEG is Robust to Task	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc			SPEECH; RECONSTRUCTION; RESPONSES; LOCUS	Recently it has been shown to be possible to ascertain the target of a subject's attention in a cocktail party environment from single-trial (similar to 60 s) electroencephalography (EEG) data. Specifically, this was shown in the context of a dichotic listening paradigm where subjects were cued to attend to a story in one ear while ignoring a different story in the other and were required to answer questions on both stories. This paradigm resulted in a high decoding accuracy that correlated with task performance across subjects. Here, we extend this finding by showing that the ability to accurately decode attentional selection in a dichotic speech paradigm is robust to the particular attention task at hand. Subjects attended to one of two dichotically presented stories under four task conditions. These conditions required subjects to 1) answer questions on the content of both stories, 2) detect irregular frequency fluctuations in the voice of the attended speaker 3) answer questions on both stories and detect frequency fluctuations in the attended story, and 4) detect target words in the attended story. All four tasks led to high decoding accuracy (similar to 89%). These results offer new possibilities for creating user-friendly brain computer interfaces (BCIs).

Using discrete wavelet transform, EEG signal is decomposed into five different frequency bands namely delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma. Only theta, alpha and beta carry seizure information. Statistical feature like energy, variance and zero crossing rate and nonlinear feature like fractal dimension is extracted from each of the three sub bands and fed to support vector machine classifier. Support vector machine classifies the input EEG signal into seizure free and seizure signal.

A Transform-Based Feature Extraction Approach for Motor Imagery Tasks Classification	IEEE JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL ENGINEERING IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; channel selection; feature extraction; linear prediction; orthogonal transform	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; INFORMATION; PATTERNS; SIGNALS	In this paper, we present a new motor imagery classification method in the context of electroencephalography (EEG)-based brainficomputer interface (BCI). This method uses a signal-dependent orthogonal transform, referred to as linear prediction singular value decomposition (LP-SVD), for feature extraction. The transform defines the mapping as the left singular vectors of the LP coefficientfilter impulse response matrix. Using a logistic tree-based model classifier; the extracted features are classified into one of four motor imagery movements. The proposed approach wasfirst benchmarked against two related state-of-the-art feature extraction approaches, namely, discrete cosine transform (DCT) and adaptive autoregressive (AAR)-based methods. By achieving an accuracy of 67.35%, the LP-SVD approach outperformed the other approaches by large margins (25% compared with DCT and 6 % compared with AAR-based methods). To further improve the discriminatory capability of the extracted features and reduce the computational complexity, we enlarged the extracted feature subset by incorporating two extra features, namely, Q-and the Hotelling's T-2 statistics of the transformed EEG and introduced a new EEG channel selection method. The performance of the EEG classification based on the expanded feature set and channel selection method was compared with that of a number of the state-of-the-art classification methods previously reported with the BCI IIIa competition data set. Our method came second with an average accuracy of 81.38%.

However, scalp-recorded EEG signals have inherent non-stationary characteristics; thus, the classification performance is deteriorated by changing the background activity of the EEG during the BCI experiment. Recently, the sparse representation based classification (SRC) method has shown a robust classification performance in many pattern recognition fields including BCI. In this study, we aim to analyze noise robustness of the SRC method to evaluate the capability of the SRC for non-stationary EEG signal classification. For this purpose, we generate noisy test signals by adding a noise source such as random Gaussian and scalp-recorded background noise into the original motor imagery based EEG signals. Using the noisy test signals and real online-experimental dataset, we compare the classification performance of the SRC and support vector machine (SVM). Furthermore, we analyze the unique classification mechanism of the SRC. We observed that the SRC method provided better classification accuracy and noise robustness compared with the SVM method. In addition, the SRC has an inherent adaptive classification mechanism that makes it suitable for time-varying EEG signal classification for online BCI systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Early screening for a specific condition of ASD known as Asperger's syndrome (AS), however, is slightly more challenging due to the subjective nature of the detection. This paper proposes a quantitative method for the identification of AS children based on the analysis of EEG signals. Brain signals were obtained from 2 children with AS and 2 typically developing children during resting states (eyes closed and eyes open). Features are extracted using Mel Frequency Cepstal Coefficient (MFCC) and classified using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network. The proposed model yields classification accuracy up to 79%, with EEG features during eyes closed giving higher accuracy compared to eyes open. This indicates the stability of the EEG during eyes closed that is worth investigating for the identification of brain developmental disorder.

Time-series discrimination using feature relevance analysis in motor imagery classification	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Motor imagery; EEG data preprocessing; Short-time parameters; Feature relevance analysis	BCI COMPETITION 2003; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; FEATURE-SELECTION; BRAIN; DIMENSIONALITY; COMMUNICATION	The use of motor imagery discrimination using feature relevance analysis (MIDFR) is investigated for classification tasks based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The method addresses the problem of a direct and automatic finding of the time-varying features influencing the most on distinguishing motor imagery tasks. The method introduces a stochastic relevance stage that is primarily used for properly handling the set of short-time features, which are extracted as to make prominent the nonstationary behavior of the EEG data. Furthermore, since it is widely accepted that the motor imagery information is concentrated in the mu and beta neural activity bands, we make use of the empirical mode decomposition together with the common-spatial-patterns mapping. We test two different motor imagery databases, using a soft-margin support vector machine classifier that is validated by a 10-fold cross-validation methodology. Since the proposed MIDFR algorithm better encodes neural activity dynamics, experimental results carried out, which are also contrasted with other state-of-the art approaches, show that the proposed approach allows improving detection of MI classification tasks. Besides, the computed relevance on the EEG channels is in accordance with other clinical findings reported in the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Alvarez-Meza, A.

Apart from CSP analysis's traditional application in time domain, it is extended to consider frequency domain information of EEG signal. After an artifact removal through the independent component analysis (ICA), the multichannel EEG signals are decomposed into a set of spatial patterns by CSP analysis, and the logarithmic frequency domain and time domain power distributions are calculated. Time-frequency power features are extracted on these distributions and optimized by a F-score method. Comparing with the traditional CSP methods, the proposed method not only retained the time domain variance features, but also induced the frequency band power features. Since F-score is easy and fast to calculate, and the F-score based method can quickly select more effective features from high dimensional data, depending on the importance and the discriminative ability of each data pattern. In our method, the F-score algorithm is also used to solve the traditional CSP problems such as the definition of common pattern number. The proposed method was tested on a five-task cognitive state analysis problem, and a recognition accuracy of 89.4% was achieved, that well approved the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method.

Analytic amplitude and analytic phase of high definition EEG estimated by the Hilbert Transform represented the local synchrony of brain. Spatiotemporal patterns of stimuli on different fingers can be extracted and classified by a specific algorithm. BP network combined with the KIII model, a bionic olfactory system model, was applied to achieve a better classification effect.

BCI systems based on motor imagery often employ feature extraction algorithms based on Common Spatial Patterns (CSP). CSP is capable of discriminating two classes, but it is sensitive to outliers and noisy trials. Therefore, regularisation is often deployed to improve the robustness and accuracy of CSP estimation. In this paper, a novel regularisation approach based on shrinkage estimation is presented in order to handle small sample problem and retain subject-specific discriminative features. In this method, an analytical solution for shrinkage estimation is provided, which not only is computationally tractable, but also overcomes the heuristic approach of traditional cross validation based parameter tuning. We applied the proposed regularisation to Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP). The proposed method is evaluated on two publicly available datasets, namely Wadsworth Physiobank Dataset and BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a. The results show that Shrinkage Regularized Filter Bank CSP (SR-FBCSP) outperforms FBCSP in classifying left vs right hand motor imagery.	[Shenoy, H.

Rehabilitation robots or exoskeletons have been controlled using EEG activity. However, all studies have used a 2-class or one-dimensional decoding scheme. In this study we investigated EEG decoding of 5 functional movements of the same limb towards an online scenario. Six healthy participants performed a three-dimensional center-out reaching task based on direction movements (four directions and rest) wearing a 32-channel EEG cap. A BCI design based on multiclass extensions of Spectrally Weighted Common Spatial Patterns (Spec-CSP) and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier was developed and tested offline. The decoding accuracy was 5-fold cross-validated. A decoding accuracy of 39.5% on average for all the six subjects was obtained (chance level being 20%). The results of the current study demonstrate multiple functional movements decoding (significantly higher than chance level) from the same limb using EEG data. This study represents first steps towards a same limb multi degree of freedom (DOF) online EEG based BCI for motor restoration.

Improved Decoding of Attentional Selection in a Cocktail Party Environment with EEG via Automatic Selection of Relevant Independent Components	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			TIME	Recently it has been shown to be possible to ascertain which speaker a subject is attending to in a cocktail party environment from single-trial (similar to 60s) electroencephalography (EEG) data. The attentional selection of most of subjects could be decoded with a very high accuracy (>90%). However, the performance of many subjects fell below what would be required for a potential brain computer interface (BCI). One potential reason for this is that activity related to the stimuli may have a lower signal-to-noise ratio on the scalp for some subjects than others. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a commonly used method for denoising EEG data. However, its effective use often requires the subjective choice of the experimenter to determine which independent components (ICs) to retain and which to reject. Algorithms do exist to automatically determine the reliability of ICs, however they provide no information as to their relevance for the task at hand. Here we introduce a novel method for automatically selecting ICs which are relevant for decoding attentional selection. In doing so, we show a significant increase in classification accuracy at all test data durations from 60s to 10s. These findings have implications for the future development of naturalistic and user-friendly BCIs, as well as for smart hearing aids.

Single trial prediction of self-paced reaching directions from EEG signals	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						stroke; self-paced voluntary movement; movement-related potentials; EEG; movement direction; brain-machine interface	SLOW CORTICAL POTENTIALS; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; HAND MOVEMENTS; AVERAGE REFERENCE; PARIETAL CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; PLASTICITY; PHASE; REHABILITATION; REPRESENTATION	Early detection of movement intention could possibly minimize the delays in the activation of neuroprosthetic devices. As yet, single trial analysis using non-invasive approaches for understanding such movement preparation remains a challenging task. We studied the feasibility of predicting movement directions in self-paced upper limb center-out reaching tasks, i.e., spontaneous movements executed without an external cue that can better reflect natural motor behavior in humans. We reported results of non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from mild stroke patients and able-bodied participants. Previous studies have shown that low frequency EEG oscillations are modulated by the intent to move and therefore, can be decoded prior to the movement execution. Motivated by these results, we investigated whether slow cortical potentials (SCPs) preceding movement onset can be used to classify reaching directions and evaluated the performance using 5-fold cross-validation. For able-bodied subjects, we obtained an average decoding accuracy of 76% (chance level of 25%) at 62.5 ms before onset using the amplitude of on-going SCPs with above chance level performances between 875 to 437.5 ms prior to onset. The decoding accuracy for the stroke patients was on average 47% with their paretic arms. Comparison of the decoding accuracy across different frequency ranges (i.e., SCPs, delta, theta, alpha, and gamma) yielded the best accuracy using SCPs filtered between 0.1 to 1 Hz. Across all the subjects, including stroke subjects, the best selected features were obtained mostly from the fronto-parietal regions, hence consistent with previous neurophysiological studies on arm reaching tasks. In summary, we concluded that SCPs allow the possibility of single trial decoding of reaching directions at least 312.5 ms before onset of reach.	[Lew, Eileen Y.

J	Chung, D; Yun, K; Jeong, J				Chung, Dongil; Yun, Kyongsik; Jeong, Jaeseung			Decoding covert motivations of free riding and cooperation from multi-feature pattern analysis of EEG signals	SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PRISONERS-DILEMMA; PARIETAL JUNCTION; NEURAL BASIS; BRAIN; PUNISHMENT; CLASSIFICATION; EMERGENCE; DYNAMICS; KINDNESS; MIND	Cooperation and free riding are among the most frequently observed behaviors in human social decision-making. In social interactions, the effects of strategic decision processes have been consistently reported in iterative cooperation decisions. However, the neural activity immediately after new information is presented, the time at which strategy learning potentially starts has not yet been investigated with high temporal resolution. Here, we implemented an iterative, binary public goods game that simulates cooperation/free riding behavior. We applied the multi-feature pattern analysis method by using a support vector machine and the unique combinatorial performance measure, and identified neural features from the single-trial, event-related spectral perturbation at the result-presentation of the current round that predict participants' decisions to cooperate or free ride in the subsequent round. We found that neural oscillations in centroparietal and temporal regions showed the highest predictive power through 10-fold cross-validation; these predicted the participants' next decisions, which were independent of the neural responses during their own preceding choices. We suggest that the spatial distribution and time-frequency information of the selected features represent covert motivations to free ride or cooperate in the next round and are separately processed in parallel with information regarding the preceding results.

This paper proposes a novel two-stage motor intension classifier to detect the correct motor planning of the drivers during car driving. Common spatial pattern filters are introduced here for feature extraction as well as artifact removal from the raw electroencephalographic signals.

Recently, functional connectivity graphs (FCGs) have entered into the picture. In the related decoding scheme, FCGs are treated as unstructured data and, hence, their inherent format is overlooked. To alleviate this, tensor subspace analysis (TSA) is incorporated for the parsimonious representation of connectivity data. In addition to the particular methodological innovation, this work also makes a contribution at a conceptual level by encoding in FCGs cross-frequency coupling apart from the conventional frequency-specific interactions. Working memory related tasks, supported by networks oscillating at different frequencies, are good candidates for assessing the novel approach. We employed surface EEG recordings when the subjects were repeatedly performing a mental arithmetic task of five cognitive workload levels. For each trial, an FCG was constructed based on phase interactions within and between Frontal (theta) and Parieto-Occipital (alpha 2) neural activities, which are considered to reflect the function of two distinct working memory subsystems. Based on the TSA representation, a remarkably high correct-recognition-rate (96%) of the task difficulties was achieved using a standard classifier. The overall scheme is computational efficient and therefore potentially useful for real-time and personalized applications.

Individually Adapted Imagery Improves Brain-Computer Interface Performance in End-Users with Disability	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MOTOR IMAGERY; SPATIAL FILTERS; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; TECHNOLOGY; PATTERNS; SYSTEM	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) translate oscillatory electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns into action. Different mental activities modulate spontaneous EEG rhythms in various ways. Non-stationarity and inherent variability of EEG signals, however, make reliable recognition of modulated EEG patterns challenging. Able-bodied individuals who use a BCI for the first time achieve - on average - binary classification performance of about 75%. Performance in users with central nervous system (CNS) tissue damage is typically lower. User training generally enhances reliability of EEG pattern generation and thus also robustness of pattern recognition. In this study, we investigated the impact of mental tasks on binary classification performance in BCI users with central nervous system (CNS) tissue damage such as persons with stroke or spinal cord injury (SCI). Motor imagery (MI), that is the kinesthetic imagination of movement (e.g. squeezing a rubber ball with the right hand), is the "gold standard" and mainly used to modulate EEG patterns. Based on our recent results in able-bodied users, we hypothesized that pair- wise combination of "brain- teaser" (e.g. mental subtraction and mental word association) and "dynamic imagery" (e. g. hand and feet MI) tasks significantly increases classification performance of induced EEG patterns in the selected end-user group. Within- day (How stable is the classification within a day?) and between- day (How well does a model trained on day one perform on unseen data of day two?) analysis of variability of mental task pair classification in nine individuals confirmed the hypothesis. We found that the use of the classical MI task pair hand vs. feed leads to significantly lower classification accuracy - in average up to 15% less - in most users with stroke or SCI. User-specific selection of task pairs was again essential to enhance performance. We expect that the gained evidence will significantly contribute to make imagery-based BCI technology become accessible to a larger population of users including individuals with special needs due to CNS damage.

Forty young participants viewed film clips that evoked the following emotional states: neutral, positive, or negative. Three connectivity indices, including correlation, coherence, and phase synchronization, were used to estimate brain functional connectivity in EEG signals. Following each film clip, participants were asked to report on their subjective affect. The results indicated that the EEG-based functional connectivity change was significantly different among emotional states. Furthermore, the connectivity pattern was detected by pattern classification analysis using Quadratic Discriminant Analysis. The results indicated that the classification rate was better than chance. We conclude that estimating EEG-based functional connectivity provides a useful tool for studying the relationship between brain activity and emotional states.

Decomposing spatiotemporal brain patterns into topographic latent sources	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						fMRI; Bayesian; Decoding; Variational; Multivariate	EEG; CLASSIFICATION; FRAMEWORK; INFERENCE; MODELS	This paper extends earlier work on spatial modeling of fMRI data to the temporal domain, providing a framework for analyzing high temporal resolution brain imaging modalities such as electroencapholography (EEG). The central idea is to decompose brain imaging data into a covariate-dependent superposition of functions defined over continuous time and space (what we refer to as topographic latent sources). The continuous formulation allows us to parametrically model spatiotemporally localized activations. To make group-level inferences, we elaborate the model hierarchically by sharing sources across subjects. We describe a variational algorithm for parameter estimation that scales efficiently to large data sets. Applied to three EEG data sets, we find that the model produces good predictive performance and reproduces a number of classic findings. Our results suggest that topographic latent sources serve as an effective hypothesis space for interpreting spatiotemporal brain imaging data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Until now, however, researchers had little understanding of the details of relationship between different emotional states and various EEG features. To improve the accuracy of EEG-based emotion classification and visualize the changes of emotional states with time, this paper systematically compares three kinds of existing EEG features for emotion classification, introduces an efficient feature smoothing method for removing the noise unrelated to emotion task, and proposes a simple approach to tracking the trajectory of emotion changes with manifold learning. To examine the effectiveness of these methods introduced in this paper, we design a movie induction experiment that spontaneously leads subjects to real emotional states and collect an EEG data set of six subjects. From experimental results on our EEG data set, we found that (a) power spectrum feature is superior to other two kinds of features; (b) a linear dynamic system based feature smoothing method can significantly improve emotion classification accuracy; and (c) the trajectory of emotion changes can be visualized by reducing subject-independent features with manifold learning.

The system uses phase locking value (PLV) for the features extraction and pattern recognition algorithm for classification. There are four classifiers: QDC, KNNC, PARZENDC and LDC used in this paper to estimate the accuracy of our system. Based on the collected time-domain EEG signals, the phase locking value (PLV) from C3-CZ and C4- CZ electrodes are calculated and then used as the feature and input for the classifiers algorithm. The classification system demonstrate an accuracy of 92 % in LDC. The results of this study suggest the method could be utilized effectively for response inhibition identification.

A Multichannel Deep Belief Network for the Classification of EEG Data	NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING, ICONIP 2015, PT IV	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	22nd International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP)	NOV 09-12, 2015	Istanbul, TURKEY			Multichannel deep belief network; EEG classification; Transcranial direct current stimulation	DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; DEPRESSION	Deep learning, and in particular Deep Belief Network (DBN), has recently witnessed increased attention from researchers as a new classification platform. It has been successfully applied to a number of classification problems, such as image classification, speech recognition and natural language processing. However, deep learning has not been fully explored in electroencephalogram (EEG) classification. We propose in this paper three implementations of DBNs to classify multichannel EEG data based on different channel fusion levels. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we used EEG data that has been recorded to study the modulatory effect of transcranial direct current stimulation. One of the proposed DBNs produced very promising results when compared to three well-established classifiers; which are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM).

A new approach which combines the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) with the Genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed in this paper. In the proposed approach, the ELM is used both as the final classifier and the fitness function for the GA to select the optimal feature subset from the initial features extracted through time-frequency (TF) analysis. The GA is adopted as the complementary input optimization mechanism to improve the performance of the ELM. To testify the performance of the proposed approach, experiments were simulated using the real-world EEG signals of 2003 International BCI Competition dataset. The recognition results haw proved the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The proposed features are based on Local Binary Patterns (LBP) descriptor extracted from t-f representation of EEG signals processed as a textured image. Compared to most previous t-f approaches were based only on features derived from the instantaneous frequency and the energies of EEG signals generated from different spectral sub-bands, the proposed t-f features are capable to describe visually the epileptic seizure activity patterns observed in t-f image of EEG signals. The results obtained on real EEG data show that the use of t-f LBP descriptor-based features achieve an overall classification accuracy up to 99% for 150 EEG signals using 2-class SVM classifier. This is confirmed by ROC curve analysis.

The combination of feature selection and classification methods generates satisfactory outcomes using biological biomarkers. The use of quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) cordance has enhanced the clinical utility of the EEG in psychiatric and neurological subjects. Trichotillomania (TTM), a kind of body focused repetitive behavior, is defined as a disorder characterized by repetitive hair pulling that results in noticeable hair loss. Phenomenological observations underline similarities between hair-pulling behaviors and compulsions seen in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Despite the recognized similarities between OCD and TTM, there is evidence of important differences between these two disorders. In order to dichotomize the subjects of each disorder, artificial intelligence approach was employed using quantitative EEG (QEEG) cordance values with 19 electrodes from 10 brain regions (prefrontal, frontocentral, central, left temporal, right temporal, left parietal, occipital, midline, left frontal and right frontal) in 4 frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha and beta). Machine learning methods, artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and Naive Bayes (NB), were used in order to classify 39 TTM and 40 OCD patients. SVM, with its relatively better performance, was then combined with an improved ant colony optimization (IACO) approach in order to select more informative features with less iterations. The noteworthy performance of the hybrid approach underline that it is possible to discriminate OCD and TTM subjects with 81.04% overall accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The influence of central neuropathic pain in paraplegic patients on performance of a motor imagery based Brain Computer Interface	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; Motor imagery; BCI; Paraplegia; Central neuropathic pain; Event related synchronisation/desynchronisation	EEG; CLASSIFICATION; REORGANIZATION; FEASIBILITY; PREVALENCE; DYNAMICS; BCI	Objective: The aim of this study was to test how the presence of central neuropathic pain (CNP) influences the performance of a motor imagery based Brain Computer Interface (BCI). Methods: In this electroencephalography (EEG) based study, we tested BCI classification accuracy and analysed event related desynchronisation (ERD) in 3 groups of volunteers during imagined movements of their arms and legs. The groups comprised of nine able-bodied people, ten paraplegic patients with CNP (lower abdomen and legs) and nine paraplegic patients without CNP. We tested two types of classifiers: a 3 channel bipolar montage and classifiers based on common spatial patterns (CSPs), with varying number of channels and CSPs. Results: Paraplegic patients with CNP achieved higher classification accuracy and had stronger ERD than paraplegic patients with no pain for all classifier configurations. Highest 2-class classification accuracy was achieved for CSP classifier covering wider cortical area: 82 +/- 7% for patients with CNP, 82 +/- 4% for able-bodied and 78 +/- 5% for patients with no pain. Conclusion: Presence of CNP improves BCI classification accuracy due to stronger and more distinct ERD. Significance: Results of the study show that CNP is an important confounding factor influencing the performance of motor imagery based BCI based on ERD.

Decoding of Intentional Actions from Scalp Electroencephalography (EEG) in Freely-behaving Infants	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc			MU RHYTHM	The mirror neuron system (MNS) in humans is thought to enable an individual's understanding of the meaning of actions performed by others and the potential imitation and learning of those actions. In humans, electroencephalographic (EEG) changes in sensorimotor alpha-band at central electrodes, which desynchronizes both during execution and observation of goal-directed actions (i.e., mu suppression), have been considered an analog to MNS function. However, methodological and developmental issues, as well as the nature of generalized mu suppression to imagined, observed, and performed actions, have yet to provide a mechanistic relationship between EEG mu-rhythm and MNS function, and the extent to which EEG can be used to infer intent during MNS tasks remains unknown. In this study we present a novel methodology using active EEG and inertial sensors to record brain activity and behavioral actions from freely-behaving infants during exploration, imitation, attentive rest, pointing, reaching and grasping, and interaction with an actor. We used delta-band (1-4Hz) EEG as input to a dimensionality reduction algorithm (locality-preserving Fisher's discriminant analysis, LFDA) followed by a neural classifier (Gaussian mixture models, GMMs) to decode the each MNS task performed by freely-behaving 6-24 month old infants during interaction with an adult actor. Here, we present results from a 20-month male infant to illustrate our approach and show the feasibility of EEG-based classification of freely occurring MNS behaviors displayed by an infant. These results, which provide an alternative to the mu-rhythm theory of MNS function, indicate the informative nature of EEG in relation to intentionality (goal) for MNS tasks which may support action-understanding and thus bear implications for advancing the understanding of MNS function.

To this end, we conducted a feasibility study on predicting the relevance of visual objects from brain activity. We analyze both magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and gaze signals from nine subjects who were viewing image collages, a subset of which was relevant to a predetermined task. We report three findings: i) the relevance of an image a subject looks at can be decoded from MEG signals with performance significantly better than chance, ii) fusion of gaze-based and MEG-based classifiers significantly improves the prediction performance compared to using either signal alone, and iii) non-linear classification of the MEG signals using Gaussian process classifiers outperforms linear classification. These findings break new ground for building brain-activity-based interactive image retrieval systems, as well as for systems utilizing feedback both from brain activity and eye movements.

In addition, brain function network (BFN), which possessed characteristics of small-world network, was constructed based on the filter threshold on Network Cost and Spearman correlation coefficient matrixes of wavelet coefficients among the channels. Then, the influence of different task states on decoding parameters was studied and analyzed through parameters of BFNs (standard deviation of average degree, average path length, average clustering coefficient). At last, the decoding parameters of hand movement were singled out according to P value of Kruskal-Wallis. The results showed that EEG low and intermediate frequency bands and the 8 channels combination set have greater contribution to decode hand movement. The paper sheds light on new ideas for choosing decoding parameters of subsequent hand movements.

Although the results currently achievable with automatic sleep staging methods are promising, there is need for improvement, especially given the time-consuming and tedious nature of visual sleep scoring. New method: Here we propose a sleep staging framework that consists of a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classification based on a decision tree approach. The performance of the method was evaluated using polysomnographic data from 15 subjects (electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EGG) and electromyogram (EMG) recordings). The decision tree, or dendrogram, was obtained using a hierarchical clustering technique and a wide range of time and frequency-domain features were extracted. Feature selection was carried out using forward sequential selection and classification was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation. Results: The dendrogram-based SVM (DSVM) achieved mean specificity, sensitivity and overall accuracy of 0.92, 0.74 and 0.88 respectively, compared to expert visual scoring. Restricting DSVM classification to data where both experts' scoring was consistent (76.73% of the data) led to a mean specificity, sensitivity and overall accuracy of 0.94, 0.82 and 0.92 respectively. Comparison with existing methods: The DSVM framework outperforms classification with more standard multi-class "one-against-all" SVM and linear-discriminant analysis. Conclusion: The promising results of the proposed methodology suggest that it may be a valuable alternative to existing automatic methods and that it could accelerate visual scoring by providing a robust starting hypnogram that can be further fine-tuned by expert inspection.

A BCI can decode electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of brain activities, and then send a command or an intent to an external interactive device, such as a wheelchair. The effectiveness of the BCI depends on the performance in decoding the EEG. Usually, the EEG is contaminated by different kinds of artefacts (e.g., electromyogram (EMG), background activity), which leads to a low decoding performance. A number of filtering methods can be utilized to remove or weaken the effects of artefacts, but they generally fail when the EEG contains extreme artefacts. In such cases, the most common approach is to discard the whole data segment containing extreme artefacts. This causes the fatal drawback that the BCI cannot output decoding results during that time. In order to solve this problem, we employ the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to estimate the spectral power from incomplete EEG (after removing only parts contaminated by artefacts), and Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) for learning. The proposed method is evaluated with motor imagery EEG data. The results show that our method can successfully decode incomplete EEG to good effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

But how to extract the imagination feature and classify them to control systems is an important problem. To simplify the complexity of the classification, the power band and a small number of electrodes have been used, but there is still a loss in classification accuracy in the state-of-art approaches. The critical problem is the machine learning art that when the signal into source has property of non-stationary causing the estimation of the population parameter to change over time. In this paper, we analyzed the performance of feature extraction method using several spatial filter such as common average reference (CAR), Laplacian (LAP), common spatial pattern analysis (CSP) and no-spatial filter techniques and feature reduction method using principle component analysis (PCA) based 90% rule variance and leave-one-out correct classification accuracy selection method; where support vector machine is the classifier. The simulation with non-stationary data set from BCI competition III-Iva shows that CAR best performance CSP method in non-stationary data and PCA with leave-one-out CCA could maintain CCA performance and reduced the trading off between training and testing 13.96% compared to not using PCA and 0.46% compared PCA with 90% variance.

BCI is one of these methods with which EEG, input signal, that is used as brain activity. We need to interpret the brain activity correctly by classifying the signal. Eye state classification is a kind of common time-series problem for detecting human cognitive state. In this paper, we propose a Neuro-Fuzzy system that is applicable to eye state classification. Performances of the proposed method and Backpropagation (BP) are evaluated in terms of recognition rates. The classification accuracy can be highly achieved by using the proposed approach with the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer, which also leads types of membership function in fuzzy rules. According to the test results, it is observed that BP gives the average error rates, 3.91%, with 5 neurons in the hidden layer, in which we use the momentum 0.9. It is a quite promising result. On the other hand, we have the best result with 5 fuzzy rules by managing parameters of standard deviations asymmetrically, with which it showed an average recognition rate, 97.02%, using the test data.

Most previous methods were based only on signal-related features derived from the instantaneous frequency and the energies of EEG signals generated from different spectral sub-bands. The proposed features are extracted from the t-f representation of EEG signals which are processed as a textured image using Haralick's texture descriptors. The proposed descriptors are capable to describe visually the epileptic seizure patterns observed in t-f image of EEG signals. The results obtained on real EEG data show that the use of the proposed features improves significantly the performance of the EEG seizure detection and classification by achieving a total classification accuracy up to 99% for 140 EEG segments using one-againt-one SVM classifier.

P300, a component of Event Related Potentials (ERPs), is a widely used feature component of EEG signal for BCI applications. However, single trial analysis is difficult since ERPs such as P300 signals have a very low signal to noise ratio, which bring down the communication rate. And the numerous number of channels needed to record EEG prevents the popularization of BCI applications due to the complexity and high cost of the system. In this paper, a new efficient method, extreme learning machine (ELM), is presented to detect P300 components using a single channel data from a visual stimuli Oddball paradigm experiment. It reaches an average accuracy above 85% and performs better than BPNN and SVM.

The medical need in this field is to reach an early differential diagnosis between subjects affected by mild cognitive impairment (MCI), early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the healthy elderly (CTR) using only the recording and the analysis of few minutes of their EEG. Methods and material: This study analyzed the EEGs of 272 subjects, recorded at Rome's Neurology Unit of the Policlinico Campus Bio-Medico. The EEG recordings were performed using 19 electrodes, in a 0.3-70 Hz bandpass, positioned according to the International 10-20 System. Many powerful learning machines and algorithms have been proposed during the last 20 years to effectively resolve this complex problem, resulting in different and interesting outcomes. Among these algorithms, a new artificial adaptive system, named implicit function as squashing time (I-FAST), is able to diagnose, with high accuracy, a few minutes of the subject's EEG track; whether it manifests an AD, MCI or CTR condition. An updating of this system, carried out by adding a new algorithm, named multi scale ranked organizing maps (MS-ROM), to the I-FAST system, is presented, in order to classify with greater accuracy the unprocessed EEG's of AD, MCI and control subjects. Results: The proposed system has been measured on three independent pattern recognition tasks from unprocessed EEG tracks of a sample of AD subjects, MCI subjects and CTR: (a) AD compared with CTR; (b) AD compared with MCI; (c) CTR compared with MCI. While the values of accuracy of the previous system in distinguishing between AD and MCI were around 92%, the new proposed system reaches values between 94% and 98%. Similarly, the overall accuracy with best artificial neural networks (ANNs) is 98.25% for the distinguishing between CTR and MCI. Conclusions: This new version of I-FAST makes different steps forward: (a) avoidance of pre-processing phase and filtering procedure of EEG data, being the algorithm able to directly process an unprocessed EEG; (b) noise elimination, through the use of a training variant with input selection and testing system, based on naive Bayes classifier; (c) a more robust classification phase, showing the stability of results on nine well known learning machine algorithms; (d) extraction of spatial invariants of an EEG signal using, in addition to the unsupervised ANN, the principal component analysis and the multi scale entropy, together with the MS-ROM; a more accurate performance in this specific task.

The aim of this paper is to find optimal signal processing methods and machine learning algorithms to achieve online sleep staging on the basis of a single EEG signal. The classification performance obtained using six different EEG signals and various signal processing feature sets is compared using the kappa statistic which has very recently become popular in sleep staging research. A variable duration of the EEG segment (or epoch) to decide on the sleep stage is also analyzed. Spectral-domain, time-domain, linear, and nonlinear features are compared in terms of performance and two types of machine learning approaches (random forests and support vector machines) are assessed. We have determined that frontal EEG signals, with spectral linear features, epoch durations between 18 and 30 seconds, and a random forest classifier lead to optimal classification performance while ensuring real-time online operation.

Different machine learning classifiers including k-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, naive Bayes, logistic regression, and neural networks are explored with the goal of maximizing detection accuracy while minimizing power, area, and latency. The input to each machine learning classifier is a 198 feature vector containing 9 features for each of the 22 EEG channels obtained over 1-second windows. All classifiers were able to obtain F1 scores over 80% and onset sensitivity of 100% when tested on 10 patients. Among five different classifiers that were explored, logistic regression (LR) proved to have minimum hardware complexity while providing average F-1 score of 91%. Both ASIC and FPGA implementations of logistic regression are presented and show the smallest area, power consumption, and the lowest latency when compared to the previous work.

However, classifying the EEG signals is not a trivial task due to their non-stationary characteristics. In this paper, we introduce and utilize incremental quantum particle swarm optimization (IQPSO) algorithm for incremental classification of EEG data stream. IQPSO builds the classification model as a set of explicit rules which benefits from semantic symbolic knowledge representation and enhanced comprehensibility. We compared the performance of IQPSO against ten other classifiers on two EEG datasets. The results suggest that IQPSO outperforms other classifiers in terms of classification accuracy, precision and recall.

Previous electroencephalography (EEG) studies of speech production have identified a slow wave negativity that occurs as early as 2 seconds prior to articulation, known as the readiness potential (RP). This EEG potential is commonly described as having two phases, an early slow component and a late fast component. In our study, we collected RPs from 15 subjects and fit a linear spline with four fixed knots and their locations as free parameters. The result was a piece wise linear approximation to the subject RPs from which it was possible to identify the onset and termination of both the slow and fast components, as well as their slopes. In addition, we used the collected RPs to train an adaptive filter neural decoding algorithm to predict occurrences of RPs front trial-based epochs of imagined speech and motor movements for use in a brain-computer interface for speech communication. The initial spline analysis will help to determine the contribution of each RP phase to the representations of intended speech-motor behavior, reducing the complexity of the adaptive filter for more efficient use in real-time.

Global synchronization index (GFS), a measure known to reflect human cognitive process, was evaluated to quantify the global synchronization of multichannel EEG data recorded from a group of participants while they were watching two short video clips. The two video clips were about 5-min long each and designed to respectively evoke happy and fearful emotions. Other participants were asked to select two most impressive scenes in each clip, and the questionnaire results were then compared to the grand averaged GFS waveforms. Our results showed that beta-band GFS value was decreased when people experienced high emotional arousal regardless of the types of emotional stimuli, suggesting that the GFS measure might be used as a new index to track emotional changes during video watching and would be potentially used for evaluating movies, TV commercials, and other broadcast products.

In this research work, as an initial step towards the development of an intelligent navigation system with a communication aid, a simple EEG data capturing procedure has been introduced using visually evoked potentials. A simple, visually evoked brain wave data acquisition protocol has been developed with seven basic tasks; that can be used for navigating a robot chair and also for communications using the oddball paradigm. In this study, ten participants were participated in the data acquisition protocol. The proposed system records the 8-channel electroencephalography signal while the subject was perceiving the seven different visual tasks. The recorded brain wave signals are pre-processed to remove the interference waveforms and segmented into six frequency bands signals, i.e. Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma1-1 and Gamma-2. The segmented frequency band signals are used to extract the features using cross correlation algorithm extracted over two consecutive frames. Further, statistical features such as Maximum, Minimum, Standard Deviation and Mean features are formed as features set and used to classify using Online Sequential - Extreme Learning Machine. Further, the classification models are compared and from the results it is observed that mean feature set hits the mean maximum testing accuracy of 85.54 % and Standard deviation feature set hits the mean minimum classification accuracy of 73.47 %.

Another common problem in BCI systems is the situation where the labeled data are scarce. In this study, we take a semi-supervised learning perspective and propose solving both types of problems by updating the BCI system with labels obtained from the outputs of the classifier. To test the approach, data from motor imagery BCI system are used. Attributes extracted from EEG signals are classified with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). With respect to the static classifiers, accuracy was improved approximately 4% using the proposed adaptation approach in the case of a training dataset. Even though the difference between the performance of static and adaptive classifiers decreases as the size of training data increases, the accuracy of our proposed adaptive classifier remains higher. The proposed approach has also improved the performance of a BCI system around 4% in the case of non-stationary signals as well.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are electrical signals collected from the scalp. They are frequently used in braincomputer interaction. However, EEG signals which change over time are highly non-stationary. One major challenge in current BCI research is how to extract features of time-varying EEG signals and classify the signals as accurately as possible. An effective BCI should be robust against and adaptive to the dynamic variations of brain activities. Adaptive learning in a BCI system, a rapidly developing application of machine learning, would be an effective approach to conquer the challenge. This paper reviews representative adaptive feature extraction and classification methods for EEG-based BCIs and further discusses some important open problems which can hopefully be useful to promote the research of the BCIs.

Due to its infancy, there are still no standard approaches for meaningful features and classifiers for single trial analysis of fNIRS. Most studies are limited to established classifiers from EEG-based BCIs and very simple features. The feasibility of more complex and powerful classification approaches like Deep Neural Networks has, to the best of our knowledge, not been investigated for fNIRS based BCI. These networks have recently become increasingly popular, as they outperformed conventional machine learning methods for a variety of tasks, due in part to advances in training methods for neural networks. In this paper, we show how Deep Neural Networks can be used to classify brain activation patterns measured by fNIRS and compare them with previously used methods.

Successful application of CSP depends on the filter band selection to a large degree. However, the most proper band is typically subject-specific and can hardly be determined manually. New method: This study proposes a sparse filter band common spatial pattern (SFBCSP) for optimizing the spatial patterns. SFBCSP estimates CSP features on multiple signals that are filtered from raw EEG data at a set of overlapping bands. The filter bands that result in significant CSP features are then selected in a supervised way by exploiting sparse regression. A support vector machine (SVM) is implemented on the selected features for MI classification. Results: Two public EEG datasets (BCI Competition III dataset IVa and BCI Competition IV lib) are used to validate the proposed SFBCSP method. Experimental results demonstrate that SFBCSP help improve the classification performance of MI.

Analyzing epileptogenic brain connectivity networks using clinical EEG data	PROCEEDINGS 2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOMEDICINE	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine-BIBM		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine - Medical Informatics and Decision Making	NOV 09-12, 2015	Washington, DC	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Natl Sci Fdn		brain network; graph theory; epilepsy; EEG; feature extraction and classification	GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; SMALL-WORLD; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ORGANIZATION	Epileptogenic brain connectivity networks are altered compared to normal ones. Here, we have investigated the properties of epileptogenic networks by applying graph theoretical, statistical and machine learning approaches to the resting state electroencephalography (EEG) recordings obtained from 30 normal volunteers and 51 patients suffering from generalized epilepsy. In the case of epileptic patients, we have found that the brain networks behave like random networks. There is some loss in node connectivity. Hub nodes are more affected during epilepsy. Hence, the epileptogenic networks show less clustering coefficient than normal ones. In addition, we have identified 11 specific regions of brains and ten most significant connections among them as an epileptogenic signature by feature extraction. The ten most significant features are used to classify 81 sample data sets into two classes, i. e., epileptogenic and normal, with 79.01 % accuracy. The highly probable eleven regions of human brain according to the positions of electrodes and connections among them may lead to a progress in the clinical treatment of epileptic patients.

The aim of this paper is to propose an automatic slow wave sleep (SWS) detection method that uses only one channel of the electroencephalography (EEG) signal. New Method: The proposed approach distinguishes itself from previous automatic sleep staging methods by using three specially designed feature groups. The first feature group characterizes the waveform pattern of the EEG signal. The remaining two feature groups are developed to resolve the difficulties caused by interpersonal EEG signal differences. Results and comparison with existing methods: The proposed approach was tested with 1,003 subjects, and the SWS detection results show kappa coefficient at 0.66, an accuracy level of 0.973, a sensitivity score of 0.644 and a positive predictive value of 0.709. By excluding sleep apnea patients and persons whose age is older than 55, the SWS detection results improved to kappa coefficient, 0.76; accuracy, 0.963; sensitivity, 0.758; and positive predictive value, 0.812. Conclusions: With newly developed signal features, this study proposed and tested a single-channel EEG-based SWS detection method. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was demonstrated by applying it to detect the SWS of 1003 subjects. Our test results show that a low SWS ratio and sleep apnea can degrade the performance of SWS detection. The results also show that a large and accurately staged sleep dataset is of great importance when developing automatic sleep staging methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With modern high-density EMG sensor technology, it is possible to capture the rich spectrospatial structure of the myoelectric activity. We hypothesize that multi-way machine learning methods can efficiently utilize this structure in classification as well as reveal interesting patterns in it. To this end, we investigate the suitability of existing three-way classification methods to EMG-based hand movement classification in spectrospatial domain, as well as extend these methods by sparsification and regularization. We propose to use Fourier-domain independent component analysis as preprocessing to improve classification and interpretability of the results. In high-density EMG experiments on hand movements across 10 subjects, three-way classification yielded higher average performance compared with state-of-the art classification based on temporal features, suggesting that the three-way analysis approach can efficiently utilize detailed spectrospatial information of high-density EMG. Phase and amplitude patterns of features selected by the classifier in finger-movement data were found to be consistent with known physiology. Thus, our approach can accurately resolve hand and finger movements on the basis of detailed spectrospatial information, and at the same time allows for physiological interpretation of the results.

This study was conducted with a dual purpose: to test the feasibility of using a combined electroencephalogram/functional near-infrared spectroscopy (EEG-fNIRS) SMR-based brain switch in patients with tetraplegia, and to examine the performance difference between motor imagery and motor attempt for this user group. A general improvement was found when using both EEG and fNIRS features for classification as compared to using the single-modality EEG classifier, with average classification rates of 79% for attempted movement and 70% for imagined movement. For the control group, rates of 87% and 79% were obtained, respectively, where the "attempted movement" condition was replaced with "actual movement." A combined EEG-fNIRS system might be especially beneficial for users who lack sufficient control of current EEG-based brain switches. The average classification performance in the patient group for attempted movement was significantly higher than for imagined movement using the EEG-only as well as the combined classifier, arguing for the case of a paradigm shift in current brain switch research.

Session-to-session nonstationarity is inherent in brain-computer interfaces based on electroencephalography. The objective of this paper is to quantify the mismatch between the training model and test data caused by nonstationarity and to adapt the model towards minimizing the mismatch. Approach. We employ a tensor model to estimate the mismatch in a semi-supervised manner, and the estimate is regularized in the discriminative objective function. Main results. The performance of the proposed adaptation method was evaluated on a dataset recorded from 16 subjects performing motor imagery tasks on different days. The classification results validated the advantage of the proposed method in comparison with other regularization-based or spatial filter adaptation approaches. Experimental results also showed that there is a significant correlation between the quantified mismatch and the classification accuracy. Significance. The proposed method approached the nonstationarity issue from the perspective of data-model mismatch, which is more direct than data variation measurement. The results also demonstrated that the proposed method is effective in enhancing the performance of the feature extraction model.

The proposed method applies the relationship between EEG activity and the Egogram. The EEG senses a single point and records readings by means of a dry-type. sensor and a number of electrodes. The EEG analysis adapts the feature mining and the clustering on EEG patterns using a self-organizing map (SOM). EEG activity of the prefrontal cortex displays individual difference. To take the individual difference into account, we construct a feature vector for input modality of the SOM. The input vector for the SOM consists of the extracted EEG feature vector and a human character vector, which is the human character quantified through the ego analysis using psychological testing. In preprocessing, we extract the EEG feature vector by calculating the time average on each frequency band: 0, low-,0, and high-,0. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform experiments using real EEG data. These results show that the accuracy rate of the EEG pattern classification is higher than it was before improvement of the input vector.

Teaching brain-machine interfaces as an alternative paradigm to neuroprosthetics control	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ERROR-RELATED POTENTIALS; COMPUTER INTERFACE; EEG; PERFORMANCE; PEOPLE; CORTEX; GRASP	Brain-machine interfaces (BMI) usually decode movement parameters from cortical activity to control neuroprostheses. This requires subjects to learn to modulate their brain activity to convey all necessary information, thus imposing natural limits on the complexity of tasks that can be performed. Here we demonstrate an alternative and complementary BMI paradigm that overcomes that limitation by decoding cognitive brain signals associated with monitoring processes relevant for achieving goals. In our approach the neuroprosthesis executes actions that the subject evaluates as erroneous or correct, and exploits the brain correlates of this assessment to learn suitable motor behaviours. Results show that, after a short user's training period, this teaching BMI paradigm operated three different neuroprostheses and generalized across several targets. Our results further support that these error-related signals reflect a task-independent monitoring mechanism in the brain, making this teaching paradigm scalable. We anticipate this BMI approach to become a key component of any neuroprosthesis that mimics natural motor control as it enables continuous adaptation in the absence of explicit information about goals. Furthermore, our paradigm can seamlessly incorporate other cognitive signals and conventional neuroprosthetic approaches, invasive or non-invasive, to enlarge the range and complexity of tasks that can be accomplished.

Comparison of multiple EEG energy algorithms is presented for solving a 4-class motor imagery BCI classification problem. Furthermore, multiple feature vector generation techniques are employed into analysis. The effectiveness of CSP (common spatial pattern) filtering method in preprocessing step is shown. Channel difference feature extraction method is presented. It is discussed that key aim in today's EEG signal analysis should be dedicated to finding more accurate techniques for determining better quality features. Initial tests prove that static feature extraction methods are not optimal and adaptive algorithms are required to overcome subject specific EEG signal variations. Further work and new dynamic feature extraction methods are required to solve the problem.

The analyzed sample includes 117 adults (67 ADHD, 50 controls). The measurements are taken for four different conditions: two resting conditions (eyes open and eyes closed) and two neuropsychological tasks (visual continuous performance test and emotional continuous performance test). We divide the sample into four data sets, one for each condition. Each data set is used for training of four different support vector machine classifiers, while the output of classifiers is combined using logical expression derived from the Karnaugh map. The results show that this approach improves the discrimination between ADHD and control groups, as well as between ADHD subtypes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Electroencephalography (EEG) can be utilized to detect electrical activity in the brain during the execution of certain mental tasks, which can be used as a control signal for an interface. Automatic interpretation of BCI control signals from multichannel EEG data is generally done by application of a classification algorithm from a particular machine learning paradigm. Classification accuracy and overall BCI performance depends on a feature extraction method, which is used to represent the EEG data according to the characteristic features of a chosen BCI control signal. Certain types of control signals used in BCI can be characterized by their spatial properties. Source localization methods can be used to localize electrically active areas of the user's brain and, hence, represent the EEG signal by its spatial features. This chapter is dedicated to the essential theory related to electromagnetic source localization problem with a particular focus on the family of sparse localization approaches. First we discuss general electromagnetic head modelling methods used to solve the EEG forward problem. Approaches to inverse problem solving, anatomical regularization and application of source localization to BCI are described later in the chapter. Finally we will discuss sparse source localization methods and present relevant simulation results.

J	Lin, YP; Yang, YH; Jung, TP				Lin, Yuan-Pin; Yang, Yi-Hsuan; Jung, Tzyy-Ping			Fusion of electroencephalographic dynamics and musical contents for estimating emotional responses in music listening	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; emotion classification; affective brain-computer interface; music signal processing; music listening	EEG; RECOGNITION; COMMUNICATION; PERCEPTION; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; RECORDINGS; ASYMMETRY; PLEASANT; VALENCE	Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion classification during music listening has gained increasing attention nowadays due to its promise of potential applications such as musical affective brain-computer interface (ABCI), neuromarketing, music therapy, and implicit multimedia tagging and triggering. However, music is an ecologically valid and complex stimulus that conveys certain emotions to listeners through compositions of musical elements. Using solely EEG signals to distinguish emotions remained challenging. This study aimed to assess the applicability of a multimodal approach by leveraging the EEG dynamics and acoustic characteristics of musical contents for the classification of emotional valence and arousal. To this end, this study adopted machine-learning methods to systematically elucidate the roles of the EEG and music modalities in the emotion modeling. The empirical results suggested that when whole-head EEG signals were available, the inclusion of musical contents did not improve the classification performance. The obtained performance of 74 similar to 76% using solely EEG modality was statistically comparable to that using the multimodality approach. However, if EEG dynamics were only available from a small set of electrodes (likely the case in real-life applications), the music modality would play a complementary role and augment the EEG results from around 61-67% in valence classification and from around 58-67% in arousal classification. The musical timber appeared to replace less-discriminative EEG features and led to improvements in both valence and arousal classification, whereas musical loudness was contributed specifically to the arousal classification. The present study not only provided principles for constructing an EEG-based multimodal approach, but also revealed the fundamental insights into the interplay of the brain activity and musical contents in emotion modeling.

The Neural Dynamics of Face Detection in the Wild Revealed by MVPA	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							TRIAL EEG DYNAMICS; TIME-COURSE; SINGLE-TRIAL; HUMAN BRAIN; OBJECT; N170; PERCEPTION; ERP; SPEED; INFORMATION	Previous magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography (M/EEG) studies have suggested that face processing is extremely rapid, indeed faster than any other object category. Most studies, however, have been performed using centered, cropped stimuli presented on a blank background resulting in artificially low interstimulus variability. In contrast, the aim of the present study was to assess the underlying temporal dynamics of face detection presented in complex natural scenes. We recorded EEG activity while participants performed a rapid go/no-go categorization task in which they had to detect the presence of a human face. Subjects performed at ceiling (94.8% accuracy), and traditional event-related potential analyses revealed only modest modulations of the two main components classically associated with face processing (P100 and N170). A multivariate pattern analysis conducted across all EEG channels revealed that face category could, however, be readout very early, under 100 ms poststimulus onset. Decoding was linked to reaction time as early as 125 ms. Decoding accuracy did not increase monotonically; we report an increase during an initial 95-140 ms period followed by a plateau similar to 140 -185 ms-perhaps reflecting a transitory stabilization of the face information available-and a strong increase afterward. Further analyses conducted on individual images confirmed these phases, further suggesting that decoding accuracy may be initially driven by low-level stimulus properties. Such latencies appear to be surprisingly short given the complexity of the natural scenes and the large intraclass variability of the face stimuli used, suggesting that the visual system is highly optimized for the processing of natural scenes.

Most anomalies in brain functioning manifest with their signature characteristics in EEG pattern. Epileptic seizure, which is a brain abnormality well-studied through EEG analysis, is an abnormal harmonious neural activity in the brain characterized by the presence of spikes in EEG. An automated detection of epileptic seizures proves useful to Neurologists in the diagnosis of epileptic patients. This work contributes towards the study of efficacy evaluation of statistical features towards classification of EEG data as Ictal, Inter-Ictal and Normal. The statistical features considered are energy, entropy, median absolute deviation, interquartile range, skewness and kurtosis. The features extracted from a real dataset of 500 time series, comprising of 100 Ictal, 200 Inter-Ictal and 200 Normal are given to classifiers such as Support Vector Machine(SVM), Fuzzy k-Nearest Neighbor (Fuzzy k-NN), k-Nearest Neighbor(k-NN) and Naive Bayes for three class classification. Each of the features were used separately for classification to determine their individual efficacies. Alongside, the popular feature ranking method 'ReliefF' has been used to rank the features. Both the evaluations resulted in "entropy" being ranked as the feature with maximum efficacy.

A Novel Experimental and Analytical Approach to the Multimodal Neural Decoding of Intent During Social Interaction in Freely-behaving Human Infants	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Behavior; Issue 104; Neuroscience; neural decoding; neural classification; neural signal processing; EEG; mobile brain imaging; behavior; developmental psychology; infant; imitation; brain; inertial measurement units	EEG	Understanding typical and atypical development remains one of the fundamental questions in developmental human neuroscience. Traditionally, experimental paradigms and analysis tools have been limited to constrained laboratory tasks and contexts due to technical limitations imposed by the available set of measuring and analysis techniques and the age of the subjects. These limitations severely limit the study of developmental neural dynamics and associated neural networks engaged in cognition, perception and action in infants performing "in action and in context". This protocol presents a novel approach to study infants and young children as they freely organize their own behavior, and its consequences in a complex, partly unpredictable and highly dynamic environment. The proposed methodology integrates synchronized high-density active scalp electroencephalography (EEG), inertial measurement units (IMUs), video recording and behavioral analysis to capture brain activity and movement non-invasively in freely-behaving infants. This setup allows for the study of neural network dynamics in the developing brain, in action and context, as these networks are recruited during goal-oriented, exploration and social interaction tasks.

This casts doubt on the validity of group-statistics-based approaches to understand age-related changes on cognitive and neural levels. Recent progress in brain-computer interface research demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques to derive reliable person-specific models, representing brain behavior mappings. The present study now proposes a supervised learning approach to derive person-specific models for the identification and quantification of interindividual differences in oscillatory EEG responses related to working memory selection and maintenance mechanisms in a heterogeneous lifespan sample. EEG data were used to discriminate different levels of working memory load and the focus of visual attention. We demonstrate that our approach leads to person-specific models with better discrimination performance compared to classical person-nonspecific models. We show how these models can be interpreted both on an individual as well as on a group level. One of the key findings is that, with regard to the time dimension, the between-person variance of the obtained person-specific models is smaller in older than in younger adults. This is contrary to what we expected because of increased behavioral and neuronal heterogeneity in older adults. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SIMULATOR PERFORMANCE; SLEEP; DROWSINESS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; PREDICTION; ALERTNESS; AWARENESS; ELECTRODE; LEVEL; POWER	Brain activity associated with attention sustained on the task of safe driving has received considerable attention recently in many neurophysiological studies. Those investigations have also accurately estimated shifts in drivers' levels of arousal, fatigue, and vigilance, as evidenced by variations in their task performance, by evaluating electroencephalographic (EEG) changes. However, monitoring the neurophysiological activities of automobile drivers poses a major measurement challenge when using a laboratory-oriented biosensor technology. This work presents a novel dry EEG sensor based mobile wireless EEG system (referred to herein as Mindo) to monitor in real time a driver's vigilance status in order to link the fluctuation of driving performance with changes in brain activities. The proposed Mindo system incorporates the use of a wireless and wearable EEG device to record EEG signals from hairy regions of the driver conveniently. Additionally, the proposed system can process EEG recordings and translate them into the vigilance level. The study compares the system performance between different regression models. Moreover, the proposed system is implemented using JAVA programming language as a mobile application for online analysis. A case study involving 15 study participants assigned a 90 min sustained-attention driving task in an immersive virtual driving environment demonstrates the reliability of the proposed system. Consistent with previous studies, power spectral analysis results confirm that the EEG activities correlate well with the variations in vigilance. Furthermore, the proposed system demonstrated the feasibility of predicting the driver's vigilance in real time.

Although Common spatial pattern (CSP) is a mostly used algorithm for classification of EEG in brain-computer interface (BCI), which has poor frequency selectivity. To address this problem, a constant-bandwidth Butterworth filters bank was utilized for frequency decomposition. Then, our novel feature selection methodology was used for new CSP features ranking and selection. We compare our method with the existing approaches, the results on 4 subjects showed that the new method outperforms the other two existing approaches based on conventional CSP and Common Spatio-Spectral Pattern (CSSP), the proposed algorithm yielded lowest test error rate of 2.2+/-1.8% in subject 1 and will be a up-and-coming signal processing tool for developing BCI and improving the efficiency of the classification method in low-resolution EEG input and small-dataset conditions.

Our objective is to develop a cognitive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) able to monitor visual working memory load in real-time. A system with these properties would eventually have different applications, such as training, rehabilitation, or safety while operating dangerous machinery. The BCI performances were evaluated using cross-validation. With an appropriately chosen classification threshold, it is possible to detect high working memory load with a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 72%. However, it is well known that some subjects are BCI illiterate, meaning that up to 30% of the users have too high signal variability to use EEG-based BCI systems. If we analyse each subject individually, it is possible to detect high working memory load with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 81% (accuracy = 81%) for a typical good subject. Changes due to visual working memory load were observed in frontal, parietal, and occipital regions.

For instance, the online decoding of intention of motion of a limb from pre-movement EEG correlates is being used to convert passive rehabilitation strategies into active ones mediated by robotics. As early stages of upper limb motor rehabilitation usually focus on analytic single-joint mobilizations, this paper investigates the feasibility of building BMI decoders for these specific types of movements. Methods: Two different experiments were performed within this study. For the first one, six healthy subjects performed seven self-initiated upper-limb analytic movements, involving from proximal to distal articulations. For the second experiment, three spinal cord injury patients performed two of the previously studied movements with their healthy elbow and paralyzed wrist. In both cases EEG neural correlates such as the event-related desynchronization (ERD) and movement related cortical potentials (MRCP) were analyzed, as well as the accuracies of continuous decoders built using the pre-movement features of these correlates (i.e., the intention of motion was decoded before movement onset). Results: The studied movements could be decoded in both healthy subjects and patients. For healthy subjects there were significant differences in the EEG correlates and decoding accuracies, dependent on the moving joint. Percentages of correctly anticipated trials ranged from 75% to 40% (with chance level being around 20%), with better performances for proximal than for distal movements. For the movements studied for the SCI patients the accuracies were similar to the ones of the healthy subjects. Conclusions: This paper shows how it is possible to build continuous decoders to detect movement intention from EEG correlates for seven different upper-limb analytic movements. Furthermore we report differences in accuracies among movements, which might have an impact on the design of the rehabilitation technologies that will integrate this new type of information. The applicability of the decoders was shown in a clinical population, with similar performances between healthy subjects and patients.

Any BCI system consists of three modules and they are signal recorder, signal preprocessor and classifier. Development /Selection of efficient classifiers are a challenging task in this domain. The key work addressed in this paper is the classification of EEG signals measured under planning and relaxed state using advanced machine learning classifiers. Planning relax dataset is a benchmark data and it is obtained from UCI (University of California Irvine) machine learning repository. FC-FLC is a recently developed fast learning complex valued classifier and it is used for the EEG signal classification task. Complex valued classifier (FC-FLC) performs better than all the real valued classifiers as well as few fuzzy classifiers taken for comparison from the literature. The improvement is due to the use of Gd (gudermannian) activation function in the hidden layer of the network and the tuning free algorithm.

Brain is a control center for almost all functions of body. As EEG originates from brain, it contains various components related to cognitive activities of brain. Hence, it also contains information regarding the motor functions associated with movement of the body. EEG is commonly recorded for purposes of diagnosis and research associated with diseases like epilepsy, seizures, sleep disorders etc. But apart from these applications it can also be used to map various motor movements being thought of. This may lead to development of landmark devices in the field of rehabilitation of physically challenged individuals. Here we intend to extract the features and classify the directions using EEG. At initial stage it is desired to classify two movements i.e. left and right, but the method can be extended for the classification of other directions as well. In present scenario the most suitable methods for classification problems can be developed using machine learning algorithms. In this work the features like probability co efficient, PSE (power spectral entropy) and STFT (Short Time Fourier Transform) are extracted and evaluated for their efficiency in classification. Radial Basis Function is used for classifying these features. The study shows probability co efficient and STFT have yielded about 60% accuracy in classifying raw EEG signals proving them advantageous over power spectral entropy.

The resting electroencephalogram (EEG) provides non-invasive spectral markers of brain function and development. Their accuracy as ADHD markers is increasingly questioned but may improve with pattern classification. Methods: This study provides an integrated analysis of ADHD and developmental effects in children and adults using regression analysis and support vector machine classification of spectral resting (eyes-closed) EEG biomarkers in order to clarify their diagnostic value. Results: ADHD effects on EEG strongly depend on age and frequency. We observed typical non-linear developmental decreases in delta and theta power for both ADHD and control groups. However, for ADHD adults we found a slowing in alpha frequency combined with a higher power in alpha-1 (8-10 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz). Support vector machine classification of ADHD adults versus controls yielded a notable cross validated sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 83% using power and central frequency from all frequency bands. ADHD children were not classified convincingly with these markers. Conclusions: Resting state electrophysiology is altered in ADHD, and these electrophysiological impairments persist into adulthood. Significance: Spectral biomarkers may have both diagnostic and prognostic value. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Tang, Q; Wang, J; Wang, HX				Tang, Qin; Wang, Jing; Wang, Haixian			L1-norm based discriminative spatial pattern for single-trial EEG classification	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Spatial filtering; EEG; L1-norm; Discriminative spatial pattern (DSP)	BCI COMPETITION 2003; MOVEMENT; ALGORITHM; FILTERS; EMG	Spatial filtering provides an efficient method for single-trial EEG classification and has been widely used in EEG-based brain computer interfaces. However, scalp-recorded EEG signals are usually very noisy since they could be contaminated by various outliers, such as EOG or EMG artifacts. The outliers may seriously distort the performance of spatial filters. To solve this problem, we propose a new robust spatial filtering algorithm, namely DSP-L1, which is L1-norm based discriminative spatial pattern (DSP). Compared with the conventional DSP, DSP-L1 takes advantage of the robust L1-norm modeling that expects to perform better in suppressing the effect of outliers. Computationally, an iterative approach is introduced to find the spatial filters of DSP-L1. Experimental results on two EEG data sets of motor movements demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, we develop an approach for discriminating between PNES and epilepsy using the common spatial pattern extracted from the brain network topology (SPN). The study reveals that 92% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 80% specificity were reached for the classification between PNES and focal epilepsy. The newly developed SPN of resting EEG may be a promising tool to mine implicit information that can be used to differentiate PNES from epilepsy.

To that end, isotonic flexion/extension knee movements will be analyzed. Particularly, the decoding performance of healthy and incomplete spinal cord injured subjects will be assessed to determine the behavior of this methodology with motor disabled people. When studying cortical activity during walking, the appearance of muscular artifacts severely influences the EEG signals recorded. The analysis of single joint movements should decrease the noise provoked by the gait process itself. Additionally, different time windows prior to the decoded angle will be assessed to obtain a more reliable decoder. The results show that decoding performance is significantly above chance for most of the subjects (both healthy and disabled) and suggests that meaningful information of the movement planning starts around 2.5 seconds prior to the decoded angle.

Decoding auditory attention to instruments in polyphonic music using single-trial EEG classification	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface; EEG; auditory; music; attention; oddball paradigm; P300	P300 SPELLING SYSTEM; BRAIN; PERCEPTION; IMAGERY	Objective. Polyphonic music (music consisting of several instruments playing in parallel) is an intuitive way of embedding multiple information streams. The different instruments in a musical piece form concurrent information streams that seamlessly integrate into a coherent and hedonistically appealing entity. Here, we explore polyphonic music as a novel stimulation approach for use in a brain-computer interface. Approach. In a multi-streamed oddball experiment, we had participants shift selective attention to one out of three different instruments in music audio clips. Each instrument formed an oddball stream with its own specific standard stimuli (a repetitive musical pattern) and oddballs (deviating musical pattern). Main results. Contrasting attended versus unattended instruments, ERP analysis shows subject-and instrument-specific responses including P300 and early auditory components. The attended instrument can be classified offline with a mean accuracy of 91% across 11 participants. Significance. This is a proof of concept that attention paid to a particular instrument in polyphonic music can be inferred from ongoing EEG, a finding that is potentially relevant for both brain-computer interface and music research.

This corpus consists of over 25,000 EEG studies, and includes a neurologist's interpretation of the test, a brief patient medical history and demographic information about the patient such as gender and age. For the first time, there is a sufficient amount of data to support the application of state of the art machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we present pilot results of experiments on the prediction of some basic attributes of an EEG from the raw EEG signal data using a 3,762 session subset of the corpus. Standard machine learning approaches are shown to be capable of predicting commonly occurring events from simple features with high accuracy on closed-loop testing, and can deliver error rates below 50% on a 6-way open set classification problem. This is very promising performance since commercial technology fails on this data.

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			A new electroencephalogram classification with reduced recording time in asphyxiated term infants	BRAIN & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Classification; Electroencephalogram; Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy; Prediction; Term infant	HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; AMPLITUDE-INTEGRATED ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION; HYPOTHERMIA; EEG; NEWBORNS	Background and objectives: Conventional electroencephalogram (cEEG) is a reliable predictor of outcome in term infants with hypmdc ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Early therapeutic hypothermia initiated within 6 h after birth is a beneficial treatment in these infants. However, a classification system with reduced cEEG recording time to determine early intervention has not been reported. The aim of this study is to propose a new classification of depression on cEEG with reduced recording time in infants with HIE and to examine the correlation between the classification and short-term outcome. Patients and methods: We retrospectively investigated 20 term infants with HIE in whom cEEG was performed within 12 h after birth, and deaths or outcomes at 18 months of age were assessed. We determined grades 0-3 EEG depression in each 10-min epoch based on the most common EEG patterns of each 20 s epoch defined by our criteria. Results: Eighteen infants could be assessed by depression grade. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient Rs between the maximum depression grade in 10-min epochs and three-grade outcomes was 0.68 (P = 0.002), and that between the minimum one and outcomes was 0.66 (P = 0.003). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the maximum and minimum depression grades for predicting abnormal outcome were 0.885 and 0.869, respectively. Conclusions: We demonstrated a new cEEG depression classification with a recording time of at least 10 min in term infants with HIE and a good correlation with short-term outcome.

Motor control BCI is a category of BCI that analyzes neural activity recorded over sensory motor area to classify or decode intended motor tasks. For a BCI system, it is desired to have defined and independent output control commands. Decoding movement trajectory parameters such as instantaneous position, speed coordinates from non-invasive brain recordings can thus be a key contribution in motor control BCI applications. In this study, we use Multiple Linear Regressor to estimate the hand movement trajectory from spectrally localized multi-sensor EEG. The algorithm is validated using data collected from subjects as they perform 2-dimensional center-out hand movement towards pre-defined targets at varying speeds. The spatio-temporal variations in motor activity based neural activation patterns using metrics derived from MLR estimator is investigated. The contribution of the predictors to the regression equation and decoding performance at various stages of movement are also studied. An average correlation of 0.63 (p<0.005) between recorded and estimated trajectory is obtained using the method. The temporally varying involvement of motor, pre-motor and parietal areas; movement task dependent activations and time-varying sensor contribution in reconstruction are further demonstrated.

Since EEG signals are non-stationary and present evident dynamic characteristics, conventional linear approaches are not highly successful in recognition of drowsy level. Furthermore, previous methods cannot produce satisfying results without considering the basic rhythms underlying the raw signals. To address these drawbacks, we propose a system for drowsiness detection using physiological signals that present four advantages: (1) decomposing EEG signals into wavelet sub-bands to extract more evident information beyond raw signals, (2) extraction and fusion of nonlinear features from EEG sub-bands, (3) fusion the information from EEGs and eyelid movements, (4) employing efficient extremely learning machine for status classification. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves not only a high detection accuracy but also a very fast computation speed. The proposed algorithm can be further developed into the monitoring and warning systems to prevent the accumulation of mental fatigue and declines of work efficiency in many environments such as vehicular driving, aviation, navigation and medical service.

FBCSP algorithm allows extracting features and dealing with subject variability by automatic selection of frequency bands. Performing random forest in the classification avoid the use of feature selection step, since RF combine a bagging (bootstrap aggregation) and a random selection of features.

The way to represent such brain data and the methods adopted to perform computations on them are discussed in this paper. EEG (Electroencephalography) and fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) are two widely employed methods of representing brain data. The processing may involve a single persons brain data or the one collected from many subjects. When a huge amount of data is involved, mining essential information from it and training classifiers to correctly predict the type of new data are important steps. This paper presents the work of the authors in pre-processing and analysing brain data through data mining techniques. Feature Selection has been utilized to mine important brain features and classification revealed the Nearest-Neighbour algorithm to be a good classifier of brain data.

In this paper, a novel machine learning (ML) scheme was presented to discriminate the MDD patients and healthy controls. The proposed method inherently involved feature extraction, selection, classification and validation. The EEG data acquisition involved eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) conditions. At feature extraction stage, the de-trended fluctuation analysis (DFA) was performed, based on the EEG data, to achieve scaling exponents. The DFA was performed to analyzes the presence or absence of long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) in the recorded EEG data. The scaling exponents were used as input features to our proposed system. At feature selection stage, 3 different techniques were used for comparison purposes. Logistic regression (LR) classifier was employed. The method was validated by a 10-fold cross-validation. As results, we have observed that the effect of 3 different reference montages on the computed features. The proposed method employed 3 different types of feature selection techniques for comparison purposes as well. The results show that the DFA analysis performed better in LE data compared with the IR and AR data. In addition, during Wilcoxon ranking, the AR performed better than LE and IR. Based on the results, it was concluded that the DFA provided useful information to discriminate the MDD patients and with further validation can be employed in clinics for diagnosis of MDD.

By using the modern sensor equipment, we can easily collect electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which capture the information from central nervous system and are closely related with our brain activities. Through the training on EEG signals, we can make reasonable analysis on people's affection, which is very promising in various areas. Unfortunately, the special properties of EEG dataset have brought difficulties for conventional machine learning methods. The main reasons lie in two aspects: the small set of labeled samples and the noisy channel problem. To overcome these difficulties and successfully identify the affective states, we come up with a novel semi-supervised deep structured framework. Compared with previous deep learning models, our method is more adapted to the EEG classification problem. We first adopt a two-level procedure, which involves both supervised label information and unsupervised structure information to jointly make decision on channel selection. And then, we add a generative Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model for the classification task, and use the training objectives of generative learning and unsupervised learning to jointly regularize the discriminative training. Finally, we extend it to the active learning scenario, which solves the costly labeling problem. The experiments conducted on real EEG dataset have shown both the convincing result on critical channel selection and the superiority of our method over multiple baselines for the affective state recognition.

A few methods exist in the market presently towards this aim. However, sleep physicians may not have full assurance and consideration in such methods due to concerns associated with systems accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. This paper presents a novel and efficient technique that can be implemented in a microcontroller device to identify sleep stages in an effort to assist physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of related sleep disorders by enhancing the accuracy of the developed algorithm using a single channel of EEG signals. First, the dataset of EEG signal is filtered and decomposed into delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma sub-bands using Butterworth band-pass filters. Second, a set of sample statistical discriminating features are derived from each frequency band. Finally, sleep stages consisting of Wakefulness, Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) are classified using several supervised machine learning classifiers including multi-class Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), Neural Networks (NN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes (NB). This paper combines REM with Stage 1 NREM due to data similarities. Performance is then compared based on single channel EEG signals that were obtained from 20 healthy subjects. The results show that the proposed technique using DT classifier efficiently achieves high accuracy of 97.30% in differentiating sleeps stages. Also, a comparison of our method with some recent available works in the literature reiterates the high classification accuracy performance.	[Aboalayon, Khald A.

To overcome the problem of misclassification in Real AdaBoost algorithm, of the already classified samples, concept of margin is employed in the Parameterized AdaBoost algorithm. The new parameter, introduced in Parameterized AdaBoost, corresponding to the margin is chosen randomly between 0 to 1. However, the margin value is different for different classification problem. Hence, in this paper, the parameter corresponding to the margin is adapted by learning the parameter value with the help of Differential Evolutionary algorithm corresponding to the optimal classification accuracy. Experiment for the support of the proposed Adaptive Parameterized AdaBoost Algorithm has been conducted with different standard database given by VCI Machine Learning Repository. In addition, an application of Adaptive Parameterized AdaBoost is performed in EEG Motor Imagery Classification. Finally the EEG Motor Imagery Classified data (Left/Right) is tested in a robot.

In a study conducted in southern Tanzania in 2005, 62 patients with NS were analyzed in great detail. The present study, a follow-up investigation, was conducted to evaluate the progression of NS over time and to obtain serial electroencephalography (EEG) data. MethodsOf the 62 NS patients, 53 (85.5%), the majority of whom were currently on some form of antiepileptic treatment, could be reevaluated in 2009 with a standardized questionnaire. A subset of these patients (25/53) underwent EEG investigation. ResultsIn patients with head nodding (HN) only in 2005, 10 (43.5%) of 23 remained with the same diagnosis, whereas 5 (21.7%) of 23 had developed HN plus (i.e., HN and generalized tonic-clonic seizures). Six patients (26.1%) had seizures other than HN only, and two patients (8.7%) had fully recovered. In the HN plus group of 2005, 9 (30.0%) of 30 patients remained HN plus, and 15 patients (50.0%) had seizures other than HN only. Four patients (13.3%) reverted to HN only, and two patients (6.7%) stopped all seizures. In 11 (44.0%) of 25 patients, electroencephalography (EEG) showed generalized slowing. Six (54.6%) of these 11 abnormal EEG studies further showed generalized epileptiform discharges: (1) ictal electroencephalographic pattern with generalized 2.5Hz spike and waves in two patients and (2) interictal bursts of 1.5-2Hz spike and waves in four patients. SignificanceThis follow-up study confirms that HN represents an epilepsy disorder, possibly of the atypical absence type with dynamic development over time.

Adaptive estimation of hand movement trajectory in an EEG based brain-computer interface system	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface; motor control; electroencephalography	MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHIC SIGNALS; CLASSIFICATION; TIME	Objective. The various parameters that define a hand movement such as its trajectory, speed, etc, are encoded in distinct brain activities. Decoding this information from neurophysiological recordings is a less explored area of brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Applying non-invasive recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) for decoding makes the problem more challenging, as the encoding is assumed to be deep within the brain and not easily accessible by scalp recordings. Approach. EEG based BCI systems can be developed to identify the neural features underlying movement parameters that can be further utilized to provide a detailed and well defined control command set to a BCI output device. A real-time continuous control is better suited for practical BCI systems, and can be achieved by continuous adaptive reconstruction of movement trajectory than discrete brain activity classifications. In this work, we adaptively reconstruct/estimate the parameters of two-dimensional hand movement trajectory, namely movement speed and position, from multi-channel EEG recordings. The data for analysis is collected by performing an experiment that involved center-out right-hand movement tasks in four different directions at two different speeds in random order. We estimate movement trajectory using a Kalman filter that models the relation between brain activity and recorded parameters based on a set of defined predictors. We propose a method to define these predictor variables that includes spatial, spectral and temporally localized neural information and to select optimally informative variables. Main results. The proposed method yielded correlation of (0.60 +/- 0.07) between recorded and estimated data. Further, incorporating the proposed predictor subset selection, the correlation achieved is (0.57 +/- 0.07, p < 0.004) with significant gain in stability of the system, as well as dramatic reduction in number of predictors (76%) for the savings of computational time. Significance. The proposed system provides a real time movement control system using EEG-BCI with control over movement speed and position. These results are higher and statistically significant compared to existing techniques in EEG based systems and thus promise the applicability of the proposed method for efficient estimation of movement parameters and for continuous motor control.

Movie clips are used to evoke three emotional states: positive, neutral, and negative. We adopt differential entropy (DE) as features, and apply linear dynamic system (LDS) to do feature smoothing. The average cross-subject classification accuracy is 64.82% with five frequency bands using data from 14 subjects as training set and data from the rest one subject as testing set. With the training set expanding from one subject to 14 subjects, the average accuracy will then continuously increase. Moreover, fuzzy-integral-based combination method is used to combine models across frequency bands and the average accuracy of 72.82% is obtained.

Most previous methods were based only on signal features derived from the instantaneous frequency and energies of EEG signals in different spectral sub-bands. The proposed features based on image descriptors are extracted from the T-F representation of EEG signals and are considered and processed as an image using T-F image processing techniques. The proposed features include shape and texture-based descriptors and are able to describe visually the normal and seizure activity patterns observed in T-F images. The results obtained on real EEG data show that T-F image descriptor-based features achieve an overall classification accuracy of up to 98% for 100 EEG segments using one-against-one SVM classifier. The results suggest that the proposed method outperforms those methods, which employ signal features only or combined signal-image features by about 3% for 100 EEG signals.

BCI paradigms are typically structured into trials and we argue that this structure should be taken into account. Moreover, the non-Euclidean structure of covariance matrices should be taken into consideration as well. We review several approaches from the literature for averaging covariance matrices in CSP and compare them empirically on three publicly available datasets. Our results show that using Riemannian geometry for averaging covariance matrices improves performances for small dimensional problems, but also the limits of this approach when the dimensionality increases.

Assessing Movement Factors in Upper Limb Kinematics Decoding from EEG Signals	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC SIGNALS; TETRAPLEGIA; PEOPLE; GRASP; REACH; ARM	The past decades have seen the rapid development of upper limb kinematics decoding techniques by performing intracortical recordings of brain signals. However, the use of noninvasive approaches to perform similar decoding procedures is still in its early stages. Recent studies show that there is a correlation between electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and hand-reaching kinematic parameters. From these studies, it could be concluded that the accuracy of upper limb kinematics decoding depends, at least partially, on the characteristics of the performed movement. In this paper, we have studied upper limb movements with different speeds and trajectories in a controlled environment to analyze the influence of movement variability in the decoding performance. To that end, low frequency components of the EEG signals have been decoded with linear models to obtain the position of the volunteer's hand during performed trajectories grasping the end effector of a planar manipulandum. The results confirm that it is possible to obtain kinematic information from low frequency EEG signals and show that decoding performance is significantly influenced by movement variability and tracking accuracy as continuous and slower movements improve the accuracy of the decoder. This is a key factor that should be taken into account in future experimental designs.

The signal processing procedure consists of a learning phase and test phase. In the learning phase, a Kinect sensor is utilized to measure the true values for a hand's movement. Sparse coding is applied to calculate the weight of a linear decoding model. Because sparse coding can be used to derive the sparse weight, most of the elements are zero, with the remaining elements being non-zero. Thus, it is an effective method for reducing the calculation costs. Sparse coding was combined with noise reduction of the EEG signals to achieve good estimation for upper limb movements in the experimental results.

It has been found that cortical coherence appearance differs in time depending on walking speed. In this work, we analyze the influence of walking speed by decoding knee angles from low frequency EEG components. Linear regression models are applied to show significant correlations between actual and decoded angles while different walking speeds are performed. Additionally, a comparison between walking speeds suggests that the decoding correlation increases with lower speeds.

A study on motor imagery (MI) based BCI has been carried out and important implications are identified. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) is applied to the EEG signals before proceeding to the classification. The primary focus of this research is to utilize the spatial dynamics of the brain to develop BCI with reduced number of electrodes which contribute to the motor imagery tasks with optimal impact. It is observed that computational cost can be reduced drastically by selecting channels from specific regions of interests (ROIs) of the brain without compromising the classification accuracy making BCI efficient. Here, we have reported the best classification accuracies 72.5% and 97.1% which are achieved for two subjects ('av' and 'ay', respectively, in the dataset IVa in the BCI competition III) using less number of electrodes.

For this purpose, various patterns/features of EEG data need to be extracted and associated with specific events like cue-paced motor imagery. However, this is a challenging task since EEG data are usually non-stationary time series with a low signal-to-noise ratio. New method: In this study, we propose a novel method, called structure constrained semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SCS-NMF), to extract the key patterns of EEG data in time domain by imposing the mean envelopes of event-related potentials (ERPs) as constraints on the semi-NMF procedure. The proposed method is applicable to general EEG time series, and the extracted temporal features by SCS-NMF can also be combined with other features in frequency domain to improve the performance of motor imagery classification. Results: Real data experiments have been performed using the SCS-NMF approach for motor imagery classification, and the results clearly suggest the superiority of the proposed method. Comparison with existing methods: Comparison experiments have also been conducted. The compared methods include ICA, PCA, Semi-NMF, Wavelets, EMD and CSP, which further verified the effectivity of SCS-NMF. Conclusions: The SCS-NMF method could obtain better or competitive performance over the state of the art methods, which provides a novel solution for brain pattern analysis from the perspective of structure constraint.

Cognitive state monitoring and the design of adaptive instruction in digital environments: lessons learned from cognitive workload assessment using a passive brain-computer interface approach	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						passive brain-computer interface; EEG; cross-task classification; working-memory load; adaptive learning environments; cognitive load theory	WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LOAD THEORY; EEG; ATTENTION; COMPONENT; TASK; COMMUNICATION; INTERFERENCE	According to Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), one of the crucial factors for successful learning is the type and amount of working-memory load (WML) learners experience while studying instructional materials. Optimal learning conditions are characterized by providing challenges for learners without inducing cognitive over- or underload. Thus, presenting instruction in a way that WML is constantly held within an optimal range with regard to learners' working-memory capacity might be a good method to provide these optimal conditions. The current paper elaborates how digital learning environments, which achieve this goal can be developed by combining approaches from Cognitive Psychology, Neuroscience, and Computer Science. One of the biggest obstacles that needs to be overcome is the lack of an unobtrusive method of continuously assessing learners' WML in real-time. We propose to solve this problem by applying passive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) approaches to realistic learning scenarios in digital environments. In this paper we discuss the methodological and theoretical prospects and pitfalls of this approach based on results from the literature and from our own research. We present a strategy on how several inherent challenges of applying BCIs to WML and learning can be met by refining the psychological constructs behind WML, by exploring their neural signatures, by using these insights for sophisticated task designs, and by optimizing algorithms for analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) data. Based on this strategy we applied machine-learning algorithms for cross-task classifications of different levels of WML to tasks that involve studying realistic instructional materials. We obtained very promising results that yield several recommendations for future work.

Use of Electrographic Seizures and Interictal Epileptiform Discharges for improving performance in Seizure Prediction	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2015 IEEE RECENT ADVANCES IN INTELLIGENT COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEMS (RAICS)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems (RAICS)	DEC 10-12, 2015	Trivandrum, INDIA	IEEE		EEG; Seizure; Ictal; Interictal; Intracranial; Extracranial; Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs); Electrographic Seizure (ES); Machine learning	EPILEPSY; STATE	Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important tool in analyzing brain activity. EEG recording is effectively used for detection and prediction of electrophysiological abnormalities due to epilepsy. Epileptic seizure is a brain disorder which affects the patients acutely. Seizures are controllable with medication in 70% of the cases, however the rest may continue to have recurring epileptic seizures despite medications. Since seizures are unpredictable clinically, these patients will also live with perpetual anxiety about the onset of seizure, apart from being affected by the seizure consequences such as drowsiness, headache, vomiting, etc. The seizures can cause injury to the patients, and in some cases may even result in death. Seizure prediction can aid patients with disabling seizure by detecting the seizure precursors in advance and alerting the patients or their caregivers. If the seizure is predicted in advance it can be aborted by fast acting Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) or other treatment procedures. This will also aid pre-surgical video EEG monitoring wherein prediction of the ictal onset zone is paramount and machine alarms can be devised. In this paper, we are comparing the results of our research work related to the seizure prediction models. First model, as in usual practice, differentiates between preictal and interictal data segments only. The other seizure prediction model uses Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs), Electrographic Seizures (ES) and ictal data segments in addition to the first model.

The presented BCI approach included three stages: (1) a pre-processing step was performed to improve the general signal quality of the EEG; (2) the features were chosen, including wavelet packet entropy and Granger causality, respectively; (3) a multiple kernel learning support vector machine (MKL-SVM) based on a gradient descent optimization algorithm was investigated to classify EEG signals, in which the kernel was defined as a linear combination of polynomial kernels and radial basis function kernels. Experimental results showed that the proposed method provided better classification performance compared with the SVM based on a single kernel. For mental tasks, the average accuracies for 2-class, 3-class, 4-class, and 5-class classifications were 99.20%, 81.25%, 76.76%, and 75.25% respectively. Comparing stroke patients with healthy controls using the proposed algorithm, we achieved the average classification accuracies of 89.24% and 80.33% for 0-back and 1-back tasks respectively. Our results indicate that the proposed approach is promising for implementing human-computer interaction (HCI), especially for mental task classification and identifying suitable brain impairment candidates.

Current neurophysiological measurements can distinguish groups of healthy controls and groups of schizophrenia patients. Individual classification based on neurophysiological measurements only shows moderate accuracy. In this study, we wanted to examine whether it is possible to distinguish controls and patients individually with a good accuracy. To this end we used a combination of features from different test paradigms, in particular the auditory and visual P300 and the mismatch negativity. We selected 54 patients and 54 controls, matched for age and gender, from the data available at the UPC Kortenberg. The EEG-data were high-and low-pass filtered, epoched, artefacts were rejected and the epochs were averaged. Features (latencies and amplitudes of component peaks) were extracted from the averaged signals. The resulting dataset was used to train and test classification algorithms. Here we applied Naive Bayes and Decision Tree (without and with AdaBoost). A combination of three evoked potentials allowed us to accurately classify individual subjects as either control or patient. For the three investigated classifiers a total accuracy of more than 80%, a sensitivity of above 82% and a specificity of at least 78% was found.

In this paper, a new algorithm, manifold regularized extreme learning machine (MRELM), is proposed for recognizing human emotional states (positive, neutral and negative) from EEG data, which were previously evoked by watching different types of movie clips. The MRELM can simultaneously consider the geometrical structure and discriminative information in EEG data. Using differential entropy features across whole five frequency bands, the average accuracy of MRELM is 81.01%, which is better than those obtained by GELM (80.25%) and SVM (76.62%). The accuracies obtained from high frequency band features (beta, gamma) are obviously superior to those of low frequency band features, which shows beta and gamma bands are more relevant to emotional states transition. Moreover, experiments are conducted to further evaluate the efficacy of MRELM, where the training and test sets are from different sessions. The results demonstrate that the proposed MRELM is a competitive model for EEG-based emotion recognition.

Five patterns of EEG can be determined by using 2 interictal EEG domains: organization of the background activity and a morphology/topography of epileptiform discharges. These patterns relate to commonly recognized categories of pediatric epilepsy: familial epilepsies, genetic generalized epilepsies, self-limited epilepsies, epilepsies with encephalopathy, and focal structural epilepsies. Each group has distinguishable clinical presentations, inheritance patterns, and outcomes. This categorization may be a useful educational tool; it may also guide decisions about further testing and management.

Vigilance level detection methodology consists of three steps, EEG channels selection, feature extraction and classification. EEG signals obtained from 64 channels are sub-divided into four frequency sub-bands i.e. alpha, beta, delta and theta. Channel selection criteria Maximum Energy to Shannon Entropy ratio is applied on each frequency band to select appropriate EEG channels. EEG signals obtained from selected channels are further divided into frequency sub-bands i.e. alpha, beta and alpha-beta bands. Three nonlinear features such as Higuchi fractal dimension, Petrosian fractal dimension and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis are calculated to prepare three feature vectors respective to each frequency sub-bands. Three machine learning techniques are used for vigilance level detection such as Support Vector Machine, Least Square-Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper introduces an efficient methodology that could be implemented in hardware to differentiate OSA patients from normal controls, based on the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. For this purpose, first, the EEG recorded datasets that were obtained from the Phsyionet website are filtered and decomposed into delta, theta alpha, beta and gamma sub-bands using Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Butterworth band-pass filters. Second, descriptive features such as energy and variance are extracted from each frequency band that are used as input parameters for classification. Finally, several machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Naive Bayes (NB) are employed in order to identify if the OSA exists or not, according to the objective of this study. The results that are obtained from these classifiers are then compared in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The experimental results show that the SVM attained the best classification accuracy of 97.14% as compared to the others.	[Almuhammadi, Wafaa S.; Aboalayon, Khald A.

A key challenge in this system is the accurate and reliable detection of motor imagery. In motor imagery-based BCIs, the common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm is widely used to extract discriminative patterns from electroencephalography signals. However, the CSP algorithm is sensitive to noise and artifacts, and its performance depends on the operational frequency band. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel optimized sparse spatio-spectral filtering (OSSSF) algorithm. The proposed OSSSF algorithm combines a filter bank framework with sparse CSP filters to automatically select subject-specific discriminative frequency bands as well as to robustify against noise and artifacts. The proposed algorithm directly selects the optimal regularization parameters using a novel mutual information-based approach, instead of the cross-validation approach that is computationally intractable in a filter bank framework. The performance of the proposed OSSSF algorithm is evaluated on a dataset from 11 stroke patients performing neuro-rehabilitation, as well as on the publicly available BCI competition III dataset IVa. The results show that the proposed OSSSF algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms based on CSP, stationary CSP, sparse CSP and filter bank CSP in terms of the classification accuracy, and substantially reduce the computational time of selecting the regularization parameters compared with the cross-validation approach.

However, this ignores the analysis of individual responses, which may explain the clinical differences in efficacy. Therefore, we explored the individual responses to morphine in terms of the altered single-sweep characteristics in a placebo-controlled crossover study. To account for multifactorial mechanisms, several characteristics were assessed simultaneously by multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). Methods: EPs were recorded from 62 channels and obtained before and after morphine and placebo administration during repeated electrical stimulations of the oesophagus in 12 healthy males. Additionally, the pain detection threshold was recorded to reflect the subjective analgesic effect in each subject. The characteristics of the sweeps were extracted by a multivariate matching pursuit algorithm with Gabor atoms implemented with a variable amplitude and constant phase across the sweeps. The single-sweep amplitudes were used as input to an MVPA algorithm to discriminate individual responses. The accuracy of the MVPA for each individual subject was used for correlation analysis of the analgesic effect. Results: The mean classification accuracy when discriminating pre- and posttreatment morphine responses was 72% (p = 0.01). The individual classification accuracy was positively correlated to the analgesic effect of morphine (p = 0.03). Furthermore, the 2 posttreatment responses were classified and validated by the classification of the 2 pretreatment responses (p = 0.001). Conclusions: The alterations in the single-sweep EPs after morphine reflect the analgesic effect. The MVPA approach is a novel methodology for monitoring the individual efficacy of analgesics.

This objective is of particular interest because CLZ, though a potentially dangerous drug, can be uniquely effective for otherwise medication-resistant SCZ subjects. We wish to determine whether ML methods can be used to identify a set of EEG-based discriminating features that can simultaneously (1) distinguish all the SCZ subjects before treatment (BT) from healthy volunteer (HV) subjects, (2) distinguish EEGs collected before CLZ treatment (BT) vs. those collected after treatment (AT) for those subjects most responsive to CLZ, (3) discriminate least responsive subjects from HV AT, and (4) no longer discriminate most responsive subjects from HVs AT. If a set of EEG-derived features satisfy these four conditions, then it may be concluded that these features normalize in responsive subjects as a result of CLZ treatment, and therefore potentially provide insight into the functioning of the drug on the SCZ brain. Methods: Odd-ball auditory evoked potentials of 66 HVs and 47 SCZ adults both BT and AT with CLZ were derived from EEG recordings. Treatment outcome, after at least one year follow-up, was assessed through clinical rating scores assigned by an experienced clinician, blind to EEG results. Using a criterion of at least 35% improvement after CLZ treatment, subjects were divided into "most-responsive'' (MR) and "least-responsive'' (LR) groups. As a first step, a brain source localization (BSL) procedure was employed on the EEG signals to extract source waveforms from specified brain regions. ML methods were then applied to these source waveform signals to determine whether a set of features satisfying the four conditions outlined above could be discovered. Results: A set of cross-power spectral density (CPSD) features meeting these criteria was identified. These CPSD features, consisting of a combination of brain regional source activity and connectivity measures, significantly overlap with the default mode network (DMN). All decrease with CLZ treatment in responding SCZs. Conclusions: A set of EEG-derived discriminating features which normalize as a result of CLZ treatment was identified. These discriminating features define a network that shares significant commonality with the DMN. Our findings are consistent with those of previous literature, which suggest that regions of the DMN are hyperactive and hyperconnected in SCZ subjects. Our study shows that these discriminating features decrease after treatment, consistent with portions of the DMN normalizing with CLZ therapy in responsive subjects. Significance: Machine learning is proposed as a potentially powerful tool for analysis of the effect of medication on psychiatric illness. If replicated, the proposed approach could be used to gain some improved understanding of the effect of neuroleptic medications in treating psychotic illness. These results may also be useful in the development of new pharmaceuticals, since a new drug which induces changes in brain electrophysiology similar to those seen after CLZ could also have powerful antipsychotic properties.

A crucial component in ABCI is to reliably and accurately characterize individuals' brain dynamics into distinct affective states by employing advanced methods of pattern recognition. This chapter explores principles for translating neuroscientific findings into a practical ABCI. It will cover not only an overview of state-of-the-art EEG-based emotion recognition techniques, but also the basic research exploring neurophysiological EEG dynamics associated with affective responses. Although previous studies have demonstrated the use of EEG spectral dynamics for emotion classification, most of them achieved high classification accuracy by using an affective framework involving all available channels as well as frequency bands. The issue of feature and electrode reduction/selection has not typically been a primary goal in ABCI research. However, this chapter aims at resolving EEG feature selection and electrode reduction issues by the generalization of subject-independent feature/electrode set extraction techniques that we have proposed in our series of emotion classification studies [1-7]. Furthermore, this study addresses several practical issues and potential challenges for ABCIs as well. We believe a user-friendly EEG cap with a small number of electrodes can efficiently detect affective states, and therefore significantly promote practical ABCI applications in daily life.

With the advancements in low-cost electronics and computer interface equipment, as well as the need to serve people suffering from disabilities of neuromuscular disorders, a new field of research has emerged by understanding different functions of the brain. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is an electrical activity generated by brain structures and recorded from the scalp surface through electrodes. Researchers primarily rely on EEG to characterise the brain activity, because it can be recorded non-invasively by using portable equipment. The EEG or the brain activity can be used in real time to control external devices via a complete BCI system. A typical BCI scheme generally consists of a data acquisition system, pre-processing of the acquired signals, feature extraction process, classification of the features, post-processing of the classifier output, and finally the control interface and device controller. The post-processed output signals are translated into appropriate commands so as to control output devices, with several applications such as robotic arms, video games, wheelchair etc.	[Prashant, Parmar] TeamLease Skills Univ, Mechatron Dept, Vadodara, India; [Joshi, Anand] GH Patel Coll Engn & Tech, Mechatron Dept, Vallabh Vidyanagar, Gujarat, India; [Gandhi, Vaibhav] Middlesex Univ, Dept Design Engn & Math, London, England		Prashant, P (corresponding author), TeamLease Skills Univ, Mechatron Dept, Vadodara, India.	prashant.parmar@teamleaseuniversity.org; anandjoshi@gcet.ac.in; v.gandhi@mdx.ac.uk	Joshi, Anand/H-6286-2011; Joshi, Anand/AAA-8378-2020	Joshi, Anand/0000-0003-1063-2944; Joshi, Anand/0000-0002-9582-3848					46	4	4	0	9	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	2375-1282		978-1-4799-9991-0	NIRMA UNIV INT CONF			2015														6	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BF2SR					2022-08-02	WOS:000380496400028

We used the EEG terminology proposed by the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) to assess interrater variability in a cohort of cardiac arrest patients included in the Target Temperature Management trial. The main objective was to evaluate if malignant EEG-patterns could reliably be identified. Methods: Full-length EEGs from 103 comatose cardiac arrest patients were interpreted by four EEG-specialists with different nationalities who were blinded for patient outcome. Percent agreement and kappa (kappa) for the categories in the ACNS EEG terminology and for prespecified malignant EEG-patterns were calculated. Results: There was substantial interrater agreement (kappa 0.71) for highly malignant patterns and moderate agreement (kappa 0.42) for malignant patterns. Substantial agreement was found for malignant periodic or rhythmic patterns (kappa 0.72) while agreement for identifying an unreactive EEG was fair (kappa 0.26). Conclusions: The ACNS EEG terminology can be used to identify highly malignant EEG-patterns in post cardiac arrest patients in an international context with high reliability. Significance: The establishment of strict criteria with high transferability between interpreters will increase the usefulness of routine EEG to assess neurological prognosis after cardiac arrest.

J	King, JR; Dehaene, S				King, J-R.; Dehaene, S.			characterizing the dynamics of mental representations: the temporal] generalization method	TRENDS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCES			English	Review							PERCEPTUAL DECISION-MAKING; BRAIN ACTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; VISUAL-IMAGERY; INFORMATION; EXPERIENCE; REVEALS; REPLAY; AREA; CLASSIFICATION	Parsing a cognitive task into a sequence of operations is a central problem in cognitive neuroscience. We argue that a major advance is now possible owing to the application of pattern classifiers to time-resolved recordings of brain activity [electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or intracranial recordings]. By testing at which moment a specific mental content becomes decodable in brain activity, we can characterize the time course of cognitive codes. Most importantly, the manner in which the trained classifiers generalize across time, and from one experimental condition to another, sheds light on the temporal organization of information-processing stages. A repertoire of canonical dynamical patterns is observed across various experiments and brain regions. This method thus provides a novel way to understand how mental representations are manipulated and transformed.

Numerous feature extraction methods have successfully been applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) classification in various experiments. However, little effort has been spent on EEG based BMI systems regarding familiarity of human faces cognition. In this work, we have implemented and compared the classification performances of four common feature extraction methods, namely, common spatial pattern, principal component analysis, wavelet transform and interval features. High resolution EEG signals were collected from fifteen healthy subjects stimulated by equal number of familiar and novel faces. Principal component analysis outperforms other methods with average classification accuracy reaching 94.2% leading to possible real life applications. Our findings thereby may contribute to the BMI systems for face recognition.

This yields fast and simple tests, but by using information-theoretic statistics one can relax the Gaussian assumption. We propose using Renyi's quadratic entropy as an alternative to the covariance and show how a linear projection can be optimized to maximize the difference between the conditional entropies. In addition, if the observed sample is actually a window of a multivariate time-series, then the temporal structure can be exploited using the generalized auto-correlation function, correntropy, of the projected sample. This both reduces the computational complexity and increases the performance. These tests can be applied for decoding the brain state from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Preliminary results are demonstrated on a brain-computer interface competition dataset. On unfiltered signals, the projections optimized with the entropy-based statistic perform better than those of common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm in terms of classification performance.

Well-known examples are the flash-lag, flash-drag, and flash-jump effect. However, where and when in the visual processing hierarchy such interactions take place is unclear. Here, we used a variant of the flash-grab illusion (Vision Research 91 (2013), pp. 8-20) to shift the perceived positions of flashed stimuli, and applied multivariate pattern classification to individual 64-channel EEG trials to dissociate neural signals corresponding to veridical versus perceived position with high temporal resolution. We show illusory effects of motion on perceived position in three separate analyses: (1) A classifier can distinguish different perceived positions of a flashed object, even when the veridical positions are identical. (2) When the perceived positions of two objects presented in different locations become more similar, the classifier performs less well than when they become more different, even if the veridical positions remain unchanged. (3) Finally, a classifier can discriminate the perceived position of an object even when trained on objects presented in physically different positions. These effects are evident as early as 81 ms post-stimulus, concurrent with the very first EEG signals indicating that any stimulus is present at all. This finding shows that the illusion must begin at an early level, probably as part of a predominantly feed-forward mechanism, leaving the influence of any recurrent processes to later stages in the development of the effect.

Classification of EEG Signals using adaptive weighted distance nearest neighbor algorithm	JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Nearest neighbor; Noisy training data; EEG signal classification; Band power; Fractal dimension; Autoregressive coefficients		Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are often used to diagnose diseases such as seizure, alzheimer, and schizophrenia. One main problem with the recorded EEG samples is that they are not equally reliable due to the artifacts at the time of recording. EEG signal classification algorithms should have a mechanism to handle this issue. It seems that using adaptive classifiers can be useful for the biological signals such as EEG. In this paper, a general adaptive method named weighted distance nearest neighbor (WDNN) is applied for EEG signal classification to tackle this problem. This classification algorithm assigns a weight to each training sample to control its influence in classifying test samples. The weights of training samples are used to find the nearest neighbor of an input query pattern. To assess the performance of this scheme, EEG signals of thirteen schizophrenic patients and eighteen normal subjects are analyzed for the classification of these two groups. Several features including, fractal dimension, band power and autoregressive (AR) model are extracted from EEG signals. The classification results are evaluated using Leave one (subject) out cross validation for reliable estimation. The results indicate that combination of WDNN and selected features can significantly outperform the basic nearest- neighbor and the other methods proposed in the past for the classification of these two groups. Therefore, this method can be a complementary tool for specialists to distinguish schizophrenia disorder. (C) 2013 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

Various channel selection methods are successfully implemented in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system that uses one type of brain activity by earlier researchers. Upon realizing the limitation of conventional BCI systems, there has been increasing number of hybrid BCI systems. These hybrid systems use combinations of two brain activity patterns to enhance the functionality of a system. In this paper, three multi-objective genetic algorithms (GAs) are proposed to optimize the number of channels selected and system accuracy. The objective of this research is to investigate the optimal tradeoff between the classification accuracy of a BCI system and the number of selected channels. This tradeoff is important because different BCI applications have different priorities; some implementations prefer minimum number of channels while others favor the classification accuracy. The second objective of this research is to investigate the effectiveness of the GAs adopted as a channel selection method for BCI systems based on different brain activity. Three BCI Competition data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed GAs. Non-parametric Friedman test (p-value = 0.635) is also conducted and the result reveals that the significant reduction in number of channels does not have significant impact in the classification accuracy on the evaluation data This confirms the validity of genetic algorithms as a channel selection method for both P300 and motor imagery data.

Most neuroimaging investigations of environmental sound discrimination have studied subjects while consciously perceiving and often explicitly recognizing the stimuli. Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent auditory object processing occurs independently of task demands and consciousness. Studies in animal models have shown that environmental sound discrimination at a neural level persists even in anesthetized preparations, whereas data from anesthetized humans has thus far provided null results. Here, we studied comatose patients as a model of environmental sound discrimination capacities during unconsciousness. We included 19 comatose patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH) during the first 2 days of coma, while recording nineteen-channel electroencephalography (EEG). At the level of each individual patient, we applied a decoding algorithm to quantify the differential EEG responses to human vs. animal vocalizations as well as to sounds of living vocalizations vs. man-made objects. Discrimination between vocalization types was accurate in 11 patients and discrimination between sounds from living and man-made sources in 10 patients. At the group level, the results were significant only for the comparison between vocalization types. These results lay the groundwork for disentangling truly preferential activations in response to auditory categories, and the contribution of awareness to auditory category discrimination.

In this paper, we cast the CSP algorithm in a probabilistic modeling setting. Specifically, probabilistic CSP (P-CSP) is proposed as a generic EEG spatio-temporal modeling framework that subsumes the CSP and regularized CSP algorithms. The proposed framework enables us to resolve the overfitting issue of CSP in a principled manner. We derive statistical inference algorithms that can alleviate the issue of local optima. In particular, an efficient algorithm based on eigendecomposition is developed for maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation in the case of isotropic noise. For more general cases, a variational algorithm is developed for group-wise sparse Bayesian learning for the P-CSP model and for automatically determining the model size. The two proposed algorithms are validated on a simulated data set. Their practical efficacy is also demonstrated by successful applications to single-trial classifications of three motor imagery EEG data sets and by the spatio-temporal pattern analysis of one EEG data set recorded in a Stroop color naming task.

This results in the deterioration of the classification performance during experimental sessions. Therefore, adaptive classification techniques are required for EEG based BCI applications. In this paper, we propose simple adaptive sparse representation based classification (SRC) schemes. Supervised and unsupervised dictionary update techniques for new test data and a dictionary modification method by using the incoherence measure of the training data are investigated. The proposed methods are very simple and additional computation for the re-training of the classifier is not needed. The proposed adaptive SRC schemes are evaluated using two BCI experimental datasets. The proposed methods are assessed by comparing classification results with the conventional SRC and other adaptive classification methods. On the basis of the results, we find that the proposed adaptive schemes show relatively improved classification accuracy as compared to conventional methods without requiring additional computation.

Independent component analysis (ICA), which is an effective method to recover independent sources from sensor outputs without assuming any a priori knowledge, has been widely used in such biological signals analysis. However, when dealing with EEG signals, the mixing model usually does not satisfy the standard ICA assumptions due to the time-variable structures of source signals. In this case, EEG patterns should be precisely separated and recognized in a short time window. Another issue is that we usually over-separate the signals by ICA due to the over learning problem when the length of data is not sufficient. In order to tackle these problems mentioned above, we try to exploit both high order statistics and temporal structures of source signals under condition of short time windows. We utilize a temporal-independent component analysis (tICA) method to formulate the blind separation problem into a new framework of analyzing the mutual independence of the residual signals. Furthermore, in order to find better features for classification, both temporal and spatial features of EEG recordings are extracted by integrating tICA together with some other algorithm like Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) for feature extraction. Computer simulations are given to evaluate the efficiency and performance of tICA based on EEG data recorded not from the normal people but from some special populations suffering from neurophysiological diseases like stroke. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that EEG characteristics of stroke patients are explored and reported using ICA algorithm. Superior separation performance and high classification rate evidence that the tICA method is promising for EEG analysis.

All disciplines have developed their respective sets of analytic tools to fuse the information that is available in all measured modalities. In this paper, we provide a review of classical as well as recent machine learning methods (specifically factor models) for fusing information from functional neuroimaging techniques such as: LFP, EEG, MEG, fNIRS, and fMRI. Early and late fusion scenarios are distinguished, and appropriate factor models for the respective scenarios are presented along with example applications from selected multimodal neuroimaging studies. Further emphasis is given to the interpretability of the resulting model parameters, in particular by highlighting how factor models relate to physical models needed for source localization. The methods we discuss allow for the extraction of information from neural data, which ultimately contributes to 1) better neuroscientific understanding; 2) enhance diagnostic performance; and 3) discover neural signals of interest that correlate maximally with a given cognitive paradigm. While we clearly study the multimodal functional neuroimaging challenge, the discussed machine learning techniques have a wide applicability, i.e., in general data fusion, and may thus be informative to the general interested reader.

Numerous studies have identified electrophysiological correlates of error recognition in the human brain (error-related potentials, ErrPs). Consequently, it has been proposed to use these signals to improve human-computer interaction (HCI) or brain-machine interfacing (BMI). Here, we present a review of over a decade of developments toward this goal. This body of work provides consistent evidence that ErrPs can be successfully detected on a single-trial basis, and that they can be effectively used in both HCI and BMI applications. We first describe the ErrP phenomenon and follow up with an analysis of different strategies to increase the robustness of a system by incorporating single-trial ErrP recognition, either by correcting the machine's actions or by providing means for its error-based adaptation. These approaches can be applied both when the user employs traditional HCI input devices or in combination with another BMI channel. Finally, we discuss the current challenges that have to be overcome in order to fully integrate ErrPs into practical applications. This includes, in particular, the characterization of such signals during real(istic) applications, as well as the possibility of extracting richer information from them, going beyond the time-locked decoding that dominates current approaches.

We first develop and implement an appropriate combination of different algorithms that resample, smooth, remove artifacts, and constantly and adaptively segment signals to prepare them for further processing. We then improve and fully implement a large variety of features introduced in the literature of epileptic seizures detection. We also select the relevant features to reduce a feature vector space and improve the classification process by developing two automated filter and wrapper selection algorithms. We thoroughly compare between these selection algorithms in terms of redundant features, execution time and classification accuracy through three experiments. We subsequently exploit the selected features as input to a machine learning classifier to detect epileptic seizure states in a reasonable time. We experimentally and theoretically evaluate the scalability of the whole algorithm respectively on patients' data available in standard clinical database and on 500 EEG recordings including 500 seizures. Having efficient and scabble algorithm, we develop two extra algorithms to dynamically acquire and transmit EEG signals from wireless sensors attached to patients and to visualize on mobile devices the obtained processing and analysis results. We finally integrate all our algorithms together along with an android mobile application to implement an effective mobile-based EEG monitoring system where its accuracy is tested on live EEG data.

The aim of this paper is to propose a semi-supervised classification algorithm whereby the model is gradually enhanced with unlabeled data collected online. Additionally, a processing stage is introduced before classification to adaptively reduce the small fluctuations between the features from training and evaluation sessions. The key element of the classification algorithm is an optimized version of kernel discriminant analysis called spectral regression kernel discriminant analysis (SRKDA) in order to meet the low computational cost requirement for online BCI applications. Four different approaches, SRKDA and sequential updating semi-supervised SRKDA (SUSS-SRKDA) with or without adaptive processing stage are considered to quantify the advantages of semi-supervised learning and adaptive stage. The session-to-session performance for each of them is evaluated on the multiclass problem (four motor imagery tasks: the imagination of movement of the left hand, right hand, both feet, and tongue) posed in the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a. The results agree with previous studies reporting semi-supervised learning enhances the adaptability of BCIs to non-stationary EEG data. Moreover, we show that reducing the inter-session non-stationarity before classification further boosts its performance. The classification method combining adaptive processing and semi-supervised learning is found to yield the highest session-to session transfer results presented so far for this multiclass dataset: accuracy (77%) and Cohen's kappa coefficient (0.70). Thus, the proposed methodology could be of great interest for real-life BCIs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To develop an automated algorithm to quantify background EEG abnormalities in full-term neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Approach. The algorithm classifies 1 h of continuous neonatal EEG (cEEG) into a mild, moderate or severe background abnormality grade. These classes are well established in the literature and a clinical neurophysiologist labeled 272 1 h cEEG epochs selected from 34 neonates. The algorithm is based on adaptive EEG segmentation and mapping of the segments into the so-called segments' feature space. Three features are suggested and further processing is obtained using a discretized three-dimensional distribution of the segments' features represented as a 3-way data tensor. Further classification has been achieved using recently developed tensor decomposition/classification methods that reduce the size of the model and extract a significant and discriminative set of features. Main results. Effective parameterization of cEEG data has been achieved resulting in high classification accuracy (89%) to grade background EEG abnormalities. Significance. For the first time, the algorithm for the background EEG assessment has been validated on an extensive dataset which contained major artifacts and epileptic seizures. The demonstrated high robustness, while processing real-case EEGs, suggests that the algorithm can be used as an assistive tool to monitor the severity of hypoxic insults in newborns.

A number of studies have attempted to evaluate media contents, especially TV commercials using various neuroimaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG). Yet neurophysiological examination of detailed cognitive and affective responses in viewers is still required to provide practical information to marketers. Here, this study develops a method to analyze temporal patterns of EEG data and extract affective and cognitive indices such as happiness, surprise, and attention for TV commercial evaluation. Methods: Twenty participants participated in the study. We developed the neurophysiological indices for TV commercial evaluation using classification model. Specifically, these model-based indices were customized using individual EEG features. We used a video game for developing the index of attention and four video clips for developing indices of happiness and surprise. Statistical processes including one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) and the cross validation scheme were used to select EEG features for each index. The EEG features were composed of the combinations of spectral power at selected channels from the cross validation for each individual. The Fisher's linear discriminant classifier (FLDA) was used to estimate each neurophysiological index during viewing four different TV commercials. Post hoc behavioral responses of preference, short-term memory, and recall were measured. Results: Behavioral results showed significant differences for all preference, short-term memory rates, and recall rates between commercials, leading to a 'high-ranked' commercial group and a 'low-ranked' group (P < 0.05). Neural estimation of happiness results revealed a significant difference between the high-ranked and the low-ranked commercials in happiness index (P < 0.01). The order of rankings based on happiness and attention matched well with the order of behavioral response rankings.

In the present study, a novel CSP sub-band feature selection has been proposed based on the discriminative information of the features. Besides, a DSLVQ-based weighting of the selected features has been considered. Then, the selected and weighted features have been classified using an SVM classifier. Finally, the performance of the suggested method has been compared with the basic CSP on EEG data on 5 subjects, from BCI competitions datasets. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the basic CSP algorithm by %7.3 on the average.

We report results from a simple visual object recognition experiment where independent component analysis (ICA) data processing and machine learning classification were able to correctly distinguish presence of visual stimuli at around 87% (0.70 AUC, p <0.0001) accuracy within single trials, using data from single ICs. Seven subjects observed a series of everyday visual object stimuli while EEG was recorded. The task was to indicate whether or not they recognised each object as familiar to them. EEG or IC data from a subset of initial object presentations was used to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, which then generated a label for subsequent data. Task-label classifier accuracy gives a proxy measure of task-related information present in the data used to train. This allows comparison of EEG data processing techniques - here, we found selected single ICs that give higher performance than when classifying from any single scalp EEG channel (0.70 AUC vs 0.65 AUC, p <0.0001). Most of these single selected ICs were found in occipital regions. Scoring a sliding analysis window moving through the time-points of the trial revealed that peak accuracy is when using data from +75 to +125 ms relative to the object appearing on screen. We discuss the use of such classification and potential cognitive implications of differential accuracy on IC activations. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

OBJECTIVE: Here, we studied the characteristics of two electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns evoked by two different imaginary tasks and evaluated the binary classification performance. METHODS: Fifteen individuals (11 male and 4 female, age range of 22 to 33) participated in five sessions of 32-channel EEG recordings. Only by analyzing the subjects' output EEG signals from the central parieto-occipital region of P-Z electrode, under the circumstances of consciousness of relaxation-meditation or tension-imagination, we carried out the experiment of feature extraction for spontaneous EEG, as the subjects were blindfolded but asked to open their eyes all the same. The Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) was utilized to obtain the Hilbert time-frequency amplitude spectrum, and then with the feature vector set extracted, a two-class Fisher linear discriminant analysis classifier was trained for classification of data epochs of those two tasks. RESULTS: The overall result was that about 90% (+/- 5%) of the epochs could be correctly classified to their originating task. CONCLUSION: This study not only brings new opportunities for consciousness studies, but also provides a new classification paradigm for achieving control of robots based on the brain-computer interface (BCI).

It is difficult to perceive the emotion of some disabled people through their facial expression, such as functional autism patient. EEG signal provides us a non-invasive way to recognize the emotion of these disable people through EEG headset electrodes placed on their scalp. In this paper, we propose a deep learning algorithm to simultaneously learn the features and classify the emotions of EEG signals. It differs from the conventional methods as we apply deep learning on the raw signal without explicit hand-crafted feature extraction. Because the EEG signal has subject dependency, it is better to train the emotion model subject-wise, while there is not much epochs available for each subject. Deep learning algorithm provides a solution with a pre-training way using three layers of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). Thus, we can use epochs of all subjects to pre-training the deep network, and use back-propagation to fine tuning the network subject by subject. Experiment results show that our proposed framework achieves better recognition accuracy than conventional algorithms.

Perception and Cognition of Cues Used in Synchronous Brain-Computer Interfaces Modify Electroencephalographic Patterns of Control Tasks	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-computer interface; motor imagery; classification accuracy; electroencephalographic patterns; human factors	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MOTOR IMAGERY; CLASSIFICATION; RHYTHMS; COMMUNICATION; OSCILLATIONS	A motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that enables humans to interact with their environment by translating their brain signals into control commands for a target device. In particular, synchronous BCI systems make use of cues to trigger the motor activity of interest. So far, it has been shown that electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns before and after cue onset can reveal the user cognitive state and enhance the discrimination of MI-related control tasks. However, there has been no detailed investigation of the nature of those EEG patterns. We, therefore, propose to study the cue effects on MI-related control tasks by selecting EEG patterns that best discriminate such control tasks, and analyzing where those patterns are coming from. The study was carried out using two methods: standard and all-embracing. The standard method was based on sources (recording sites, frequency bands, and time windows), where the modulation of EEG signals due to motor activity is typically detected. The all-embracing method included a wider variety of sources, where not only motor activity is reflected. The findings of this study showed that the classification accuracy (CA) of MI-related control tasks did not depend on the type of cue in use. However, EEG patterns that best differentiated those control tasks emerged from sources well defined by the perception and cognition of the cue in use. An implication of this study is the possibility of obtaining different control commands that could be detected with the same accuracy. Since different cues trigger control tasks that yield similar CAs, and those control tasks produce EEG patterns differentiated by the cue nature, this leads to accelerate the brain-computer communication by having a wider variety of detectable control commands. This is an important issue for Neuroergonomics research because neural activity could not only be used to monitor the human mental state as is typically done, but this activity might be also employed to control the system of interest.

A typical EEG experiment can produce a two-dimensional data matrix related to the human neuronal activity every millisecond, projected on the head surface at a spatial resolution of a few centimeters. As in other modern empirical sciences, the EEG instrumentation has led to a flood of data and a corresponding need for new data analysis methods. This paper summarizes the results of applying supervised machine learning (ML) methods to the problem of classifying emotional states of human subjects based on EEG. In particular, we compare six ML algorithms to distinguish event-related potentials, associated with the processing of different emotional valences, collected while subjects were viewing high arousal images with positive or negative emotional content. 98% inter-subject classification accuracy based on the majority of votes between all classifiers is the main achievement of this paper, which outperforms previous published results.

It is extensively used in the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system and can be used for disease diagnosis, disease treatment, etc. The two main technologies of EEG signal analysis is feature extraction and pattern recognition. The key features of EEG signals can be obtained through time-domain and frequency-domain analysis. The wavelet analysis is one kind of time-frequency analysis and has been considered very promising for data compression. The conventional method find wavelet synopsis to minimize the total mean squared error (L-2). It cannot control the approximation error of each single data element in the data vector. Usually, the nonlinear classification algorithms perform better than the linears, also more time-consuming in the meantime. In this paper, one method is provided to realize the feature extraction and pattern recognition of EEG signals. The data compression algorithm Fixed-value Shift (F-Shift) proposed by Pang et al. takes a novel method to construct unrestricted Haar wavelet synopsis under uniform norm (L-infinity) error bound. In their algorithm, the maximum approximation error of each individual element can be bounded by an given error bound. We apply this method to EEG signal compression, thus the key features are obtained. Then a fast nonlinear classification algorithm, one Randomize Neural Network (RNN), is provided to identify different patterns of EEG signals. The experiments indicate that (1) the F-Shift algorithm can compress EEG signals effectively and obtain the key features at the same time and (2) the RNN can discriminate different patterns of EEG signals based on the extracted features.

BCI's efficiency is dependent on brain signal processing methods which classify brain signal patterns accurately in various tasks. The presence of artifacts in raw EEG signal makes it necessary to preprocess the signal for feature extraction.

Many methods for feature extraction have been studied and the selection of both appropriate features and electrode locations is usually based on neuro-scientific findings. Their suitability for emotion recognition, however, has been tested using a small amount of distinct feature sets and on different, usually small data sets. A major limitation is that no systematic comparison of features exists. Therefore, we review feature extraction methods for emotion recognition from EEG based on 33 studies. An experiment is conducted comparing these features using machine learning techniques for feature selection on a self recorded data set. Results are presented with respect to performance of different feature selection methods, usage of selected feature types, and selection of electrode locations. Features selected by multivariate methods slightly outperform univariate methods. Advanced feature extraction techniques are found to have advantages over commonly used spectral power bands. Results also suggest preference to locations over parietal and centro-parietal lobes.

Common spatial pattern (CSP) is used to estimate the spatial filters for the multi-channel EEG data. The spatial filters lead to weighting of the channel/electrodes according to their variance in discriminating the two tasks performed. Channels with the largest variance are considered as significant channels. A two-fold classification method using support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify the test signal into right hand movement and right foot movement. In the present work, the analysis conducted demonstrate that the proposed twofold classification scheme can achieve upto 94.2% of accuracy in discrimination of the two tasks performed. The high-recognition rate and computational simplicity make CSP a promising method for an EEG-based BCI.

Sunil			Classifiers for the Epilepsy Risk Level Classification from Electroencephalographic Signals	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Machine learning; Statistical theory; Epilepsy		In the field of machine learning analysis and statistical theory, classification is actually the problem of identification of a new observation to a particular set of categories. It is done on the basis of a training set of a particular data which contains its respective observations and whose category membership is known. In the context of machine learning, classification is generally considered as an instance of supervised learning. When a particular training set of correctly identified observations are available, then it is known as supervised learning. An algorithm that implements classification in a perfect concrete implementation form is known as a classifier. Sometimes classifiers can also refer to any mathematical functions which could be implemented by any classification algorithm where mapping of an input data to a particular category is done simultaneously. This paper reviews the different types of classifiers used for the perfect classification of epilepsy risk levels from Electroencephalography signals.	[Harikumar, R.; Kumar, P.

In order to better utilize EEG signals in identity authentication, a new analytical approach to study authentication system based on EEG signals is designed in this paper. To increase the stability of authentication signals, event evoked potentials are introduced in this study. Subjects' photos are used as stimulus source and subjects are divided into groups when signals are collected. To increase classification accuracy, several analytical methods are used in this study to collect features. A specific classifier is established for each subject to study the classification accuracy. The variation of classification accuracy under different thresholds is investigated. Moreover, the effect of subjects' genders on classification accuracy is also studied. Finally, the difference between the subjects' brain responses to their own photos and to others' photos is demonstrated in 2D brain maps.

NeuCube: A spiking neural network architecture for mapping, learning and understanding of spatio-temporal brain data	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Spiking neural networks; Spatio-temporal brain data; Pattern recognition; Data mining; EEG; FMRI; Neurogenetic data; Gene regulatory networks; Computational neuro-genetic modeling; Associative memory; Finite automata for spatio-temporal data	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CLASSIFICATION; STATES; MODEL	The brain functions as a spatio-temporal information processing machine. Spatio- and spectra-temporal brain data (STBD) are the most commonly collected data for measuring brain response to external stimuli. An enormous amount of such data has been already collected, including brain structural and functional data under different conditions, molecular and genetic data, in an attempt to make a progress in medicine, health, cognitive science, engineering, education, neuro-economics, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), and games. Yet, there is no unifying computational framework to deal with all these types of data in order to better understand this data and the processes that generated it. Standard machine learning techniques only partially succeeded and they were not designed in the first instance to deal with such complex data. Therefore, there is a need for a new paradigm to deal with STBD. This paper reviews some methods of spiking neural networks (SNN) and argues that SNN are suitable for the creation of a unifying computational framework for learning and understanding of various STBD, such as EEG, fMRI, genetic, DTI, MEG, and NIRS, in their integration and interaction. One of the reasons is that SNN use the same computational principle that generates STBD, namely spiking information processing. This paper introduces a new SNN architecture, called NeuCube, for the creation of concrete models to map, learn and understand STBD. A NeuCube model is based on a 3D evolving SNN that is an approximate map of structural and functional areas of interest of the brain related to the modeling STBD. Gene information is included optionally in the form of gene regulatory networks (GRN) if this is relevant to the problem and the data. A NeuCube model learns from STBD and creates connections between clusters of neurons that manifest chains (trajectories) of neuronal activity. Once learning is applied, a NeuCube model can reproduce these trajectories, even if only part of the input STBD or the stimuli data is presented, thus acting as an associative memory. The NeuCube framework can be used not only to discover functional pathways from data, but also as a predictive system of brain activities, to predict and possibly, prevent certain events. Analysis of the internal structure of a model after training can reveal important spatio-temporal relationships 'hidden' in the data. NeuCube will allow the integration in one model of various brain data, information and knowledge, related to a single subject (personalized modeling) or to a population of subjects. The use of NeuCube for classification of STBD is illustrated in a case study problem of EEG data. NeuCube models result in a better accuracy of STBD classification than standard machine learning techniques. They are robust to noise (so typical in brain data) and facilitate a better interpretation of the results and understanding of the STBD and the brain conditions under which data was collected. Future directions for the use of SNN for STBD are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the decoding performance is far from being sufficient to obtain an accurate control. In this paper, we propose the use of this methodology to detect horizontal hand movements. To that end, subjects are asked to reach two targets on a screen by moving the computer mouse. First, the decoding models are computed from fast training runs where both mouse trajectories and EEG signals are recorded. Then, these models are applied to classify the movement direction in real time and compare it to the actual performed trajectories. The results show that success rates are significantly above chance levels and suggest that this could be a suitable technique to infer hand movement intention with a very short training.

The included noise can represent the quality of the recorded EEG signal, this paper proposes a signal quality assessment method for EEG signal. The method generates an automated measure to detect the noise level of the recorded EEG signal. Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient is used to represent the signals. Hidden Markov Models were used to build a classification model that classifies the EEG signals based on the noise level associated with the signal. This EEG quality assessment measure will help doctors and researchers to focus on the patterns in the signal that have high signal to noise ratio and carry more information. Moreover, our model was applied on an uncontrolled environment and on controlled environment and a result comparison was applied.

Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) is frequently used in feature extraction of motor imagery EEG signals and its performance depends heavily on the choice of frequency component. Moreover, EEG of stroke patients, which is full of noise, makes it hard for traditional CSP to extract discriminative patterns for classification. In order to deal with the subject-specific band selection, in this paper, we adopt denoising autoencoders and contractive autoencoders to extract and compose robust features from CSP features filtered in multiple frequency bands. We compare our method with traditional methods on data collected from two months clinical rehabilitation. The results not only demonstrate its superior recognition performance but also evidence the effectiveness of our BCI-FES rehabilitation training system.

Three datasets were used to evaluate their performance. In particular sleep, artifact and newborn EEG signals. Most accurate classifiers that are able to detect unwanted elements in EEG signal are found using artifact data set and tested on sleep and newborn datasets. Classification is performed using two incremental classifiers: Support Vector Machine and 1-Nearest Neighbors. The classifiers are able to classify sleep (10%) and newborn (0.5%) datasets by learning the shortest part of the data set with sufficient accuracy at least 70%. Better and quicker results were obtained by random rather than sequential selection of data. In conclusion it means that the classification is made fast. The incremental approach is supposed to save time, which neurologists spend during manual EEG signal scoring.

This algorithm involves applying the optimum allocation technique to select representative samples that reflect an entire database. This research investigates whether the optimum allocation is suitable to extract representative samples depending on their variability within the groups in the input EEG data. It also assesses whether these samples are efficient for the multiclass least square support vector machine (MLS-SVM) to classify EEG signals. The performances of the MLS-SVM with four different output coding approaches: minimum output codes (MOC), error correcting output codes (ECOC), One vs One (1vs1) and One vs All (lvsA), are evaluated with a benchmark epileptic EEG database. To test the consistency, all experiments are repeated ten times with the same classifying parameters in each classification process. The results show very high classification performances for each class, and also confirm the consistency of the proposed method in each repeated experiment. In addition, the performances by the optimum allocation based MLS-SVM method are compared with the four existing reference methods using the same database. The outcomes of this research demonstrate that the optimum allocation is very effective and efficient for extracting the representative patterns from the multiclass EEG data, and the MLS-SVM is also very well fitted with the optimum allocation technique for the EEG classification.

J	Qi, FF; Li, YQ; Wu, W				Qi, Feifei; Li, Yuanqing; Wu, Wei			RSTFC: A Novel Algorithm for Spatio-Temporal Filtering and Classification of Single-Trial EEG	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); common spatial patterns (CSPs); electroencephalogram (EEG); Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA); spatio-temporal filtering	SPARSE SPATIAL FILTER; MOTOR IMAGERY; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; PATTERNS; OPTIMIZATION; BANK	Learning optimal spatio-temporal filters is a key to feature extraction for single-trial electroencephalogram (EEG) classification. The challenges are controlling the complexity of the learning algorithm so as to alleviate the curse of dimensionality and attaining computational efficiency to facilitate online applications, e.g., brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). To tackle these barriers, this paper presents a novel algorithm, termed regularized spatio-temporal filtering and classification (RSTFC), for single-trial EEG classification. RSTFC consists of two modules. In the feature extraction module, an l(2)-regularized algorithm is developed for supervised spatio-temporal filtering of the EEG signals. Unlike the existing supervised spatio-temporal filter optimization algorithms, the developed algorithm can simultaneously optimize spatial and high-order temporal filters in an eigenvalue decomposition framework and thus be implemented highly efficiently. In the classification module, a convex optimization algorithm for sparse Fisher linear discriminant analysis is proposed for simultaneous feature selection and classification of the typically high-dimensional spatio-temporally filtered signals. The effectiveness of RSTFC is demonstrated by comparing it with several state-of-the-arts methods on three brain-computer interface (BCI) competition data sets collected from 17 subjects. Results indicate that RSTFC yields significantly higher classification accuracies than the competing methods. This paper also discusses the advantage of optimizing channel-specific temporal filters over optimizing a temporal filter common to all channels.

Motor imagery, P300 and error-related EEG-based robot arm movement control for rehabilitation purpose	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Brain-computer interfacing; Motor imagery; P300; Error-related potential; Position control of robot arm; Electroencephalography	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; WHEELCHAIR; POTENTIALS; SYSTEM; SSVEP	The paper proposes a novel approach toward EEG-driven position control of a robot arm by utilizing motor imagery, P300 and error-related potentials (ErRP) to align the robot arm with desired target position. In the proposed scheme, the users generate motor imagery signals to control the motion of the robot arm. The P300 waveforms are detected when the user intends to stop the motion of the robot on reaching the goal position. The error potentials are employed as feedback response by the user. On detection of error the control system performs the necessary corrections on the robot arm. Here, an AdaBoost-Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to decode the 4-class motor imagery and an SVM is used to decode the presence of P300 and ErRP waveforms. The average steady-state error, peak overshoot and settling time obtained for our proposed approach is 0.045, 2.8 % and 44 s, respectively, and the average rate of reaching the target is 95 %. The results obtained for the proposed control scheme make it suitable for designs of prosthetics in rehabilitative applications.	[Bhattacharyya, Saugat; Tibarewala, D.

We review research findings regarding associations between attachment classifications and frontal EEG asymmetry, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HPA). Studies indicate that insecure attachment is related to a heightened adrenocortical activity, heart rate and skin conductance in response to stress, which is consistent with the hypothesis that attachment insecurity leads to impaired emotion regulation. Research on frontal EEG asymmetry also shows a clear difference in the emotional arousal between the attachment groups evidenced by specific frontal asymmetry changes. Furthermore, we discuss neurophysiological evidence of attachment organization and present up-to-date findings of EEG-research with adults. Based on the overall patterns of results presented in this article we identify some major areas of Interest and directions for future research.

A definition and classification of status epilepticus - Report of the ILAE Task Force on Classification of Status Epilepticus	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Status epilepticus; Seizure; Definition; Classification; Seizure duration	NONCONVULSIVE STATUS EPILEPTICUS; MYOCLONIC STATUS EPILEPTICUS; SEIZURES; CRITERIA; EPILEPSY; ABSENCE; LONG	The Commission on Classification and Terminology and the Commission on Epidemiology of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) have charged a Task Force to revise concepts, definition, and classification of status epilepticus (SE). The proposed new definition of SE is as follows: Status epilepticus is a condition resulting either from the failure of the mechanisms responsible for seizure termination or from the initiation of mechanisms, which lead to abnormally, prolonged seizures (after time point t(1)). It is a condition, which can have long-term consequences (after time point t(2)), including neuronal death, neuronal injury, and alteration of neuronal networks, depending on the type and duration of seizures. This definition is conceptual, with two operational dimensions: the first is the length of the seizure and the time point (t(1)) beyond which the seizure should be regarded as continuous seizure activity. The second time point (t(2)) is the time of ongoing seizure activity after which there is a risk of long-term consequences. In the case of convulsive (tonic-clonic) SE, both time points (t(1) at 5min and t(2) at 30min) are based on animal experiments and clinical research. This evidence is incomplete, and there is furthermore considerable variation, so these time points should be considered as the best estimates currently available. Data are not yet available for other forms of SE, but as knowledge and understanding increase, time points can be defined for specific forms of SE based on scientific evidence and incorporated into the definition, without changing the underlying concepts. A new diagnostic classification system of SE is proposed, which will provide a framework for clinical diagnosis, investigation, and therapeutic approaches for each patient. There are four axes: (1) semiology; (2) etiology; (3) electroencephalography (EEG) correlates; and (4) age. Axis 1 (semiology) lists different forms of SE divided into those with prominent motor systems, those without prominent motor systems, and currently indeterminate conditions (such as acute confusional states with epileptiform EEG patterns). Axis 2 (etiology) is divided into subcategories of known and unknown causes. Axis 3 (EEG correlates) adopts the latest recommendations by consensus panels to use the following descriptors for the EEG: name of pattern, morphology, location, time-related features, modulation, and effect of intervention. Finally, axis 4 divides age groups into neonatal, infancy, childhood, adolescent and adulthood, and elderly.

Visually or auditory evoked concentration affects information processing in human brain. To understand the concentration process of humans, the underlying neural mechanism needs to be explored. EEG device is a promising device to understand underlying neural mechanism of various cognitive functions. In this paper, we propose an accurate concentration monitoring method using a low cost EEG device. Our low cost EEG device has two channel electrodes (FP1, FP2). Usually small channel EEG devices face filtering problem because commonly used filtering method, such as ICA, fails with less number of electrodes. In our work, we investigate effective filters for removing noises from raw data and suitable features for monitoring the concentration status with the low cost EEG device in real time. We collect EEG data from 10 participants for rest state with open eyes and concentration task state. For concentration task, Sudoku game is used. Using support vector machine, we successfully distinguish between rest state and concentration state over 88 % accuracy in real time.

Exploiting the temporal patterning of transient VEP signals: A statistical single-trial methodology with implications to. brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						BCI; Decoding; Mahalanobis-Taguchi system; Transient VEPs	CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES; EEG; SYSTEM	Background: When visual evoked potentials (VEPs) are deployed in brain computer interfaces (BCIs), the emphasis is put on stimulus design. In the case of transient VEPs (TVEPs) brain responses are never treated individually, i.e. on a single-trial (ST) basis, due to their poor signal quality. Therefore their main characteristic, which is the emergence during early latencies, remains unexplored. New method: Following a pattern-analytic methodology, we investigated the possibility of using single-trial TVEP responses to differentiate between the different spatial locations where a particular visual stimulus appeared and decide whether it was attended or unattended by the subject. Results: Covert spatial attention modulates the temporal patterning of TVEPs in such a way that a brief ST-segment, from a single synthesized sensor, is sufficient for a Mahalanobis-Taguchi (MT) system to decode subject's intention. Comparison with existing method(s): In contrast to previous VEP-based approaches, stimulus-related information and user's intention are being decoded from transient ST-signals via exploiting aspects of brain response in the temporal domain. Conclusions: We demonstrated that in the TVEP signals there is sufficient discriminative information, coming in the form of a temporal code. We were able to introduce an efficient scheme that can fully exploit this information for the benefit of online classification. The measured performance brings high expectations for incorporating these ideas in BCI-control. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We first identify pre-/post-stimulus EEG oscillatory activities that are correlated with the intensity of laser-evoked pain perception using a multivariate linear regression (MVLR) model, which is solved by partial least-squares regression (PLSR). Further, we used the MVLR model to predict the intensity of pain perception from identified pain-correlated time-frequency EEG data for each subject. Our results showed that the proposed MVLR prediction model provided a qualitative prediction of pain (classification of low pain and high pain) with an accuracy of 78.53 +/- 1.16% and a quantitative prediction of pain (on a continuous scale from 0 to 10) with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.45 +/- 0.05, both of which are significantly better than the results of the conventional pain prediction based on single-trial detection of laser-evoked potentials. Besides, for the first time it was found that the pre-stimulus EEG oscillation could significantly contribute to the prediction, which extended our notion of the determinants of pain perception.

In this paper, we introduce recent advanced deep learning models to classify two emotional categories (positive and negative) from EEG data. We train a deep belief network (DBN) with differential entropy features extracted from multichannel EEG as input. A hidden markov model (HMM) is integrated to accurately capture a more reliable emotional stage switching.

J	Linden, DEJ				Linden, David E. J.			Neurofeedback and networks of depression	DIALOGUES IN CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						emotion; frontal lobe; functional magnetic resonance imaging; limbic system; mood disorder; self-regulation	DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; ASYMMETRY; TIME; CLASSIFICATION; VALIDATION; ACTIVATION; CHALLENGES; OUTCOMES; THERAPY; TRIALS	Recent advances in imaging technology and in the understanding of neural circuits relevant to emotion, motivation, and depression have boosted interest and experimental work in neuromodulation for affective disorders. Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to train patients in the self-regulation of these circuits, and thus complement existing neurofeedback technologies based on electroencephalography (EEG). EEG neurofeedback for depression has mainly been based on models of altered hemispheric asymmetry. fMRI-based neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) can utilize functional localizer scans that allow the dynamic adjustment of the target areas or networks for self-regulation training to individual patterns of emotion processing. An initial application of fMRI-NF in depression has produced promising clinical results, and further clinical trials are under way. Challenges lie in the design of appropriate control conditions for rigorous clinical trials, and in the transfer of neurofeedback protocols from the laboratory to mobile devices to enhance the sustainability of any clinical benefits.

J	Spuler, M; Niethammer, C				Spueler, Martin; Niethammer, Christian			Error-related potentials during continuous feedback: using EEG to detect errors of different type and severity	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						error-related potential (ErrP); error-related negativity (Ne/ERN); feedback related negativity (FRN); brain-computer interface (BCI); human-computer interaction; performance monitoring; asynchronous classification	ERP COMPONENTS; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; SPECTRA	When a person recognizes an error during a task, an error-related potential (ErrP) can be measured as response. It has been shown that ErrPs can be automatically detected in tasks with time discrete feedback, which is widely applied in the field of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for error correction or adaptation. However, there are only a few studies that concentrate on ErrPs during continuous feedback. With this study, we wanted to answer three different questions: (i) Can ErrPs be measured in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during a task with continuous cursor control? (ii) Can ErrPs be classified using machine learning methods and is it possible to discriminate errors of different origins? (iii) Can we use EEG to detect the severity of an error? To answer these questions, we recorded EEG data from 10 subjects during a video game task and investigated two different types of error (execution error, due to inaccurate feedback; outcome error, due to not achieving the goal of an action). We analyzed the recorded data to show that during the same task, different kinds of error produce different ErrP waveforms and have a different spectral response. This allows us to detect and discriminate errors of different origin in an event-locked manner. By utilizing the error-related spectral response, we show that also a continuous, asynchronous detection of errors is possible. Although the detection of error severity based on EEG was one goal of this study, we did not find any significant influence of the severity on the EEG.

To improve the classification accuracy for electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, a novel KF-PP-SVM (kernel fisher, posterior probability, and support vector machine) classification method is developed. Its detailed process entails the use of common spatial patterns to obtain features, based on which the within-class scatter is calculated. Then the scatter is added into the kernel function of a radial basis function to construct a new kernel function. This new kernel is integrated into the SVM to obtain a new classification model. Finally, the output of SVM is calculated based on posterior probability and the final recognition result is obtained. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed KF-PP-SVM method, EEG data collected from laboratory are processed with four different classification schemes (KF-PP-SVM, KF-SVM, PP-SVM, and SVM). The results showed that the overall average improvements arising from the use of the KF-PP-SVM scheme as opposed to KF-SVM, PP-SVM and SVM schemes are 2.49%, 5.83 % and 6.49 % respectively.

One of the recurrent problems is to know exactly when to activate such devices. For the execution of the most common activities of daily living, these devices only need to be active when in the presence of a goal. Therefore, we believe that the distinction between the planning of goal-directed and aimless movements, using non-invasive recordings, can be useful for the implementation of a simple and effective activation method for these devices. We investigated whether those differences are detectable during a reach-and-touch task, using electroencephalography (EEG). Event-related potentials and oscillatory activity changes were studied. Our results show that there are statistically significant differences between both types of movement. Combining this information with movement decoding would allow a natural control strategy for BCIs, exclusively relying on the cognitive processes behind movement preparation and execution.

In addition, we developed a patient-independent seizure detection algorithm using Freiburg EEG database. Each patient contains datasets called "ictal" and "interictal". Window length of 16 s was applied to extract EEG segments from datasets of each patient. Furthermore, Power Spectral Density (PSD) of each EEG segment was estimated using different spectral analysis methods. Afterwards, these values were fed as input to different machine learning methods that were responsible for seizure detection. We also applied MSPCA de-noising method to EEG segments prior to PSD estimation to determine if MSPCA can further enhance the classifiers' performance. The MSPCA drastically improved both the sensitivity and the specificity, increasing the overall accuracy of all three classifiers up to 20 %. The best overall detection accuracy (99.59 %) was achieved when Eigenvector analysis was used for frequency estimation, and C4.5 as a classifier. The experiment results show that MSPCA is an effective de-noising method for improving the classification performance in epileptic seizure detection.

In this paper, a model has been introduced that integrates Weighted Permutation Entropy (WPE) as input feature to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning model to enhance the sensitivity and precision of the detection process. WPE is a modified statistical parameter of the permutation entropy (PE) that measures the complexity and irregularity of a time series. It incorporates both the mapped ordinal pattern of the time series and the information contained in the amplitude of its sample points. The proposed system utilizes the fact that entropy based measures for the EEG segments during epileptic seizure are lower than in normal EEG.

In this paper, a novel classification model based on independent component analysis (ICA) and Extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed to detect lying. Firstly, ICA and its topography information were used to automatically identify the P300 ICs. Then, time and frequency-domain features were extracted from the reconstructed P3 waveforms. Finally, two classes of feature samples were used to train ELM, Back-propagation network (BPNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for comparison. The optimal number of P3 ICs and the values of classifier parameter were optimized by the cross-validation procedures. Experimental results show that the presented method (ICA_ELM) achieves the highest training accuracy of 95.40% with extremely less training and testing time on detecting P3 components for the guilty and the innocent subjects. The results indicate that the proposed method can be applied in lie detection.

In our propose algorithm, we first analyze time-frequency spectrum of EEG signals using short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and then we apply the LBG algorithm to extract the features of EEG signals via the vector quantization. Next, we calculate the degree of the similarity on the time series pattern of EEG signals. Finally, the motor imagery EEG signal is determined by using the method of the k-nearest neighbors (KNN).

Classification of EEG signals is an important task in BCI applications. This paper investigates two common methods of feature extraction on EEG signals, autoregressive (AR) model and approximate entropy. AR coefficients of each segment of each channel are calculated by AR model and entropies of each channel are also calculated by approximate entropy. A combination strategy of feature extraction, where each feature vector consists of AR coefficients and approximate entropies, is proposed in this paper. Extreme learning machine is employed as a classifier for evaluating the classification performance. The classification of five different mental tasks is evaluated by the proposed method. It can be observed from experimental results that the proposed method can effectively improve the classification performance, and achieve a good compromise between classification accuracy and computational cost.

This paper proposes a novel algorithm for joint selection of time segment and frequency band for multiclass motor imagery based BCIs. A task-independent sliding window method, which does not require any prior knowledge, is used for the choice. Approximation joint diagonalization (AJD) based multiclass common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is utilized for feature extraction and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) is used for classification. The algorithm was tested and compared with three typical methods on a four-class motor imagery data set The experimental results suggested that based on the chosen time segment and frequency band, the proposed algorithm achieved superior performance with regard to classification accuracy.

This study investigates the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the classification of multi-class MI-EEG signals. Augmented common spatial pattern (ACSP) features are generated based on pair-wise projection matrices, which covers various frequency ranges. We propose a frequency complementary feature map selection (FCMS) scheme by constraining the dependency among frequency bands. Experiments are conducted on BCI competition IV dataset IIa with 9 subjects. Averaged cross-validation accuracy of 68.45% and 69.27% is achieved for FCMS and all feature maps, respectively, which is significantly higher (4.53% and 5.34%) than random map selection and higher (1.44% and 2.26%) than filter-bank CSP (FBCSP). The results demonstrate that the CNNs are capable of learning discriminant, deep structure features for EEG classification without relying on the handcrafted features.

We investigated if systematic changes in breathing rate affect EEG bandpower features that are commonly used in BCIs. This is of particular interest for the development of cognitive BCIs for patients with artificial ventilation, e.g. for those in late stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). If subjects can alter the spectrum of the EEG by changing their breathing rate, decoding results obtained with healthy subjects may not generalize to this patient population. We recorded a high-density EEG from twelve healthy subjects, who were instructed to alternate between fast and slow breathing. We do not find any statistically significant modulation of EEG bandpower. As such, changes in breathing rate are unlikely to substantially bias the performance of BCIs based on EEG bandpower features.

This approach is used in order to account for the fact that EEG signals from the same person for the same stimulus have variations in different observations in the same as well as over different days of experiments. Adaptive Autoregressive Parameters, Hjorth Parameters, Hurst Exponents and Approximate Entropy features are extracted from the acquired EEG signals to obtain the maximum possible discrimination between different classes of activities. A maximum classification accuracy of 85.33 % on an average over all subjects and classes is obtained using IT2FS classifier on a combined feature space. The study is validated using Friedman's statistical test with respect to four other classification algorithms.

To develop practical brain computer interface (BCI) systems that cope with such inevitable variability, one possible scenario is to prepare a brain signal database that covers various situations occurring in the target environment.

Results from the literature, however, suggest that current implementations of this approach does not lead to desired results ("BCI inefficiency"). In this paper, we propose an alternative strategy that implements some recommendations from educational psychology and instructional design. We present a jigsaw puzzle game for Android devices developed to train the BCI skill in individuals with cerebral palsy (CP). Preliminary results of a supporting study in four CP users suggest high user acceptance. Three out of the four users achieved better than chance accuracy in arranging pieces to form the puzzle.

In this paper, aiming at classifying EEG data based on Motor Imagery task, Deep Learning (DL) algorithm was applied. For the classification of left and right hand motor imagery, firstly, based on certain single channel, a weak classifier was trained by deep belief net (DBN); then borrow the idea of Ada-boost algorithm to combine the trained weak classifiers as a more powerful one. During the process of constructing DBN structure, many RBMs (Restrict Boltzmann Machine) are stacked on top of each other by setting the hidden layer of the bottom layer RBM as the visible layer of the next RBM, and Contrastive Divergence (CD) algorithm was also exploited to train multilayered DBN effectively. The performance of the proposed DBN was tested with different combinations of hidden units and hidden layers on multiple subjects, the experimental results showed that the proposed method performs better with 8 hidden layers. The recognition accuracy results were compared with Support vector machine (SVM) and DBN classifier demonstrated better performance in all tested cases. There was an improvement of 4 - 6% for certain cases.

In recent years, many algorithms for the automatic seizure detection have been proposed and applied, in which Support vector machines proved to be a robust machine learning algorithm. The purpose of this study is to compute relevant EEG features and apply a feature selection algorithm to select an optimum set of features for use in a classification scheme for epileptic seizure detection. Thus SVM will thereby yield a better accuracy compared to other algorithms. Effective features such as energy, relative amplitude, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, fluctuation index etc are selected and then these features are fed into the support vector machine for training and classification. This algorithm makes use of Radial Basis Function Kernels for training data and thus obtains more accurate results.

In this article, we investigate which causal statements are warranted and which ones are not supported by empirical evidence. We argue that the distinction between encoding and decoding models is not sufficient for this purpose: relevant features in encoding and decoding models carry a different meaning in stimulus-and in response-based experimental paradigms. We show that only encoding models in the stimulus-based setting support unambiguous causal interpretations. By combining encoding and decoding models trained on the samedata, however, we obtain insights into causal relations beyond those that are implied by each individual model type. We illustrate the empirical relevance of our theoretical findings on EEG data recorded during a visuo-motor learning task. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

After several decades of research in fields such as neuroscience and machine learning, the performance remains too low due to the low signal to noise ratio of the EEG signal, and the time that has to be dedicated to the recording of the brain responses. Hybrid BCIs consider the combination of several modalities, including brain responses, for new communication systems. The creation of a Hybrid BCI requires particular care as it possesses the constraints from several modalities. We propose to investigate the performance that could be achieved in a paradigm, where gaze control is used for the selection of an item on a computer screen and motor imagery is used to enable the selected item on the screen. Based on the results obtained from gaze detection with an eye tracker, and motor imagery detection with non-invasive EEG recording, we show that the performance of a parallel Hybrid BCI is only beneficial if the accuracy of each modality reaches a particular limit, and if the number of commands from each modality is carefully chosen.

In many of these situations, there is a rapid assessment by the shooter that recognizes a threat and responds to it with return fire. But the neural processes underlying these rapid decisions are largely unknown, especially amongst those with extensive weapons experience and expertise. In this paper, we investigate differences in weapons experts and non-experts during an incoming gunfire detection task. Specifically, we analyzed the electroencephalography (EEG) of eleven expert marksmen/soldiers and eleven non-experts while they listened to an audio scene consisting of a sequence of incoming and non-incoming gunfire events. Subjects were tasked with identifying each event as quickly as possible and committing their choice via a motor response. Contrary to our hypothesis, experts did not have significantly better behavioral performance or faster response time than novices. Rather, novices indicated trends of better behavioral performance than experts. These group differences were more dramatic in the EEG correlates of incoming gunfire detection. Using machine learning, we found condition-discriminating EEG activity among novices showing greater magnitude and covering longer periods than those found in experts. We also compared group-level source reconstruction on the maximum discriminating neural correlates and found that each group uses different neural structures to perform the task. From condition-discriminating EEG and source localization, we found that experts perceive more categorical overlap between incoming and non-incoming gunfire. Consequently, the experts did not perform as well behaviorally as the novices. We explain these unexpected group differences as a consequence of experience with gunfire not being equivalent to expertise in recognizing incoming gunfire.

Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are often based on motor- and/or sensory processes that are known to be impaired in late stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We propose a novel BCI designed for patients in late stages of ALS that only requires high-level cognitive processes to transmit information from the user to the BCI. Approach. We trained subjects via EEG-based neurofeedback to self-regulate the amplitude of gamma-oscillations in the superior parietal cortex (SPC). We argue that parietal gamma-oscillations are likely to be associated with high-level attentional processes, thereby providing a communication channel that does not rely on the integrity of sensory- and/or motor-pathways impaired in late stages of ALS. Main results. Healthy subjects quickly learned to self-regulate gamma-power in the SPC by alternating between states of focused attention and relaxed wakefulness, resulting in an average decoding accuracy of 70.2%. One locked-in ALS patient (ALS-FRS-R score of zero) achieved an average decoding accuracy significantly above chance-level though insufficient for communication (55.8%). Significance. Self-regulation of gamma-power in the SPC is a feasible paradigm for brain-computer interfacing and may be preserved in late stages of ALS. This provides a novel approach to testing whether completely locked-in ALS patients retain the capacity for goal-directed thinking.

Clinical utility of early amplitude integrated EEG in monitoring term newborns at risk of neurological injury	JORNAL DE PEDIATRIA			English	Article						Amplitude integrated electroencephalography (aEEG); Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE); Neonatal intensive care; Seizures	CEREBRAL ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; NEONATAL ENCEPHALOPATHY; PERINATAL ASPHYXIA; PREDICTIVE-VALUE; INFANTS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; SEIZURES; BIRTH; HYPOTHERMIA; PATTERNS	Objective: to test the clinical utility of an early amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) to predict short-term neurological outcome in term newborns at risk of neurology injury. Methods: this was a prospective, descriptive study. The inclusion criteria were neonatal encephalopathy, neurologic disturbances, and severe respiratory distress syndrome. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and likelihood ratio (LR) were calculated. Clinical and demographic data were analyzed. Neurological outcome was defined as the sum of clinical, electroimaging, and neuroimaging findings. Results: ten of the 21 monitored infants (48%) presented altered short-term neurologic outcome. The aEEG had 90% sensitivity, 82% specificity, 82% positive predictive value, and 90% negative predictive value. The positive LR was 4.95, and the negative LR was 0.12. In three of 12 (25%) encephalopathic infants, the aEEG allowed for a better definition of the severity of their condition. Seizures were detected in eight infants (38%), all subclinical at baseline, and none had a normal aEEG background pattern. The status of three infants (43%) evolved and required two or more drugs for treatment. Conclusions: in infants with encephalopathy or other severe illness, aEEG disturbances occur frequently. aEEG provided a better classification of the severity of encephalopathy, detected early subclinical seizures, and allowed for monitoring of the response to treatment. aEEG was a useful tool at the neonatal intensive care unit for predicting poor short-term neurological outcomes for all sick newborn.

This work analyzes the network mechanisms related to human emotion based on synchronization measure - phase-locking value in EEG to formulate the emotion specific brain functional network. Based on network dissimilarities between emotion and rest tasks, most reactive channel pairs and the reactive band corresponding to emotions are identified. With the identified most reactive pairs, the subject-specific functional network is formed. The identified subject-specific and emotion-specific dynamic network pattern show significant synchrony variation in line with the experiment protocol. The same network pattern are then employed for classification of emotions. With the study conducted on the 4 subjects, an average classification accuracy of 62% was obtained with the proposed technique.	[Gonuguntla, V.; Shafiq, G.; Wang, Y.; Veluvolu, K.

Discriminant brain connectivity patterns of performance monitoring at average and single-trial levels	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Monitoring error; EEG; Brain connectivity; Anterior cingulate cortex; Single-trial classification; Multivariate auto-regressive model	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; DIRECTED TRANSFER-FUNCTION; ERROR-RELATED NEGATIVITY; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; THETA OSCILLATIONS; RESPONSE CONFLICT; GRANGER CAUSALITY; CORTICAL NETWORKS; WORKING-MEMORY; NEURAL SYSTEMS	Electrophysiological and neuroimaging evidence suggest the existence of common mechanisms for monitoring erroneous events, independent of the source of errors. Previous works have described modulations of theta activity in the medial frontal cortex elicited by either self-generated errors or erroneous feedback. In turn, similar patterns have recently been reported to appear after the observation of external errors. We report cross-regional interactions after observation of errors at both average and single-trial levels. We recorded scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 15 subjects while monitoring the movement of a cursor on a computer screen. Connectivity patterns, estimated using multivariate auto-regressive models, show increased error-related modulations of the information transfer in the theta and alpha bands between frontocentral and frontolateral areas. Conversely, a decrease of connectivity in the beta band is also observed. These network patterns are similar to those elicited by self-generated errors. However, since no motor response is required, they appear to be related to intrinsic mechanisms of error processing, instead of being linked to co-activation of motor areas. Noticeably, we demonstrate that cross-regional interaction patterns can be estimated on a trial-by-trial basis. These trial-specific patterns, consistent with the multi-trial analysis, convey discriminant information on whether a trial was elicited by observation of an erroneous action. Overall, our study supports the role of frequency-specific modulations in the medial frontal cortex in coordinating cross-regional activity during cognitive monitoring at a single-trial basis.

A Closed-loop Brain Computer Interface to a Virtual Reality Avatar: Gait Adaptation to Visual Kinematic Perturbations	2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON VIRTUAL REHABILITATION PROCEEDINGS (ICVR)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Virtual Rehabilitation Proceedings (ICVR)	JUN 09-12, 2015	Valencia, SPAIN	Bright Cloud Int		Brain machine interlace; visuomator adaptation; virtual environment; gait adaptation	TREADMILL EXERCISE; CHRONIC STROKE; WALKING; REHABILITATION; INDIVIDUALS; PARAMETERS	The control of human bipedal locomotion is of great interest to the field of lower-body brain computer interfaces (BCIs) for rehabilitation of gait. While the feasibility of a closed-loop BCI system for the control of a lower body exoskeleton has been recently shown, multi-day closed-loop neural decoding of human gait in a virtual reality (BCI-VR) environment has yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we propose a real-time closed-loop BCI that decodes lower limb joint angles from scalp electroencephalography (EEC) during treadmill walking to control the walking movements of a virtual avatar. Moreover, virtual kinematic perturbations resulting in asymmetric walking gait patterns of the avatar were also introduced to investigate gait adaptation using the closed-loop BCI-VR system over a period of eight days. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using a closed-loop BCI to learn to control a walking avatar under normal and altered visuomotor perturbations, which involved cortical adaptations. These findings have implications for the development of BCI-VR systems for gait rehabilitation after stroke and for understanding cortical plasticity induced by a closed-loop BCI system.

Classification of Human Emotions from EEG Signals using Filtering and ANFIS Classifier	SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CURRENT TRENDS IN ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY (ICCTET 2014)	International Conference on Current Trends in Engineering and Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Current Trends In Engineering and Technology (ICCTET)	JUL 08, 2014	Coimbatore, INDIA			Brain signal; Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system; adaptive filtering	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; RECOGNITION	Human emotion classification has been an attractive research area in the field of data mining. Several research works have been carried out for investigating the classification system for human emotions. This research article is intended to deal with the classification of human emotions through Electroencephalogram (EEG). The essential aspects of this system are feature extraction and accurate classification of the emotion-related EEG-characteristics to attain a significant emotion recognition system. In this research work, the emotions and the patterns of EEG signals of human brain are studied. The aim of this work is to investigate the changes in the brain signals in the domain of different emotions. The study can be analyzed for its utility in the diagnosis of psychosomatic disorders like anxiety and depression in economical way with higher precision. The modified adaptive filtering for signal preprocessing is proposed in this system for removing the noise and artifacts in EEG signal. The adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system is also proposed for classifying and analyzing the emotions based on the features selected. The proposed system is compared with the existing system and the performance of the proposed system is evaluated using the metrics such as specificity and sensitivity.

This method can be used into a brain-computer interface system that encourages golfers for putting when their EEG patterns show that they are ready. In the proposed method, multi-channel EEG trials of a golfer are collected from the electrodes placed at different scalp locations in one particular second when she/he concentrates on putting preparation. The EEG trials are used to predict two possible outcomes: successful or failed putts. This binary classification is performed by the support vector machine (SVM). Based on the collected time-domain EEG signals, the spectral coherences from 22-pair electrodes are calculated and then used as the feature and input for the SVM algorithm. Our experimental results show that the proposed method using EEG coherence significantly outperforms the SVM with other popular features such as power spectral density (PSD), average PSD, power, and average spectral coherence.

The Wilcoxon test is employed to rank wavelet coefficients. Top ranking wavelets are used to form a feature set that serves as inputs to the fuzzy classifiers. Experiments are carried out using two benchmark datasets, Ia and Ib, downloaded from the BCI competition II. Prevalent classifiers including feed forward neural network, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbours, ensemble learning Adaboost and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system are also implemented for comparisons.

However, the exact length of the preictal state is unclear and varies from seizure to seizure. We propose a novel statistical approach for proper selection of the preictal period, which can also be considered either as a measure of predictability of a seizure or as the prediction capability of an understudy feature. The optimal preictal periods (OPPs) obtained from the training samples can be used for building a more accurate classifier model. The proposed method uses amplitude distribution histograms of features extracted from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. To evaluate this method, we extract spectral power features in different frequency bands from monopolar and space-differential EEG signals of 18 patients suffering from pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Furthermore, comparisons among monopolar channels with space-differential channels, as well as intracranial EEG (iEEG) and surface EEG (sEEG) signals, indicate that while monopolar signals perform better in iEEG recordings, no significant difference is noticeable in sEEG recordings.

These systems are trained to classify the EEG based on the ground truth provided by the neurologists. So, there should be a mechanism in these systems, using which a system's incorrect markings can be mentioned and the system should improve its classification by learning from them. We have developed a simple mechanism for neurologists to improve classification rate while encountering any false classification. This system is based on taking discrete wavelet transform(DWT) of the signals epochs which are then reduced using principal component analysis, and then they are fed into a classifier. After discussing our approach, we have shown the classification performance of three types of classifiers: support vector machine (SVM), quadratic discriminant analysis, and artificial neural network. We found SVM to be the best working classifier. Our work exhibits the importance and viability of a self-improving and user adapting computer-assisted EEG analysis system for diagnosing epilepsy which processes each channel exclusive to each other, along with the performance comparison of different machine learning techniques in the suggested system.

Remaining challenges are among others a low signal-to-noise ratio of neural signals, lack of robustness for decoders in the presence of inter-trial and inter-subject variability, time constraints on the calibration phase and the use of BCIs outside a controlled lab environment. Recent advances in BCI research addressed these issues by novel combinations of complementary analysis as well as recording techniques, so called hybrid BCIs. In this paper, we review a number of data fusion techniques for BCI along with hybrid methods for BCI that have recently emerged. Our focus will be on sensorimotor rhythm-based BCIs. We will give an overview of the three main lines of research in this area, integration of complementary features of neural activation, integration of multiple previous sessions and of multiple subjects, and show how these techniques can be used to enhance modern BCI systems.

We discussed the novel channel-wise convolutional neural network (CCNN) and CCNN-R which is a CCNN variation that uses Restricted Boltzmann Machine in order to replace the convolutional filter. We also consider bagging classifiers based on DL hidden units as an alternative to the conventional DL solutions. To test the performance of the proposed methods, a large EEG dataset from 3 studies of driver's fatigue that includes 70 sessions from 37 subjects is assembled. All proposed methods are tested on both raw EEG and Independent Component Analysis (ICA)-transformed data for cross-session predictions. The results show that CCNN and CCNN-R outperform deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) as well as other non-DL algorithms and DL with raw EEG inputs achieves better performance than ICA features.

Actually, one major concern is to find a correlation between several physiologic variables and sleep stages. There is a scientific agreement on the characteristics of the five stages of human sleep, based on EEG analysis. Nevertheless, manual stage classification is still the most widely used approach. This work proposes a new automatic sleep classification method based on unsupervised feature classification algorithms recently developed, and on EEG entropy measures. This scheme extracts entropy metrics from EEG records to obtain a feature vector. Then, these features are optimized in terms of relevance using the Q-alpha algorithm. Finally, the resulting set of features is entered into a clustering procedure to obtain a final segmentation of the sleep stages. The proposed method reached up to an average of 80% correctly classified stages for each patient separately while keeping the computational cost low.

The particular characteristics of the considered low-amplitude signals (a self-induced emotion produces a signal whose amplitude is about 15% of a really experienced emotion) require exploring and adapting strategies like the Wavelet Transform, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) for signal processing, analysis and classification. Moreover, the method is thought to be used in a multi-emotions based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) and, for this reason, an ad hoc shrewdness is assumed. Method: The peculiarity of the brain activation requires ad-hoc signal processing by wavelet decomposition, and the definition of a set of features for signal characterization in order to discriminate different self-induced emotions. The proposed method is a two stages algorithm, completely parameterized, aiming at a multi-class classification and may be considered in the framework of machine learning. The first stage, the calibration, is off-line and is devoted at the signal processing, the determination of the features and at the training of a classifier. The second stage, the real-time one, is the test on new data. The PCA theory is applied to avoid redundancy in the set of features whereas the classification of the selected features, and therefore of the signals, is obtained by the SVM. Results: Some experimental tests have been conducted on EEG signals proposing a binary BCI, based on the self-induced disgust produced by remembering an unpleasant odor. Since in literature it has been shown that this emotion mainly involves the right hemisphere and in particular the T8 channel, the classification procedure is tested by using just T8, though the average accuracy is calculated and reported also for the whole set of the measured channels. Conclusions: The obtained classification results are encouraging with percentage of success that is, in the average for the whole set of the examined subjects, above 90%. An ongoing work is the application of the proposed procedure to map a large set of emotions with EEG and to establish the EEG headset with the minimal number of channels to allow the	[Iacoviello, Daniela] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn Antonio Ruber, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Petracca, Andrea; Spezialetti, Matteo; Placidi, Giuseppe] Univ LAquila, Dept Life Hlth & Environm Sci, A2VI Lab, I-67100 Laquila, Italy		Iacoviello, D (corresponding author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn Antonio Ruber, Via Ariosto 25, I-00185 Rome, Italy.	iacoviello@dis.uniroma1.it	Placidi, Giuseppe/R-4065-2019	Placidi, Giuseppe/0000-0002-4790-4029; Spezialetti, Matteo/0000-0001-5786-3999; Iacoviello, Daniela/0000-0003-3506-1455	Fondazione Fabio Sciacca Onlus	Fondazione Fabio Sciacca Onlus	The authors are very grateful to the "Fondazione Fabio Sciacca Onlus" for having supported this research project.

Electroencephalograph (EEG) based Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is one of the most important tools for detecting one's brain electrical activities. Unfortunately, several problems including its sensitivity to artifacts, inaccurate labels and the great diversity of patterns within EEG signals present great challenges to predict vigilance level reliably. In this paper we propose an integrated approach to estimate vigilance level, which incorporates an automatically artifact removing preprocess, a novel vigilance labeling method and finally a Gaussian Mixed Model (GMM) to discover the underlying pattern of EEG signals. Extensive off-line experiments are conducted on 12 groups of data sets to show the effectiveness of our integrated approach in the real-time application. A reasonably high classification performance (88.46% over 12 data sets) is obtained with low delay by employing only one channel in the frontal lobe, which is in accordance with the conclusions of brain science and is of significance in practice.

EEG is a brain mapping technique, which can record brain states directly and can be used to assess learning and memory recall. In this paper, we will assess the effects of 2D and 3D educational contents on learning and memory recall by analyzing the brain states during recall tasks using EEG signals. 34 subjects learn same 2D and 3D educational contents and after 30 minutes, they are asked multiple-choice questions (MCQs) related to the learned contents. Though the answers of MCQs can be used to assess the effects of 2D and 3D educational contents on learning and memory recall, the correct answer of an MCQ can be based on just a guess. We studied direct brain states by analyzing EEG signals for this purpose and modeled it as a classification problem. While answering an MCQ, EEG signal is recorded, which is then converted into topomaps. The number of topomaps corresponding to one MCQ is excessively high and there is a large number of redundant topomaps, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce this number. Finally, statistical features are extracted from these topomaps and passed to Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict brain states corresponding to correct/incorrect answers. The results of the study showed that 3D content gave 81.6% classification accuracy compared with 76.1% given by 2D content. It indicates that 3D educational content is more effective than 2D educational content. The proposed system can used to predict the memory recall level of a subject, which can help to select the educational content and future carrier for a subject.

In this study, an optimized classification method was tested in 147 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) treated with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). The performance of the combination of a genetic algorithm (GA) and a back-propagation (BP) neural network (BPNN) was evaluated using 6-channel pre-rTMS electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns of theta and delta frequency bands. The GA was first used to eliminate the redundant and less discriminant features to maximize classification performance. The BPNN was then applied to test the performance of the feature subset. Finally, classification performance using the subset was evaluated using 6-fold cross-validation. Although the slow bands of the frontal electrodes are widely used to collect EEG data for patients with MDD and provide quite satisfactory classification results, the outcomes of the proposed approach indicate noticeably increased overall accuracy of 89.12% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.904 using the reduced feature set.

In this paper, we study the feasibility of predicting the goal for controlling the robot arm in self-paced reaching movements, i.e., spontaneous movements that do not require an external cue. Our proposed system continuously estimates the goal throughout a trial starting before the movement onset by online classification and generates optimal trajectories for driving the robot arm to the estimated goal. Experiments using EEG signals of one healthy subject (right arm) yield smooth reaching movements of the simulated 7 degrees of freedom KUKA robot arm in planar center-out reaching task with approximately 80% accuracy of reaching the actual goal.

In the case of mentally practised movements, electroencephalogram (EEG) can be utilized to provide feedback about an otherwise covert act. The main target group for such an intervention are elderly patients, though research so far is largely focused on young populations (<30 years). The present study therefore aimed to examine the influence of age on the neural correlates of covert movements (CMs) in a real-time EEG neurofeedback framework. CM-induced event-related desynchronization (ERD) was studied in young (mean age: 23.6 years) and elderly (mean age: 62.7 years) healthy adults. Participants performed covert and overt hand movements. CMs were based on kinesthetic motor imagery (MI) or quasi-movements (QM). Based on previous studies investigating QM in the mu frequency range (8-13 Hz) QM were expected to result in more lateralized ERD% patterns and accordingly higher classification accuracies. Independent of CM strategy the elderly were characterized by a significantly reduced lateralization of ERD%, due to stronger ipsilateral ERD%, and in consequence, reduced classification accuracies. QM were generally perceived as more vivid, but no differences were evident between MI and QM in ERD% or classification accuracies. EEG feedback enhanced task-related activity independently of strategy and age. ERD% measures of overt and covert movements were strongly related in young adults, whereas in the elderly ERD% lateralization is dissociated. In summary, we did not find evidence in support of more pronounced ERD% lateralization patterns in QM. Our finding of a less lateralized activation pattern in the elderly is in accordance to previous research and with the idea that compensatory processes help to overcome neurodegenerative changes related to normal ageing. Importantly, it indicates that EEG neurofeedback studies should place more emphasis on the age of the potential end-users. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although great achievements have been made for the development of reliable BCI systems to assist people with upper-limb disabilities, researches on BCI development related to lower-limb are still rudimentary. In the current study, based on the regularized common spatial pattern analysis (R-CSP) method and statistical dependency, we have developed an improved feature selection method for lower-limb movement pattern classification. High-resolution electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded from four healthy male subjects undergoing real lower-limb movements. Compared to the conventional CSP, R-CSP, and PCA methods, the proposed method achieved the best average accuracy of 83.5% for single trial classification of left and right lower-limb movement. Our findings thereby have insightful implications for developing practical BCI systems for lower-limb movement.

Attentional Selection in a Cocktail Party Environment Can Be Decoded from Single-Trial EEG	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						attention; BCI; cocktail party; EEG; speech; stimulus-reconstruction	AUDITORY EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; SPEECH; RECONSTRUCTION; MECHANISMS; RESPONSES	How humans solve the cocktail party problem remains unknown. However, progress has been made recently thanks to the realization that cortical activity tracks the amplitude envelope of speech. This has led to the development of regression methods for studying the neurophysiology of continuous speech. One such method, known as stimulus-reconstruction, has been successfully utilized with cortical surface recordings and magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, the former is invasive and gives a relatively restricted view of processing along the auditory hierarchy, whereas the latter is expensive and rare. Thus it would be extremely useful for research in many populations if stimulus-reconstruction was effective using electroen-cephalography (EEG), a widely available and inexpensive technology. Here we show that single-trial (approximate to 60 s) unaveraged EEG data can be decoded to determine attentional selection in a naturalistic multi-speaker environment. Furthermore, we show a significant correlation between our EEG-based measure of attention and performance on a high-level attention task. In addition, by attempting to decode attention at individual latencies, we identify neural processing at similar to 200 ms as being critical for solving the cocktail party problem. These findings open up new avenues for studying the ongoing dynamics of cognition using EEG and for developing effective and natural brain-computer interfaces.

A discriminative spatial pattern (DSP) algorithm has been shown to be effective for extracting MRPs. However, the spatial filtering and feature extraction of DSP are not exactly consistent. In addition, DSP filtering and subsequent classifiers, such as support vector machines, are optimized toward different goals. These two drawbacks may degrade overall classification performance. In this paper, inspired by the multilayer perceptron, we propose a hierarchical framework based on a logistic regression model. Our framework directly extracts the distance between each pair of time series as a feature, and unifies spatial filtering and classification under a regularized empirical risk minimization problem. Experimental results from three BCI datasets recorded from five subjects demonstrate that our method can make more accurate classifications.

An exploration of EEG features during recovery following stroke - implications for BCI-mediated neurorehabilitation therapy	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						BCI; Stroke rehabilitation; EEG; CSP	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MOTOR IMAGERY; CLASSIFICATION; REHABILITATION	Background: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) can potentially be used to aid in the recovery of lost motor control in a limb following stroke. BCIs are typically used by subjects with no damage to the brain therefore relatively little is known about the technical requirements for the design of a rehabilitative BCI for stroke. Methods: 32-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded during a finger-tapping task from 10 healthy subjects for one session and 5 stroke patients for two sessions approximately 6 months apart. An off-line BCI design based on Filter Bank Common Spatial Patterns (FBCSP) was implemented to test and compare the efficacy and accuracy of training a rehabilitative BCI with both stroke-affected and healthy data. Results: Stroke-affected EEG datasets have lower 10-fold cross validation results than healthy EEG datasets. When training a BCI with healthy EEG, average classification accuracy of stroke-affected EEG is lower than the average for healthy EEG. Classification accuracy of the late session stroke EEG is improved by training the BCI on the corresponding early stroke EEG dataset. Conclusions: This exploratory study illustrates that stroke and the accompanying neuroplastic changes associated with the recovery process can cause significant inter-subject changes in the EEG features suitable for mapping as part of a neurofeedback therapy, even when individuals have scored largely similar with conventional behavioural measures. It appears such measures can mask this individual variability in cortical reorganization. Consequently we believe motor retraining BCI should initially be tailored to individual patients.

Post hoc analysis of 186 children with TSC who underwent resective epilepsy surgery derived from an individual participant data meta-analysis was performed. PLS was used to derive a latent variable (component) that relates clinical covariates with Engel classification. Permutation testing was performed to evaluate the significance of the component, and bootstrapping was used to identify significant contributors to the component. A significant component was identified, which represents the pattern of covariates related to Engel class. The strongest and significant factors contributing to this component were focal ictal electroencephalogram and concordance of electroencephalography (EEG)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormality. Interestingly, covariates contributing the least to the seizure-free patient phenotype were continent of treatment and age at the time of surgery. Using a data-driven, multivariate method, PLS, we describe patient phenotypes that are associated with seizure-freedom following resective surgery for TSC.

In this paper, we investigated the multiclass classification of mental task using EEG signal. Higuchi Fractal Dimension and 10-Statistic Parameters were used as feature extraction method. The 10-statistic parameters are central tendency type that is, maximum value, minimum value, mean, standard deviation, median, mode, variance, first-quartile, third-quartile, interchange quartile. Multiclass Support Vector Machine with One-against-All strategy is applied to classify EEG signal related to the mental task. The result shows that the Multiclass SVM classifier with 1-against-All strategy using 10-Statistic Parameters has a higher accuracy when compared to Higuchi Fractal Dimension-SVM, Extreme Learning Machine, Back Propagation Neural Network, both of Support Vector Machine 1-versus-1 strategy and 1-versus-All strategy. The average accuracy ranging between 99.2% and 100% for 10-Statistic Parameters-SVM and HFD_SVM ranging from 60.22% to 91.91% were gained for five mental task classes.

However, analysis of EEG signal is often complex since the signal recoding often contaminates with noises or artifacts such as ocular and muscle artifacts, which could mislead the diagnosis result. Therefore, to identify the artifacts from the EEG signal and handle it in a proper way is becoming an important and interesting research area. This paper presents an automated EEG artifacts handling approach, where it combines Independent Component Analysis (ICA) with a 2nd order clustering approach. Here, the 2nd order clustering approach combines the Hierarchical and Gaussian Picture Model clustering algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been examined and observed on the real EEG recording. According to the result, artifacts in the EEG signals are identified and removed successfully where the artifacts handled EEG signals show acceptable considering visual inspection.

BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH-INDIA			English	Article						EEG; Seizure; continuous wavelet transform; discrete wavelet transform; reconstruction error; wavelet coefficients		The analysis of EEG signals plays a vital role in the detection of Seizure. The EEG signal of a normal person varies when compared to that of a seizure affected person. A new wavelet is created which closely represents a normal EEG wave. The discrete wavelet transform using the new wavelet family is applied to the input EEG signals. Since the new wavelet represents the normal EEG wave pattern the reconstruction error is very less when a normal EEG signal is applied as an input when compared to that of a seizure EEG signal. This marked difference in the reconstruction error is used to classify the normal and seizure EEG signals. When continuous wavelet transform is applied to the input EEG signal using the new mother wavelet, the wavelet coefficients are higher in seizure EEG when compared to that of the normal EEG signal.

This study investigated maximum and mean accuracy of a MI based BCI using Common Spatial Patterns (CSP). Twenty healthy people participated in the study and were equipped with 64 active EEG electrodes. They performed a training paradigm with 160 trials by imagining either left or right hand movement to set up a subject specific CSP filter to spatially filter the EEG data. Following that, two real-time runs with 80 trials were performed, which provided feedback to the subject. The real-time accuracy was then calculated for every subject, and finally a grand average accuracy of 80.7% was reached for the 20 subjects. One person reached a perfect classification result of 100%, 30% performed above 90% and one was below 59%. The results show that most people can use a MI based BCI after a brief training time if CSPs with 64 active electrodes are used. The method of CSP yields clearly better classification results compared to a bandpower approach. While more electrodes are needed for classification, this is less of a disadvantage with modern active electrodes.

Therefore, it contains useful information for diagnosis of epilepsy. However, it is a very time consuming and costly task to handle these subtle details by a human observer. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) was proposed to automate the process of seizure detection in EEG signals. Initially, the EEG signals have been analysed using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for features extraction. Then, the PSO algorithm has been trained to recognize the epileptic signals in EEG data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of classification accuracy and stability. A comparison with other methods in the literature confirms the superiority of the PSO.

Especially, neurophysiological studies were employed to develop the novel driving assistant technologies for driver's safety. These studies verified that neurophysiological characteristics could be used for detection of emergency situations during simulated driving. However, it is impossible to control the vehicle spontaneously using previous approach. In this article, the method for decoding of driver's braking intention spontaneously is proposed to predict the amount of braking continuously based on analysis of neural correlates.

It mainly consists of feature extraction, feature selection and classification. Surface Laplacian filter is used for background removal. Several potential features, including phase features, are then extracted to enhance the classification accuracy. Next, genetic algorithm is used to select sub-features from feature combination. Finally, selected features are classified by extreme learning machine. Compared with without phase features and linear discriminant analysis on motor imagery data from 2 data sets, the results denote that the proposed system achieves enhanced performance, which is suitable for the brain-computer interface applications.

The large number of methods for the EEG feature extraction demands a good feature for every task. Digging up the most unique feature would be worthy for the identification of individual using EEG signal. This research presents a novel approach for feature extraction of EEG signal using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and information-theoretic method. The EMD technique is applied to decompose an EEG signal into a set of intrinsic mode function. These decomposed signals are of the same length and in the same time domain as the original signal. Hence, the EMD method preserves varying frequencies in time. To measure the performance of the features, we have used hybrid learning for classification where we have selected learning vector quantization neural network with fuzzy algorithm. In order to test the performance of proposed classifier based on fuzzy theory, we have tested classification accuracy of each cognitive task over all participated subjects. The results are compared with the past methods in the literature for feature extraction and classification methods. Results confirm that the proposed features present a satisfactory performance.

Augmented Complex Common Spatial Patterns for Classification of Noncircular EEG From Motor Imagery Tasks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Augmented complex common spatial pattern (ACCSP); brain-computer interface (BCI); common spatial pattern (CSP); complex noncircularity; complex pseudocovariance; motor imagery paradigm; strong-uncorrelating transform (SUT)	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; BLIND SOURCE EXTRACTION; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; RANDOM VECTORS; ACTIVATION; COMPONENTS; SIGNALS; FILTERS; MU	A novel augmented complex-valued common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is introduced in order to cater for general complex signals with noncircular probability distributions. This is a typical case in multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG), due to the power difference or correlation between the data channels, yet current methods only cater for a very restrictive class of circular data. The proposed complex-valued CSP algorithms account for the generality of complex noncircular data, by virtue of the use of augmented complex statistics and the strong-uncorrelating transform (SUT). Depending on the degree of power difference of complex signals, the analysis and simulations show that the SUT based algorithm maximizes the inter-class difference between two motor imagery tasks. Simulations on both synthetic noncircular sources and motor imagery experiments using real-world EEG support the approach.

The objective of this study is to find components that might be related to phoneme representation in the brain and to discriminate EEG responses for each speech sound on a trial basis. Approach. We used multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) and common spatial pattern for feature extraction. We chose three vowel stimuli, /a/, /i/ and /u/, based on previous findings, such that the brain can detect change in formant frequency (F2) of vowels. EEG activity was recorded from seven native Korean speakers at Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology. We applied MEMD over EEG channels to extract speech-related brain signal sources, and looked for the intrinsic mode functions which were dominant in the alpha bands. After the MEMD procedure, we applied the common spatial pattern algorithm for enhancing the classification performance, and used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a classifier. Main results. The brain responses to the three vowels could be classified as one of the learned phonemes on a single-trial basis with our approach. Significance. The results of our study show that brain responses to vowels can be classified for single trials using MEMD and LDA. This approach may not only become a useful tool for the brain-computer interface but it could also be used for discriminating the neural correlates of categorical speech perception.

The brain activities can be measured using different systems with different spatial and temporal resolutions. The magnetoencephalography (MEG) is one of those systems that can measure the brain activities in a high temporal resolution. Here the brain signals have been recorded using the MEG system from different brain areas of human subjects while doing a visual spatial attention task. These signals have been forwarded to a pattern recognition system for the possibility of predicting the attentional state of the subjects in two different positions. The proposed hybrid system consists of channel selection using Bayesian approach, feature extraction using the wavelet packet and feature selection based on entropy-based method. The final classifier was selected to be Naive Bayesian classifier for attentional state prediction. The results indicate that the proposed system can predict the location of the attended stimulus with a high accuracy, so it can be helpful for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications.

The neural mechanism of this understanding is referred to as the mirror neuron system (MNS). Different actions may correspond to different intentions, and the activation of the MNS in the human brain may also be slightly different. The present study distinguishes these differences according to functional brain imaging signals analyzed with machine learning. Brain signals were detected when the participants observed two types of actions: (1) grasping a cup for drinking, and (2) no meaningful contact. A synchronous measurement method for EEG and NIRS was adopted to increase the information contained in the brain signals. In order to obtain better cIassification accuracies, the method of functional brain networks was used. This method can be used to examine the relations hip between brain regions. First, phase synchronization and Pearson correlation were used to caIculate correlations for EEG channels and NIRS channels, respectively. Next, correlation matrices were converted into binary matrices, and the local properties of the networks were obtained. Finally, the feature vectors for the cIassifier were selected by analysis of their significance. In addition, EEG data and NIRS data were combined at the feature level and better cIassification results were obtained.

However, satisfactory ER performance within a bi-dimensional and non-discrete emotional space using single-trial EEG data remains a challenging task. To address this issue, we propose a three-layer scheme for single-trial EEG-ER. In the first layer, a set of spectral powers of different EEG frequency bands are extracted from multi-channel single-trial EEG signals. In the second layer, the kernel Fisher's discriminant analysis method is applied to further extract features with better discrimination ability from the EEG spectral powers. The feature vector produced by layer 2 is called a kernel Fisher's emotion pattern (KFEP), and is sent into layer 3 for further classification where the proposed imbalanced quasiconformal kernel support vector machine (IQK-SVM) serves as the emotion classifier. The outputs of the three layer EEG-ER system include labels of emotional valence and arousal. Furthermore, to collect effective training and testing datasets for the current EEG-ER system, we also use an emotion-induction paradigm in which a set of pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) are employed as emotion induction stimuli. The performance of the proposed three-layer solution is compared with that of other EEG spectral power-based features and emotion classifiers. Results on 10 healthy participants indicate that the proposed KFEP feature performs better than other spectral power features, and IQK-SVM outperforms traditional SVM in terms of the EEG-ER accuracy. Our findings also show that the proposed EEG-ER scheme achieves the highest classification accuracies of valence (82.68%) and arousal (84.79%) among all testing methods.

BCI research aims to develop systems that help disabled people to communicate using computers and their brain waves without any muscular action between a person and a computer. Motor Imagery (MI) is one of the popular paradigm to design the BCI system. Besides the BCI's complicated architecture, the required computation load is heavy. BCIs based on electroencephalogram (EEG) are growing fast, and several EEG-based techniques have been proposed for this purpose. Although EEG signals are characterised by a low spatial resolution and a limited frequency range. Moreover, they are often contaminate by noise caused by a cardiac activity (electrocardiography-ECG effects) and/or ocular artefacts (electrooculography-EOG effects). To handle the problem, in this paper, we present an efficient approach based on Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) for spatial feature extraction and Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) for classification. In this study, CSP and FLDA have been used to reduce common channels artefacts and to find projections that maximise the discrimination between different classes. A CSP feature extraction of EEG-based Motor Imagery is conducted, then an offline classification of Motor Imagery is performed. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and the accuracy of the approach which can be used in real-life applications.

EEG artifact elimination by extraction of ICA-component features using image processing algorithms	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Independent component analysis; ICA; EEG; Artifact elimination; Image processing; Local binary patterns; Range filter; Geometric features	BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; FACE RECOGNITION; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; OCULAR ARTIFACT; CLASSIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS; REMOVAL; NOISE	Artifact rejection is a central issue when dealing with electroencephalogram recordings. Although independent component analysis (ICA) separates data in linearly independent components (IC), the classification of these components as artifact or EEG signal still requires visual inspection by experts. In this paper, we achieve automated artifact elimination using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for classification of feature vectors extracted from ICA components via image processing algorithms. We compare the performance of this automated classifier to visual classification by experts and identify range filtering as a feature extraction method with great potential for automated IC artifact recognition (accuracy rate 88%). We obtain almost the same level of recognition performance for geometric features and local binary pattern (LBP) features. Compared to the existing automated solutions the proposed method has two main advantages: First, it does not depend on direct recording of artifact signals, which then, e.g. have to be subtracted from the contaminated EEG. Second, it is not limited to a specific number or type of artifact. In summary, the present method is an automatic, reliable, real-time capable and practical tool that reduces the time intensive manual selection of ICs for artifact removal. The results are very promising despite the relatively small channel resolution of 25 electrodes. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The WPD-CSP is used for feature extraction and KF-SVM is used for classification. The presented recognition method includes the following steps: (1) some important EEG channels are selected. The 'haar' wavelet basis is used to take wavelet packet decomposition. And some decomposed sub-bands related with motor imagery for each EEG channel are reconstructed to obtain the relevant frequency information. (2) A six-dimensional feature vector is obtained by the CSP feature extraction to the reconstructed signal. And then the within-class scatter is calculated based on the feature vector. (3) The scatter is added into the radical basis function to construct a new kernel function. The obtained new kernel is integrated into the SVM to act as its kernel function. To evaluate effectiveness of the proposed WPD-CSP + KF-SVM method, the data from the 2008 international BCI competition are processed. A preliminary result shows that the proposed classification algorithm can well recognize EEG data and improve the EEG recognition accuracy in motor imagery BCIs.

Detecting intention to grasp during reaching movements from EEG	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have been shown to be a promising tool in rehabilitation and assistive scenarios. Within these contexts, brain signals can be decoded and used as commands for a robotic device, allowing to translate user's intentions into motor actions in order to support the user's impaired neuro-muscular system. Recently, it has been suggested that slow cortical potentials (SCPs), negative deflections in the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals peaking around one second before the initiation of movements, might be of interest because they offer an accurate time resolution for the provided feedback. Many state-of-the-art studies exploiting SCPs have focused on decoding intention of movements related to walking and arm reaching, but up to now few studies have focused on decoding the intention to grasp, which is of fundamental importance in upper-limb tasks. In this work, we present a technique that exploits EEG to decode grasping correlates during reaching movements. Results obtained with four subjects show the existence of SCPs prior to the execution of grasping movements and how they can be used to classify, with accuracy rates greater than 70% across all subjects, the intention to grasp. Using a sliding window approach, we have also demonstrated how this intention can be decoded on average around 400 ms before the grasp movements for two out of four subjects, and after the onset of grasp itself for the two other subjects.

Long-term EEG recordings of an epileptic patient contain a huge amount of EEG data. The detection of epileptic activity is, therefore, a very demanding process that requires a detailed analysis of the entire length of the EEG data, usually performed by an expert. This paper describes an automated classiffication of EEG signals for the detection of epileptic seizures using wavelet transform and statistical pattern recognition. The decision making process is comprised of three main stages: (a) feature extraction based on wavelet transform, (b) feature space dimension reduction using scatter matrices and (c) classiffication by quadratic classiffiers. The proposed methodology was applied on EEG data sets that belong to three subject groups: (a) healthy subjects, (b) epileptic subjects during a seizure-free interval and (c) epileptic subjects during a seizure. An overall classiffication accuracy of 99% was achieved. The results conffirmed that the proposed algorithm has a potential in the classiffication of EEG signals and detection of epileptic seizures, and could thus further improve the diagnosis of epilepsy.

It would be a very useful way, especially if people with disabilities can use these functions as a means of self-xpression. The user's intension classification is a kind of common time-series problem for detecting human cognitive state. In this paper, we classify user intention by analyzing EEG signal using machine learning in BCI. The performance of the classification accuracy can be achieved by using the proposed approach in terms of the number of neurons in the hidden layer, which also leads types of membership function in fuzzy rules. We prepared training and test data using the Emotive headset for the experiment. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach gives us a quite promising method with 5 fuzzy rules obtained through a fuzzy C-means clustering. It is a simple fuzzy system with neural network structure by tuning GA providing statistically superior solutions. Experimental results show that the best results were obtained using the electrode position {F7, F8, FC5, FC6} of EEG. Experimental results using training data showed an accuracy of 94.2%. However, the result of using the test data after learning shows a slightly lower accuracy of 92.3%. This experiment shows that using training data and test dares can result in more than 90% accuracy. Experimental results show that all 4-action behaviors have similar accuracy.

The most important benefit of EEG signal analysis is to control a device without moving muscles or provide communication. In particular, patients with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) disease who cannot control muscles can communicate with their environment. Researchers use signal processing and machine learning in order to extract meaningful information from raw EEG signals. In this study, data obtained at the University of Tiibingen in Germany and presented in 2003 BCI competition is classified using only time domain features and nonlinear classifier. Classification accuracy of time domain features without preprocessing is higher than that of the accuracy of BCI competition.

In this paper, we propose an architecture of compressive sensing for electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals in the telemedicine sensor network. In order to save the hardware cost in encoding-end, the sensing matrix must be simple. Moreover, the decoding algorithm is required with the medium computational complexity under the trade-off between the reconstructed error and the speed of convergence. Accordingly, we propose a modified compressive sensing matching pursuit (MCoSaMP) and the multiple domains decoding method to enhance the performance. The proposed architecture is composed of Bernoulli matrix in encoding-end, Daubechies-4 (DB-4) for EMG signals (DCT for EEG signals), and MCoSaMP algorithm with multiple domains decoding method in decoding-end. The proposed architecture for EEG signals can reduce the percentage root mean square difference (PRD) by 17% compared to other papers. We can achieve the compression ratio (CR) for EEG signals at 0.4 with PRD 9.1%. Moreover, the comperssion ratio for EMG signals can be achieved at 0.4 with PRD 21.3%. The proposed MCoSaMP with multiple domains decoding method can achieve almost the same PRD with convex optimization for EMG signals. And the complexity can be reduced from O(N-3.5) to O(m(3)/(logN)(2)), where m and N are the number of measurement and length of signal, respectively. Although the PRD of proposed architecture for EMG signals is 6% larger than traditional EMG compression method, the complexity of proposed method in encoding-end is much lower. That achieves the goal of low complexity in encoding-end at telemedicine sensor network.

Recently, Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) has been studied in a variety of ways due to the development of brain measurement technology. Therefore, we have used the BMI to identify the human selection of directions. Our method consists of data normalization, principal component analysis and neural network. The maximum value of the identification rate was 46% by using 3 electrodes (F4, F8 and T8) in the previous study. In this study, we improved the learning method of neural network for the improvement of identification rate of brain state. For that purpose, the measurement points of EEG and the number of subjects are increased. As a result, the maximum value of the identification rate was improved. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, this study develops a novel attention aware system (AAS) capable of recognizing students' attention levels accurately based on EEG signals, thus having high potential to be applied in providing timely alert for conveying low-attention level feedback to online instructors in an e-learning environment. To construct AAS, attention responses of students and their corresponding EEG signals are gathered on a continuous performance test (CPT), i.e. an attention assessment test. Next, the AAS is constructed by using training and testing data by the NeuroSky brainwave detector and the support vector machine (SVM), a well-known machine learning model. Additionally, based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the collected EEG signals are decomposed into five primary bands (i.e. alpha, beta, gamma, theta and delta) as well as each primary band contains five statistical parameters (including approximate entropy, total variation, energy, skewness and standard deviation), thus generating twenty five potential brainwave features associated with students' attention level for constructing the AAS. An attempt based on genetic algorithm (GA) is also made to enhance the prediction performance of the proposed AAS in terms of identifying students' attention levels. According to GA, the seven most influential features are selected from twenty-five considered features; parameters of the proposed AAS are optimized as well. Analytical results indicate that the proposed AAS can accurately recognize individual student's attention state as either a high or low level, and the average accuracy rate reaches as high as 90.39 %. Moreover, the proposed AAS is integrated with a video lecture tagging system to examine whether the proposed AAS can accurately detect students' low-attention periods while learning about electrical safety in the workplace via a video lecture. An experiment is designed to assess the prediction performance of the proposed AAS in terms of identifying the periods of video lecture with high-or low-attention levels during learning processes. Analytical results indicate that the proposed AAS can accurately identify the low-attention periods of video lecture generated by students when engaging in a learning activity with video lecture. Results of this study demonstrate that the proposed AAS is an effective attention aware system, capable of assisting online instructors in evaluating students' attention levels to enhance their online learning performance.

For each mental task, CSP methods estimate a covariance matrix of EEG signals and adopt the uniform average of the sample covariance matrices over trials. However, the uniform average is sensitive to outliers caused by e.g. unrelated brain activity. In this paper, we propose an improvement of the estimated covariance matrix utilized in CSP methods by reducing the influence of the outliers as well as guaranteeing positive definiteness. More precisely, our estimation is the projection of the uniform average onto the intersection of two convex sets: the first set is a special reduced dimensional subspace which alleviates the influence of the outliers; the second is the positive definite cone. A numerical experiment supports the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

Recent studies exploit the neural signal recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) to get a more objective measurement of perceived video quality. Most of these studies capitalize on the event-related potential component P3. We follow an alternative approach to the measurement problem investigating steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) as EEG correlates of quality changes. Unlike the P3, SSVEPs are directly linked to the sensory processing of the stimuli and do not require long experimental sessions to get a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, we investigate the correlation of the EEG-based measures with the outcome of the standard behavioral assessment. Approach. As stimulus material, we used six gray-level natural images in six levels of degradation that were created by coding the images with the HM10.0 test model of the high efficiency video coding (H.265/MPEG-HEVC) using six different compression rates. The degraded images were presented in rapid alternation with the original images. In this setting, the presence of SSVEPs is a neural marker that objectively indicates the neural processing of the quality changes that are induced by the video coding. We tested two different machine learning methods to classify such potentials based on the modulation of the brain rhythm and on time-locked components, respectively. Main results. Results show high accuracies in classification of the neural signal over the threshold of the perception of the quality changes. Accuracies significantly correlate with the mean opinion scores given by the participants in the standardized degradation category rating quality assessment of the same group of images. Significance. The results show that neural assessment of video quality based on SSVEPs is a viable complement of the behavioral one and a significantly fast alternative to methods based on the P3 component.

Optimal set of EEG features for emotional state classification and trajectory visualization in Parkinson's disease	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Emotion classification; Feature reduction; Manifold learning; Parkinson's disease	FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; RECOGNITION; SPEECH; MUSIC; VALENCE; SOUND	In addition to classic motor signs and symptoms, individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by emotional deficits. Ongoing brain activity can be recorded by electroencephalograph (EEG) to discover the links between emotional states and brain activity. This study utilized machine-learning algorithms to categorize emotional states in PD patients compared with healthy controls (HC) using EEG. Twenty non-demented PD patients and 20 healthy age-, gender-, and education level-matched controls viewed happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust emotional stimuli while fourteen-channel EEG was being recorded. Multimodal stimulus (combination of audio and visual) was used to evoke the emotions. To classify the EEG-based emotional states and visualize the changes of emotional states overtime, this paper compares four kinds of EEG features for emotional state classification and proposes an approach to track the trajectory of emotion changes with manifold learning. From the experimental results using our EEG data set, we found that (a) bispectrum feature is superior to other three kinds of features, namely power spectrum, wavelet packet and nonlinear dynamical analysis; (b) higher frequency bands (alpha, beta and gamma) play a more important role in emotion activities than lower frequency bands (delta and theta) in both groups and; (c) the trajectory of emotion changes can be visualized by reducing subject-independent features with manifold learning. This provides a promising way of implementing visualization of patient's emotional state in real time and leads to a practical system for noninvasive assessment of the emotional impairments associated with neurological disorders.

An emotion-induction paradigm is designed for emotional EEG data collection, where a set of pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) are used as the emotion induction stimuli. Experimental results indicate that the KFEP feature performs better than the commonly used spectral power features.

Several studies have shown stimulus-dependent modulation of the evoked neural responses after gaze shifts (i.e. eye fixation related potentials, EFRP) depending on the relevance of the fixated object. However these studies are typically performed on still images under constrained conditions. Here we extend this approach to study overt visual attention during a simulated driving task. Simultaneous analysis of eye-tracking and electroencephalography data revealed similar patterns than those previously reported. However, natural visual exploration yielded shorter fixations, which imposes constraints in the analysis of the elicited brain responses. Nevertheless, we found significant differences between EFRPs corresponding to target objects or non-object stimuli. These results suggest the possibility of decoding such information during driving, allowing better understanding of how drivers process the environmental information.

Decoding of these signals, indicating subject's perception of erroneous system decisions or actions can be used to correct these actions or to improve the overall interfacing system. Multiple studies have shown the feasibility of decoding these potentials in single-trial using different types of experimental protocols and feedback modalities. However, previously reported approaches are limited by the use of long inter-stimulus intervals (ISI > 2 s). In this work we assess if it is possible to overcome this limitation. Our results show that it is possible to decode error-related potentials elicited by stimuli presented with ISIs lower than 1 s without decrease in performance. Furthermore, the increase in the presentation rate did not increase the subject workload. This suggests that the presentation rate for ErrP-based BMI protocols using serial monitoring paradigms can be substantially increased with respect to previous works.

Using the SSVEP-based paradigm, data were acquired from 4 subjects using 3 scalp electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes located on the visual area. Subjects were instructed to perform the attention task in which they attended covertly or overtly to either of the stimuli flickering with different frequencies (6; 7; 8 and 9 H z). We observed a decrease in signal power in covert compared to the overt attention. However, there was a consistent pattern in covert attention causing an increase in the power of the 2(nd) harmonic of the attended frequency. Encouraging results of this preliminary study indicates that it can be adapted and implemented in the brain-computer interface (BCI) system which could potentially be used as a neuro-rehabilitation tool for individuals with attention deficit.

Microstates correspond to defined states of brain activity, and their connectivity patterns may change accordingly. Little is known about alteration of connectivity in microstates, especially in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment with stable or improving cognition within 30 months (aMCI). Methods: Thirty-five outpatients with aMCI or mild dementia (mean age 77 +/- 7 years, 47 % male, Mini Mental State Examination score >= 24) had comprehensive neuropsychological and clinical examinations. Subjects with cognitive decline over 30 months were allocated to the AD group, subjects with stable or improving cognition to the MCI-stable group. Results of neuropsychological testing at baseline were summarized in six domain scores. Resting state EEG was recorded with 256 electrodes and analyzed using TAPEEG. Five microstates were defined and individual data fitted. After phase transformation, the phase lag index (PLI) was calculated for the five microstates in every subject. Networks were reduced to 22 nodes for statistical analysis. Results: The domain score for verbal learning and memory and the microstate segmented PLI between the left centro-lateral and parieto-occipital regions in the theta band at baseline differentiated significantly between the groups. In the present sample, they separated in a logistic regression model with a 100 % positive predictive value, 60 % negative predictive value, 100 % specificity and 77 % sensitivity between AD and MCI-stable. Conclusions: Combining neuropsychological and quantitative EEG test results allows differentiation between subjects with aMCI remaining stable and subjects with aMCI deteriorating over 30 months.

Wavelet coefficients are ranked based on statistics of the Wilcoxon test. The most informative coefficients are assembled to form a feature set that serves as inputs to the tabu-FSAM. Two benchmark datasets, named Ia and lb, downloaded from the brain-computer interface (BCI) competition II are employed for the experiments. Classification performance is evaluated using accuracy, mutual information, Gini coefficient and F-measure. Widely-used classifiers, including feedforward neural network, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbours, ensemble learning Adaboost and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, are also implemented for comparisons. The proposed tabu-FSAM method considerably dominates the competitive classifiers, and outperforms the best performance on the la and lb datasets reported in the BCI competition II.

EEG-Based Event Detection Using Optimized Echo State Networks with Leaky Integrator Neurons	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc			LAPSES	This study investigates the classification ability of linear and nonlinear classifiers on biological signals using the electroencephalogram (EEG) and examines the impact of architectural changes within the classifier in order to enhance the classification. Consequently, artificial events were used to validate a prototype EEG-based microsleep detection system based around an echo state network (ESN) and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The artificial events comprised infrequent 2-s long bursts of 15 Hz sinusoids superimposed on prerecorded 16-channel EEG data which provided a means of determining and optimizing the accuracy of overall classifier on 'gold standard' events. The performance of this system was tested on different signal-to-noise amplitude ratios (SNRs) ranging from 16 down to 0.03. Results from several feature selection/reduction and pattern classification modules indicated that training the classifier using a leakyintegrator neuron ESN structure yielded highest classification accuracy. For datasets with a low SNR of 0.3, training the leaky-neuron ESN using only those features which directly correspond to the underlying event, resulted in a phi correlation of 0.92 compared to 0.37 that employed principal component analysis (PCA). On the same datasets, other classifiers such as LDA and simple ESNs using PCA performed weakly with a correlation of 0.05 and 0 respectively. These results suggest that ESNs with leaky neuron architectures have superior pattern recognition properties. This, in turn, may reflect their superior ability to exploit differences in state dynamics and, hence, provide superior temporal characteristics in learning.	[Ayyagari, Sudhanshu S. D.

Though interrater agreement on critical events such as seizures is high, it is much lower on subtler events (e.g., when there are benign variants). The process used by an expert to interpret an EEG is quite subjective and hard to replicate by machine. The performance of machine learning technology is far from human performance. We have been developing an interpretation system, AutoEEG, with a goal of exceeding human performance on this task. In this work, we are focusing on one of the early decisions made in this process - whether an EEG is normal or abnormal. We explore two baseline classification algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Random Forest Ensemble Learning (RF). A subset of the TUH EEG Corpus was used to evaluate performance. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data. kNN achieved a 41.8% detection error rate while RF achieved an error rate of 31.7%. These error rates are significantly lower than those obtained by random guessing based on priors (49.5%). The majority of the errors were related to misclassification of normal EEGs.

In this electroencephalography (EEG) study, we used single-trial classification to perform a Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) of categorical representation of objects in human visual cortex. Brain responses were recorded while participants viewed a set of 72 photographs of objects with a planned category structure. The Representational Dissimilarity Matrix (RDM) used for RSA was derived from confusions of a linear classifier operating on single EEG trials. In contrast to past studies, which used pairwise correlation or classification to derive the RDM, we used confusion matrices from multi-class classifications, which provided novel self-similarity measures that were used to derive the overall size of the representational space. We additionally performed classifications on subsets of the brain response in order to identify spatial and temporal EEG components that best discriminated object categories and exemplars. Results from category-level classifications revealed that brain responses to images of human faces formed the most distinct category, while responses to images from the two inanimate categories formed a single category cluster. Exemplar-level classifications produced a broadly similar category structure, as well as sub-clusters corresponding to natural language categories. Spatiotemporal components of the brain response that differentiated exemplars within a category were found to differ from those implicated in differentiating between categories. Our results show that a classification approach can be successfully applied to single- trial scalp-recorded EEG to recover fine-grained object category structure, as well as to identify interpretable spatiotemporal components underlying object processing. Finally, object category can be decoded from purely temporal information recorded at single electrodes.

Since EEG recording and analysis is one of the fundamental tools in diagnosing and identifying disorders in neurophysiology, researchers strive to use the EEG signals for diagnosing individuals with ASD. We found that studies on ASD diagnosis using EEG techniques could be divided into two groups in which where analysis was based on either comparison techniques or pattern recognition techniques. In this paper, we try to explain these two sets of algorithms along with their applied methods and results. Lastly, evaluation measures of diagnosis algorithms are discussed.

However, low signal-to-noise ratio and significant data variation of EEG make it very difficult for BCI to obtain reliable results. Spatial filtering is one of the most successful feature extraction methods, and many efforts have been made to construct spatial filters that are robust against the data nonstationarity. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial filter optimization method based on mutual information which is estimated by Gaussian functions instead of Parzen window. We analyze the relationship between the mutual information and feature distance using a simulation study to show that optimization based on mutual information can contribute to feature stationarity. Moreover, we also evaluate the proposed method on a real world motor imagery EEG data set recorded from 16 subjects performing motor imagery or staying in idle state. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed spatial filter optimization method as it outperforms both the common spatial pattern analysis and filter-bank common spatial pattern analysis.

Artefacts make it difficult to calibrate from training sessions, resulting in low test performance, or lead to artificially high performance when unintentionally used for BCI control. We investigate different artefacts' effects on motor-imagery based BCI relying on Common Spatial Patterns (CSP). Data stem from an 80-subject BCI study. We use the recently developed classifier IC MARC to classify independent components of EEG data into neural and five classes of artefacts. We find that muscle, but not ocular, artefacts adversely affect BCI performance when all 119 EEG channels are used. Artefacts have little influence when using 48 centrally located EEG channels in a configuration previously found to be optimal.

This paper presents a six-layer biologically inspired feedforward neural network to discriminate human emotions from EEG. The neural network comprises a shift register memory after spectral filtering for the input layer, and the estimation of coherence between each pair of input signals for the hidden layer. EEG data are collected from 57 healthy participants from eight locations while subjected to audio-visual stimuli. Discrimination of emotions from EEG is investigated based on valence and arousal levels. The accuracy of the proposed neural network is compared with various feature extraction methods and feedforward learning algorithms. The results showed that the highest accuracy is achieved when using the proposed neural network with a type of radial basis function.

The EEG of five subjects was recorded while they recalled humorous videos. Extracted frequency features were compared to a control state in which users where asked to remain in a neutral mental state. An ANOVA test performed on the two groups: neutral and humor recall found a statistically significant difference in the frequency range 28-32 Hz for a number of channels including T7 and P7. Both of which presented the greatest statistically significant results with p values of 0.009 and 0.0 respectively Furthermore, we demonstrate that these mental states can be classified using Principal Component Analysis followed by a 3 features Linear Discriminant Analysis resulting in a leave one out classification accuracy of 95%.

However, the frequency band and time interval involved for CSP feature extraction will have large effect on the BCI performance. In this paper, with aim to find the optimal frequency band and time interval for effective CSP feature extraction, an approach based on particle swarm optimization is proposed. In this approach, the frequency band and time interval are coded with the particles and the optimal settings of them can be simultaneously detected by the evolution of particles for individual subject. The results from eighteen BCI participants confirmed that the individual frequency band and time interval provided by particles could actually improve the discriminative ability of CSP features, and it has potential application in online BCI system.

Do such events that extend in time elicit evoked responses of similar strength as evoked responses associated with instantaneous events such as the presentation of a static target image? Using a set of simulated scenarios, with avatars/actors having different behaviors, we identified evoked neural activity discriminative of target vs. distractor events (behaviors) at discrimination levels that are comparable to static imagery. EEG discriminative activity was largely in the time-locked evoked response and not in oscillatory activity, with the exception of very low EEG frequency bands such as delta and theta, which simply represent bands dominating the event related potential (ERP). The discriminative evoked response activity we see is observed in all target/distractor conditions and is robust across different recordings from the same subjects. The results suggest that we have identified a robust neural correlate of target detection in video, at least in terms of the stimulus set we used-i.e., dynamic behavior of an individual in a low clutter environment. Additional work is needed to test a larger variety of behaviors and more diverse environments.

The method works in three steps: (i) to employ EEMD for EEG signal decomposition into components called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), followed by applying Hilbert transform to the IMFs to determine the instantaneous frequency and amplitude; (ii) to choose the IMFs containing the most significant information based on the degree of presence in gamma band; (iii) to select segments of instantaneous vectors according to JSD metric, which measures the distances between two concepts. This method was applied to EEG signals of 5 subjects performing 5 mental tasks. The classification of mental tasks was performed using Fisher linear discriminator. The experimental results are compared with the ones obtained by a method that uses the power of gamma band in EEG signals (a traditional and popular method). The experimental results show improvement of the classification accuracy.

J	Moghim, N; Corne, DW				Moghim, Negin; Corne, David W.			Predicting Epileptic Seizures in Advance	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ACCUMULATED ENERGY; REAL-TIME; OSCILLATIONS; ALGORITHMS; DYNAMICS; LONG	Epilepsy is the second most common neurological disorder, affecting 0.6-0.8% of the world's population. In this neurological disorder, abnormal activity of the brain causes seizures, the nature of which tend to be sudden. Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs) are used as long-term therapeutic solutions that control the condition. Of those treated with AEDs, 35% become resistant to medication. The unpredictable nature of seizures poses risks for the individual with epilepsy. It is clearly desirable to find more effective ways of preventing seizures for such patients. The automatic detection of oncoming seizures, before their actual onset, can facilitate timely intervention and hence minimize these risks. In addition, advance prediction of seizures can enrich our understanding of the epileptic brain. In this study, drawing on the body of work behind automatic seizure detection and prediction from digitised Invasive Electroencephalography (EEG) data, a prediction algorithm, ASPPR (Advance Seizure Prediction via Pre-ictal Relabeling), is described. ASPPR facilitates the learning of predictive models targeted at recognizing patterns in EEG activity that are in a specific time window in advance of a seizure. It then exploits advanced machine learning coupled with the design and selection of appropriate features from EEG signals. Results, from evaluating ASPPR independently on 21 different patients, suggest that seizures for many patients can be predicted up to 20 minutes in advance of their onset. Compared to benchmark performance represented by a mean S1-Score (harmonic mean of Sensitivity and Specificity) of 90.6% for predicting seizure onset between 0 and 5 minutes in advance, ASPPR achieves mean S1-Scores of: 96.30% for prediction between 1 and 6 minutes in advance, 96.13% for prediction between 8 and 13 minutes in advance, 94.5% for prediction between 14 and 19 minutes in advance, and 94.2% for prediction between 20 and 25 minutes in advance.

Little is known, however, about the functional neural circuit abnormalities in BECTS without IEDs, or if such abnormalities could be used to differentiate BECTS patients without IEDs from healthy controls (HCs) for early diagnosis. To this end, we conducted resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) and simultaneous Electroencephalogram (EEG) in children with BECTS (n=43) and age-matched HC (n=28). The simultaneous EEG recordings distinguished BECTS with IEDs (n=20) from without IEDs (n=23). Intrinsic brain activity was measured in all three groups using the amplitude of low frequency fluctuation at rest. Compared to HC, BECTS patients with IEDs exhibited an intrinsic activity abnormality in the thalamus, suggesting that thalamic dysfunction could contribute to IED emergence while patients without IEDs exhibited intrinsic activity abnormalities in middle frontal gyrus and superior parietal gyrus. Using multivariate pattern classification analysis, we were able to differentiate BECTS without IEDs from HCs with 88.23% accuracy. BECTS without epileptic transients can be distinguished from HC and BECTS with IEDs by unique regional abnormalities in resting brain activity. Both transient abnormalities as reflected by IEDs and chronic abnormalities as reflected by RS-fMRI may contribute to BECTS development and expression. Intrinsic brain activity and multivariate pattern classification techniques are promising tools to diagnose and differentiate BECTS syndromes. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The study is carried out on two patients named CHIMIC and JANPRZ who were diagnosed with drug-resistant epilepsy and were subsequently operated. Along with EEG recordings, inter-ictal discharges, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, structural placement of the epileptogenic zone and clinical description, are used in the study. The key step involved in the analysis, is to create an algorithm that shapes the problem into an appropriate machine learning framework, identifying the features, forward modeling of the extracted features and finally classifying them as epileptic seizures arising from the location on the right or left region of the brain. The feature extraction is done by independent component analysis (ICA) with spatially filtered eight spectral features per components. These features are classified using Support Vector Machines with radial basis function kernels (SVM) and Proximal SVM. A comparative study is done for evaluating specificity and sensitivity using segments of ICA data. The analysis and results of both patients indicates that the specificity and sensitivity ratios are higher for ICA with SVM rather than those obtained from PSVM. Localization of epileptic focuses from the classified results showed that they matched with the marked epileptic regions in the MRI scans.

Although EEG is a well-established diagnostic tool and EEG-NFB shows great promise for enhancing cognitive performance and treating neurological disorders, proof of its efficacy has been limited. Here we characterize a novel Self-Calibrating Protocol (SCP) method coupled to five standard machine learning algorithms to classify brain states corresponding to the experience of "pain" or "no pain". Our results indicate that commercially available, wearable EEG sensors provide sufficient data fidelity to robustly differentiate the two "perceptually opposite" brain states. Crucially, use of SCP allows us for the first time to bypass the pitfalls associated with trying to force an individual's brain wave patterns to match "normed" target patterns obtained over population averages. These are necessary steps towards personalized NFB therapies and bespoke Brain-Computer Interfaces and brain training suitable to a wide variety of individual needs.

These devices are significantly more affordable than their medical counterparts, and are mainly used to measure levels of engagement, focus, relaxation and stress. This information is sought after for marketing research and games. However, these EEG devices have the potential to enable users to interact with their surrounding environment using thoughts only, without activating any muscles. In this paper, we present preliminary results that demonstrate that despite reduced voltage and time sensitivity compared to medical-grade EEG systems, the quality of the signals of the Emotiv EPOC neuroheadset is sufficiently good in allowing discrimination between imaging events. We collected streams of EEG raw data and trained different types of classifiers to discriminate between three states (rest and two imaging events). We achieved a generalisation error of less than 2% for two types of non-linear classifiers.

In the field of biological information processing, methods are available for analyzing biological information directly based on electroencephalogram: EEG to determine the pleasant/unpleasant reactions of users. In this study, we propose a sensitivity filtering technique for discriminating preferences (pleasant/unpleasant) for images using a sensitivity image filtering system based on EEG. Using a set of images retrieved by similarity retrieval, we perform the sensitivity-based pleasant/unpleasant classification of images based on the affective features extracted from images with the maximum entropy method: MEM. In the present study, the affective features comprised cross-correlation features obtained from EEGs produced when an individual observed an image. However, it is difficult to measure the EEG when a subject visualizes an unknown image. Thus, we propose a solution where a linear regression method based on canonical correlation is used to estimate the cross-correlation features from image features. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the validity of sensitivity filtering compared with image similarity retrieval methods based on image features. We found that sensitivity filtering using color correlograms was suitable for the classification of preferred images, while sensitivity filtering using local binary patterns was suitable for the classification of unpleasant images. Moreover, sensitivity filtering using local binary patterns for unpleasant images had a 90% success rate. Thus, we conclude that the proposed method is efficient for filtering unpleasant images.

From early Electroencephalography (EEG), able to capture a few simultaneous signals, to in-vivo spinal recording, Magneto Encephalograpy (MEG) or functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), that capture up to hundreds of signals, the amount of data from neurophysiological experimentation to be analyzed multiplies every year. This paper proposes a methodology composed by several steps. It is targeted to extract qualitative and quantitative information from experiments recorded using such devices. The process selects patterns of interest for the hypothesis in the experiment, analyzes the characteristics of the patterns and its changes in temporal behavior from the perspective of individual sensors, identifies coocurrences of patterns from the simultaneous sensors and extracts frequent temporal patterns that show recurrent collective sensor activity. These patterns are expected to characterize and discriminate different states or conditions in the experiments. An application to the analysis of recordings of spinal neural activity in cats is presented to show the use of the methodology.

Two novel classifiers: Biomimetic Pattern Recognition (BPR) and Sparse Representation (SR) are applied. Each classifier labels the unlabeled data for the other classifier to extend the labeled set. And the enlarged labeled set is used to generate the final classifier BPR-SR. BPR-SR is constructed by combining BPR with SR, in which SR is used to replace the traditional distance method when BPR encounters the overlap coverage problem. The features extracted by common spatial pattern were used for classification. The experiment with datasets from previous BCI competitions demonstrates the validity of our proposed co-training algorithm compared with BPR, SR and BPR-SR without co-training. And the experiment about our novel classifier BPR-SR compared with other excellent classifiers on datasets from previous BCI competitions and our own lab was also conducted. And the result shows that the classifier BPR-SR can overcome the overlap coverage problem of BPR by introducing SR. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the proposed method, we extract the EEG features from EEG signals recorded while users stare at images, and the visual features are computed from these images. Then the classification of images is performed based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) by separately using the EEG and visual features. Furthermore, we merge the above classification results based on Supervised Learning from Multiple Experts to obtain the final classification result. This method focuses on the classification accuracy calculated from each classification result. Therefore, although classification accuracy based on EEG and visual features are different from each other, our method realizes effective integration of these classification results. In addition, we newly derive a kernelized version of the method in order to realize more accurate integration of the classification results. Consequently, our method realizes successful multimodal classification of images by the object categories that they contain.

In this paper, a novel feature extraction and a feature fusion method for EEG signal classification are introduced. After preprocessing, the windowed EEG signals are decomposed to five rhythms by filter bank of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) structure. Three correlogram spectrums for 3 lags are computed for these rhythms. The extracted features of these spectrums have been combined by Hidden Markov Model (HMM) as a fusion method. The lag values are optimized using a hybrid approach based on Multi- Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and Genetic Algorithm (GA) with implementing the Hill- Climbing (HC) search technique. The final feature vector is obtained with optimal lags and optimized HMM feature fusion. This scenario for feature extraction and fusion is called Lagged Correlogram Patterns (LCP) algorithm. Meanwhile, the spectral entropy as a frequency model of signal is estimated. The maximum value of averaged spectrum on all windows has been considered as a feature. Finally, the feature vectors are classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. The average of accuracy rate of 81.40% is obtained for the performance of seizure recognition.

In this work, the evaluation of human motion intention (HMI) based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and surface electromyography (sEMG) signals are analyzed for a knee exoskeleton control as a preliminary study for gait neurorehabilitation with a hybrid robotic system. This system consists of the knee exoskeleton H2 and the UFES's Smart Walker, which are used to restore the neuromotor control function of subjects with neural injuries. An experimental protocol was developed to identify patterns to control the exoskeleton in accordance with the HMI-based on EEG/sEMG. The EEG and sEMGsignalsare recorded during thefollowing activities: stand-up/sit-down and knee flexion/extension. HMI is analyzed through both event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) and slow cortical potential, as well as the myoelectric patternclassification related to lower limb. The feature extraction from sEMG signals is based on vector combinations in time and frequency domain which are used for a pattern classification stage trough an artificial neural network with LevenbergMarquadt training algorithm and support vector machine. Preliminary results shown that a combination of EEG/sEMG signals can be used to define a control strategy for the robotic system. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Villa-Parra, A.

In this paper, we study the feasibility of using a commercial low cost EEG amplifier which has only limited number of electrodes, to develop a motor control BCI system. The objective is to extract brain activity responsible for direction specific imagined and executed motor activity, which can be used to identify the motor task performed by the user using the simultaneously recorded EEG. An experiment is conducted to engage the user in bi-directional horizontal movement execution and imagination of the dominant hand. The analysis includes investigation of the time-frequency bins of the recorded EEG that provides maximum discrimination of directional movement. Further, the features are extracted using Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP), followed by Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) for classification. The classification performance at various time instants of each trial are considered; and a control strategy was introduced at the classifier output to enhance performance. The performance in terms of average classification accuracy over five subjects is obtained as 81.3 % (movement execution) and 82.4 % (movement imagination). The results indicate the applicability of this EEG-BCI system to provide directional motor control to an interfaced device such as a robotic arm or a game element.	[Robinson, Neethu; Vinod, A.

IS is a type of seizure that was first described by West in 1841, who witnessed the seizure in his own son. West's syndrome refers to the classic triad of spasms, characteristic EEG, and neurodevelopmental regression. Most cases involve flexors and extensors, but either of the types may be involved independently. IS, as its name implies, most often occurs during the first year of life with an incidence of approximately 1 per 2000-4000 live births. Most, but not all, patients with this disorder have severe EEG abnormalities; this pattern was originally referred to as hypsarrhythmia by Gibbs and Gibbs. Cases with known etiology or signs of brain damage are considered as symptomatic. The Overall prognosis of the disease is poor. Peak onset age of the epileptic syndrome is 3 to 7 months, which mainly occurs before 2 years of age in 93% of patients. Hypsarrhythmia is the EEG hallmark of IS, which comprised a chaotic, bilaterally asynchronous high-voltage polyspike, and slow wave discharges interspersed with multifocal spikes and slow waves. Etiological classification is as follows: 1) Symptomatic: with identifiable prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal causes with developmental delay at the presentation time; 2) Cryptogenic: unknown underlying cause, normal development at the onset of spasms, normal neurological exam and neuroimaging, and no abnormality in the metabolic evaluation; 3) Idiopathic: pure functional cerebral dysfunction with complete recovery, no residual dysfunction, normal neuroimaging and normal etiologic evaluation, and normal neurodevelopment.

As they typically lack visible expressions, indirect methods like analysis of facial expressions are ineffective at best. Towards solving such problem, we present a statistical approach to predict cognitive load from single trial electrophysiological recordings of brain activity (i.e., EEG). We evaluated the utility of two commonly used sets of features, namely, wavelet entropy and band-specific power (theta, alpha, and beta) to predict levels of cognitive load. We show that performance of the model (i.e., support vector machine) could be improved by feature fusion (such as wavelet entropy and spectral power features together) and also integrating nonlinear representations learned through deep belief networks. Our results demonstrate predictions of cognitive load across four different levels with an overall accuracy of 92% during execution of a memory task.

The authors introduce a means to identify various types of epileptic pathologic oscillations using a parameter based on the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution of the amplitudes within EEG signals. Multiple entropy and entropy-like measures have been explored to aid in epileptic seizure classification including Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, spectral entropy, Renyi entropy, approximate entropy, and equal frequency discretization. Here we propose a more computational efficient measure which calculates a discrete probability distribution directly from the recorded amplitudes of an EEG recording over a specified window and uses an entropy-like calculation to reduce dimensionality.

Cognitive workload modulation through degraded visual stimuli: a single-trial EEG study	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						work load; single trial; EEG ERP	MENTAL WORKLOAD; TASK-DIFFICULTY; P300; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; FILTERS; NOISE	Objective. Our experiments explored the effect of visual stimuli degradation on cognitive workload. Approach. We investigated the subjective assessment, event-related potentials (ERPs) as well as electroencephalogram ( EEG) as measures of cognitive workload. Main results. These experiments confirm that degradation of visual stimuli increases cognitive workload as assessed by subjective NASA task load index and confirmed by the observed P300 amplitude attenuation. Furthermore, the single-trial multi-level classification using features extracted from ERPs and EEG is found to be promising. Specifically, the adopted single-trial oscillatory EEG/ERP detection method achieved an average accuracy of 85% for discriminating 4 workload levels. Additionally, we found from the spatial patterns obtained from EEG signals that the frontal parts carry information that can be used for differentiating workload levels. Significance. Our results show that visual stimuli can modulate cognitive workload, and the modulation can be measured by the single trial EEG/ERP detection method.

Up to date, there are few studies that investigate the single trial performance of neural decoding in cognitive tasks. In this study we examine EEG data while a given subject is solving questions which are commonly used in intelligence quotient tests. Subjects are instructed to solve a number of visual template matching tasks. Our findings suggest that it is possible to decode the true answer from the subjects' ERP responses at the time of its presentation. These results indicate that neurophysiological markers could be useful for neurotechnology assisted learning paradigms.

Combination of scalp topography, estimated dipole source location and spectral patterns of resulted ICs were used to k-means clustering and identification of near-equivalent ICs across subjects. Several frequency features were extracted from clustered ICs and individually submitted to k-nn classifier. The best resulted accuracy was 86.36% using (mean feature at R-parietal cluster. Eight pairs of features resulted in such accuracy. The method used in this study not only improves the participant's classification accuracy compared to reference analysis, but also better identifies the dynamic of brain source signals than time domain ICA algorithms.

Identification of interictal spikes is often carried out manually by trained neurologists. It is a time-consuming process and can exhibit variability between experts. In this work, we develop and evaluate an automated spike detector. We implement a template-matching approach and improve its accuracy on one set of recordings using a supervised machine-learning algorithm. Evaluation with two independent datasets shows the template-matching detector to perform comparably with experts and the version augmented with a classifier. In one test dataset, variations of the detection threshold partially explain discrepancies between experts. In the other, the detector demonstrates similar behavior to an existing algorithm developed with this dataset.

Setting: The participants were recruited in two specialised centres and three schools in Reykjavik. Participants: The data are from a large cross-sectional cohort of 310 patients with ADHD and 351 controls, covering an age range from 5.8 to 14 years. ADHD was diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria using the K-SADS-PL semistructured interview. Participants in the control group were reported to be free of any mental or developmental disorders by their parents and had a score of less than 1.5 SDs above the age-appropriate norm on the ADHD Rating Scale-IV. Other than moderate or severe intellectual disability, no additional exclusion criteria were applied in order that the cohort reflected the typical cross section of patients with ADHD. Results: Diagnostic classifiers were developed using statistical pattern recognition for the entire age range and for specific age ranges and were tested using cross-validation and by application to a separate cohort of recordings not used in the development process. The age-specific classification approach was more accurate (76% accuracy in the independent test cohort; 81% cross-validation accuracy) than the age-independent version (76%; 73%). Chronological age was found to be an important classification feature. Conclusions: The novel application of EEG-based classification methods presented here can offer significant benefit to the clinician by improving both the accuracy of initial diagnosis and ongoing monitoring of children and adolescents with ADHD. The most accurate possible diagnosis at a single point in time can be obtained by the age-specific classifiers, but the age-independent classifiers are also useful as they enable longitudinal monitoring of brain function.

Brain electrical activity bears the emotional cues needed for emotion detection, but very modest research has been done to extract those cues. This paper presents a novel machine learning approach using Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Packet Transform (DT-CWPT) time-frequency features from electroencephalogram (EEG) to detect emotions together with an analysis of brain activity in different emotional states. Firstly, DT-CWPT is used to extract time-frequency emotional features. Then non-redundant and most discriminating emotional features are selected through singular value decomposition (SVD), QR factorization with column pivoting (QRcp) and F-Ratio based feature selection (FS) method. The reduced emotional feature set is used to classify emotion using support vector machine (SVM) and validated by leave-one-out cross-validation scheme. Results confirm the robustness and consistency in classification of emotions from EEG signals and significant correlation between participants' self assessed ratings with emotional features. It also gives an analysis of activities in brain region during different emotional states. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study we aimed to classify single-trial 12 categories of recorded EEG signals. Ten subjects participated in this study. The task was to select target images among 12 basic object categories including animals, flowers, fruits, transportation devices, body organs, clothing, food, stationery, buildings, electronic devices, dolls and jewelry. In order to decode object categories, we have considered several units namely artifact removing, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. Data were divided into training, validation, and test sets following the artifact removal process. Features were extracted using three different wavelets namely Daubechies4, Haar, and Symlet2. Features were selected among training data and were reduced afterward via scalar feature selection using three criteria including T test, entropy, and Bhattacharyya distance. Selected features were classified by the one-against-one support vector machine (SVM) multi-class classifier. The parameters of SVM were optimized based on training and validation sets. The classification performance (measured by means of accuracy) was obtained approximately 80 % for animal and stationery categories. Moreover, Symlet2 and T test were selected as better wavelet and selection criteria, respectively.

Although many classification methods have been applied to classify EEG signals for detection of epilepsy, little attention is paid on accurate epileptic seizure detection methods with comprehensible and transparent interpretation. This study develops a detection framework and focuses on doing a comparative study by applying the four rule-based classifiers, i.e., the decision tree algorithm C4.5, the random forest algorithm (RF), the support vector machine (SVM) based decision tree algorithm (SVM + C4.5) and the SVM based RF algorithm (SVM + RF), to two-group and three-group classification and the most challenging five-group classification on epileptic seizures in EEG signals. The experimental results justify that in addition to high interpretability, RF has the competitive advantage for two-group and three-group classification with the average accuracy of 0.9896 and 0.9600. More importantly, its performance is highlighted in five-group classification with the highest average accuracy of 0.8260 in contrast to other three rule-based classifiers.

The phase locking value (PLV) is one of the most effective measures widely used for phase synchronization analysis. We first calculate the PLVs of the pair-wise intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) based on multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) method. Next, the average PLV of the prominent pairs relative to the rest duration is adopted for the classification of motor imagery (MI) tasks. Comparative analysis with the EMD-based PLV method, the proposed method has a significant increase in feature separability for most subjects. This paper demonstrates that MEMD-based PLV method can provide an effective feature in the MI task classification and the potential for BCI applications.

Temporal lobe surgery in medically refractory epilepsy: A comparison between populations based on MRI findings	SEIZURE-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPILEPSY			English	Article						Epilepsy surgery; Temporal lobe; Nonlesional; Negative MRI; Ictal EEG; Outcomes	SCLEROSIS; EEG; LOBECTOMY; PREDICTORS; OUTCOMES; FOCI	Introduction: High resolution MRI findings suggestive of mesial temporal sclerosis (MRI-MTS) correlate with good outcome after surgery. However, a large group of patients present with normal brain MRI (N-MRI) and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We aim to compare pre-operative ictal EEG patterns in predicting surgical outcomes in the population with MRI-MTS vs. N-MRI after selective anterior-mesial temporal lobe (AMTL) resection. Methods: 241 patients with unilateral anterior ictal EEG findings underwent selective AMTL resection. 143 MRI-MTS and 98 N-MRI patients were identified. Outcome was based on the modified Engel classification, ictal EEG pattern at seizure onset, demographics and MRI findings. Results: Seizure-free outcome was seen in the MRI-MTS in 79% of patients, compared to 59.1% (p < .005) of the N-MRI group. No significant difference was identified in ictal EEG patterns at presentation between groups. Class I outcome was achieved in 78.9% of patients that had theta rhythm and MRI-MTS compared to 57.9% of patients that had theta rhythm and N-MRI (p < 0.05). Discussion and conclusion: Surgical treatment for mesial TLE is effective. Positive MRI suggestive of mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) predicts better seizure control after surgery. Theta rhythm is the most common ictal pattern and seems to carry the best prognosis for TLE. However, a well-selected group of patients with N-MRI will benefit from surgical intervention, and similar outcome to MRI-MTS patients can be achieved if delta ictal EEG pattern is presented at initial onset. Early referral to an epilepsy center cannot be emphasized enough, even in situations when high-resolution brain MRI is normal. (C) 2013 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

MCI has been proven to be correlated with disorders in multiple brain areas. In this paper, we used information from resting brain networks at different EEG frequency bands to reliably recognize MCI. Because EEG network analysis is influenced by the reference that is used, we also evaluate the effect of the reference choices on the resting scalp EEG network-based MCI differentiation. The conducted study reveals two aspects: (1) the network-based MCI differentiation is superior to the previously reported classification that uses coherence in the EEG; and (2) the used EEG reference influences the differentiation performance, and the zero approximation technique (reference electrode standardization technique, REST) can construct a more accurate scalp EEG network, which results in a higher differentiation accuracy for MCI. This study indicates that the resting scalp EEG-based network analysis could be valuable for MCI recognition in the future.

All these disadvantages have motivated researchers to substantially improve speed and accuracy of all components of the communication system between brain and a BCI output device. New method: In this study, a fast and accurate decision tree structure based classification method was proposed for classifying EEG data to up/down/right/left computer cursor movement imagery EEG data. The data sets were acquired from three healthy human subjects in age group of between 24 and 29 years old in two sessions on different days. Results: The proposed decision tree structure based method was successfully applied to the present data sets and achieved 55.92%, 57.90% and 82.24% classification accuracy rate on the test data of three subjects. Comparison with existing method(s): The results indicated that the proposed method provided 12.25% improvement over the best results of the most closely related studies although the EEG signals were collected on two different sessions with about 1 week interval. Conclusions: The proposed method required only a training set of the subject and automatically generated specific DTS for each new subject by determining the most appropriate feature set and classifier for each node. Additionally, with further developments of feature extraction and/or classification algorithms, any existing node can be easily replaced with new one without breaking the whole DTS. This attribute makes the proposed method flexible. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The approach is based on embedded machine-learning stages that learn and model the statistics of the computational outputs in the presence of errors, resulting in an error-aware model for embedded analysis. We demonstrate, in hardware, two systems for analyzing sensor data: 1) an EEG-based seizure detector and 2) an ECG-based cardiac arrhythmia detector. The systems use a small kernel of fault-free hardware (constituting < 7.0% and < 31% of the total areas respectively) to construct and apply the error-aware model. The systems construct their own error-aware models with minimal overhead through the use of an embedded active-learning framework. Via an field-programmable gate array implementation for hardware experiments, stuck-at faults are injected at controllable rates within synthesized gate-level netlists to permit characterization. The seizure detector demonstrates restored performance despite faults on 0.018% of the circuit nodes [causing bit error rates (BERs) up to 45%], and the arrhythmia detector demonstrates restored performance despite faults on 2.7% of the circuit nodes (causing BERs up to 50%).

The statistics and structure of EEG noise are usually unknown and time-varying. As these characteristics may vary substantially between subjects, as well as within subjects both in time and space, it may be difficult to select a unique noise model and/or to update its parameters. This study proposes a data-driven approach, based on the Empirical Model Decomposition and the auto-correlation function, for estimating and comparing the spatiotemporal statistical characteristics of EEG noise. The proposed approach was applied to a dataset of continuously recorded (over several hours) scalp EEGs from 3 patients with focal epilepsy. It is shown that the statistical characteristics of EEG noise vary substantially in time and space. Thus, adaptive signal processing methods may be most appropriate for denoising and/ or estimation of data-driven and possibly subject-specific noise distributions, with the ultimate goal to improve source localization, waveform feature extraction and signal decoding.

This deficit can manifest itself as difficulties in orthographic working memory, brain systems asynchrony, poor executive function skills and/or rapid naming processing. Although each of the aforementioned factors incorporates different brain systems and is activated at different speeds and in different manners, it is clear that for good reading performance to occur, these systems must be activated in a synchronized manner (hence, the name "A-synchronization Theory"). This aforementioned theory of A-synchronization indicates that impairment among dyslexic readers involves not only the speed of processing but also the integrating and processing of information emerging from different sensory systems, specifically, the visual and auditory modalities. Based on this, an effective algorithm was developed for analysis and classification of subjects as either Regular Readers or Dyslexic Readers. This was achieved by measuring phase synchrony in Electroencephalographic (EEG) recorded channels during visual Lexical Decision task. An average correct identification rate of 89% +/- 2% was achieved when phase synchrony features from the gamma-band (30-40Hz) were extracted. This may indicate a lack of synchrony between different modalities in dyslexic readers related to attention process.

Adaptive filtering of EEG/ERP through Bounded Range Artificial Bee Colony (BR-ABC) algorithm	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						EEG/ERP; Adaptive filter; SNR; LMS; RLS; ABC	EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; EEG; ARTIFACT; REMOVAL	In this paper, the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is applied to construct Adaptive Noise Canceller (ANC) for electroencephalogram (EEG)/Event Related Potential (ERP) filtering with modified range selection, described as Bounded Range ABC (BR-ABC). ERP generated due to hand movement is filtered through Adaptive Noise Canceller (ANC) from the EEG signals. ANCs are also implemented with Least Mean Square (LMS) and Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithm. Performance of the algorithms is evaluated in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in dB, correlation between resultant and template ERP, and mean value difference. Testing of their noise attenuation capability is done on contaminated ERP with white noise at different SNR levels. A comparative study of the performance of conventional gradient based methods like LMS, RLS, and ABC algorithm is also made which reveals that ABC algorithm gives better performance in highly noisy environment.

This is achieved by (1) revisiting and streamlining the design of high-resolution quadratic time frequency distributions (TFDs) so as to produce adequate (t, f) images, (2) using image enhancement techniques to improve the resolution of TFDs, and (3) defining new (t, f) features such as (t, f) flatness and (t, f) entropy by extending time-domain or frequency-domain features. Comparative results indicate that the new (t, f) features give better performance as compared to time-only or frequency-only features for the detection of abnormalities in newborn EEG signals. Defining high-resolution TFDs for the extraction of new (t, f) features further improves performance. The findings are corroborated by new experimental results, theoretical derivations and conceptual insights. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

A filter bank CSP (FBCSP) algorithm typically uses all the features from all the bands to extract and select robust features. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of four methods for frequency band selection applied to binary motor imagery classification: forward-addition (FA), backward-elimination (BE), the intersection and the union of the FA and BE. These methods automatically select and learn the best discriminative sets of frequency bands, and their corresponding CSP features. The performances of the proposed methods are evaluated on binary motor imagery classification using a publicly available real-world dataset (BCI competition 2008 dataset 2A). It is found that the BE method provides the best improvement resulting in an average classification accuracy increase of the BCI system over the FBCSP algorithm, from 77.06% to 79.09%.

This study introduces a modification of Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) for subject transfer BCIs, where similar characteristics are considered to transfer knowledge from other subjects' data. With this aim, we proposed a new approach based on Composite Local Temporal Correlation CSP, namely Composite LTCCSP with selected subjects, which considers the similarity between subjects using Frobenius distance. The performance of the proposed method is compared with different methods like traditional CSP, Composite CSP, LTCCSP and Composite LTCCSP. Experimental results have shown that our proposed method has increased the performance compared to all these different methods. Furthermore, our results suggest that it is worth emphasizing the data of subjects with similar characteristics in a subject transfer diagram. The suggested framework, as demonstrated by experimental results, can obtain a positive knowledge transfer for enhancing the performance of BCIs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pathological EEG records correspond to people with proven epilepsy diagnosis. Cross training has proven to be a technique to selectively remove error support vectors, and reduce the complexity of the underlying function. A low complexity implies a high possibility of classifying samples with less error. In this technique, the optimization process is performed in two stages, 1) the dataset is divided into an initial number of subsets, and an SVM is trained for each subset, 2) the margin (distance) for each sample of entire dataset to each decision function is found, and the average margin is obtained for each sample. Those samples whose average margins are outside from a certain range are eliminated from the dataset. Then, the final SVM is trained with a reduced dataset. The results show a high performance in the classification of EEG patterns, resulting in a high rate greater than 95% of accuracy.

Despite its advantages of wide versatility and high efficiency, CSP is shown to be non-robust to noise and prone to over fitting when training sample number is limited. In order to overcome these problems, Regularized Common Spatial Pattern (RCSP) is further proposed. RCSP regularized covariance matrix estimation by two parameters, which reduces the estimation difference and improves the stationarity under small sample condition. However, RCSP does not make full use of the frequency information. In this paper, we presents a filter ensemble technique for RCSP (FERCSP) to further extract frequency information and aggregate all the RCSPs efficiently to get an ensemble-based solution. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on data set IVa of BCI Competition III against other five RCSP-based algorithms. The experimental results show that FERCSP significantly outperforms those of the existing methods in classification accuracy. The FERCSP outperforms the CSP algorithm and R-CSP-A algorithm in all five subjects with an average improvement of 6% in accuracy.

The aim of this work is to develop a seizure detection system with high accuracy. The proposed system was mainly based on multifractal analysis, which describes the local singular behavior of fractal objects and characterizes the multifractal structure using a continuous spectrum. Compared with computing the single fractal dimension, multifractal analysis can provide a better description on the transient behavior of EEG fractal time series during the evolvement from interictal stage to seizures. Thus both interictal EEG and ictal EEG were analyzed by multifractal formalism and their differences in the multifractal features were used to distinguish the two class of EEG and detect seizures. In the proposed detection system, eight features (alpha(0), alpha(min), alpha(max), Delta alpha, f(alpha(min)), f(alpha(max)), Delta f and R) were extracted from the multifractal spectrums of the preprocessed EEG to construct feature vectors. Subsequently, relevance vector machine (RVM) was applied for EEG patterns classification, and a series of post-processing operations were used to increase the accuracy and reduce false detections. Both epoch-based and event-based evaluation methods were performed to appraise the system's performance on the EEG recordings of 21 patients in the Freiburg database. The epoch-based sensitivity of 92.94% and specificity of 97.47% were achieved, and the proposed system obtained a sensitivity of 92.06% with a false detection rate of 0.34/h in event-based performance assessment.

Electroencephalography during syncope shows either a 'slow-flat-slow' or a 'slow' pattern. The first is believed to denote more severe hypoperfusion. Although the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope relies primarily on history taking, there is limited evidence regarding the relative importance of various clinical features, and none that relate them to the severity of electroencephalographic changes. The aim of this investigation was to study symptoms, signs and electroencephalographic changes with a 1 s resolution using electroencephalography and video data in 69 cases of tilt-induced vasovagal syncope. The main finding was that flattening of the electroencephalograph indicated more profound circulatory changes: the 'slow-flat-slow' group had a lower minimum blood pressure, longer maximum RR-interval, contained more cases with asystole and had a longer duration of loss of consciousness than the 'slow' group. Second, we describe a range of signs, including some that have rarely been reported in syncope, e.g. oral automatisms. Third, signs occurred at different rates depending on electroencephalographic flattening, suggesting a classification of syncopal signs. Type A signs (e.g. loss of consciousness, eye opening and general stiffening) develop during the first slow phase, stay present during flattening and stop in the second slow phase. Type B (particularly myoclonic jerks) occur when the electroencephalograph is slow but not flat: their abolition with electroencephalographic flattening suggests dependence on cortical activity. Type C signs (making sounds, roving eye movements and stertorous breathing) occur only in the flat phase, whereas type D (dropping the jaw and snoring) may occur either in slow or flat phases. In conclusion, our findings provide a detailed assessment of clinical symptoms in relation to electroencephalographic (EEG) changes during tilt-induced syncope.	[van Dijk, J.

In this study, we have investigated the feasibility of determining mood from gaze, which is one of the human cognitive processes that can be recorded during interaction with computers. To do so, we have designed a feature vector composed of typical gaze patterns, and piloted the approach on the dataset which we gathered. It consists of 145 samples of 30 people. A supervised machine learning technique was employed for classification and recognition of mood. The results of this pilot test suggests that even during these initial steps, the approach is quite promising and opens other research paths for improvement through multi-modal recognition and information fusion. Multi-modal approach would employ the added information provided by our previously developed mood extraction approach using camera and/or the information gained by the use of EEG signals. Further analysis will be performed in feature extraction process to enhance the model accuracy by enriching the feature-set of each modality.

However, a reliable detection of single trial potentials is challenging, because they are strongly affected by noise. Furthermore, potentials with their subcomponents are often distributed over several channels. With high density sensor arrays, a hypothesis-driven selection of channels, as often performed in BCIs based on electroencephalography (EEG), is challenging. We present a new data-driven approach that constructs spatio-temporal filters, considerably reducing the number of channels, reducing noise, and simultaneously determining the underlying brain dynamics. The extracted signals can be easily used to recognize the event sequence on which users focus their attention, without applying multivariate classification. We evaluated the approach using high density magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, recorded during a BCI experiment based on P300 responses. Compared to the subject's performance achieved with the initial decoding approach, the recognition rate increased significantly from 74.1% (std: 14.8%) to 95.1% (std: 4.9%) correct detections, which implies an information transfer rate improvement from 6.9 bit/min to 13.1 bit/min on average over 17 subjects.

EEG oscillatory states were assessed by the probability-classification analysis of short-term EEG spectral patterns. The results demonstrated that brain activity consists of a limited repertoire of local EEG states in any of the examined conditions. The size of the state repertoires was associated with changes in cognition and vigilance or neuropsychopathologic conditions. Additionally universal, optional and unique EEG states across 13 diverse conditions were observed. It was demonstrated also that EEG oscillations which constituted EEG states were characteristic for different groups of conditions in accordance to oscillations' functional significance. The results suggested that (a) there is a limit in the number of local states available to the cortex and many ways in which these local states can rearrange themselves and still produce the same global state and (b) EEG individuality is determined by varying proportions of universal, optional and unique oscillatory states. The results enriched our understanding about dynamic microstructure of EEG-signal.

It entails the search of an optimal subset from a very large data set with high dimensional feature space. Apart from eliminating redundant features and reducing computational cost, a good selection of feature also leads to higher prediction and classification accuracy. In this paper, an efficient feature selection technique is introduced in the task of epileptic seizure detection. The raw data are electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Using discrete wavelet transform, the biomedical signals were decomposed into several sets of wavelet coefficients. To reduce the dimension of these wavelet coefficients, a feature selection method that combines the strength of both filter and wrapper methods is proposed. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used as part of the filter method. As for wrapper method, the evolutionary harmony search (HS) algorithm is employed. This metaheuristic method aims at finding the best discriminating set of features from the original data. The obtained features were then used as input for an automated classifier, namely wavelet neural networks (WNNs). The WNNs model was trained to perform a binary classification task, that is, to determine whether a given EEG signal was normal or epileptic. For comparison purposes, different sets of features were also used as input. Simulation results showed that the WNNs that used the features chosen by the hybrid algorithm achieved the highest overall classification accuracy.

J	Lin, YP; Wang, YJ; Jung, TP				Lin, Yuan-Pin; Wang, Yijun; Jung, Tzyy-Ping			Assessing the feasibility of online SSVEP decoding in human walking using a consumer EEG headset	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						EEG; Consumer-level EEG headset; SSVEP; BCI; Moving humans	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; DYNAMICS; DESIGN	Background: Bridging the gap between laboratory brain-computer interface (BCI) demonstrations and real-life applications has gained increasing attention nowadays in translational neuroscience. An urgent need is to explore the feasibility of using a low-cost, ease-of-use electroencephalogram (EEG) headset for monitoring individuals' EEG signals in their natural head/body positions and movements. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using a consumer-level EEG headset to realize an online steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI during human walking. Methods: This study adopted a 14-channel Emotiv EEG headset to implement a four-target online SSVEP decoding system, and included treadmill walking at the speeds of 0.45, 0.89, and 1.34 meters per second (m/s) to initiate the walking locomotion. Seventeen participants were instructed to perform the online BCI tasks while standing or walking on the treadmill. To maintain a constant viewing distance to the visual targets, participants held the hand-grip of the treadmill during the experiment. Along with online BCI performance, the concurrent SSVEP signals were recorded for offline assessment. Results: Despite walking-related attenuation of SSVEPs, the online BCI obtained an information transfer rate (ITR) over 12 bits/min during slow walking (below 0.89 m/s). Conclusions: SSVEP-based BCI systems are deployable to users in treadmill walking that mimics natural walking rather than in highly-controlled laboratory settings. This study considerably promotes the use of a consumer-level EEG headset towards the real-life BCI applications.

These potentials can be measured at the scalp, and constitute the electroencephalogram (EEG). When the EEG is time-locked to stimulation - such as the presentation of a word - and averaged over many such presentations, the Event-Related Potential (ERP) is obtained. The functional characteristics of components of the ERP are well understood, and some components represent processing that may differ uniquely from individual to individual such as the N400 component, which represents access to the semantic network. We applied several pattern classifiers to ERPs representing the response of individuals to a stream of text designed to be idiosyncratically familiar to different individuals. Results indicate that there are robustly identifiable features of the ERP that enable labeling of ERPs as belonging to individuals with accuracy reliably above chance (in the range of 82-97%). Further, these features are stable over time, as indicated by continued accurate identification of individuals from ERPs after a lag of up to six months. Even better, the high degree of labeling accuracy achieved in all cases was achieved with the use of only 3 electrodes on the scalp the minimal possible number that can acquire clean data.

Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are one of the most reliable brain responses to detect in the EEG signal. Although advanced supervised machine learning techniques can improve the classification performance of SSVEP responses, obtaining robust techniques that do not rely on training a classifier is also important. We propose to analyze, compare, and combine the performance of three state-of-the-art techniques for the detection of SSVEP responses across 10 subjects and different time segments to determine if robust classification can be obtained without subject-specific rigorous analysis using a combination of one or more techniques. The methods include two approaches based on spatial filtering, and canonical correlation analysis. The results support the conclusion that the choice of the method does not depend on the time segment, and the current techniques provide equivalent performance.

A new method is proposed based on a convex optimized delay vector variance (CDVV) and Genetic algorithm (GA) optimized multi-kernel extreme learning machine (GA-MKELM) for analyzing the epileptic seizures images. In this new method, the CDVV is used to extract the disease features and the MKELM is established to identify the features for the purpose of disease detection. To enhance the performance of the MKELM, the GA is adopted to optimize the structural parameters of the MKELM to provide accurate epileptic seizures detection and prediction. Experimental tests have been carried out in this work to verify the proposed CDVV-GA-MKELM method. The analysis results show that, useful quantitative image features could be efficiently extracted by CDVV from the EEG images of epileptic seizures and high identification rate has been achieved by the GA-MKELM. The overall accuracy is 88.67% for disease detection and 76.0% for forecasting. The CDW extracted features have been compared with existing features, such as the energy and entropy. The comparison suggests that the proposed feature extraction based on convex DVV is more effective than the energy and entropy with respect to the disease detection and prediction rates. Hence, the newly proposed method has importance for practical applications.

This paper addresses the emerging problem of comparing multivariate overcomplete dictionaries. Despite a recurrent need to rely on a distance for learning or assessing multivariate overcomplete dictionaries, no metrics in their underlying spaces have yet been proposed. Henceforth we propose to study overcomplete representations from the perspective of matrix manifolds. We consider distances between multivariate dictionaries as distances between their spans which reveal to be elements of a Grassmannian manifold. We introduce set-metrics defined on Grassmannian spaces and study their properties both theoretically and numerically. Thanks to the introduced metrics, experimental convergences of dictionary learning algorithms are assessed on synthetic datasets. Set-metrics are embedded in a clustering algorithm for a qualitative analysis of real EEG signals for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). The obtained clusters of subjects are associated with subject performances. This is a major methodological advance to understand the BCI-inefficiency phenomenon and to predict the ability of a user to interact with a BCI.

A Direct Brain-to-Brain Interface in Humans	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; COMPUTER INTERFACE; MOTOR; BCI	We describe the first direct brain-to-brain interface in humans and present results from experiments involving six different subjects. Our non-invasive interface, demonstrated originally in August 2013, combines electroencephalography (EEG) for recording brain signals with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for delivering information to the brain. We illustrate our method using a visuomotor task in which two humans must cooperate through direct brain-to-brain communication to achieve a desired goal in a computer game. The brain-to-brain interface detects motor imagery in EEG signals recorded from one subject (the "sender") and transmits this information over the internet to the motor cortex region of a second subject (the "receiver"). This allows the sender to cause a desired motor response in the receiver (a press on a touchpad) via TMS. We quantify the performance of the brain-to-brain interface in terms of the amount of information transmitted as well as the accuracies attained in (1) decoding the sender's signals, (2) generating a motor response from the receiver upon stimulation, and (3) achieving the overall goal in the cooperative visuomotor task. Our results provide evidence for a rudimentary form of direct information transmission from one human brain to another using non-invasive means.	[Rao, Rajesh P.

However, some of these nonlinear measures cannot achieve satisfying performance without considering the basic rhythms of epileptic EEGs. New method: To overcome the defects, this paper proposed a framework on wavelet-based nonlinear features and extreme learning machine (ELM) for the seizure detection. Three nonlinear methods, i.e., approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SampEn) and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) were computed from orignal EEG signals and corresponding wavelet decomposed sub-bands separately. The wavelet-based energy was measured as the comparative. Then the combination of sub-band features was fed to ELM and SVM classifier respectively. Results: The decomposed sub-band signals show significant discrimination between interictal and ictal states and the union of sub-band features helps to achieve better detection. All the three nonlinear methods show higher sensitivity than the wavelet-based energy analysis using the proposed framework. The wavelet-based SampEn-ELM detector reaches the best performance with a sensitivity of 92.6% and a false detection rate (FDR) of 0.078. Compared with SVM, the ELM detector is better in terms of detection accuracy and learning efficiency. Comparison with existing method(s): The decomposition of original signals into sub-bands leads to better identification of seizure events compared with that of the existing nonlinear methods without considering the time-frequency decomposition. Conclusions: The proposed framework achieves not only a high detection accuracy but also a very fast learning speed, which makes it feasible for the further development of the automatic seizure detection system.

Because interpretation of clinical EEG data is time-intensive and reliant on experts who are in short supply, there is a great need for automated spike detectors. However, attempts to develop general-purpose spike detectors have so far been severely limited by a lack of expert-annotated data. Huge databases of interictal discharges are therefore in great demand for the development of general-purpose detectors. Detailed manual annotation of interictal discharges is time consuming, which severely limits the willingness of experts to participate. To address such problems, a graphical user interface "SpikeGUI" was developed in our work for the purposes of EEG viewing and rapid interictal discharge annotation. "SpikeGUI" substantially speeds up the task of annotating interictal discharges using a custom-built algorithm based on a combination of template matching and online machine learning techniques. While the algorithm is currently tailored to annotation of interictal epileptiform discharges, it can easily be generalized to other waveforms and signal types.

This study throws light upon the contribution EEG signal for depression analysis. In this paper, classification of depressed patients from normal subjects are identified by using EEG signal. Experimental results are carried out with the help of 13 depressed patients and 12 normal subjects. This paper tries to classify person's mental state either normal or depressed with the help of EEG signal using signal processing technique FFT and machine learning technique SVM. These noninvasive signal techniques are useful for detection of depression disorders through EEG signals. The proposed work is compared with the other methods. The diagnosis is done and appropriate remedies are taken according to scale of the depression in the patient. This work shows that linear analysis of EEG can be an efficient method for identifying depressed patients from normal subjects. It is recommended that this analysis may be a supporting aid for psychiatrists to identify severity level of depressed patients.

EEG signals were acquired from eleven healthy subjects during four different imagined tasks performed with the right or left hand. Subjects were instructed to execute imagined grip movement at two different levels of force. Each task was executed 60 times in random order. The imagined grip force MRCP of the right or left hand was analyzed by superposition and averaging technology, a single-trial extraction method, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and multiple comparisons. Significantly different features were observed among different imagined grip force tasks. These differences were used to decode imagined grip force parameters using Fisher linear discrimination analysis based on kernel function (k-FLDA) and support vector machine (SVM). Under the proposed experimental paradigm, the study showed that MRCP may characterize the dynamic processing that takes place in the brain during the planning, execution, and precision of a given imagined grip force task. This means that features related to MRCP can be used to decode imagined grip force parameters based on EEG. ANOVA and multiple comparisons of time-domain features for MRCP showed that movement-monitoring potentials (MMP) and specific interval (0-150 ms) average potentials to be significantly different among 4 different imagined grip force tasks. The minimum peak negativity differed significantly between high and low amplitude grip force. Identification of the 4 different imagined grip force tasks based on MMP was performed using k-FLDA and SVM, and the average misclassification rates of 27 % +/- A 5 % and 24 % +/- A 4 % across 11 subjects were achieved respectively. The minimum misclassification rate was 15 %, and the average minimum misclassification rate across 11 subjects was 24 % +/- A 4.5 %. This investigation indicates that imagined grip force MRCP may encode imagined grip force parameters. Single-trial decoding of imagined grip force parameters based on MRCP may be feasible. The study may provide some additional and fine control instructions for brain-computer interfaces.

The current work, inspired by a similar fMRI design (Detre et al., in press), used a modified Think/No-Think(TNT) paradigm to investigate the neural signatures of volition over enhancing and suppressing memory retrieval. Previous studies have shown memory enhancement when well-learned stimulus pairs are restudied in cued recall ("Recall or think of studied pair item"), and degradation when restudied with cued suppression ("Avoid thinking of studied pair item"). We used category-based (faces vs. scenes) multivariate classification of electroencephalography signals to determine if individual target items were successfully retrieved or suppressed. A logistic regression based on classifier output determined that retrieval activation during the cued recall/suppression period was a predictor for subsequent memory. Labeling trials with this internal measure, as opposed to their nominal Think vs. No-Think condition, revealed the classic TNT pattern of enhanced memory for successful cued-retrieval and degraded memory for cued-suppression. This classification process enabled a more selective investigation into the time-frequency signatures of control over retrieval. Comparing controlled retrieval vs. controlled suppression, results showed more prominent Theta oscillations (3 to 8 Hz) in controlled retrieval. Beta oscillations (12 to 30 Hz) were involved in high levels of both controlled retrieval and suppression, suggesting it may have a more general control-related role. These results suggest unique roles for these frequency bands in retrieval processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This technique offers a very high temporal resolution that allows noninvasive brain exploration at a millisecond (ms) time scale. Decoding, a.k.a. brain reading, consists in predicting from neuroimaging data the subject's behavior and/or the parameters of the perceived stimuli. This is facilitated by the use of supervised learning techniques. In this work we consider the problem of decoding a target variable with ordered values. This target reflects the use of a parametric experimental design in which a parameter of the stimulus is continuously modulated during the experiment. The decoding step is performed by a Ridge regression. The evaluation metric, given the ordinal nature of the target is performed by a ranking metric. On a visual paradigm consisting of random dot kinematograms with 7 coherence levels recorded on 36 subjects we show that one can predict the perceptual thresholds of the subjects from the MEG data. Results are obtained in sensor space and for source estimates in relevant regions of interests (MT, pSTS, mSTS, VLPFC).

This article provides an overview of these methods and offers guidelines for choosing appropriate signal processing techniques. The review considers the three key stages required for the analysis of sleep EEGs namely, pre-processing, feature extraction, and feature classification. The pre-processing section describes the most frequently used signal processing techniques that deal with preparation of the sleep EEG signal prior to further analysis. The feature extraction and classification sections are also dedicated to highlight the most commonly used signal analysis methods used for characterising and classifying the sleep EEGs. Performance criteria of the addressed techniques are given where appropriate. The online supplementary materials accompanying this article comprise an extended taxonomy table for each section, which contains the relevant signal processing techniques, their brief descriptions (including their pros and cons where possible) and their specific applications in the field of sleep EEG analysis. In order to further increase the readability of the article, signal processing techniques are also categorised in tabular format based on their application in intensively researched sleep areas such as sleep staging, transient pattern detection and sleep disordered breathing diagnosis.

We conducted a cognitive workload experiment involving multiple subjects and collected an extensive data set of EEG, ECG and GSR signals. We show that the GSR signal is consistent with the variations of cognitive workload in 75% of the samples. To explore cardiac patterns in ECG that are potentially correlated with the cognitive workload process, we computed various hear-trate-variability features. To extract neuronal activity patterns in EEG related to cognitive workload, we introduced a filter bank common spatial pattern filtering technique. As there can be large variations in e.g. individual responses to the cognitive workload, we propose a large margin unbiased recursive feature extraction and regression method. Our leave-one-subject-out cross validation test shows that, using the proposed method, EEG can provide significantly better prediction of the cognitive workload variation than ECG, with 87.5% vs 62.5% in accuracy rate.

J	Yang, HJ; Guan, CT; Wang, CC; Ang, KK				Yang, Huijuan; Guan, Cuntai; Wang, Chuan Chu; Ang, Kai Keng			Detection of motor imagery of brisk walking from electroencephalogram	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Rehabilitation; Motor imageiy of walking; Optimization/regularization; Maximum dependency and minimum redundancy; Class separation; Joint channel and frequency band selection	CHANNEL SELECTION; GAIT REHABILITATION; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; DEPENDENCY; ACTIVATION; MOVEMENTS; PATTERNS; OVERT; HAND	Rehabilitation of lower limbs is equally as important as that of upper limbs. This paper presented a study to detect motor imagery of walking (MI-Walking) from background idle state. Broad overlapping neuronal networks involved in reorganization following motor imagery introduce redundancy. We hypothesized that MI-Walking could be robustly detected by constraining dependency among selected features and class separations. Hence, we proposed to jointly select channels and frequency bands involved in MI-Walking by optimizing/regularizing the objective function formulated on the dependency between features and class labels, redundancy between to-be-selected with selected features, and separations between classes, namely, "regularized maximum dependency with minimum redundancy-based joint channel and frequency band selection (RMDR-JCFS)". Evaluated on electroencephalography (EEG) data of 11 healthy subjects, the results showed that the selected channels were mainly located at premotor cortex, mid-central area overlaying supplementary motor area (SMA), prefrontal cortex, foot area sensory cortex and leg and arm sensorimotor representation area. Broad frequencies of alpha, mu and beta rhythms were involved. Our proposed method yielded an averaged accuracy of 76.67%, which was 9.08%, 5.03%, 7.03%, 14.15% and 3.88% higher than that obtained by common spatial pattern (CSP), filter-bank CSP, sliding window discriminate CSP, filter-bank power and maximum dependency and minimum redundancy methods, respectively. Further, our method yielded significantly superior performance compared with other channel selection methods, and it yielded an averaged session-to-session accuracy of 70.14%. These results demonstrated the potentials of detecting MI-Walking using proposed method for stroke rehabilitation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For motion pattern recognition, many features of multi-channel EMG signals were investigated, but the relationships between muscles were not considered. In this study, a novel STFT-ranking feature based on short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is proposed. The novelty of STFT-ranking features is considering and covering the relationship information between EMG signals and multiple muscles in a motion pattern. With an exoskeleton robot arm, two series of motion patterns corresponding to the shoulder and elbow in the sagittal plane were investigated. EMG signals from six muscles were acquired in arm motion patterns when participants worn the robot arm. Four types of feature combinations, including seven conventional features, were compared with the STFT-ranking feature. The principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to build the motion recognition model. With the STFT-ranking feature, the recognition performance (93.9%) is superior to the conventional features (33.3-90.8%). The recognition variation is smaller (SD = 4.3%) than the other features tested (SD = 5.9-13.8%). These achievements will contribute to the advancement of control method of exoskeleton robots or power orthoses based on multi-channel EMG signals in the future. Based on the principle of STFT-ranking feature, the method also has potential for other multi-channel signal applications, such as electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing, speech recognition, and acoustic analysis.

In BCIs, motor imagery (MI) tasks generate brain activities, which are generally measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The aim of this research was to introduce a method for the extraction of discriminatory information from the MI-based EEG signals for BCI applications. The proposed scheme develops an optimal allocation (OA)-based approach to discover the most effective representatives with minimal variability from a large number of MI-based EEG data. To investigate a suitable classifier for the OA-based features, the least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) methods are applied separately on the extracted features for discriminating the MI activities. Experimental results on datasets, IVa and IVb of BCI Competition III, show that the OA-based features with the LS-SVM classifier yields better performances compared to the NB classifiers. The results also demonstrate that the classification performance is improved up to 21.16 %, through the use of the OA algorithm with the LS-SVM, compared to the reported four prominent methods. This implies that the OA technique is promising for extracting representative characteristics from MI-based EEG data, which can be reliably used with the LS-SVM to identify different signals of brain activities in the development of BCI systems.

However, 15-30 % of subjects cannot achieve SMR-BCI control even after long-term training, and they are termed as "BCI inefficiency". This study focuses on the investigation of reliable SMR-BCI performance predictor. 40 subjects participated in the first experimental session and 26 of them returned in the second session, each session consists of an eyes closed/open resting-state EEG recording run and four EEG recording runs with hand motor imagery. We found spectral entropy derived from eyes closed resting-state EEG of channel C3 has a high correlation with SMR-BCI performance (r = 0.65). Thus, we proposed to use it as a biomarker to predict individual SMR-BCI performance. Receiver operating characteristics analysis and leave-one-out cross-validation demonstrated that the spectral entropy predictor provide outstanding classification capability for high and low aptitude BCI users. To our knowledge, there has been no discussion about the reliability of inter-session prediction in previous studies. We further evaluated the inter-session prediction performance of the spectral entropy predictor, and the results showed that the average classification accuracy of inter-session prediction up to 89 %. The proposed predictor is convenient to obtain because it derived from single channel resting-state EEG, it could be used to identify potential SMR-BCI inefficiency subjects from novel users. But there are still limitations because Kubler et al. have shown that some BCI users may need eight or more sessions before they develop classifiable SMR activity.

Almost all conventional intelligent recognition methods assume that the training and testing data of EEG signals have identical distribution. However, this assumption may indeed be invalid for practical applications due to differences in distributions between the training and testing data, making the conventional epilepsy detection algorithms not feasible under such situations. In order to overcome this problem, we proposed a transfer-learning-based intelligent recognition method for epilepsy detection. Methods: We used the large-margin-projected transductive support vector machine method (LMPROJ) to learn the useful knowledge between the training domain and testing domain by calculating the maximal mean discrepancy. The method can effectively learn a model for the testing data with training data of different distributions, thereby relaxing the constraint that the data distribution in the training and testing samples should be identical. Results: The experimental validation is performed over six datasets of electroencephalogram signals with three feature extraction methods. The proposed LMPROJ-based transfer learning method was compared with five conventional classification methods. For the datasets with identical distribution, the performance of these six classification methods was comparable. They all could achieve an accuracy of 90%. However, the LMPROJ method obviously outperformed the five conventional methods for experimental datasets with different distribution between the training and test data. Regardless of the feature extraction method applied, the mean classification accuracy of the proposed method is above 93%, which is greater than that of the other five methods with statistical significance. Conclusion: The proposed transfer-learning-based method has better classification accuracy and adaptability than the conventional methods in classifying EEG signals for epilepsy detection.

The EEG clinical data were obtained from the EEG Database available with the Clinic of Epileptology of the University Hospital of Bonn, Germany. The data sets (C, D, and E) were taken from five epileptic patients undergoing presurgical evaluations. The data sets consist of intracranial EEG recordings during seizure-free intervals (interictal periods) from within the epileptogenic zone (D) and from the hippocampal formation of the opposite hemisphere of the epileptic patients' brain, respectively (C). The data set (E) was recorded during seizure activity (ictal periods). MF-DXA is a very rigorous and robust tool for assessment of cross-correlation among two nonlinear time series. The study reveals the degree of cross-correlation is more among seizure and seizure free interval in epileptogenic zone. These data are very significant for diagnosis, onset and prognosis of epileptic patients. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A New EEG Measure Using the 1-D Cluster Variation Method	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSES, COMPRESSIVE SAMPLING, LARGE DATA ANALYSES (LDA), NEURAL NETWORKS, BIOSYSTEMS, AND NANOENGINEERING XIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Independent Component Analyses, Compressive Sampling, Large Data Analyses (LDA), Neural Networks, Biosystems, and Nanoengineering XIII	APR 23-24, 2015	Baltimore, MD	SPIE		EEG; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Cluster Variation Method; statistical thermodynamics; free energy minimization; pattern classification; neural networks; neural ensembles	BRAIN	A new information measure, drawing on the 1-D Cluster Variation Method (CVM), describes local pattern distributions (nearest-neighbor and next-nearest neighbor) in a binary 1-D vector in terms of a single interaction enthalpy parameter h for the specific case where the fractions of elements in each of two states are the same (x(1) = x(2) = 0.5). An example application of this method would be for EEG interpretation in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), especially in the frontier of invariant biometrics based on distinctive and invariant individual responses to stimuli containing an image of a person with whom there is a strong affiliative response (e.g., to a person's grandmother). This measure is obtained by mapping EEG observed configuration variables (z(1), z(2), z(3) for next-nearest neighbor triplets) to h using the analytic function giving h in terms of these variables at equilibrium. This mapping results in a small phase space region of resulting h values, which characterizes local pattern distributions in the source data. The 1-D vector with equal fractions of units in each of the two states can be obtained using the method for transforming natural images into a binarized equiprobability ensemble (Saremi & Sejnowski, 2014; Stephens et al., 2013). An intrinsically 2-D data configuration can be mapped to 1-D using the 1-D Peano-Hilbert space-filling curve, which has demonstrated a 20 dB lower baseline using the method compared with other approaches (cf. SPIE ICA etc. by Hsu & Szu, 2014). This CVM-based method has multiple potential applications; one near-term one is optimizing classification of the EEG signals from a COTS 1-D BCI baseball hat. This can result in a convenient 3-D lab-tethered EEG, configured in a 1-D CVM equiprobable binary vector, and potentially useful for Smartphone wireless display. Longer-range applications include interpreting neural assembly activations via high-density implanted soft, cellular-scale electrodes.

Estimating Vigilance from EEG using Manifold Clustering Guided by Instantaneous Lapse Rate	2015 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION, COMMUNICATIONS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (ICICS)			English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)	DEC 02-04, 2015	Singapore, SINGAPORE				CLASSIFICATION; REDUCTION	Vigilance decrement happens in prolonged and monotonous tasks such as driving, therefore efficient estimation of vigilance using machine learning becomes a growing research field in road safety. However, the ground truth of vigilance level is often unknown. To address the estimation of brain states with unknown ground truth, we proposed an unsupervised manifold clustering method guided by task performance, namely instantaneous lapse rate, without directly using any artificially labels, using electroencephalogram (EEG) as data source. The proposed algorithm utilizes information from both data structure and task performance, which is especially suitable for applications with unknown ground truth. Future research directions include using advanced manifold clustering algorithms to increase the robustness towards the high nonlinearity in the EEG feature space and the embedded space, as well as allowing the mapping from multiple clusters to one vigilance level.

Of primary importance is to use less data and computationally efficient algorithms to support real-time BCI. To this end, an algorithm that exploits the sparse characteristics of EEGs is proposed to classify these signals. Different feature vectors are extracted based on the energies in different frequency sub-bands of the Wavelet Packet decomposition of EEG trials recorded only by five electrodes near the sensorimotor cortex. Features from a small spatial region are approximated by a sparse linear combination of few atoms from a multi-class dictionary constructed from the wavelet features of the projected EEG training signals for each class. This is used to classify the signals based on the pattern of their sparse representation using a minimum-residual decision rule. The results obtained from real data demonstrate that the combination of energy and entropy features enables efficient classification of motor imagery EEG trials related to hand and foot movements. Also, the decomposition used is shown to provide a frequency resolution consistent with the existence of different levels within the alpha band.

For this purpose, the EEG signal processing plays an important role, especially in feature extraction. In this paper, a combined feature extraction method is proposed for left-right hand motor imagery in BCI. The power in the sensorimotor rhythm band and the statistical features of wavelet coefficients are used for extracting features and support vector machine is adopted for pattern recognition of left-right hand motor imagery.

Beside promising studies in the application of Al methods to health informatics, working with more informative features is crucial in order to contribute to early diagnosis. Being one of the prevalent psychiatric disorders, depressive episodes of bipolar disorder (BD) is often misdiagnosed as major depressive disorder (MDD), leading to suboptimal therapy and poor outcomes. Therefore discriminating MDD and BD at earlier stages of illness could help to facilitate efficient and specific treatment. In this study, a nature inspired and novel FS algorithm based on standard Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), called improved ACO (IACO), was used to reduce the number of features by removing irrelevant and redundant data. The selected features were then fed into support vector machine (SVM), a powerful mathematical tool for data classification, regression, function estimation and modeling processes, in order to classify MDD and BD subjects. Proposed method used coherence, a promising quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) biomarker, values calculated from alpha, theta and delta frequency bands. The noteworthy performance of novel IACO-SVM approach stated that it is possible to discriminate 46 BD and 55 MDD subjects using 22 of 48 features with 80.19% overall classification accuracy. The performance of IACO algorithm was also compared to the performance of standard ACO, genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms in terms of their classification accuracy and number of selected features. In order to provide an almost unbiased estimate of classification error, the validation process was performed using nested cross-validation (CV) procedure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This new approach allows for improved EEG spatial resolution based on simultaneous fMRI activity measurements. Advanced signal processing and machine learning methods were applied on EEG data acquired simultaneously with fMRI during relaxation training guided by on-line continuous feedback on changing alpha/theta EEG measure. We focused on demonstrating improved EEG prediction of activation in sub-cortical regions such as the amygdala. Our analysis shows that a ridge regression model that is based on time/frequency representation of EEG data from a single electrode, can predict the amygdala related activity significantly better than a traditional theta/alpha activity sampled from the best electrode and about 1/3 of the times, significantly better than a linear combination of frequencies with a pre-defined delay. The far-reaching goal of our approach is to be able to reduce the need for fMRI scanning for probing specific sub-cortical regions such as the amygdala as the basis for brain-training procedures. On the other hand, activity in those regions can be characterized with higher temporal resolution than is obtained by fMRI alone thus revealing additional information about their processing mode.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) alterations in the spectral content of brainwaves and connectivity at resting state have been associated with early-stage AD. Recently, cognitive event-related potentials (ERPs) have entered into the picture as an easy to perform screening test. Motivated by the recent findings about the role of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in cognition, we introduce a relevant methodological approach for detecting MCI based on cognitive responses from a standard auditory oddball paradigm. By using the single trial signals recorded at Pz sensor and comparing the responses to target and non-target stimuli, we first demonstrate that increased CFC is associated with the cognitive task. Then, considering the dynamic character of CFC, we identify instances during which the coupling between particular pairs of brainwave frequencies carries sufficient information for discriminating between normal subjects and patients with MCI. In this way, we form a multiparametric signature of impaired cognition. The new composite biomarker was tested using data from a cohort that consists of 25 amnestic MCI patients and 15 age-matched controls. Standard machine-learning algorithms were employed so as to implement the binary classification task. Based on leave-one-out cross validation, the measured classification rate was found reaching very high levels (95%). Our approach compares favorably with the traditional alternative of using the morphology of averaged ERP response to make the diagnosis and the usage of features from spectro-temporal analysis of single-trial responses. This further indicates that task related CFC measurements can provide invaluable analytics in AD diagnosis and prognosis.

It is a critical limitation to broader neurophysiological study of hf-SEPs in that hundreds of responses have to be averaged to detect hf-SEPs reliably. Here, we establish a framework for detecting human hf-SEPs non-invasively in single trials. Methods: Spatio-temporal features were extracted from band-pass filtered (400-900 Hz) hf-SEPs by bilinear Common Spatio-Temporal Patterns (bCSTP) and then classified by a weighted Extreme Learning Machine (w-ELM). The effect of varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), number of trials, and degree of w-ELM re-weighting was characterized using surrogate data. For practical demonstration of the algorithm, median nerve hf-SEPs were recorded inside a shielded room in four subjects, spanning the hf-SEP signal-to-noise ratio characteristic for a larger population, utilizing a custom-built 29-channel low-noise EEG amplifier. Results: Using surrogate data, the SNR proved to be pivotal to detect hf-SEPs in single trials efficiently, with the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm being obtained by the w-ELM re-weighting parameter. In practice, human hf-SEPs were detected non-invasively in single trials with a sensitivity of up to 99% and a specificity of up to 97% in two subjects, even without any recourse to knowledge of stimulus timing. Matching with the results of the surrogate data analysis, these rates dropped to 62-79% sensitivity and 18-31% specificity in two subjects with lower SNR. Conclusions: Otherwise buried in background noise, human high-frequency EEG components can be extracted from low-noise recordings. Specifically, refined supervised filter optimization and classification enables the reliable detection of single-trial hf-SEPs, representing non-invasive correlates of cortical population spikes. Significance: While low-frequency EEG reflects summed postsynaptic potentials, and thereby neuronal input, we suggest that high-frequency EEG (>400 Hz) can provide non-invasive access to the unaveraged output of neuronal computation, i.e., single-trial population spike activity evoked in the responsive neuronal ensemble.

Therefore, many learners do the experiential learning through visual and haptic digital teaching materials. In such a system, however, it is difficult to evaluate whether the learner could recognize the sensation and obtain the sensory skill. In the paper, we investigate whether the biological signal such as EEG can be used for the evaluation of the haptic task skill level. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Automatic seizure detection from EEG recording is very important for clinical diagnosis and monitoring and has become an issue of major scientific and technological interest. In this work, we use the spatio-spectral features extracted via multidimensional PARAFAC analysis of the EEG for seizure detection. This is a subject-specific approach which only requires extracting one component explaining a seizure's space-time-frequency pattern. Then, we propose a simple adaptive zero-training technique (AZT) to classify the seizures, with the additional advantages of being fast and able to be used online. Here, we evaluate the performance of this technique and compare its accuracy, sensitivity and specificity with those obtained from known pattern recognition methodologies (LDA, SVM, k-Means), on EEG recordings of two epileptic pediatric patients. Results showed that the new method offers the highest sensitivity for different segments' length, although small segments lead to an increase of the false positives rate. The combination of the feature extracted via PARAFAC model and the AZT procedure would therefore be a promising technique for fast zero-training online seizure detection.

To resolve this problem, it is important to know about neural correlation of the directions of arm movement. Previous studies classified the directions of arm movement, using center-out task, only including y-z-axis movement. In this research, 4 subjects participated in experiment and the movement of their right arm in infinity shape (infinity) divided into six part of symbol. Moreover, we used Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm to extract finer feature of EEG signal and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) method to classify directions of movement. The result states that, average of classification accuracy was 74% and standard derivation was 0.08. In the topographical map at the center of infinity shape, we could observe the divided image of left and right side of the brain and FC3, F-7 and C-3 channels included most information about directions of movement. By the result of this study, we can confirm the possibility of controlling neuro-prosthetics and evidence of neurological basis of the arm movement.

It is common in human-robot interaction, tutoring systems, and in human-computer interfaces such as brain-computer ones. In most cases, learning these tasks is possible because the signals are predefined or an ad-hoc calibration procedure allows to map signals to specific meanings. In this paper, we address the problem of simultaneously solving a task under human feedback and learning the associated meanings of the feedback signals. This has important practical application since the user can start controlling a device from scratch, without the need of an expert to define the meaning of signals or carrying out a calibration phase. The paper proposes an algorithm that simultaneously assign meanings to signals while solving a sequential task under the assumption that both, human and machine, share the same a priori on the possible instruction meanings and the possible tasks. Furthermore, we show using synthetic and real EEG data from a brain-computer interface that taking into account the uncertainty of the task and the signal is necessary for the machine to actively plan how to solve the task efficiently.

Frequent sleep arousals can degrade sleep quality, result in sleep fragmentation and lead to daytime sleepiness. Visual inspection of arousal events from PSG recordings is time consuming and cumbersome, and manual scoring results can vary widely among different expert scorers. This paper reports the design and performance evaluation of an effective and efficient method to automatically detect sleep arousals using a single channel EEG. A detection model, based on a Curious Extreme Learning Machine (C-ELM), using a set of 22 features is proposed. The performance was evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) and the Accuracy (ACC). The proposed C-ELM based model achieved an average AUC and ACC of 0.85 and 0.79 respectively. The best AUC from among the 50 datasets used was 0.88. In comparison, the average AUC and ACC of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based model were 0.69 and 0.67 respectively, and the best AUC from among the same 50 datasets used was 0.88. This indicates that the proposed C-ELM based model works well for the sleep arousal detection problem.

This paper presents a novel method to detect neonatal bust suppression from multichannel EEG using a time-frequency (T-F) based approach. In this approach, features are extracted from T-F representations of EEG signals obtained using quadratic time-frequency distributions (QTFDs). Such features take into account the non-stationarity of EEG signals and are shown to be able to discriminate between burst and suppression patterns. The features are based on the energy concentration of the signals in the T-F domain, instantaneous frequency of the signals, and Renyi entropy and singular-value decomposition (SVD) of the TFDs of EEG. For each feature, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is found and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is calculated as the performance criterion. Experimental results using EEG signals with burst suppression acquired from 3 term neonates show that the features extracted from the singular values of TFDs and energy concentration outperform others. Amongst different QTFDs, features extracted from the optimized extended modified B distribution exhibit the best performance. Also, a classifier which uses these features achieves a total accuracy of 99.6%.	[Awal, Md.

In this work, we discuss a novel, fully Bayesian-and thereby probabilistic-framework, called Bayesian Spatio-Spectral Filter Optimization (BSSFO) and apply it to a large data set of 80 non-invasive EEG-based BCI experiments. Across the full frequency range, the BSSFO framework allows to analyze which spatio-spectral parameters are common and which ones differ across the subject population. As expected, large variability of brain rhythms is observed between subjects. We have clustered subjects according to similarities in their corresponding spectral characteristics from the BSSFO model, which is found to reflect their BCI performances well. In BCI, a considerable percentage of subjects is unable to use a BCI for communication, due to their missing ability to modulate their brain rhythms-a phenomenon sometimes denoted as BCI-illiteracy or inability. Predicting individual subjects' performance preceding the actual, time-consuming BCI-experiment enhances the usage of BCIs, e.g., by detecting users with BCI inability. This work additionally contributes by using the novel BSSFO method to predict the BCI-performance using only 2 minutes and 3 channels of resting-state EEG data recorded before the actual BCI-experiment. Specifically, by grouping the individual frequency characteristics we have nicely classified them into the subject 'prototypes' (like mu - or beta - rhythm type subjects) or users without ability to communicate with a BCI, and then by further building a linear regression model based on the grouping we could predict subjects' performance with the maximum correlation coefficient of 0.581 with the performance later seen in the actual BCI session.

J	Lu, N; Yin, T				Lu, Na; Yin, Tao			Motor imagery classification via combinatory decomposition of ERP and ERSP using sparse nonnegative matrix factorization	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Motor imagery; Classification; Event related potential; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Brain computer interface	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERNS; EEG; COMPONENTS; ALGORITHMS; ICA	Background: Brain activities could be measured by devices like EEG, MEG, MRI etc. in terms of electric or magnetic signal, which could provide information from three domains, i.e., time, frequency and space. Combinatory analysis of these features could definitely help to improve the classification performance on brain activities. NMF (nonnegative matrix factorization) has been widely applied in pattern extraction tasks (e.g., face recognition, gene data analysis) which could provide physically meaningful explanation of the data. However, brain signals also take negative values, so only spectral feature has been employed in existing NMF studies for brain computer interface. In addition, sparsity is an intrinsic characteristic of electric signals. New method: To incorporate sparsity constraint and enable analysis of time domain feature using NMF, a new solution for motor imagery classification is developed, which combinatorially analyzes the ERP (event related potential, time domain) and ERSP (event related spectral perturbation, frequency domain) features via a modified mixed alternating least square based NMF method (MALS-NMF for short). Results: Extensive experiments have verified the effectivity the proposed method. The results also showed that imposing sparsity constraint on the coefficient matrix in ERP factorization and basis matrix in ERSP factorization could better improve the algorithm performance. Comparison with existing methods: Comparisons with other eight representative methods have further verified the superiority of the proposed method.

Such classification problems frequently appear in many bioinformatics applications where the number of patterns is smaller than the number of features and thus the curse of dimensionality problem exists. The main contribution of this paper is proposing a set of label-aided utility functions that allows the effective search of the most adequate subset of features through an evolutionary multi-objective optimization scheme. The experimental results have been obtained in a brain-computer interface (BCI) classification task based on LDA classifiers, where the properties of multi-resolution analysis (MRA) for signal analysis in temporal and spectral domains have been used to extract the features from EEG signals. The results from the proposed filter method demonstrate some advantages such as less time consumption and better generalization capabilities with respect to some wrapper-based multi-objective feature selection alternatives.

Feature extraction plays a fundamental role for good classification purposes. EEG features commonly extracted are linear as well as nonlinear. Nonlinear approaches are used when the complexity of EEG signals increases. Nonlinear features like correlation dimension (CD), Lyapunov exponents, approximate entropy requires higher computational complexity. On other hand Fractal dimension (FD) requires less computations. Therefore, Fractal dimension are widely used in engineering and biological sciences. In our paper, Fractal dimension has been selected to discriminate the different brain states. EEG data from 08 healthy participants have been acquired during eyes open, eyes close and during IQ task. Fractal dimensions have been computed on the EEG data acquired. Using Fractal dimension, we have successfully discriminated the different brain conditions/states like eyes open, eyes close and IQ task. Results have shown better discrimination between mental task and active brain conditions with 91.66 % accuracy using SVM classifier as compared to other classifiers. This approach can be used for fast decision making and pattern matching based on the selected epoch of the EEG signal using nonlinear approach.

In this paper, nonnegative Tucker decomposition which is one model of nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) is used to fuse two kinds of bioelectricity signals (EEG and sEMG) and extract multi-domain features of EEG and sEMG signals for classification which contain time, frequency, and space domains. In the first step the EEG and sEMG data are transformed into multidimensional information using continuous wavelet transform and the 4-D EEG-sEMG tensor is established. Then the tensor is decomposed into four components (spatial components, spectral components, temporal components and category components) and the core tensor is the feature extracted. The feature after being eliminated and compressed are fed into KNN, LDA and SVM classifiers for pattern recognition, and a comparison is done in single EEG analysis, single sEMG analysis and both EEG and sEMG analysis. An experiment about 10 healthy participants' upper limb movements was carried out to verify the validity of this algorithm. The result implied that NTF is a meaningful and valuable synchronous and multi-domain feature extraction method which may be promising in power-assist rehabilitation robot control.

Orthogonal Haar wavelet coefficients are ranked based on the Wilcoxon test's statistics. The most prominent discriminant wavelets are assembled to form a feature set that serves as inputs to the na < ve Bayes classifier. Two benchmark datasets, named Ia and Ib, downloaded from the brain-computer interface (BCI) competition II are employed for the experiments. Classification performance is evaluated using accuracy, mutual information, Gini coefficient and F-measure. Widely used classifiers, including feedforward neural network, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbours, ensemble learning Adaboost and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, are also implemented for comparisons. The proposed combination of Haar wavelet features and na < ve Bayes classifier considerably dominates the competitive classification approaches and outperforms the best performance on the Ia and Ib datasets reported in the BCI competition II. Application of na < ve Bayes also provides a low computational cost approach that promotes the implementation of a potential real-time BCI system.

PLANAR REACHING MOVEMENTS; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MOTOR IMAGERY; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC SIGNALS; CLASSIFICATION; INTERFACE; TARGETS; TASKS	The relationship between movement kinematics and human brain activity is an important and fundamental question for the development of neural prosthesis. The peak velocity and the peak acceleration could best reflect the feedforward-type movement; thus, it is worthwhile to investigate them further. Most related studies focused on the correlation between kinematics and brain activity during the movement execution or imagery. However, human movement is the result of the motor planning phase as well as the execution phase and researchers have demonstrated that statistical correlations exist between EEG activity during the motor planning and the peak velocity and the peak acceleration using grand-average analysis. In this paper, we examined whether the correlations were concealed in trial-to-trial decoding from the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG activity. The alpha and beta powers from the movement planning phase were combined with the alpha and beta powers from the movement execution phase to predict the peak tangential speed and acceleration. The results showed that EEG activity from the motor planning phase could also predict the peak speed and the peak acceleration with a reasonable accuracy. Furthermore, the decoding accuracy of the peak speed and the peak acceleration could both be improved by combining band powers from the motor planning phase with the band powers from the movement execution.

To detect movement intention from executed and imaginary palmar grasps in healthy subjects and attempted executions in stroke patients using one EEG channel. Moreover, movement force and speed were also decoded. Approach. Fifteen healthy subjects performed motor execution and imagination of four types of palmar grasps. In addition, five stroke patients attempted to perform the same movements. The movements were detected from the continuous EEG using a single electrode/channel overlying the cortical representation of the hand. Four features were extracted from the EEG signal and classified with a support vector machine (SVM) to decode the level of force and speed associated with the movement. The system performance was evaluated based on both detection and classification. Main results. similar to 75% of all movements (executed, imaginary and attempted) were detected 100 ms before the onset of the movement. similar to 60% of the movements were correctly classified according to the intended level of force and speed. When detection and classification were combined, similar to 45% of the movements were correctly detected and classified in both the healthy and stroke subjects, although the performance was slightly better in healthy subjects. Significance. The results indicate that it is possible to use a single EEG channel for detecting movement intentions that may be combined with assistive technologies. The simple setup may lead to a smoother transition from laboratory tests to the clinic.

BCIs which based on mental tasks of users are widely used for disabled or paralyzed patients, in order to help their mobility. Preprocessing techniques have been extensively developed to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and spatial distribution of the signals. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) has shown to be a robust and effective method for processing Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, the results of CSP filter are still far from being completely explored. CSP was originally designed for two-class problem despite the fact that a practical application of Motor-imagery (MI) based BCI contains numbers of activities. It is necessary to design the classification algorithm which applicable to more than two-class problem. In this paper we investigate the performance of CSP by selecting optimal time slice and components for training CSP filters in four-class BCI by separating the four-class problem into multiple binary classifications. Our method is verified in the testing phase with four different types of classification approaches which are linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), linear support vector machines (LSVM), and support vector machines with radial basis function kernel (RBF-SVM). The result showed that, under the optimal time slice and components, the classification accuracy reach 78.82% for the best untrained subject in this dataset.

Projects like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib have created a strong foundation for scientific computing in Python and machine learning packages like scikit-learn or packages for data analysis like Pandas are building on top of it. In this paper we present Wyrm (https://github.com/bbci/wyrm), an open source BCI toolbox in Python. Wyrm is applicable to a broad range of neuroscientific problems. It can be used as a toolbox for analysis and visualization of neurophysiological data and in real-time settings, like an online BCI application. In order to prevent software defects, Wyrm makes extensive use of unit testing. We will explain the key aspects of Wyrm's software architecture and design decisions for its data structure, and demonstrate and validate the use of our toolbox by presenting our approach to the classification tasks of two different data sets from the BCI Competition III.

On the effect of subliminal priming on subjective perception of images: a machine learning approach	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc			PICTURES	The research presented in this article investigates the influence of subliminal prime words on peoples' judgment about images, through electroencephalograms (EEGs). In this cross domain priming paradigm, the participants are asked to rate how much they like the stimulus images, on a 7-point Likert scale, after being subliminally exposed to masked lexical prime words, with EEG recorded simultaneously. Statistical analysis tools are used to analyze the effect of priming on behavior, and machine learning techniques to infer the primes from EEGs. The experiment reveals strong effects of subliminal priming on the participants' explicit rating of images. The subjective judgment affected by the priming makes visible change in event-related potentials (ERPs); results show larger ERP amplitude for the negative primes compared with positive and neutral primes. In addition, Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifiers are proposed to infer the prime types from the average ERPs, which yields a classification rate of 70%.

In the proposed method, observed signals are divided into some frequency bins and covariance matrices in each bin are obtained. And then we measure the distances of the covariance matrices between the bins by the common spatial pattern method. The near bins on this metric are selected as the passband. By adopting this metric, we can select the passbands being useful for classification problem in MI-BMI. We conducted the experiment with a dataset of MI-BMI. The proposed method outperforms some conventional methods in the classification accuracy.

In SWS, sensitivity to pain is the lowest relative to other sleep stages and arousal needs stronger stimuli. 40-Hz ASSR signals were extracted by averaging over 900 sweeps on a 30-s window. Signals generated during N-3 deep sleep state show similarities to those produced when general anesthesia is given to patients during clinical surgery. Our experimental results show that the automatic classification system used identifies sleep states with an accuracy rate of 100% when the training and test signals come from the same subjects while its accuracy is reduced to 97.6%, on average, when signals are used from different training and test subjects. Our results may lead to future classification of consciousness and wakefulness of patients with 40-Hz ASSR for observing the depth and effects of general anesthesia (DGA).

The PREP pipeline: standardized preprocessing for large-scale EEG analysis	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						EEG; artifact; preprocessing; EEGLAB; BCILAB; machine learning; big data	BRAIN; COMPONENTS; PLATFORM	The technology to collect brain imaging and physiological measures has become portable and ubiquitous, opening the possibility of large-scale analysis of real-world human imaging. By its nature, such data is large and complex, making automated processing essential. This paper shows how lack of attention to the very early stages of an EEG preprocessing pipeline can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and introduce unwanted artifacts into the data, particularly for computations done in single precision. We demonstrate that ordinary average referencing improves the signal-to-noise ratio, but that noisy channels can contaminate the results. We also show that identification of noisy channels depends on the reference and examine the complex interaction of filtering, noisy channel identification, and referencing. We introduce a multi-stage robust referencing scheme to deal with the noisy channel-reference interaction. We propose a standardized early-stage EEG processing pipeline (PREP) and discuss the application of the pipeline to more than 600 EEG datasets. The pipeline includes an automatically generated report for each dataset processed. Users can download the PREP pipeline as a freely available MATLAB library from http://eegstudy.org/prepcode.

Use of Discrete Sine Transform in EEG signal classification for early Autism detection	2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMMUNICATION CONTROL AND COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES (ICACCCT)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Advanced Communication Control and Computing Technologies*	MAY 08-10, 2014	Syed Ammal Eng Coll, Ramanathapuram, INDIA		Syed Ammal Eng Coll	Feature Extraction; artificial neural networks; discrete sine transform; EEG		In this work, a method called Discrete Sine Transform is used in order to classify EEG signals of the brain and are used for the purpose of early autism detection. Autism is a complex behavioral disorder. The EEG signals are obtained by using electrodes that are attached to the brain. Each electrode measures the signals in different regions of the brain as the subject responds to different stimuli. The signals are processed by applying Discrete Sine Transform (DST) and then it is passed as an input to an artificial neural network. DST is used as it greatly simplifies the process and reduces the complexity. The computing tool of a neural network is used in order to objectively estimate whether a subject is suffering from autism. The network is trained with a particular dataset and upon applying a testing input the output was achieved. This study looked at EEG signals, an indirect measure of brain connectivity, and identified patterns that distinguished subjects at an increased risk for autism.

The dual-channel charge recycled (DCCR) analog front end (AFE) achieves chopping and time-multiplexing an amplifier between two channels simultaneously which exploits fast-settling DC servo-loop with current consumption and NEF of 0.9 mu A/channel and 3.29/channel, respectively. The dual-detector architecture (D(2)A) classification processor utilizes two linear support-vector machine (LSVM) classifiers based on digital hysteresis to enhance both the sensitivity and the specificity simultaneously. The pulsating voltage transcranial electrical stimulator (PVTES) automatically configures the number of pulses to control the amount of charge delivered based on skin-electrode impedance variation in efforts to suppress the seizure activity, while burning only 2.45 mu W. The 25 mm(2) SoC implemented in 0.18 mu m CMOS consumes 2.73 mu J/classification for 16 channels with an average sensitivity, specificity, and latency of 95.7%, 98%, and 1 s, respectively.

Using the Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) techniques, ErrP, which appear when a classification error occurs, are not easily recognizable by only examining the temporal or frequency characteristics of EEG signals. A supplementary classification process is therefore needed to identify them in order to stop the course of the action and back up to a recovery state. This paper presents a set of time-frequency (t-f) features for the detection and classification of EEG ErrP in extra-brain activities due to misclassification observed by a user exploiting non-invasive BMI and robot control in the task space. The proposed features are able to characterize and detect ErrP activities in the t-f domain. These features are derived from the information embedded in the t-f representation of EEG signals, and include the Instantaneous Frequency (IF), t-f information complexity, SVD information, energy concentration and sub-bands' energies. The experiment results on real EEG data show that the use of the proposed t-f features for detecting and classifying EEG ErrP achieved an overall classification accuracy up to 97% for 50 EEG segments using 2-class SVM classifier.

Frequency bands and channels configuration that relate to brain activities associated with BCI tasks are often pre-decided as default in EEG analysis without deliberations. However, a steady configuration usually loses effects due to individual variability across different subjects in practical applications. In this paper, we propose an adaptive boosting algorithm in a unifying theoretical framework to model the usually predetermined spatial-spectral configurations into variable preconditions, and further introduce a novel heuristic of stochastic gradient boost for training base learners under these preconditions. We evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed algorithm based on two data sets recorded from diverse populations including the healthy people and stroke patients. The results demonstrate its superior performance.

Despite the constant improvements in this field, there still exist diverse factors to overcome before achieving a natural control. In particular, the high variability of the brain signals often leads to the incorrect decoding of the subject intentions, producing unreliable behaviors in the controlled device. A possible solution to this problem would be that of correcting this erroneous decoding using a feedback signal from the user. In this work, we evaluate the possibility of decoding neural signals associated to performance monitoring (EEG-recorded error-related potentials) during a reaching task. Compared to previous works where these error potentials were recorded under scenarios with discrete movements performed by the cursor, under real conditions the cursor is moving continuously and thus the system is required to asynchronously detect any possible error. To this end, we simulated two different erroneous events during the monitoring of a reaching task: errors at the beginning of the movement, and errors happening in the middle of the trajectory being executed. Through the analysis of the recorded EEG of three subjects, we demonstrate the existence of neural correlates for the two types of elicited error potentials, and we are able to asynchronously detect them with high accuracies.

Spatio and spectro-temporal data (SSTD) are also the most common types of data collected in many domain areas, including engineering, bioinformatics, neuroinformatics, ecology, environment, medicine, economics, etc. However, there is lack of methods for the efficient analysis of such data and for spatio-temporal pattern recognition (STPR). The brain functions as a spatio-temporal information processing machine and deals extremely well with spatio-temporal data. Its organization and functions have been the inspiration for the development of new methods for SSTD analysis and STPR. Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNN) are considered the third generation of neural networks and are a promising paradigm for the creation of new intelligent ICT for SSTD. This new generation of computational models and systems is potentially capable of modeling complex information processes due to the ability to represent and integrate different information dimensions, such as time, space, frequency, and phase, and to deal with large volumes of data in an adaptive and self-organizing manner. This chapter reviews methods and systems of SNN for SSTD analysis and STPR, including single neuronal models, evolving spiking neural networks (eSNN), and computational neurogenetic models (CNGM). Software and hardware implementations and some pilot applications for audio-visual pattern recognition, EEG data-analysis, cognitive robotic systems, BCI, neurodegenerative diseases, and others are discussed.

Hence, there is another biometric has been emerged based on EEG where mimicry of data is quite impossible because it depends on users thought. The following article presents a new and unique template using empirical mode decomposition as a feature for classification each from another one. In order to do this work we have taken four regions of the brain such as frontal, cerebral, parietal, and occipital and we have observed that each and every individual has unique pattern.

The diagnosis of epilepsy is usually made by a neurologist but can be difficult to be made in the early stages. Supporting paraclinical evidence obtained from magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography may enable clinicians to make a diagnosis of epilepsy and investigate treatment earlier. However, electroencephalogram capture and interpretation are time consuming and can be expensive due to the need for trained specialists to perform the interpretation. Automated detection of correlates of seizure activity may be a solution. In this paper, we present a supervised machine learning approach that classifies seizure and nonseizure records using an open dataset containing 342 records. Our results show an improvement on existing studies by as much as 10% in most cases with a sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 94%, and area under the curve of 98% with a 6% global error using a k-class nearest neighbour classifier. We propose that such an approach could have clinical applications in the investigation of patients with suspected seizure disorders.

Actually, CSP only extracts the linear correlation between each pair of channels. The performance of CSP severely depends on the preprocessing. Moreover, CSP and the subsequent classifier are not optimized by the same criteria. In this paper, we investigated the nonlinear correlation between channels with kernel technique, and proposed a unified prediction framework based on linear ridge regression model. This prediction framework integrates preprocessing, feature extraction and classification, can automatically select the time windows, frequency bands and regularization parameter by minimizing leave-one-out cross-validation error through gradient descent. Experimental results on the dataset IV, BCI competition II show the effectiveness of our approach.

The communication is provided by detecting the presence of P300 Event Related Potentials (ERPs) in the electroencophelogram (EEG) signals, recorded from scalp. The major problem associated with P300 spellers is the stratification of EEGs recorded out of visual stimulation given to a subject. In this paper, we present a method to analyze the EEG data for P300 speller system using Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification technique. Using the proposed method, we are able to find a correct and faster solution for the "target character detection" associated with the P300 speller system. The method requires minimal preprocessing and provides a high transfer rate, which makes it suitable for online analysis also.

One of the main categories of BCI techniques is motor imagery based BCI (MI-BCI). A large number of studies have focused on machine learning approaches to optimize MI-BCI performance. However, enhancement of MI-BCI through provision of optimized feedback modalities has not received equal attention. Motor imagery and motor execution activate almost the same area of the brain. During motor skills performance, a combination of proprioceptive and direct visual feedback (PDVF) is provided. Thus, we hypothesized that MI-BCI that receives PDVF outperforms the traditional MI-BCI, which only uses indirect visual feedback (IVF). We studied 8 healthy subjects performing MI through (i) IVF and (ii) PDVF. We used 8 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and extracted features using an autoregressive model and classified MIs using linear regression. On average, PDVF increased the accuracy of MI performance by 11%, and improved information transfer rate (ITR) by more than two times. In conclusion, using PDVF appears to improve MI-BCI performance according to the studied metrics, making this approach potentially more reliable.

This paper presents a novel patient-specific algorithm for prediction of seizures in epileptic patients. Cross-correlation coefficients are extracted every 2 seconds using a 4-second window with 50% overlap from focus electrodes identified by the epileptologist. Features are further processed by a second-order Kalman filter and then input to three different classifiers which include AdaBoost, radial basis function kernel support vector machine (RBF-SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). The algorithm is tested on the long-term intra-cranial EEG (iEEG) database collected at the UMN epilepsy clinic. This database includes EEG recordings from 2 patients sampled from varying number of electrodes sampled at 2kHz. It is shown that the proposed algorithm achieves a high sensitivity and a low false positive rate.

Detection of emotions in Parkinson's disease using higher order spectral features from brain's electrical activity	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Emotion recognition; Parkinson's disease; Bispectrum; Support vector machine	FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION; EEG; SPEECH; CLASSIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS; METAANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; IMPAIRMENT; PERCEPTION; DIAGNOSIS	Objective: Non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) involving cognition and emotion have been progressively receiving more attention in recent times. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, being an activity of central nervous system, can reflect the underlying true emotional state of a person. This paper presents a computational framework for classifying PD patients compared to healthy controls (HC) using emotional information from the brain's electrical activity. Approach: Emotional EEG data were obtained from 20 PD patients and 20 healthy age-, gender- and education level-matched controls by inducing the six basic emotions of happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust using multimodal (audio and visual) stimuli. In addition, participants were asked to report their subjective affect. Because of the nonlinear and dynamic nature of EEG signals, we utilized higher order spectral features (specifically, bispectrum) for analysis. Two different classifiers namely K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used to investigate the performance of the HOS based features to classify each of the six emotional states of PD patients compared to HC. Ten-fold cross-validation method was used for testing the reliability of the classifier results. Main results: From the experimental results with our EEG data set, we found that (a) classification performance of bispectrum features across ALL frequency bands is better than individual frequency bands in both the groups using SVM classifier; (b) higher frequency band plays a more important role in emotion activities than lower frequency band; and (c) PD patients showed emotional impairments compared to HC, as demonstrated by a lower classification performance, particularly for negative emotions (sadness, fear, anger and disgust). Significance: These results demonstrate the effectiveness of applying EEG features with machine learning techniques to classify the each emotional state difference of PD patients compared to HC, and offer a promising approach for detection of emotional impairments associated with other neurological disorders.

Permutation entropy (PE) has been developed to describe the relative occurrence of each of these motifs. However, PE has few limitations, mainly its inability to differentiate between distinct patterns of a certain motif, and its sensitivity to noise. To minimize those limitations, Weighted-Permutation Entropy (WPE) was proposed as a modification version of PE to improve complexity measuring for times series. This paper presents an approach by incorporating WPE into the analysis of different physiological states namely EEG time series. Three different EEG physiological states, eye-closed (EC), eye-open (EO), and visual oddball task (VOT) were included to examine ability of WPE to identify and discriminate different physiological states. The classification using WPE has achieved the results with accuracy of 87% between EC and EO states, and 83% between EO and VOT, respectively, using linear discrimination analysis. The results showed the potential of WPE to be a promising feature for nonlinear analysis in different physiological states of brain. It was also observed that WPE also could be used as marker for large artifact with low frequency such as eye-blink.

However, these algorithms usually detect too many events making it difficult to achieve a good tradeoff between sensitivity (Se) and false detection rate (FDr). In this work, we propose a semi-automatic detector comprising a sensitivity phase based on well-established criteria followed by a specificity phase using spatial and spectral criteria. In the sensitivity phase, selected events are those which amplitude in the 10-16 Hz band and spectral ratio characteristics both reject a null hypothesis (p < 0.1) stating that the considered event is not a spindle. This null hypothesis is constructed from events occurring during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep epochs. In the specificity phase, a hierarchical clustering of the selected candidates is done based on events' frequency and spatial position along the anterior-posterior axis. Only events from the classes grouping most (at least 80%) spindles scored by an expert are kept. We obtain Se = 93.2% and FDr = 93.0% in the first phase and Se = 85.4% and FDr = 86.2% in the second phase. For these two phases, Matthew's correlation coefficients are respectively 0.228 and 0.324. Results suggest that spindles are defined by specific spatio-spectral properties and that automatic detection methods can be improved by considering these features.

Currently, one of the most important challenges is the adaptive design of a BCI system. For solving it, this work explores dimensionality reduction techniques: once features have been extracted from Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, the high-dimensional EEG data has to be mapped onto a new reduced feature space to make easier the classification stage. Besides the standard sequential feature selection methods, this paper analyzes two unsupervised transformation-based approaches - Principal Component Analysis and Locality Preserving Projections - and the Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis (LFDA), which works in a supervised manner. The dimensionality in the projected space is chosen following a wrapper-based approach by an efficient leave-one-out estimation. Experiments have been conducted on five novice subjects during their first sessions with MI-based BCI systems in order to show that the appropriate use of dimensionality reduction methods allows increasing the performance. In particular, obtained results show that LFDA gives a significant enhancement in classification terms without increasing the computational complexity and, then, it is a promising technique for designing MI-based BCI system.

Design: Retrospective analysis of polysomnograms. Setting: Research laboratory. Participants: 114 patients who underwent clinical polysomnography in sleep centers at the University of Manitoba (n = 58) and the University of Calgary (n = 56). Interventions: None. Measurements and Results: Power spectrum of EEG was determined in 3-second epochs and divided into delta, theta, alpha-sigma, and beta frequency bands. The range of powers in each band was divided into 10 aliquots. EEG patterns were assigned a 4-digit number that reflects the relative power in the 4 frequency ranges (10,000 possible patterns). Probability of each pattern occurring in 30-s epochs staged awake was determined, resulting in a continuous probability value from 0% to 100%. This was divided by 40 (% of epochs staged awake) producing the odds ratio product (ORP), with a range of 0-2.5. In validation testing, average ORP decreased progressively as EEG progressed from wakefulness (2.19 +/- 0.29) to stage N3 (0.13 +/- 0.05). ORP < 1.0 predicted sleep and ORP > 2.0 predicted wakefulness in > 95% of 30-s epochs. Epochs with intermediate ORP occurred in unstable sleep with a high arousal index (> 70/h) and were subject to much interrater scoring variability. There was an excellent correlation (r(2) = 0.98) between ORP in current 30-s epochs and the likelihood of arousal or awakening occurring in the next 30-s epoch. Conclusions: Our results support the use of the odds ratio product (ORP) as a continuous measure of sleep depth.

A common EEG BCI paradigm is based on the so called Event-Related Potentials (ERP) which arc responses of the brain to some external stimuli. For the present work at hand, the innermost part of a BCI is the pattern recognition stage whose aim is to detect the presence of ERPs with high accuracy. In recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of sparse representation of signals. Using a dictionary composed of prototype atoms, signals arc written as linear combinations of just a few of those atoms. This sparse representation is found to be appropriate for posterior classification purposes. In this work we propose a sparse representation and posterior classification of ERPs signals by means of an ad-hoc spatio-temporal dictionary composed of bidimensional Gaussian atoms. Based on fl-minimization we find the sparsest possible solution which allow us to design a robust classification based on nearest representation	[Peterson, Victoria; Rufiner, Hugo L.] Univ Nacl Litoral, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn Sinc I FICH UNL, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Hidr, Inst Invest Senales Sistemas & Inteligencia Compu, Ruta Nac 168,Km 472-4, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina; [Rufiner, Hugo L.] UNER, FI, RA-3100 Oro Verde, Entre Rios, Argentina; [Spies, Ruben D.] UNL, CONICET, IMAL, RA-3000 Paraje El Pozo, Santa Fe, Argentina; [Spies, Ruben D.] UNL, FIQ, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina		Peterson, V (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Litoral, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn Sinc I FICH UNL, Fac Ingn & Ciencias Hidr, Inst Invest Senales Sistemas & Inteligencia Compu, Ruta Nac 168,Km 472-4, RA-3000 Santa Fe, Argentina.	vpeterson@santafe-conicet.gov.ar; lrufiner@fich.unl.edu.ar; rspies@santafe-conicetgov.ar	Rufiner, Hugo Leonardo/R-7337-2019; Spies, Ruben/N-4100-2019	Rufiner, Hugo Leonardo/0000-0002-1083-5891; Spies, Ruben/0000-0002-4957-9979; Peterson, Victoria/0000-0003-0825-1018					15	0	0	0	0	INT CENTER NUMERICAL METHODS ENGINEERING	08034 BARCELONA	GRAN CAPITAN, S-N, CAMPUS NORTE UPC, MODULO C1, 08034 BARCELONA, SPAIN			978-84-943928-2-5				2015							1167	1178						12	Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Mechanics	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering; Mathematics; Mechanics	BF3WF					2022-08-02	WOS:000380586300107

Mostly due of the presence of considerable heterogeneity in the seizure patterns. Extensive research efforts have gone in solving this issue. But, the shortcomings and complexity of the deployed methods till date have been noteworthy to realize their practical applications. Present study showcased an expert system design for automated classification of ictal activities in electroencephalogram signals. The development used 'coiflets' wavelet packets for decomposition of signals to extract energy, standard deviation and Shannon entropy as features. Followed by support vector machine classifier with feds of various feature sets combinations. In the presented scheme, standard deviation feature set proved to be the best input features. It showed mean classification accuracy = 99.46 %, sensitivity = 99.40 % and specificity = 99.48 % with computation time = 5.60e-04 s. These outcomes demonstrated an improvement over the existing expert systems and also shed light on using different features. Proposed scheme hold promises for deployment in clinics and also for improvement in existing expert system designs.

A BCI provides a platform for direct communication between a human brain and a computer without the normal neurophysiology pathways. The electrical signals in the brain, because of their fast response to cognitive processes are most suitable as non-motor controlled mediation between the human and a computer. It can serve as a communication and control channel for different applications. Though the primary goal is to restore communication in severely paralyzed population, the BCI for speech communication fetches recognition in a variety of non-medical fields, the silent speech communication, cognitive biometrics and synthetic telepathy to name a few. A survey of diverse applications and principles of the BCI technology used for speech communication is discussed in this chapter. An ample evidence of speech communication used by "locked-in" patients is specified. Through the aid of assistive computer technology, they were able to pen their memoir. The current state-of-the-art techniques and control signals used for speech communication is described in brief. Possible future research directions are discussed. A comparison of indirect and direct methods of BCI speech production is shown. The direct method involves capturing the brain signals of the intended speech or speech imagery, processes the signals to predict the speech and synthesizes the speech production in real-time. There is enough evidence that the direct speech prediction from the neurological signals is a promising technology with fruitful results and challenging issues.

J	Omedes, J; Iturrate, I; Minguez, J; Montesano, L				Omedes, Jason; Iturrate, Inaki; Minguez, Javier; Montesano, Luis			Analysis and asynchronous detection of gradually unfolding errors during monitoring tasks	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; event related potentials; brain-machine interfaces; asynchronous classification; evidence accumulation; mismatch event	BRAIN-ACTUATED WHEELCHAIR; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION; TEMPORAL DYNAMICS; NEURAL MECHANISMS; PREDICTION ERROR; EEG; POTENTIALS; RECOGNITION; SYSTEM	Human studies on cognitive control processes rely on tasks involving sudden-onset stimuli, which allow the analysis of these neural imprints to be time-locked and relative to the stimuli onset. Human perceptual decisions, however, comprise continuous processes where evidence accumulates until reaching a boundary. Surpassing the boundary leads to a decision where measured brain responses are associated to an internal, unknown onset. The lack of this onset for gradual stimuli hinders both the analyses of brain activity and the training of detectors. This paper studies electroencephalographic (EEG)-measurable signatures of human processing for sudden and gradual cognitive processes represented as a trajectory mismatch under a monitoring task. Time-locked potentials and brain-source analysis of the EEG of sudden mismatches revealed the typical components of event-related potentials and the involvement of brain structures related to cognitive control processing. For gradual mismatch events, time-locked analyses did not show any discernible EEG scalp pattern, despite related brain areas being, to a lesser extent, activated. However, and thanks to the use of non-linear pattern recognition algorithms, it is possible to train an asynchronous detector on sudden events and use it to detect gradual mismatches, as well as obtaining an estimate of their unknown onset. Post-hoc time-locked scalp and brain-source analyses revealed that the EEG patterns of detected gradual mismatches originated in brain areas related to cognitive control processing. This indicates that gradual events induce latency in the evaluation process but that similar brain mechanisms are present in sudden and gradual mismatch events. Furthermore, the proposed asynchronous detection model widens the scope of applications of brain-machine interfaces to other gradual processes.

The BCI detects the movement imagination (MI) and the neuroprosthesis transforms it into a real movement. Today's BCIs can detect the process of MI, but not the actual imagined trajectories of, e.g., the arm. Users' control of a BCI would become more intuitive and natural when the detailed MI, i.e., trajectories, are detected. This is called movement decoding. We made a first attempt to decode MIs, and notably, we did not provoke task depended artefacts like eye movements in our paradigm design. However, that made it necessary to restrict the MIs to movements in two orthogonal planes. We classified the movement plane using a decoding method. For this purpose, we decoded the imagined trajectory and correlated it with two assumed movement trajectories, and then assigned the MI to the assumed movement with the higher correlation. That way, we reached a significant classification accuracy in 7 out of 9 subjects, and showed indirectly the decoding of imagined movements.

This study introduces an aggregation of sparse linear discriminant analyses (ASLDA) to overcome these problems. In the ASLDA, multiple sparse discriminant vectors are learned from differently l(1)-regularized least-squares regressions by exploiting the equivalence between LDA and least-squares regression, and are subsequently aggregated to form an ensemble classifier, which could not only implement automatic feature selection for dimensionality reduction to alleviate curse-of-dimensionality, but also decrease the variance to improve generalization capacity for new test samples. Extensive investigation and comparison are carried out among the ASLDA, the ordinary LDA and other competing ERP classification algorithms, based on different three ERP datasets. Experimental results indicate that the ASLDA yields better overall performance for single-trial ERP classification when insufficient training samples are available. This suggests the proposed ASLDA is promising for ERP classification in small sample size scenario to improve the practicability of BCI.

Genetic Feature Selection for a P300 Brain Computer Interface	VI LATIN AMERICAN CONGRESS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING (CLAIB 2014)	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	6th Latin American Biomedical Engineering Conference (CLAIB)	OCT 29-31, 2014	Parana, ARGENTINA	Reg Council Biomed Engn Latin America, Argentine Soc Bioengineering, Nacl Univ Entre Rios, Engn Sch, Int Federat Med & Biol Engn, IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc		Brain Computer Interface; Features Selection; Genetic Algorithms; Fisher's Discriminant Analysis; P300		A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) provides a direct form of communication between a person and the outside world using brain signals, either to increase his/her integration in society or to provide a way to control the environment where he/she lives. BCIs are communication systems based on electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, such as event-related evoked potentials (ERP). P300 is one of there ERP. It is a peak that usually appears in the EEG signals around 300 ms in response to an infrequent stimulus. The BCI based on P300 is usually composed by different blocks: input (data acquisition), feature selection/extraction, classification, output (e. g. control commands) and, eventually, feedback. In this work, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed as a feature selection method before the classification stage, implemented using Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). A dataset of input patterns was generated from a database of EEG recordings of healthy people, in order to train and test the proposed configuration. The addition of the GA as a feature selection method resulted in a significant improvement in classification performance (p < 0.001) and in a reduction of the amount of features needed to reach such performance (p < 0.001). The results of this work suggest that this configuration could be implemented in a portable BCI.	[Atum, Y. V.; Acevedo, R. C.] UNER, Fac Ingn, LIRINS, Oro Verde, Argentina; [Manresa, J. A.

The BCI system for UAV control consists of two main subsystems responsible for decision and semi-autonomous navigation. The decision subsystem is established based on the analysis of motor imagery (MI) EEG. The improved cross-correlation method (CC) is used to accomplish the MI feature extraction and the logistic regression method (LR) is employed to complete the MI feature classification and decision. The average classification accuracy rate of the BCI system reaches to 94.36%. The semi-autonomous navigation subsystem is utilized to avoid obstacles automatically for UAV and provide feasible directions for decision subsystem. The actual indoor target searching experiment is carried out to verify the performance of this BCI system. The experiment validates the feasibility and effectiveness of this BCI system for low speed UAV control by using MI and semi-autonomous navigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is useful to enable such browsers to have hands free functionality to enable people to use them when their hands are occupied when driving or performing other tasks. A hands free browser would be also useful for disabled or paralyzed people. In this paper we describe the design of a hands free browser. It uses EEG inputs using a NeuroSky EEG sensor, as well as voice inputs. Various functions in the browser including add to favorites, scroll up or down, next and previous tab, open an URL that is part of the favorites, are mapped to varying attention and blink levels recognized by the EEG sensor. Maintaining of the concentration level higher than a threshold enables the user to cycle through a list of items, which could be menu items or history items or most visited sites in the browser. A deliberate double blink enables the user to open the currently selected URL or menu item. Other functionalities are performed using voice in a way that is more intuitive and user friendly. We describe the browser architecture and various implementation issues, as well as some screenshots from the implementation.

The EEG wave pattern and frequency vary during five stages of sleep. These subtle variations in sleep EEG signals cannot be easily detected through visual inspection. Summary: A range of time, frequency, time-frequency and nonlinear analysis methods can be applied to understand the complex physiological signals and their chaotic behavior. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative review and analysis of 29 nonlinear dynamics measures for EEG-based sleep stage detection. Key Messages: The characteristic ranges of these features are reported for the five different sleep stages. All nonlinear measures produce clinically significant results, that is, they can discriminate the individual sleep stages. Feature ranking based on the statistical F-value, however, shows that the third order cumulant of higher order spectra yields the most discriminative result. The distinct value ranges for each sleep stage and the discriminative power of the features can be used for sleep disorder diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and drug efficacy assessment. (C) 2015 S.

EEG seizure detection and prediction algorithms: a survey	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Review							EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; WAVELET; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; PATTERNS; MODEL; SVM	Epilepsy patients experience challenges in daily life due to precautions they have to take in order to cope with this condition. When a seizure occurs, it might cause injuries or endanger the life of the patients or others, especially when they are using heavy machinery, e.g., deriving cars. Studies of epilepsy often rely on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in order to analyze the behavior of the brain during seizures. Locating the seizure period in EEG recordings manually is difficult and time consuming; one often needs to skim through tens or even hundreds of hours of EEG recordings. Therefore, automatic detection of such an activity is of great importance. Another potential usage of EEG signal analysis is in the prediction of epileptic activities before they occur, as this will enable the patients (and caregivers) to take appropriate precautions. In this paper, we first present an overview of seizure detection and prediction problem and provide insights on the challenges in this area. Second, we cover some of the state-of-the-art seizure detection and prediction algorithms and provide comparison between these algorithms. Finally, we conclude with future research directions and open problems in this topic.

The detection of the direction intended movements and the type of intended movement is a challenging goal in neuroscience and engineering applications such as brain-computer interfacing (BCI). In previous studies, it has been reported that EEG signals extracted from PPC can be used to decode intended movement direction. However, it is not clear whether extracted EEG signals are related to motor intention, because visually evoked potential (VEP) which evoked by visual cue in their experiment may be included in their extracted EEG signals. The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of VEP mixed into extracted EEG signals. Therefore experiments with not only visual but also tactile cues were conducted. EEG components that could be related to PPC were extracted by using independent component analysis (ICA). We compared event related potential (ERP) waveforms between two experiments. In the result, ERP waveforms of the experiment with tactile cue were significantly different from that of the experiment with visual cue. This result suggests that VEP was included in the EEG signals extracted from PPC in the experiment with visual cue.

J	De Lucia, M; Tzovara, A				De Lucia, Marzia; Tzovara, Athina			Decoding auditory EEG responses in healthy and clinical populations: A comparative study	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Decoding; Single-trial; EEG; Logistic regression; Coma; MMN	PERCEPTUAL DECISION-MAKING; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; TRIAL; BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION; TUTORIAL; DYNAMICS; MODEL; STATE	Background: Analyses of brain responses to external stimuli are typically based on the means computed across conditions. However in many cognitive and clinical applications, taking into account their variability across trials has turned out to be statistically more sensitive than comparing their means. New method: In this study we present a novel implementation of a single-trial topographic analysis (STTA) for discriminating auditory evoked potentials at predefined time-windows. This analysis has been previously introduced for extracting spatio-temporal features at the level of the whole neural response. Adapting the STTA on specific time windows is an essential step for comparing its performance to other time-window based algorithms. Results: We analyzed responses to standard vs. deviant sounds and showed that the new implementation of the STTA gives above-chance decoding results in all subjects (in comparison to 7 out of 11 with the original method). In comatose patients, the improvement of the decoding performance was even more pronounced than in healthy controls and doubled the number of significant results. Comparison with existing method(s): We compared the results obtained with the new STTA to those based on a logistic regression in healthy controls and patients. We showed that the first of these two comparisons provided a better performance of the logistic regression; however only the new STTA provided significant results in comatose patients at group level. Conclusions: Our results provide quantitative evidence that a systematic investigation of the accuracy of established methods in normal and clinical population is an essential step for optimizing decoding performance.

An important component of a BCI system is feature extraction, which is responsible for representing brain signals in terms of essential components called features. This paper presents a comparison of the following feature extraction techniques for BCI; Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), Wavelength Optimal Spatial Filter (WOSF) and Approximate Entropy. The motivation for this work is the non-availability of comparative studies on the mentioned feature extraction techniques in literature. Further, even though CSP has been a widely used feature extraction technique for motor-imagery based BCI systems, entropy-based features, such as approximate entropy, and WOSF are still being explored. We investigate the use of approximate entropy and WOSF for feature extraction in motor imagery datasets of BCI Competitions, and compare the results with those obtained using CSP. It was observed that both WOSF and Approximate Entropy provide a higher classification accuracy as compared to CSP.	[Sen Gupta, Soumya; Soman, Sumit; Raj, P.

This approach works very well for high-dimensional spatio-temporal data with separable covariance matrix. At first all features are divided into subgroups and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used to obtain a score for each subgroup. Then LDA is applied to these scores, producing the overall score used for classification. In this way we avoid estimation of the high-dimensional covariance matrix of all spatio-temporal features. We investigate the classification performance with special attention to the small sample size case. We also present a theoretical error bound for the normal model with separable covariance matrix, which results in a recommendation on how subgroups should be formed for the data.

The aim of BCI is to interpret brain activity into digital form which acts as a command for a computer. One key challenge in current BCI research is how to extract features of random time-varying EEG signals and its classification as accurately as possible. Feature extraction techniques are used to extract the features which represent a unique property obtained from pattern of brain signal. Earlier EEG analysis was restricted to visual inspection only. The visual inspection of the signal is very subjective and hardly allows any standardization or statistical analysis. Hence, several different techniques were intended in order to quantify the information of the brain signal. Many linear and non-linear methods for feature extraction exist. The purpose of this paper is to give a brief introduction to the EEG signals and BCI system. The paper also includes a review on the conventional methods that are used for feature extraction of the signal.

This work approaches two different techniques to improve the accuracy of intelligent sleep stage classifiers, based on the use of previous and posterior information from nearby epochs(1) : stacked sequential learning and time series prediction. Stacked sequential learning uses a second-layer classifier to improve the classification by using previous and posterior first-layer predicted stages as additional features providing information to the model. Time series prediction approach tackles the possibility of using nearby stages signal information to predict the current stage. Results obtained show significant improvements in the classification rates achieved using the two proposed techniques.	[Herrera, L.

Statistical methods play a crucial role in understanding and analyzing fMRI data. Bayesian approaches, in particular, have shown great promise in applications. A remarkable feature of fully Bayesian approaches is that they allow a flexible modeling of spatial and temporal correlations in the data. This article provides a review of the most relevant models developed in recent years. We divide methods according to the objective of the analysis. We start from spatiotemporal models for fMRI data that detect task-related activation patterns. We then address the very important problem of estimating brain connectivity. We also touch upon methods that focus on making predictions of an individual's brain activity or a clinical or behavioral response. We conclude with a discussion of recent integrative models that aim at combining fMRI data with other imaging modalities, such as electroencephalography/ magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, measured on the same subjects. We also briefly discuss the emerging field of imaging genetics. (C) 2014Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Methods: Sixteen BCI novices were trained over four consecutive days to imagine left and right hand movements while receiving feedback. The most informative bipolar channels for use on the subsequent days were identified on the first day for each individual based on a high-density online MI recording. Results: Online classification accuracy on the first day was 85.1% on average (range: 64.7-97.7%). Offline an individually-selected bipolar channel pair based on common spatial patterns significantly outperformed a pair informed by independent component analysis and a standard 10-20 pair. From day 2 to day 4 online MI accuracy increased significantly (day 2: 69.1%; day 4: 73.3%), which was mostly caused by a reduction in ipsilateral event-related desynchronization of sensorimotor rhythms. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that systematic MI practice in an everyday environment with a user-friendly EEG system results in MI learning effects. Significance: These findings help to bridge the gap between elaborate laboratory studies with healthy participants and efficient home or hospital based MI neurofeedback protocols.

Electroencephalogram subject identification: A review	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Review						Electroencephalogram; Biometrics; Genetics; Identification	PERSON IDENTIFICATION; INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFICATION; EEG DATA; BRAIN; RECOGNITION; POTENTIALS; MACHINE; CLASSIFICATION; PATTERNS; SIGNALS	This is, to the best of the authors knowledge, the first complete research on the state of the art on EEG based subject identification. As well as covering the full story of this field (from 1980 to 2013), an overview of the findings made in genetic and neurophysiology areas, from which it is based, is also provided. After a comprehensive search, 109 biometric publications were found and studied, from which 88 were finally included in this document. A categorization of papers is proposed based on the recording paradigm. The most used databases, some of them public, have been identified and named to allow the comparison of results from these and future works. The findings of this work show that, although basic questions remain to be answered, the EEG, and specially its power spectrum in the range of the alpha rhythm, contains subject specific information that can be used for classification. Moreover, approaches such as a multi-day-session training, the fusion of information from different electrodes and bands, and Support Vector Machines are recommended to maximize the system's performance. All in all, the problem of subject identification by means of their EEG is harder than initially expected, as it relies on information extracted from complex heterogeneous EEG traits which are the results of elaborated models of inheritance, which in turn makes the problem very sensitive to its variables (time, frequency, space, recording paradigm and algorithms).

J	Priyadharsini, S; Sonia, B; Dejey				Priyadharsini, Suja; Sonia, Bala; Dejey			A HYBRID ELM-WAVELET TECHNIQUE FOR THE CLASSIFICATION AND DIAGNOSIS OF NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDER USING EMG SIGNAL	IIOAB JOURNAL			English	Article						Electromyogram (EMG); Motor Unit Action Potentials (MUAPs); Extreme Learning Machine (ELM); Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT); Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT)	EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; NEURAL-NETWORK; FACE RECOGNITION; EEG	Electromyogram (EMG) signal classification plays a major role in the diagnosis of neuromuscular disorder. The Motor Unit Action Potentials (MUAPs) in an electromyographic signal is one, which offers a significant source of information to evaluate the neuromuscular disorders. Neuromuscular diseases are the one that affect the control of muscular and nervous system. The proposed method employs a technique called Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for the classification of EMG signal into healthy, myopathy or neuropathy. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) / Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) are the methods used for feature extraction individually. The performance of ELM together with DWT (ELM-DWT) and ELM with WPT (ELM-WPT) are compared with each other and it is found that the time complexity and number of feature vectors in ELM-WPT is reduced. The number of features is minimal in ELM-WPT compared with the ELM-DWT. The performance of ELM is evaluated using the confusion matrix and in terms of specificity, sensitivity, computational time and classification accuracy. The learning phase of ELM is completed in less than a second. The classification accuracy of ELM-WPT is 100%. The obtained result indicates that proposed ELM is very effective in the diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders.

As a hybrid-BCI, we combine EEG and NIRS signals to improve the performance of BCI system. Since there's a coupled relationship between EEG and NIRS, we try to define the activation state of subject's brain according to the changes of hemoglobin. We therefore defined the maximum point of HbO changes to be the time when the brain was fully activated. Then we chose the EEG data according to this critical time point with a 3 s window, which is almost within 6-9s according to the NIRS signal. With this selected time window, there is a significantly improvement of decoding accuracy from 69% to 79% compared to the original time window (1-12 s).

Automatic Sleep Stage Classification: Potential and Limitations	KLINISCHE NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE			German	Article						polysomnography; computer-assisted sleep recording; cyclic alternating pattern; sleep EEG; EOG; EMG	ALTERNATING PATTERN CAP; INTER-SCORER RELIABILITY; PERIODIC LIMB MOVEMENTS; POLYSOMNOGRAPHIC RECORDINGS; AMERICAN ACADEMY; POPULATION; VALIDATION; EEG	The reference method for sleep recording in a sleep medicine center is cardiorespiratory polysomnography. This method is well standardized in terms of signal choice, recording technology and visual presentation. A sleep study requires much time for recording and subsequent visual scoring. A computer-based scoring can reduce time and effort and improve reliability of the result. A computer-based scoring is not yet accepted because of potential misclassifications, which may lead to false diagnoses. The principles of automatic sleep scoring are well known and documented. Automatic sleep scoring can summarize patterns quantitatively and enables a comparison of result, which is not possible by visual scoring alone: statistics, counting of patterns, arousal scoring, and sleep microstructure analysis. Classical methods such as frequency analysis and new methods, including nonlinear signal processing, can be of great help in answering research questions and for characterizing sleep EEG abnormalities. The computer-supported scoring of sleep-related breathing disorders and sleep-related movement disorders is reliable and is widely used in clinical practice. It is reliable if applicants agree on the sensor technology applied and specify the amplitude criteria chosen. In order to remain compatible with values from previous sleep study reports (sleep duration times, percent spent in each sleep stage, sleep efficiency, latencies), a visual scoring or a re-scoring of automated sleep analysis is indispensable.

Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) can use motor imagery to detect interaction intention from users but lack the accuracy of mechanical switches. Hence, there exists a strong need to improve the accuracy of EEG-based motor imagery BCIs attempting to implement an on/off switch. Here, we investigate how monitoring the pupil diameter of a person as a psycho-physiological parameter in addition to traditional EEG channels can improve the classification accuracy of a switch-like BCI. We have recently noticed in our lab (work not yet published) how motor imagery is associated with increases in pupil diameter when compared to a control rest condition. The pupil diameter parameter is easily accessible through video oculography since most gaze tracking systems report pupil diameter invariant to head position. We performed a user study with 30 participants using a typical EEG based motor imagery BCI. We used common spatial patterns to separate motor imagery, signaling movement intention, from a rest control condition. By monitoring the pupil diameter of the user and using this parameter as an additional feature, we show that the performance of the classifier trying to discriminate motor imagery from a control condition improves over the traditional approach using just EEG derived features. Given the limitations of EEG to construct highly robust and reliable BCIs, we postulate that multi-modal approaches, such as the one presented here that monitor several psycho-physiological parameters, can be a successful strategy in making BCIs more accurate and less vulnerable to constraints such as requirements for long training sessions or high signal to noise ratio of electrode channels.

Here, we examined the generalization across time within individuals and across different individuals. We trained classification algorithms to decode conscious perception from neural activity recorded during binocular rivalry using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The classifiers were then used to predict the perception of the same participants during different recording sessions either days or years later as well as between different participants. No drop in decoding accuracy was observed when decoding across years compared with days, whereas a large drop in decoding accuracy was found for between-participant decoding. Furthermore, underlying percept-specific MEG signals remained stable in terms of latency, amplitude, and sources within participants across years, whereas differences were found in all of these domains between individuals. Our findings demonstrate that the neural correlates of conscious perception are stable across years for adults, but differ across individuals. Moreover, the study validates decoding based on MEG data as a method for further studies of correlations between individual differences in perceptual contents and between-participant decoding accuracies.

J	Yuksel, A; Olmez, T				Yuksel, Ayhan; Olmez, Tamer			A Neural Network-Based Optimal Spatial Filter Design Method for Motor Imagery Classification	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EEG	In this study, a novel spatial filter design method is introduced. Spatial filtering is an important processing step for feature extraction in motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces. This paper introduces a new motor imagery signal classification method combined with spatial filter optimization. We simultaneously train the spatial filter and the classifier using a neural network approach. The proposed spatial filter network (SFN) is composed of two layers: a spatial filtering layer and a classifier layer. These two layers are linked to each other with non-linear mapping functions. The proposed method addresses two shortcomings of the common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm. First, CSP aims to maximize the between-classes variance while ignoring the minimization of within-classes variances. Consequently, the features obtained using the CSP method may have large within-classes variances. Second, the maximizing optimization function of CSP increases the classification accuracy indirectly because an independent classifier is used after the CSP method. With SFN, we aimed to maximize the between-classes variance while minimizing within-classes variances and simultaneously optimizing the spatial filter and the classifier. To classify motor imagery EEG signals, we modified the well-known feed-forward structure and derived forward and backward equations that correspond to the proposed structure. We tested our algorithm on simple toy data. Then, we compared the SFN with conventional CSP and its multi-class version, called one-versus-rest CSP, on two data sets from BCI competition III. The evaluation results demonstrate that SFN is a good alternative for classifying motor imagery EEG signals with increased classification accuracy.

Electroencephalogram Predicts Outcome in Patients With Postanoxic Coma During Mild Therapeutic Hypothermia	CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						brain hypoxia; cardiac arrest; coma; electroencephalography; postanoxic encephalopathy; prognosis	CARDIAC-ARREST PATIENTS; ANOXIC-ISCHEMIC COMA; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; PROSPECTIVE COHORT; CEREBRAL ANOXIA; CRITICALLY-ILL; CONTINUOUS EEG; PROGNOSIS; PROPOFOL; PROGNOSTICATION	Objective: To assess the value of electroencephalogram for prediction of outcome of comatose patients after cardiac arrest treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Medical ICU. Patients: One hundred forty-two patients with postanoxic encephalopathy after cardiac arrest, who were treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia. Measurements and Main Results: Continuous electroencephalogram was recorded during the first 5 days of ICU admission. Visual classification of electroencephalogram patterns was performed in 5-minute epochs at 12 and 24 hours after cardiac arrest by two independent observers, blinded for patients' conditions and outcomes. Patterns were classified as isoelectric, low voltage, epileptiform, burst-suppression, diffusely slowed, or normal. Burst-suppression was subdivided into patterns with and without identical bursts. Primary outcome measure was the neurologic outcome based on each patient's best achieved Cerebral Performance Category score within 6 months after inclusion. 67 patients (47%) had favorable outcome (Cerebral Performance Category, 1-2). In patients with favorable outcome, electroencephalogram patterns improved within 24 hours after cardiac arrest, mostly toward diffusely slowed or normal. At 24 hours after cardiac arrest, the combined group of isoelectric, low voltage, and "burst-suppression with identical bursts" was associated with poor outcome with a sensitivity of 48% (95% CI, 35-61) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 94-100). At 12 hours, normal or diffusely slowed electroencephalogram patterns were associated with good outcome with a sensitivity of 56% (95% CI, 41-70) and a specificity of 96% (95% CI, 86-100). Conclusions: Electroencephalogram allows reliable prediction of both good and poor neurologic outcome of patients with postanoxic encephalopathy treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia within 24 hours after cardiac arrest.

The scaling exponent of each digit is different especially at positions C3 and C4, and at positions O1 and O2. LDA exhibits its robustness against noises in our works. We could benefit more from the results of this paper in designing mental tasks and selecting brain areas in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. The objective of this system is to report the work done related to sensitivity of EEG signals related to specific thought process. The thought process was chosen to be numbers (0-9). The main objective of this work is the analysis and classification of EEG signals among the men and machines and provide a secure communication interface. EEG recordings of six male right-handed subjects in the age group of (20-25) were taken. The subjects were normal without any mental disorder. They did not have any problem in communicating and had normal vision. All subjects have good knowledge of digits. A simple display system in visual basic is prepared for the project. This system generates random number with interval of 2 s. After every 2 s a random number is displayed on the screen. The recording was captured for 3 min. This process was repeated for five times. The EEG signal has been processed by statistical analysis methods such as LDA and PCA. It was found that the EEG signals are sensitive to thought process. So it is possible to recognize thought process through EEG signals. In our ten digit thought process, we get ten distinct clusters by analyzing EEG signals through statistical technique like LDA and PCA. The recognition rate of LDA is 70 %. The recognition rate of PCA is 37 %. So we establish that LDA is more powerful method as compared to PCA. We observe that the EEG signal is more dominant on right hemisphere as compared to left hemisphere. The data base created has potential to be used as a digital recognition system. It has tremendous applications in design of security system.

This work performed is based on the four phases, which are first phase is raw data and after data processing using statistical features such as mean and standard deviation. The second phase is the sum of hertz, the third is the sum of hertz divided by the number of hertz, and last is the sum of hertz divided by total hertz. We are using five attributes that are patients, class, domain, location, and hertz. The data were classified using WEKA. The results showed that BayesNet gave a consistent result for all the phases from multilayer perceptron and K-Means. However, K-Mean gave the highest result in the first phase.

These potential users of noninvasive BCIs display a large range of physical and mental conditions. Prior studies have shown the general applicability of BCI with patients, with the conflict of either using many training sessions or studying only moderately restricted patients. We present a BCI system designed to establish external control for severely motor-impaired patients within a very short time. Within only six experimental sessions, three out of four patients were able to gain significant control over the BCI, which was based on motor imagery or attempted execution. For the most affected patient, we found evidence that the BCI could outperform the best assistive technology (AT) of the patient in terms of control accuracy, reaction time and information transfer rate. We credit this success to the applied user-centered design approach and to a highly flexible technical setup. State-of-the art machine learning methods allowed the exploitation and combination of multiple relevant features contained in the EEG, which rapidly enabled the patients to gain substantial BCI control. Thus, we could show the feasibility of a flexible and tailorable BCI application in severely disabled users. This can be considered a significant success for two reasons: Firstly, the results were obtained within a short period of time, matching the tight clinical requirements. Secondly, the participating patients showed, compared to most other studies, very severe communication deficits. They were dependent on everyday use of AT and two patients were in a locked-in state. For the most affected patient a reliable communication was rarely possible with existing AT.

Decoding of motor intentions from epidural ECoG recordings in severely paralyzed chronic stroke patients	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						electrocorticography (ECOG); stroke; brain-computer interface (BCI)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MOVEMENT TRAJECTORIES; UPPER-LIMB; HUMANS; REHABILITATION; STIMULATION; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM; EEG; ARM	Objective. Recently, there have been several approaches to utilize a brain-computer interface (BCI) for rehabilitation with stroke patients or as an assistive device for the paralyzed. In this study we investigated whether up to seven different hand movement intentions can be decoded from epidural electrocorticography (ECoG) in chronic stroke patients. Approach. In a screening session we recorded epidural ECoG data over the ipsilesional motor cortex from four chronic stroke patients who had no residual hand movement. Data was analyzed offline using a support vector machine (SVM) to decode different movement intentions. Main results. We showed that up to seven hand movement intentions can be decoded with an average accuracy of 61% (chance level 15.6%). When reducing the number of classes, average accuracies up to 88% can be achieved for decoding three different movement intentions. Significance. The findings suggest that ipsilesional epidural ECoG can be used as a viable control signal for BCI-driven neuroprosthesis. Although patients showed no sign of residual hand movement, brain activity at the ipsilesional motor cortex still shows enough intention-related activity to decode different movement intentions with sufficient accuracy.

Significance of multiple neurophysiological measures in patients with chronic disorders of consciousness	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Disorders of consciousness; Evoked potentials; EEG; Relative power; Sleep score; Cluster analysis	PERSISTENT VEGETATIVE STATE; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; WAKEFULNESS SYNDROME; POSTTRAUMATIC COMA; CRS-R; EEG; SLEEP; RECOVERY	Objective: The aim of this study was to verify the value of multiple neurophysiological tests in classifying disorders of consciousness (DOCs) in patients in a chronic vegetative or minimal consciousness state categorised on the basis of the Coma Recovery Scale (CRS). Methods: The study included 142 patients, all of whom underwent long (18 h) EEG-polygraphic recordings including one night. The EEG was scored using the Synek scale and sleep patterns using an arbitrary scale. Absolute total power and relative EEG power were evaluated in different frequency bands. Multimodal evoked potentials (EPs), including auditory event-related potentials, were also evaluated and scored. Results: The most information came from the combined multimodal EPs and sleep EEG scores. A two-step cluster analysis based on the collected information allowed a satisfactory evaluation of DOC severity. Spectral EEG properties seemed to be significantly related to DOC classes and CRS scores, but did not seem to make any significant additional contribution to DOC classification. Conclusions: Multiple electrophysiological evaluations based on EEG, sleep polygraphic recordings and multimodal EPs are helpful in assessing DOC severity and residual functioning in patients with chronic DOCs. Significance: Simple electrophysiological measures that can be easily applied at patients' bedsides can significantly contribute to the recognition of DOC severity in chronic patients surviving a severe brain injury.

However, extraction and classification of kinetics from the 'movement intention' (before task onset) on a single-trial basis have only been performed with limited performance due to low signal-to-noise ratio and large trial-to-trial variability. The aim of this study was to investigate a covariate shift method to address the basic challenge of non-stationarity (changes from session to session and trial-to-trial variability) for decoding different levels of speed and force. We tested this method using cross-validation procedures and a linear support vector machine to classify temporal features associated with two levels of force and speed in 9 subjects. The classification accuracy obtained across different class pairs across subjects was 73.1 +/- 6.8 % and 70.0 +/- 3.6 % with and without the covariate shift method, respectively. The classification accuracy was significantly higher (p < 0.03) using the covariate shift method.

In line with this hypothesis, we show that the spatial distribution of power in the alpha frequency band (8 -12 Hz) can be used to decode the content and quality of the representations stored in visual WM. We acquired EEG data during an orientation WM task, and used a forward encoding model of orientation selectivity to reconstruct orientation-specific response profiles (termed channel tuning functions, or CTFs) that tracked the orientation of the memorandum during both encoding and delay periods of the trial. Critically, these EEG-based CTFs were robust predictors of both between-and within-subject differences in mnemonic precision, showing that EEG-based CTFs provide a sensitive measure of the quality of sensory population codes. Experiments 2 and 3 established that these EEG-based CTFs are contingent on the voluntary storage goals of the observer. When observers were given a postsample cue to store or drop the memorandum, the resulting CTF was sustained in the "store" condition and rapidly eliminated following the "drop" cue. When observers were instructed to store one of two simultaneously presented stimuli, only the stored item was represented in a sustained fashion throughout the delay period. These findings suggest that the oscillatory activity in the alpha frequency band plays a central role in the active storage of information in visual WM, and demonstrate a powerful approach for tracking the precision of on-line memories with high temporal resolution.

The imagination of hands movement allows inducing up to three different brain states by considering the activity that each hand produces separately and the one caused by the combination of both. This article presents a new method to extend the classic Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm to a multi-class approach which analyses both brain hemispheres separately to solve, together with a stepwise classification strategy, a multi-label Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) problem. The considered approach is based upon the assumption that the brain activity induced by the motor imagery (MI) of the combination of both hands corresponds to the superposition of the activity generated during simple hand MIs. In this way, based on the event-related desynchronization that is detected within each brain hemisphere, the multi-classification task can be reduced into two binary-classification problems, leading to a much simpler recognition scheme that overcomes the drawback of the classical CSP method of being suitable to discriminate only between two classes. After testing the proposed approach over the EEG signals of six healthy subjects performing a four-class multi-label task involving simple and combined hand MIs together with the rest condition, results show that this technique is plausible for BCI control. In terms of accuracy, it outperforms the classical one-vs-one approach by 20% and has the same performance as the one-vs-all method. Nevertheless, to solve a multi-label classification problem involving k classes, the proposed method requires only log2(k) classifiers, whereas the one-vs-one method uses k(k-1)/2 classifiers and the one-vs-all k classifiers, thereby the new approach simplifies the classification task and seems promising for solving multi-label problems involving numerous classes.

An under-explored area is multimode data, where each data point is a matrix or a tensor. Standard RBMs applying to such data would require vectorizing matrices and tensors, thus resulting in unnecessarily high dimensionality and at the same time, destroying the inherent higher-order interaction structures. This paper introduces Tensor-variate Restricted Boltzmann Machines (TvRBMs) which generalize RBMs to capture the multiplicative interaction between data modes and the latent variables. TvRBMs are highly compact in that the number of free parameters grows only linear with the number of modes. We demonstrate the capacity of TvRBMs on three real-world applications: handwritten digit classification, face recognition and EEG-based alcoholic diagnosis. The learnt features of the model are more discriminative than the rivals, resulting in better classification performance.

Therefore there is a great need to find complex MI tasks that are intuitive for BCI users to perform and that can be classified with high accuracy. In this paper we present our results on classifying four MI tasks of the right hand, flexion, extension, supination and pronation using a novel EEG source imaging approach. Using this approach we were able to improve the four-class classification of the four tasks by nearly 10% as compared to traditional sensor-based techniques.

For example, a reliable method could be used to improve scientific study of voluntary action by allowing external probe stimuli to be delivered at different moments during development of intention and action. Several Brain Computer Interface applications have used motor imagery of repetitive actions to achieve this goal. These systems are relatively successful, but only if the intention is sustained over a period of several seconds; much longer than the timescales identified in psychophysiological studies for normal preparation for voluntary action. We have used a combination of sensorimotor rhythms and motor imagery training to decode intentions in a single-trial cued-response paradigm similar to those used in human and non-human primate motor control research. Decoding accuracy of over 0.83 was achieved with twelve participants. With this approach, we could decode intentions to move the left or right hand at sub-second timescales, both for instructed choices instructed by an external stimulus and for free choices generated intentionally by the participant. The implications for volition are considered.

EEG artifacts of non-neural origin can be separated from neural signals by independent component analysis (ICA). It is unclear (1) how robustly recently proposed artifact classifiers transfer to novel users, novel paradigms or changed electrode setups, and (2) how artifact cleaning by a machine learning classifier impacts the performance of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Approach. Addressing (1), the robustness of different strategies with respect to the transfer between paradigms and electrode setups of a recently proposed classifier is investigated on offline data from 35 users and 3 EEG paradigms, which contain 6303 expert-labeled components from two ICA and preprocessing variants. Addressing (2), the effect of artifact removal on single-trial BCI classification is estimated on BCI trials from 101 users and 3 paradigms. Main results. We show that (1) the proposed artifact classifier generalizes to completely different EEG paradigms. To obtain similar results under massively reduced electrode setups, a proposed novel strategy improves artifact classification. Addressing (2), ICA artifact cleaning has little influence on average BCI performance when analyzed by state-of-the-art BCI methods. When slow motor-related features are exploited, performance varies strongly between individuals, as artifacts may obstruct relevant neural activity or are inadvertently used for BCI control. Significance. Robustness of the proposed strategies can be reproduced by EEG practitioners as the method is made available as an EEGLAB plug-in.

Our approach is based on the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of polygon primitives and brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. The presentation of polygons that contribute to building a target image (because they match the shape and/or color of the target) trigger attention-related EEG patterns. Accordingly, these target primitives can be determined using BCI classification of event-related potentials (ERPs). They are then accumulated in the display until a satisfactory reconstruction is reached. Selection steps have an average classification accuracy of 75%. Twenty-five percent of the images could be reconstructed completely, while more than 65% of the available visual details could be captured on average. Most of the misclassifications were not misinterpretations of the BCI concerning users' intent; rather, users tried to select polygons that were different than what was intended by the experimenters. Open problems and alternatives to develop a practical BCI-based image reconstruction application are discussed.

Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Filtering for Movement Related Potentials in EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs); electroencephalogram (EEG); movement related potentials (MRPs)	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; BCI; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; COMPONENTS; REGRESSION; SELECTION; ERP; ICA	Movement related potentials (MRPs) are used as features in many brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on electroencephalogram (EEG). MRP feature extraction is challenging since EEG is noisy and varies between subjects. Previous studies used spatial and spatio-temporal filtering methods to deal with these problems. However, they did not optimize temporal information or may have been susceptible to overfitting when training data are limited and the feature space is of high dimension. Furthermore, most of these studies manually select data windows and low-pass frequencies. We propose an adaptive spatio-temporal (AST) filtering method to model MRPs more accurately in lower dimensional space. AST automatically optimizes all parameters by employing a Gaussian kernel to construct a low-pass time-frequency filter and a linear ridge regression (LRR) algorithm to compute a spatial filter. Optimal parameters are simultaneously sought by minimizing leave-one-out cross-validation error through gradient descent. Using four BCI datasets from 12 individuals, we compare the performances of AST filter to two popular methods: the discriminant spatial pattern filter and regularized spatio-temporal filter. The results demonstrate that our AST filter can make more accurate predictions and is computationally feasible.

Emerging type of controllers are the brain computer interfaces that detect, intentions by using of brain signals and use them for control purposes. Tyre common classification of BEG signals is complicated due to its variation over time and recordings. In this paper two classification algorithms are proposed for Brain Computer interfaces. The two algorithms are the Restricted Boltzmann Machines and the Long Short time Memory. The first one creates an internal representation of the joint entrance of the input and the output, while the second one uses its recurrent, connection to keep an internal representation of previous inputs. The classification methods were tested using a Database of Brain activity patterns representing two classes (left, and right motor imagery). Both techniques were compared against, a conventional feedforward Artificial Neural Network trained with back propagation, observing their classification accuracies. The classification accuracy obtained from the two proposed methods revised showed similar accuracy than for the common Artificial Neural Network, displaying their usability on classifying EEG patterns, and open the possibility to be used in manufacturing systems.

Such a task is relevant to diverse domains, where a person is expected or required to be in a particular state of mind. For instance, pilots and medical staff are expected to be in a highly alert state and the proposed method could help to detect possible deviations from this expected state. This work poses a binary classification problem where the goal is to distinguish between a "relaxed" state and a baseline state ("normal") from the study of electroencephalographic signals (EEG) collected with a small number of electrodes. The EEG of 58 subjects in the two alertness states (116 records) were collected via a cap with 58 electrodes. After a data validation step, 19 subjects were retained for further analysis. A genetic algorithm was used to select a subset of electrodes. Common spatial pattern (CSP) coupled to linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to build a decision rule and thus predict the alertness of the subjects. Different subset sizes were investigated and the best compromise between the number of selected electrodes and the quality of the solution was obtained by considering 9 electrodes. Even if the present approach is costly in computation time (GA search), it allows to construct a decision rule that provides an accurate and fast prediction of the alertness state of an unseen individual.

The assessment of IHS in both clinical and scientific work relies on visual, qualitative EEG assessment without clearly quantifiable definitions. A quantitative measure, activation synchrony index (ASI), was recently shown to perform well as compared to visual assessments. The present study was set out to test whether IHS is stable enough for clinical use, and whether it could be an objective feature of EEG normality. We analyzed 31 neonatal EEG recordings that had been clinically classified as normal (n = 14) or abnormal (n = 17) using holistic, conventional visual criteria including amplitude, focal differences, qualitative synchrony, and focal abnormalities. We selected 20-min epochs of discontinuous background pattern. ASI values were computed separately for different channel pair combinations and window lengths to define them for the optimal ASI intraindividual stability. Finally, ROC curves were computed to find trade-offs related to compromised data lengths, a common challenge in neonatal EEG studies. Using the average of four consecutive 2.5-min epochs in the centro-occipital bipolar derivations gave ASI estimates that very accurately distinguished babies clinically classified as normal vs. abnormal. It was even possible to draw a cut-off limit (ASI-3.6) which correctly classified the EEGs in 97% of all cases. Finally, we showed that compromising the length of EEG segments from 20 to 5 min leads to increased variability in ASI-based classification. Our findings support the prior literature that I HS is an important feature of normal neonatal brain function. We show that ASI may provide diagnostic value even at individual level, which strongly supports its use in prospective clinical studies on neonatal EEG as well as in the feature set of upcoming EEG classifiers.

The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the interactions and causality of different parts of a brain using EEG signals recorded during a performance subjects of verbal fluency tasks. Subjects who have Parkinson's Disease (PD) have difficulties with mental tasks, such as switching between one behavior task and another. The behavior tasks include motor and phonemic fluency. This method uses verbal generation skills, activating different Broca's areas of the Brodmann's areas (BA44 and BA45). Advanced signal processing techniques are used in order to determine the activated frequency bands in the granger causality for verbal fluency tasks. The graph learning technique for channel strength is used to characterize the complex graph of Granger causality. Also, the support vector machine (SVM) method is used for training a classifier between two subjects with PD and two healthy controls. Neural data from the study was recorded at the Colorado Neurological Institute (CNI).

Imagination of left and right hand movements results in spatially distinct brain activation patterns that can be used as control signals for the BCI. Motor imagery (MI) results in the attenuation (event related desynchronization, ERD) or enhancement (event related synchronization, ERS) of amplitude in a certain frequency band of electroencephalogram (EEG). This frequency band can vary between different participants. Therefore time-frequency (TF) analysis is performed in order to extract interesting features from EEG. A simple way of performing TF analysis is by using band power features. In this paper we investigate the perspective of Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) for extracting TF information used for MI classification. HHT is a method that allows calculation of instantaneous frequency and amplitude of the signal. It does that by decomposing the signal into components for which these parameters can be calculated by means of Hilbert transform. We compare classification accuracy of simple band power features and features obtained by means of HHT on BCI competition IV dataset 2b.

The extraction of patterns of interest and dynamic features from these cortical signals has so far relied on the expertise of investigators. There is a definite need in both clinical and neuroscience research for a method that will extract critical features from high-dimensional neuroimaging data in an automatic fashion. We have previously demonstrated the use of optical flow techniques for evaluating the kinematic properties of motion field projected on non-flat manifolds like in a cortical surface. We have further extended this framework to automatically detect features in the optical flow vector field by using the modified and extended 2-Riemannian Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition (HHD). Here, we applied these mathematical models on simulation and MEG data recorded from a healthy individual during a somatosensory experiment and an epilepsy pediatric patient during sleep. We tested whether our technique can automatically extract salient dynamical features of cortical activity. Simulation results indicated that we can precisely reproduce the simulated cortical dynamics with HHD; encode them in sparse features and represent the propagation of brain activity between distinct cortical areas. Using HHD, we decoded the somatosensory N20 component into two HHD features and represented the dynamics of brain activity as a traveling source between two primary somatosensory regions. In the epilepsy patient, we displayed the propagation of the epileptic activity around the margins of a brain lesion. Our findings indicate that HHD measures computed from cortical dynamics can: (i) quantitatively access the cortical dynamics in both healthy and disease brain in terms of sparse features and dynamic brain activity propagation between distinct cortical areas, and (ii) facilitate a reproducible, automated analysis of experimental and clinical MEG/EEG source imaging data.

Many BCI studies using steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) have been reported. However, the conventional SSVEP-based BCI was found difficult to use as a versatile interface in real-life settings because the system included several types of apparatuses and computers that are not easily portable. Therefore, we investigated a new SSVEP-based BCI; our system included smartglasses for visual stimuli and employed a mobile neuro-headset for measuring electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We conducted experiments using a two-class SSVEP with our system. An SSVEP dataset from five healthy subjects was used in averaging classification performance. The classification performance depended on the viewing area of pattern reversal on the smartglasses was estimated. The accuracy rate was high when a large pattern was used. Next, the classification performance in three different situations-a resting state, a walking state, and a conversation state-was measured. Classifiers using features up to the second harmonic SSVEP signals gave a mean accuracy rate of 0.70 at the resting state.

This novel architecture not only boosts the accuracy of classification but maintains the computational efficiency of the system.

This chapter proposes an unsupervised Multi-Scale K-means (MSK-means) algorithm to distinguish epileptic EEG signals and identify epileptic zones. The random initialization of the K-means algorithm can lead to wrong clusters. Based on the characteristics of EEGs, the MSK-means algorithm initializes the coarse-scale centroid of a cluster with a suitable scale factor. In this chapter, the MSK-means algorithm is proved theoretically superior to the K-means algorithm on efficiency. In addition, three classifiers: the K-means, MSK-means and support vector machine (SVM), are used to identify seizure and localize epileptogenic zone using delay permutation entropy features. The experimental results demonstrate that identifying seizure with the MSK-means algorithm and delay permutation entropy achieves 4.7% higher accuracy than that of K-means, and 0.7% higher accuracy than that of the SVM.

So far, it is not known to what extent different devices display similar index values while processing identical electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. OBJECTIVE To compare BIS and state entropy during analysis of identical EEG data. Inspection of raw EEG input to detect potential causes of erroneous index calculation. DESIGN Offline re-analysis of EEG data from a randomised, single-centre controlled trial using the Entropy Module and an Aspect A-2000 monitor. SETTING Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich. PATIENTS Forty adult patients undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia. INTERVENTIONS Blocked randomisation of 20 patients per anaesthetic group (sevoflurane/remifentanil or propofol/remifentanil). Isolated forearm technique for differentiation between consciousness and unconsciousness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Prediction probability (P-K) of state entropy to discriminate consciousness from unconsciousness. Correlation and agreement between state entropy and BIS from deep to light hypnosis. Analysis of raw EEG compared with index values that are in conflict with clinical examination, with frequency measures (frequency bands/Spectral Edge Frequency 95) and visual inspection for physiological EEG patterns (e.g. beta or delta arousal), pathophysiological features such as high-frequency signals (electromyogram/ high-frequency EEG or eye fluttering/saccades), different types of electro-oculogram or epileptiform EEG and technical artefacts. RESULTS P-K of state entropy was 0.80 and of BIS 0.84; correlation coefficient of state entropy with BIS 0.78. Nine percent BIS and 14% state entropy values disagreed with clinical examination. Highest incidence of disagreement occurred after state transitions, in particular for state entropy after loss of consciousness during sevoflurane anaesthesia. EEG sequences which led to false 'conscious' index values often showed high-frequency signals and eye blinks. High-frequency EEG/electromyogram signals were pooled because a separation into EEG and fast electro-oculogram, for example eye fluttering or saccades, on the basis of a single EEG channel may not be very reliable. These signals led to higher Spectral Edge Frequency 95 and ratio of relative beta and gamma band power than EEG signals, indicating adequate unconscious classification. The frequency of other artefacts that were assignable, for example technical artefacts, movement artefacts, was negligible and they were excluded from analysis. CONCLUSION High-frequency signals and eye blinks may account for index values that falsely indicate consciousness. Compared with BIS, state entropy showed more false classifications of the clinical state at transition between consciousness and unconsciousness.

Prior research has demonstrated that implicitly selecting features with a genetic programming (GP) algorithm more effectively determined the proper features to discern biomarker and non-biomarker interictal iEEG and fMRI activity than conventional feature selection approaches. However for each the iEEG and fMRI modalities, it is still uncertain whether the stochastic properties of indirect feature selection with a GP yield (a) consistent results within a patient data set and (b) features that are specific or universal across multiple patient data sets. We examined the reproducibility of implicitly selecting features to classify interictal activity using a GP algorithm by performing several selection trials and subsequent frequent itemset mining (FIM) for separate iEEG and fMRI epilepsy patient data. We observed within-subject consistency and across-subject variability with some small similarity for selected features, indicating a clear need for patient-specific features and possible need for patient-specific feature selection or/and classification. For the fMRI, using nearest-neighbor classification and 30 GP generations, we obtained over 60% median sensitivity and over 60% median selectivity. For the iEEG, using nearest-neighbor classification and 30 GP generations, we obtained over 65% median sensitivity and over 65% median selectivity except one patient. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Electroencephalogram(EEG) signals can be used as a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of subjects with alcoholism. The neurophysiological interpretation of EEG signals in persons with alcoholism(PWA) is based on observation and interpretation of the frequency and power in their EEGs compared to EEG signals from persons without alcoholism. This paper presents a review of the known features of EEGs obtained from PWA and proposes that the impact of alcoholism on the brain can be determined by computer-aided analysis of EEGs through extracting the minute variations in the EEG signals that can differentiate the EEGs of PWA from those of nonaffected persons. The authors advance the idea of automated computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of alcoholism by employing the EEG signals. This is achieved through judicious combination of signal processing techniques such as wavelet, nonlinear dynamics, and chaos theory and pattern recognition and classification techniques. A CAD system is cost-effective and efficient and can be used as a decision support system by physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism especially those who do not specialize in alcoholism or neurophysiology. It can also be of great value to rehabilitation centers to assess PWA over time and to monitor the impact of treatment aimed at minimizing or reversing the effects of the disease on the brain. A CAD system can be used to determine the extent of alcoholism-related changes in EEG signals (low, medium, high) and the effectiveness of therapeutic plans. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Detection of mental imagery and attempted movements in patients with disorders of consciousness using EEG	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; mental imagery; attempted movements; passive movements; disorders of consciousness	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; VEGETATIVE STATE; SYNCHRONIZATION; AWARENESS; FMRI	Further development of an EEG based communication device for patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC) could benefit from addressing the following gaps in knowledge-first, an evaluation of different types of motor imagery; second, an evaluation of passive feet movement as a mean of an initial classifier setup; and third, rapid delivery of biased feedback. To that end we investigated whether complex and/or familiar mental imagery, passive, and attempted feet movement can be reliably detected in patients with DoC using EEG recordings, aiming to provide them with a means of communication. Six patients in a minimally conscious state (MCS) took part in this study. The patients were verbally instructed to perform different mental imagery tasks (sport, navigation), as well as attempted feet movements, to induce distinctive event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/S) patterns in the EEG. Offline classification accuracies above chance level were reached in all three tasks (i.e., attempted feet, sport, and navigation), with motor tasks yielding significant (p < 0.05) results more often than navigation (sport: 10 out of 18 sessions; attempted feet: 7 out of 14 sessions; navigation: 4 out of 12 sessions). The passive feet movements, evaluated in one patient, yielded mixed results: whereas time-frequency analysis revealed task-related EEG changes over neurophysiological plausible cortical areas, the classification results were not significant enough (p < 0.05) to setup an initial classifier for the detection of attempted movements. Concluding, the results presented in this study are consistent with the current state of the art in similar studies, to which we contributed by comparing different types of mental tasks, notably complex motor imagery and attempted feet movements, within patients. Furthermore, we explored new venues, such as an evaluation of passive feet movement as a mean of an initial classifier setup, and rapid delivery of biased feedback.

Methods: Fifty-four consecutive patients with pharmacoresistant TLE were enrolled retrospectively after a comprehensive presurgical evaluation. This evaluation defined: 7 lateral TLE, 17 mesial TLE, 14 "plus" TLE, and 16 bilateral TLE. Whole-brain voxel-based brain metabolism was studied in each group of patients, in comparison to 23 healthy subjects, and individual classification was evaluated by cross-validation using the found clusters. An (18)FDG-PET index was moreover calculated for each patient, based on the individual Z-score of the most significant cluster extracted on the comparison between patients' subgroup and healthy subjects. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate factors associated with postoperative outcome (Engel's classes III-IV vs. I-II), including age, gender, disease duration, seizure frequency, as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET findings. Results: Different patterns of hypometabolism were found inside and outside the epileptogenic zone, among patients with distinct subgroups of TLE, in comparison to healthy subjects (p < 0.001, corrected for the cluster). At individual level, cross-validation showed satisfactory discrimination between the four groups with 71.4-88.2% overall accuracy. Multivariate analysis shows that (18)FDG-PET index was the only significant predictor of postoperative outcome to distinguish between Engel's classes I-II and III-IV (p = 0.037). Significance: Overall, this whole-brain voxel-based analysis validates specific patterns of hypometabolism, inside and outside the EZ, in distinct subgroups of patients with TLE, as defined by SEEG gold standard, and in relation with postoperative outcome.

Episodic retrieval involves early and sustained effects of reactivating information from encoding	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Episodic memory; Recognition; EEG; Reinstatement; Reactivation; Confidence	COMPLEMENTARY-LEARNING-SYSTEMS; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; MRC PSYCHOLINGUISTIC DATABASE; MULTIVOXEL PATTERN-ANALYSIS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; NETWORK MODEL	Several fMRI studies have shown a correspondence between the brain regions activated during encoding and retrieval, consistent with the view that memory retrieval involves hippocampally-mediated reinstatement of cortical activity. With the limited temporal resolution of fMRI, the precise timing of such reactivation is unclear, calling into question the functional significance of these effects. Whereas reactivation influencing retrieval should emerge with neural correlates of retrieval success, that signifying post-retrieval monitoring would trail retrieval. The present study employed EEG to provide a temporal landmark of retrieval success from which we could investigate the sub-trial time course of reactivation. Pattern-classification analyses revealed that early-onsetting reactivation differentiated the outcome of recognition-memory judgments and was associated with individual differences in behavioral accuracy, while reactivation was also evident in a sustained form later in the trial. The EEG findings suggest that, whereas prior fMRI findings could be interpreted as reflecting the contribution of reinstatement to retrieval success, they could also indicate the maintenance of episodic information in service of post-retrieval evaluation.

Currently, EEG-based BCIs are mostly based on classification between different limb effectors, and only few commands can be generated directly. To increase the command number and control efficiency, both clench force parameters and clench speed parameters has been studied independently. In this paper, we try to decode speed and force hand movement imagination at the same time. Alpha band power of EEG signal is extracted as feature and then classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM). The primary result shows that speed and force motor imagery of the same hand is distinguishable, which may increase direct BCI control commands in the future.	[Xu, B. L.; Yin, X. X.; Shi, G.; Li, H.

Electrocorticography reveals the temporal dynamics of posterior parietal cortical activity during recognition memory decisions	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						intracranial EEG; declarative memory; decision making; multivariate pattern analysis; ECoG	EPISODIC MEMORY; FIELD POTENTIALS; RETRIEVAL; CORTEX; LOBE; FMRI; REGIONS; BRAIN; SIGNALS; RECOLLECTION	Theories of the neurobiology of episodic memory predominantly focus on the contributions of medial temporal lobe structures, based on extensive lesion, electrophysiological, and imaging evidence. Against this backdrop, functional neuroimaging data have unexpectedly implicated left posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in episodic retrieval, revealing distinct activation patterns in PPC subregions as humans make memory-related decisions. To date, theorizing about the functional contributions of PPC has been hampered by the absence of information about the temporal dynamics of PPC activity as retrieval unfolds. Here, we leveraged electrocorticography to examine the temporal profile of high gamma power (HGP) in dorsal PPC subregions as participants made old/new recognition memory decisions. A double dissociation in memory-related HGP was observed, with activity in left intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and left superior parietal lobule (SPL) differing in time and sign for recognized old items (Hits) and correctly rejected novel items (CRs). Specifically, HGP in left IPS increased for Hits 300-700 ms poststimulus onset, and decayed to baseline similar to 200 ms preresponse. By contrast, HGP in left SPL increased for CRs early after stimulus onset (200-300 ms) and late in the memory decision (from 700 ms to response). These memory-related effects were unique to left PPC, as they were not observed in right PPC. Finally, memory-related HGP in left IPS and SPL was sufficiently reliable to enable brain-based decoding of the participant's memory state at the single-trial level, using multivariate pattern classification. Collectively, these data provide insights into left PPC temporal dynamics as humans make recognition memory decisions.

These models present a biologically more plausible structure and behavior than other neural networks models. K-sets have been used in many machine-learning problems, with potential application on pattern recognition while presenting novel chaotic concepts for signal processing. This paper presents the characteristics of the K-sets models and their application in a face recognition task.

J	Amsuess, S; Goebel, P; Graimann, B; Farina, D				Amsuess, Sebastian; Goebel, Peter; Graimann, Bernhard; Farina, Dario			A Multi-Class Proportional Myocontrol Algorithm for Upper Limb Prosthesis Control: Validation in Real-Life Scenarios on Amputees	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Pattern recognition; physical prosthesis control; proportional estimation; prosthesis control; user-centered testing	MULTIFUNCTION MYOELECTRIC CONTROL; EMG SIGNALS; KINEMATICS; CLASSIFICATION; HANDS; EEG	Functional replacement of upper limbs by means of dexterous prosthetic devices remains a technological challenge. While the mechanical design of prosthetic hands has advanced rapidly, the human-machine interfacing and the control strategies needed for the activation of multiple degrees of freedom are not reliable enough for restoring hand function successfully. Machine learning methods capable of inferring the user intent from EMG signals generated by the activation of the remnant muscles are regarded as a promising solution to this problem. However, the lack of robustness of the current methods impedes their routine clinical application. In this study, we propose a novel algorithm for controlling multiple degrees of freedom sequentially, inherently proportionally and with high robustness, allowing a good level of prosthetic hand function. The control algorithm is based on the spatial linear combinations of amplitude-related EMG signal features. The weighting coefficients in this combination are derived from the optimization criterion of the common spatial patterns filters which allow for maximal discriminability between movements. An important component of the study is the validation of the method which was performed on both able-bodied and amputee subjects who used physical prostheses with customized sockets and performed three standardized functional tests mimicking daily-life activities of varying difficulty. Moreover, the new method was compared in the same conditions with one clinical/industrial and one academic state-of-the-art method. The novel algorithm outperformed significantly the state-of-the-art techniques in both subject groups for tests that required the activation of more than one degree of freedom. Because of the evaluation in real time control on both able-bodied subjects and final users (amputees) wearing physical prostheses, the results obtained allow for the direct extrapolation of the benefits of the proposed method for the end users. In conclusion, the method proposed and validated in real-life use scenarios, allows the practical usability of multifunctional hand prostheses in an intuitive way, with significant advantages with respect to previous systems.

Hence, the challenge is how to train the BCI system effectively especially in the scenario with small amount of training data. In this paper, we introduce improved semisupervised adaptation based on common spatial pattern (CSP) features. The feature extraction and classification are performed jointly and iteratively. In the iteration step, training data are expanded by part of the testing data with labels which are predicted by a linear discriminant analysis classifier and/or a Bayesian linear discriminant analysis classifier in the previous iteration. Then CSP features are reextracted from the expanded training data, and the classifiers are retrained. Both self-training and cotraining paradigms are proposed for the improved semisupervised adaptation. Throughout the investigation on different number of initial training trials, we find that when a small number of training trials are used, e.g., a training session contains no more than 30 trials, similar classification performance to that of large training data items (40-50 trials) can be achieved. Effectiveness of the algorithms is verified by two competition datasets. Compared with several existing algorithms, the proposed semisupervised algorithms show improvements in classification accuracy for most of the competition datasets especially in the case of small training data.

For example, in brain-computer interface applications, training data is often the result of lengthy experimental sessions, where the attention levels of participants can change over the course of the experiment. In such application cases, structured label noise will cause problems because most machine learning methods assume independent and identically distributed label noise. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for learning and evaluation in presence of systematic label noise. The core of which is a novel extension of support vector data description / one-class SVM that can incorporate latent variables. Controlled simulations on synthetic data and a real-world EEG experiment with 20 subjects from the domain of brain-computer-interfacing show that our method achieves accuracies that go beyond the state of the art.

So, studies in this area are about biomedical signal classification or biomedical discrete data classification. There are artificial intelligence models which are relevant to classification of ECG, EMG or EEG signals. In same way, in literature, many models exist for classification of discrete data taken as value of samples which can be results of blood analysis or biopsy in medical process. Each algorithm could not achieve high accuracy rate on classification of signal and discrete data. In this study, compensatory neurofuzzy network model is presented for classification of discrete data in biomedical pattern recognition area. The compensatory neurofuzzy network has a hybrid and binary classifier. In this system, the parameters of fuzzy systems are updated by backpropagation algorithm. The realized classifier model is conducted to two benchmark datasets (Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset and Pima Indian Diabetes dataset). Experimental studies show that compensatory neurofuzzy network model achieved 96.11% accuracy rate in classification of breast cancer dataset and 69.08% accuracy rate was obtained in experiments made on diabetes dataset with only 10 iterations.

Unsupervised classification of neocortical activity patterns in neonatal and pre-juvenile rodents	FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS			English	Article						development; principal component analysis; network oscillations; synchrony; high-frequency oscillations; prefrontal cortex	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SPINDLE BURSTS; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; EEG; HIPPOCAMPUS; MECHANISMS; MATURATION; SWITCH; WAVES; HZ	Flexible communication within the brain, which relies on oscillatory activity, is not confined to adult neuronal networks. Experimental evidence has documented the presence of discontinuous patterns of oscillatory activity already during early development. Their highly variable spatial and time-frequency organization has been related to region specificity. However, it might be equally due to the absence of unitary criteria for classifying the early activity patterns, since they have been mainly characterized by visual inspection. Therefore, robust and unbiased methods for categorizing these discontinuous oscillations are needed for increasingly complex data sets from different labs. Here, we introduce an unsupervised detection and classification algorithm for the discontinuous activity patterns of rodents during early development. For this, in a first step time windows with discontinuous oscillations vs. epochs of network "silence" were identified. In a second step, the major features of detected events were identified and processed by principal component analysis for deciding on their contribution to the classification of different oscillatory patterns. Finally, these patterns were categorized using an unsupervised cluster algorithm. The results were validated on manually characterized neonatal spindle bursts (SB), which ubiquitously entrain neocortical areas of rats and mice, and prelimbic nested gamma spindle bursts (NG). Moreover, the algorithm led to satisfactory results for oscillatory events that, due to increased similarity of their features, were more difficult to classify, e.g., during the pre-juvenile developmental period. Based on a linear classification, the optimal number of features to consider increased with the difficulty of detection. This algorithm allows the comparison of neonatal and pre-juvenile oscillatory patterns in their spatial and temporal organization. It might represent a first step for the unbiased elucidation of activity patterns during development.

EEG data are essentially nonlinear and this nonlinear time series has been identified as multi-fractal in nature. We need rigorous techniques for such analysis. In this article, we present the visibility graph as the latest, rigorous technique that can assess the degree of multifractality accurately and reliably. Moreover, it has also been found that this technique can give reliable results with test data of comparatively short length. In this work, the visibility graph algorithm has been used for mapping a time series-EEG signals-to a graph to study complexity and fractality of the time series through investigation of its complexity. The power of scale-freeness of visibility graph has been used as an effective method for measuring fractality in the EEG signal. The scale-freeness of the visibility graph has also been observed after averaging the statistically independent samples of the signal. Scale-freeness of the visibility graph has been calculated for 5 sets of EEG data patterns varying from normal eye closed to epileptic. The change in the values is analyzed further, and it has been observed that it reduces uniformly from normal eye closed to epileptic.

Sensor fusion applications such as intention detection have been emphasized as a major challenge for both robotic orthoses and prostheses. In order to better examine the strengths and shortcomings of the field, this paper presents a review of existing sensor fusion methods for wearable robots, both stationary ones such as rehabilitation exoskeletons and portable ones such as active prostheses and full-body exoskeletons. Fusion methods are first presented as applied to individual sensing modalities (primarily electromyography, electroencephalography and mechanical sensors), and then four approaches to combining multiple modalities are presented. The strengths and weaknesses of the different methods are compared, and recommendations are made for future sensor fusion research. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper proposes a low computation seizure prediction algorithm that combines a fractal dimension with a machine learning algorithm. The presented seizure prediction algorithm extracts the Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD) of EEG signals as features to classify the patient's preictal or interictal state with Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) as a classifier. The outputs of BLDA are smoothed by a Kalman fitter for reducing possible sporadic and isolated false alarms and then the final prediction results are produced using a thresholding procedure. The algorithm was evaluated on the intracranial EEG recordings of 21 patients in the Freiburg EEG database. For seizure occurrence period of 30 min and 50 min, our algorithm obtained an average sensitivity of 86.95% and 89.33%, an average false prediction rate of 0.20/h, and an average prediction time of 24.47 min and 39.39 min, respectively. The results confirm that the changes of HFD can serve as a precursor of ictal activities and be used for distinguishing between interictal and preictal epochs. Both HFD and BLDA classifier have a low computational complexity. All of these make the proposed algorithm suitable for real-time seizure prediction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Compared with most studies in the literature, which are mainly focused on the classification of distracted and nondistracted periods, this study proposes a new framework to prospectively predict the start and end of a distraction period, defined by map viewing. The proposed prediction algorithm was tested on a data set of continuous EEG signals recorded from 24 subjects. During the EEG recordings, the subjects were asked to drive from an initial position to a destination using a city map in a simulated driving environment. The overall accuracy values for the prediction of the start and the end of map viewing were 81% and 70%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can predict the start and end of map viewing with relatively high accuracy and can be generalized to individual subjects. The outcome of this study has a high potential to improve the design of future intelligent navigation systems. Prediction of the start of map viewing can be used to provide route information based on a driver's needs and consequently avoid map-viewing activities. Prediction of the end of map viewing can be used to provide warnings for potential long map-viewing durations. Further development of the proposed framework and its applications in driver-distraction predictions are also discussed.

Experimental architecture for synchronized recordings of cerebral, muscular and biomechanical data during lower limb activities	2015 23RD MEDITERRANEAN CONFERENCE ON CONTROL AND AUTOMATION (MED)	Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation		English	Proceedings Paper	23rd Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation (MED)	JUN 16-19, 2015	Torremolinos, SPAIN	Mediterranean Control Assoc, Univ Malaga, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Control Syst Soc, IEEE Robot & Automat Soc, IFAC, Comite Espanol Automatica, Departmento Ingn Sistemas & Automatica		EEG; EMG; biomechanical data; synchronized registers; lower limb	WALKING	In this paper, an architecture that allows the synchronized recording of cerebral, muscular and biomechanical data during lower limb activities has been designed. The synchronization issue has been addressed. The goal is to analyze the relationship between the different signals, first during simple lower limbs movements, then extending the analysis to gait. Five incomplete spinal cord injury patients and four healthy users participated in experiments to validate the architecture. The users were asked to perform simple movements that involve only one or two joints, particularly knee and ankle. Future studies with the recorded data will address several issues, such as creating neuromusculoskeletal models that relate kinematics data with EMG information, improving the decoding of the angles of the lower limb through EEG signals, or analyzing the coherence between the EEG signals and the EMG information.

Frontal alpha oscillations distinguish leaders from followers: Multivariate decoding of mutually interacting brains	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Social interaction; Dual EEG; Interpersonal coordination; Multivariate decoding; Leader-follower dynamics	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; NEURAL SYNCHRONIZATION; EEG; COORDINATION; INFORMATION; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; STRATEGIES; IMITATION; ARTIFACTS	Successful social interactions rely upon the abilities of two or more people to mutually exchange information in real-time, while simultaneously adapting to one another. The neural basis of social cognition has mostly been investigated in isolated individuals, and more recently using two-person paradigms to quantify the neuronal dynamics underlying social interaction. While several studies have shown the relevance of understanding complementary and mutually adaptive processes, the neural mechanisms underlying such coordinative behavioral patterns during joint action remain largely unknown. Here, we employed a synchronized finger-tapping task while measuring dual-EEG from pairs of human participants who either mutually adjusted to each other in an interactive task or followed a computer metronome. Neurophysiologically, the interactive condition was characterized by a stronger suppression of alpha and low-beta oscillations over motor and frontal areas in contrast to the non-interactive computer condition. A multivariate analysis of two-brain activity to classify interactive versus non-interactive trials revealed asymmetric patterns of the frontal alpha-suppression in each pair, during both task anticipation and execution, such that only one member showed the frontal component. Analysis of the behavioral data showed that this distinction coincided with the leader-follower relationship in 8/9 pairs, with the leaders characterized by the stronger frontal alpha-suppression. This suggests that leaders invest more resources in prospective planning and control. Hence our results show that the spontaneous emergence of leader-follower relationships in dyadic interactions can be predicted from EEG recordings of brain activity prior to and during interaction. Furthermore, this emphasizes the importance of investigating complementarity in joint action. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, MW estimated from the spontaneously generated electroencephalogram (EEG) was found to be task-specific. In existing studies, EEG-based MW classifier can work well under the task used to train the classifier (within-task) but crash completely when used to classify MW of a task that is similar to but not included in the training data (cross task). The possible causes have been considered to be the task-specific EEG patterns, the mismatched workload across tasks and the temporal effects. In this study, cross-task performance-based feature selection (FS) and regression model were tried to cope with these challenges, in order to make EEG-based MW estimator trained on working memory tasks work well under a complex simulated multi-attribute task (MAT). The results show that the performance of regression model trained on working memory task and tested on multi-attribute task with the feature subset picked-out were significantly improved (correlation coefficient (COR): 0.740 +/- 0.147 and 0.598 +/- 0.161 for FS data and validation data respectively) when compared to the performance in the same condition with all features (chance level). It can be inferred that there do exist some MW-related EEG features can be picked out and there are something in common between MW of a relatively simple task and a complex task. This study provides a promising approach to measure MW across tasks.

Multi-channel EEG recordings during 3,936 grasp and lift trials with varying weight and friction	SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article								WAY-EEG-GAL is a dataset designed to allow critical tests of techniques to decode sensation, intention, and action from scalp EEG recordings in humans who perform a grasp-and-lift task. Twelve participants performed lifting series in which the object's weight (165, 330, or 660 g), surface friction (sandpaper, suede, or silk surface), or both, were changed unpredictably between trials, thus enforcing changes in fingertip force coordination. In each of a total of 3,936 trials, the participant was cued to reach for the object, grasp it with the thumb and index finger, lift it and hold it for a couple of seconds, put it back on the support surface, release it, and, lastly, to return the hand to a designated rest position. We recorded EEG (32 channels), EMG (five arm and hand muscles), the 3D position of both the hand and object, and force/torque at both contact plates. For each trial we provide 16 event times (e.g., 'object lift-off') and 18 measures that characterize the behaviour (e. g., 'peak grip force').

EEG Analysis for Cognitive Failure Detection in Driving Using Neuro-Evolutionary Synergism	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2014 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	JUL 06-11, 2014	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE		cognition; cognitive failure detection; differential evolution; Hopfield neural net; tactile sensor		The paper proposes a solution to reduce accidents in driving by alarming specific cognitive failures to the drivers on occurrence of the failures. Three different types of cognitive failures that might occur due to lapse of i) visual alertness, ii) cognitive planning and iii) motor execution are studied, and suitable classifiers have been employed to classify these failures. Force exerted by the driver during turning or sudden tracking is also measured to detect his level of cognitive load during significant changes in the driving environment. Recurrent neural networks are introduced here as classifiers to decode cognitive tasks performed by the driver from his acquired EEG. For each recurrent neural net, we use a Lyapunov energy surface the minima of which denote the cognitive tasks during one of three cognitive activities mentioned above. Given the features of the measured EEG for a cognitive tasks, the recurrent net converges to one of several optima, describing a specific cognitive failure. Experimental results obtained by employing a driving simulator and an EEG system are encouraging.

The objective of this work is to measure and classify psychophysiological reactivity in response to cultural heritage material presented as visual and audio. We present a data processing and classification framework for the classification of interest. Two studies are reported, adopting a subject-dependent approach to classify psychophysiological signals using mobile physiological sensors and the support vector machine learning algorithm. The results show that it is possible to reliably infer a state of interest from cultural heritage material using psychophysiological feature data and a machine learning approach, informing future work for the development of a real-time physiological computing system for use within an adaptive cultural heritage experience designed to adapt the provision of information to sustain the interest of the visitor.

The transition period is in the order of 20-30 ms, and standard signal processing methodologies such as Fourier analysis are inadequate for proper characterization of the phenomenon. Hilbert transform-based (HT) analysis has shown great promise in detecting rapid changes in the synchronization properties of the cortex measured by high-density EEG arrays. Therefore, HT is a primary candidate of operational principles of brain computer interfaces (BCI). Hilbert transform over narrow frequency bands has been applied successfully to develop robust BCI methods, but optimal filtering is a primary concern. Here we systematically evaluate the performance of FIR filters over various narrow frequency bands before applying Hilbert transforms. The conclusions are illustrated using rabbit ECoG data. The results are applicable for the analysis of scalp EEG data for advanced BCI devices.

The analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) data related to motor imagery potentials has proved to be a difficult task. EEG readings are noisy, and the elicited patterns occur in different parts of the scalp, at different instants and at different frequencies. Wavelet transform has been widely used in the BCI field as it offers temporal and spectral capabilities, although it lacks spatial information. In this study we propose a tailored second generation wavelet to extract features from these three domains. This transform is applied over a graph representation of motor imaginary trials, which encodes temporal and spatial information. This graph is enhanced using per-subject knowledge in order to optimise the spatial relationships among the electrodes, and to improve the filter design. This method improves the performance of classifying different imaginary limb movements maintaining the low computational resources required by the lifting transform over graphs. By using an online dataset we were able to positively assess the feasibility of using the novel method in an online BCI context.

Above sensomotor cortex 28 electrodes were set as a rectangle - 4 rows with 7 electrodes in each one. 2D center-out reaching task was used. The target appeared on the screen edge through the random intervals 0.5-2.5 s equiprobably at the left, on the right, from above or from below. The task was to touch the target with the joystick-operated cursor displacing the cursor in one of the sides from the center to edge. EEG from the target occurrence till cursor contact with it was analyzed. Leading on phase of spontaneous EEG waves in the local area of the left sensomotor cortex and in the centre of back-parietal cortex during cursor movement downwards (the hand with joystick moves to oneself) comparing to rest state and movements in three other directions is revealed. The over time smoothing of data concerning phase alignment reveals hidden constant components in EEG resembling evoked potentials.	[Belov, D. R.; Stepanova, P. A.; Kolodyazhnyi, S.

Current neurophysiological measurements can distinguish groups of healthy controls and groups of schizophrenia patients. Individual classification based on neurophysiological measurements mostly shows moderate accuracy. We wanted to examine whether it is possible to distinguish controls and patients individually with a good accuracy. To this end we used a combination of features extracted from the auditory and visual P300 paradigms and the mismatch negativity paradigm. Methods: We selected 54 patients and 54 controls, matched for age and gender, from the data available at the UPC Kortenberg. The EEG-data were high- and low-pass filtered, epoched and averaged. Features (latencies and amplitudes of component peaks) were extracted from the averaged signals. The resulting dataset was used to train and test classification algorithms. First on separate paradigms and then on all combinations, we applied Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Derision Tree, with two of its improvements: Adaboost and Random Forest Results: For at least two classifiers the performance increased significantly by combining paradigms compared to single paradigms. The classification accuracy increased from at best 79.8% when trained on features from single paradigms, to 84.7% when trained on features from all three paradigms. Conclusion: A combination of features originating from three evoked potential paradigms allowed us to accurately classify individual subjects as either control or patient. Classification accuracy was mostly above 80% for the machine learners evaluated in this study and close to 85% at best. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To achieve this goal the Eletroencephalogram (EEG) entropy was used as principal feature and a Principal Component Analyses (PCA) was also used. EEG signal, from each of the 8-channel transversal set up, was acquired from electrodes Fz, Cz, Pz and Oz to electrodes F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, and O2. Results showed that for each MI there is an specific topographic distribution of the cortex activation. A common point was the minor activation of the motor area. The principal areas were the frontal and the parietal ones. The clustering analysis showed, considering 20 % of similarity, that the points which possibly contribute to motor imagery recognition came from those areas. Furthermore, the best results in the classification process were reached to distinguish between left arm and left hand with 89.74 % and between arms and hands with 80.77 %. Both of these scenes were possible using only the information provided by the frontal electrodes, and this agree with brain mapping. The activation of frontal and parietal lobes reflects the network involved in sensory-motor integration (posterior parietal), decision-making (prefrontal) and preparation of motor response (premotor). Our finding that the frontal electrodes were the most representative may be related to the fact that the premotor cortex is responsible for motor planning and thus, should be the most active area in distinguishing between different motor movements.

Synchronization of EEG: Bivariate and Multivariate Measures	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bivariate measurement; coupled oscillators; electroencephalogram (EEG); multivariate measurement; synchronization	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EARLY ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; STATE-SPACE ANALYSIS; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; THETA OSCILLATIONS; ONLINE CONTROL; FREQUENCY; SYSTEMS; POWER	Synchronization behavior of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is important for decoding information processing in the human brain. Modern multichannel EEG allows a transition from traditional measurements of synchronization in pairs of EEG signals to whole-brain synchronization maps. The latter can be based on bivariate measures (BM) via averaging over pair-wise values or, alternatively, on multivariate measures (MM), which directly ascribe a single value to the synchronization in a group. In order to compare BM versus MM, we applied nine different estimators to simulated multivariate time series with known parameters and to real EEGs. We found widespread correlations between BM and MM, which were almost frequency-independent for all the measures except coherence. The analysis of the behavior of synchronization measures in simulated settings with variable coupling strength, connection probability, and parameter mismatch showed that some of them, including S-estimator, S-Renyi, omega, and coherence, are more sensitive to linear interdependences, while others, like mutual information and phase locking value, are more responsive to nonlinear effects. One must consider these properties together with the fact that MM are computationally less expensive and, therefore, more efficient for the large-scale data sets than BM while choosing a synchronization measure for EEG analysis.

Diagnosing depression in the early curable stage is very important. It may also lead to various disorders like sleep disorders and alcoholism. Here in this project the Electroencephalogram Gram (EEG) signals are obtained from publicly available database are processed in MATLAB. This can be useful in classifying subjects with the disorders using classifier tools present in it. For this aim, the features are extracted from frequency bands (alpha, delta and theta). Primarily the EEG signals were read using EDF browser software and the signals were loaded into Matlab to get log Power Spectral Density from EEG bands. The results obtained from Matlab are fed into neural network pattern recognition tool and ANFIS tool box which is integrated in MATLAB. These are powerful tool for data classification. Relevant extracted features parameters are used as inputs to the ANFIS and nprtool. The evaluated outputs are helpful to distinguish alcoholics from controls and various sleep disorders like insomnia, narcolepsy, bruxism and nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. 20 samples are trained and evaluated for Alcoholism and 40 samples are trained and evaluated for 4 different sleep disorders in ANFIS tool. The evaluated ANFIS output is read as 0 for Insomnia, 1 is for No sleep disorder, 2 for Narcolepsy, 3 for NFLE, 4 for Bruxism. 240 samples for 4 different sleep disorders and 60 samples for Alcoholism/ Control are trained and classified in nprtool.

The article describes the development of a continuous method for neuronal mental workload registration during the execution of cognitive tasks. The sample consists of 54 people in paid work. The electroencephalogram as well as further workload relevant biosignal data and the NASA-TLX as a subjective questionnaire method are registered. Results from the workload classification of the EEG segments are presented. They are in concordance with the results expected from different task requirements on the executive functions. Findings from the subjective ratings, accuracy rates, and cardiovascular parameters underscore this fact.

Derived electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals allow the investigation of spatially highly focused task-related activation within the high-gamma frequency band, making the discrimination of individual finger movements or complex grasping tasks possible. Common spatial patterns (CSP) are commonly used for BCI systems and provide a powerful tool for feature optimization and dimensionality reduction. This work focused on the discrimination of (i) three complex hand movements, as well as (ii) hand movement and idle state. Two subjects S1 and S2 performed single 'open', 'peace' and 'fist' hand poses in multiple trials. Signals in the high-gamma frequency range between 100 and 500 Hz were spatially filtered based on a CSP algorithm for (i) and (ii). Additionally, a manual feature selection approach was tested for (i). A multi-class linear discriminant analysis (LDA) showed for (i) an error rate of 13.89 % / 7.22 % and 18.42 % / 1.17 % for S1 and S2 using manually / CSP selected features, where for (ii) a two class LDA lead to a classification error of 13.39 % and 2.33 % for S1 and S2, respectively.

One of the major challenges is to develop tools for early diagnosis and disease progression. Electroencephalogram represents potentially a noninvasive and relatively non-expensive approach for screening of dementia and AD. It provides a method to objectively quantify the cortical activation patterns but it is usually considered insensitive in the early AD. This study introduces a novel method where electroencephalographic recordings (EEG) are subjected to Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), which decomposes a signal into components known as Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). The results, suggest that, the IMFs may be used to determine the particular frequency bandwidths in which specific phenomena occur.

SLEEP SPINDLES DETECTION USING EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION	2015 INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE FOR MULTIMEDIA UNDERSTANDING (IWCIM)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Workshop on Computational Intelligence for Multimedia Understanding (IWCIM)	OCT 29-30, 2015	PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC	ERCIM, IEEE Czechoslovakia Sect, isep, CTU Prague Circ, UCT Prague, agile Europe, Humusoft		Sleep; Spindles; EEG; Empirical Mode Decomposition; EMD; Adaptive Segmentation		Sleep spindles are very important EEG patterns in modern neuroscience. There were developed many spindle detection algorithms, but not all of them are suitable for patients with insomnia because of artifacts, movements and complicated spindle producing. The paper presents a spindle detection method based on proper preprocessing and classification of stationary segments using Naive Bayes classifier. Preprocessing was performed using Empirical Mode Decomposition, which decomposes the signal into trends. Trends rejecting from the signal gives filtered signal for feature processing. To evaluate the quality of proposed approach, F-measure, positive predicative value and true positive rating were calculated. The method shows good results on dataset of 11 insomniac patient: F-measure by sample was 40.72% and F-measure by events was 48.59%. The results were also compared with Martin, Molle, Wendt and Ferallelli methods.

However, GPFA has also been reported in a few patients with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) who presented with typical absence seizures (TAS). Our aim was to report the results of long-term follow-up and genetic findings in these patients. Methods: We investigated all EEGs of adult GGE patients with TAS, and identified 12 patients with GPFA (8.3% of adult GGE patients with TAS). Ten of these patients were available for long-term follow up. Their clinical and electroencephalographic courses and genetic features were investigated. The control group was composed of 24 adult GGE patients who also had TAS, but lacking GPFA with a similar follow-up duration in the same epilepsy center. Results: The mean age at GPFA detection was 33 +/- 16.6 (16-71 years) and 80% still had GPFA in their last EEG. The duration of epilepsy and persistence of TAS were both significantly longer in the GPFA group despite a similar follow-up duration. Sixty percent of the GPFA group had consanguineous parents, whereas this rate was only 4.17% in the control group. Seven relatives of the GPFA group also had epilepsy. We could not show any known mutations in two families. At the end of the follow-up, none of the patients with GPFA was dependent in self-care, despite continuing seizures. Conclusion: Our study shows that GPFA is an ignored EEG pattern of adult GGE patients with TAS, indicating a long and non-remitting course in almost all of the patients.

One model hypothesizes that error detection results from the confrontation of two signals: a fast and unconscious motor code, based on a direct sensory-motor pathway; and a slower conscious intention code that computes the required response given the stimulus and task instructions. To test this theory and assess how the chain of cognitive processes leading to error detection is modulated by consciousness, we applied multivariate decoding methods to single-trial magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography data. Human participants performed a fast bimanual number comparison task on masked digits presented at threshold, such that about half of them remained unseen. By using both erroneous and correct trials, we designed orthogonal decoders for the actual response (left or right), the required response (left or right), and the response accuracy (correct or incorrect). While perceptual stimulus information and the actual response hand could be decoded on both conscious and non-conscious trials, the required response could only be decoded on conscious trials. Moreover, whether the current response was correct or incorrect could be decoded only when the target digits were conscious, at a time and with a certainty that varied with the amount of evidence in favor of the correct response. These results are in accordance with the proposed dual-route model of conscious versus nonconscious evidence accumulation, and suggest that explicit error detection is possible only when the brain computes a conscious representation of the desired response, distinct from the ongoing motor program.

Quantitative EEGs produce complex data sets derived from digitally analyzed electrical activity at different frequency bands, at multiple electrode locations, and under different vigilance (eyes open vs. closed) states, resulting in potential feature patterns which may be diagnostically useful, but detectable only with advanced mathematical models. Methods: This paper uses a data mining methodology for classifying EEGs of 53 MDD patients and 43 HVs. This included: (a) pre-processing the data, including cleaning and normalization, applying Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to map the features into a new feature space; and applying Genetic Algorithm (GA) to identify the most significant features; (b) building predictive models using the Decision Tree (DT) algorithm to discover rules and hidden patterns based on the reduced and mapped features; and (c) evaluating the models based on the accuracy and false positive values on the EEG data of MDD and HV participants. Two categories of experiments were performed. The first experiment analyzed each frequency band individually, while the second experiment analyzed the bands together. Results: Application of LDA and GA markedly reduced the total number of utilized features by >= 50 % and, with all frequency bands analyzed together, the model showed average classification accuracy (MDD vs. HV) of 80 %. The best results from model testing with additional test EEG recordings from 9 MDD patients and 35 HV individuals demonstrated an accuracy of 80 % and showed an average sensitivity of 70 %, a specificity of 76 %, and a positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 74 and 75 %, respectively. Conclusions: These initial findings suggest that the proposed automated EEG analytical approach could be a useful adjunctive diagnostic approach in clinical practice.

When subjects performed the task of relaxation -meditation or tension -imagination, the output EEG signals of the subjects from the central parieto-occipital region of PZ electrode were recorded by the digital EEC device. By means of drawing Hilbert time -frequency amplitude spectrum and selecting the statistical properties of amplitude within different time -frequency bands as characteristic vector set, then carrying out feature selection based on Fisher distance criterion, choosing former several elements of larger Fisher index to be multidimensional feature vector and at last inputting the eigenvector to Fisher classifier, and so brain -computer interface was realized. The experiment results of 15 volunteers showed that the average of classification correct ratio was 90.3% and the highest was 95%. Due to only one electrode adopted, if some coding way was adopted, the brain -computer interface technology could be more easily used in robot control.

Robust Communication with IoT Devices using Wearable Brain Machine Interfaces	2015 IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN (ICCAD)	ICCAD-IEEE ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design		English	Proceedings Paper	34th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)	NOV 02-06, 2015	IEEE Council Elect Design Automat, Austin, TX	IEEE, ACM, Assoc Comp Machinery, Assoc Comp Machinery SIGDA, IEEE Electron Devices Soc, Taiwan Minist Educ CAD Contest, IEEE Circuits & Syst Soc	IEEE Council Elect Design Automat		COMPUTER-INTERFACE; TECHNOLOGY; INTERNET; THINGS	Proliferation of internet-of-things (IoT) will lead to scenarios where humans will interact with and control a variety of networked devices including sensors and actuators. Wearable brain -machine interfaces (BMI) can be a key enabler of this interaction for people with disabilities and limited motor skills. At the same time, BAH can improve the experience of healthy individuals significantly. However, state-of-the-art BAH systems have limited applicability as they are prone to errors even with sophisticated machine learning algorithms used for classifying the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We improve the reliability of BAH communication significantly by proposing two techniques at higher abstraction layers. Our first contribution is a command confirmation protocol that protects the brain machine communication against false interpretations at run time. The second contribution is an off-line optimal event selection algorithm that identifies the most reliable subset of events supported by the target BMI system. The event selection is guided by novel user specific reliability metrics defined for the first time in this paper. Extensive experiments using a commercial BAH system demonstrate that the proposed techniques increase the communication robustness significantly, and reduce the time to complete a complex navigation task by 63% on average.

Comparative analysis of physiological signals and Electroencephalogram (EEG) for multimodal emotion recognition using generative models	2014 XIX SYMPOSIUM ON IMAGE, SIGNAL PROCESSING AND ARTIFICIAL VISION (STSIVA)	Symposium of Image, Signal Processing, and Artificial Vision		English	Proceedings Paper	XIX Symposium on Image, Signal Processing and Artificial Vision (STSIVA)	SEP 17-19, 2014	Armenia, COLOMBIA	Univ Quindio, Soc Colombiana Tratamiento Senales, IEEE Signal Proc Soc				Multimodal Emotion recognition (MER) is an application of machine learning were different biological signals are used in order to automatically classify a determined affective state. MER systems has been developed for different type of applications from psychological evaluation, anxiety assessment, human-machine interfaces and marketing. There are several spaces of classification proposed in the state of art for the emotion recognition task, the most known are discrete and dimensional spaces were the emotions are described in terms of some basic emotions and latent dimensions respectively. The use of dimensional spaces of classification allows a higher range of emotional states to be analyzed. The most common dimensional space used for this purpose is the Arousal/Valence space were emotions are described in terms of the intensity of the emotion that goes from inactive to active in the arousal dimension, and from unpleasant to pleasant in the valence dimension. The use of physiological signals and the EEG is well suited for emotion recognition due to the fact that an emotional states generates responses from different biological systems of the human body. Since the expression of an emotion is a dynamic process, we propose the use of generative models as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to capture de dynamics of the signals for further classification of emotional states in terms of arousal and valence. For the development of this work an international database for emotion classification known as Dataset for Emotion Analysis using Physiological signals (DEAP) is used. The objective of this work is to determine which of the physiological and EEG signals brings more relevant information in the emotion recognition task, several experiments using HMMs from different signals and combinations of them are performed, and the results shows that some of those signals brings more discrimination between arousal and valence levels as the EEG and the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and the Heart rate (HR).

Thirty-four patients with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy underwent chronic electrocorticography using subdural electrodes. The resection extent of cortices with maximum amplitude activities were compared between seizure outcome groups. In detected activity significantly related to seizure outcome, we analyzed waveforms with automated waveform amplitude analysis. Mann-Whitney U tests were used. Mean follow-up duration was 49.7 +/- 18.2 months. The resection extents of maximum amplitude activities in theta bands during the period between -10 and -5s from the ictal onset were significantly different between seizure outcome groups (adjusted p=0.01, the Benjamini-Hochberg correction). Delta, alpha and beta bands were related to seizure outcome only without multiple comparison corrections (unadjusted p = 0.02, 0.03 and 0.04). Waveform peak amplitudes greater than 200 mu V tended to be more common in the seizure free group than in the non-seizure-free group (unadjusted p= 0.06). Waveform peak amplitudes greater than 350 mu V were significantly more common in the cortical dysplasia type I group than in the hippocampal sclerosis group (unadjusted p= 0.03). The resection of theta band activities during the preictal period was most important for good seizure outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Basic knowledge about its impact on motor system oscillations and functional connectivity is however scarce. Specifically, a direct comparison between different feedback modalities and their neural signatures is missing. We assessed a neurofeedback training intervention of modulating beta-activity in circumscribed sensorimotor regions by kinesthetic motor imagery (MI). Right-handed healthy participants received two different feedback modalities contingent to their MI-associated brain activity in a cross-over design: (I) visual feedback with a brain-computer interface (BCI) and (II) proprioceptive feedback with a brain-robot interface (BRI) orthosis attached to the right hand. High-density electroencephalography was used to examine the reactivity of the corticalmotor system during the training session of each task by studying both local oscillatory power entrainment and distributed functional connectivity. Both feedback modalities activated a distributed functional connectivity network of coherent oscillations. A significantly higher skill and lower variability of self-controlled sensorimotor beta-bandmodulation could, however, be achieved in the BRI condition. This gain in controlling regional motor oscillations was accompanied by functional coupling of remote beta-band and theta-band activity in bilateral fronto-central regions and left parieto-occipital regions, respectively. The functional coupling of coherent theta-band oscillations correlated moreover with the skill of regional beta-modulation thus revealing a motor learning related network. Our findings indicate that proprioceptive feedback is more suitable than visual feedback to entrain the motor network architecture during the interplay between motor imagery and feedback processing thus resulting in better volitional control of regional brain activity.

We take inspiration from the recently introduced k-support norm, which has been successfully applied to sparse prediction problems with correlated features, but lacks any explicit structural constraints commonly found in machine learning and image processing. We address this problem by incorporating a total variation penalty in the k-support framework. We introduce the (k, s) support total variation norm as the tightest convex relaxation of the intersection of a set of sparsity and total variation constraints. We show that this norm leads to an intractable combinatorial graph optimization problem, which we prove to be NP-hard. We then introduce a tractable relaxation with approximation guarantees that scale well for grid structured graphs. We devise several first-order optimization strategies for statistical parameter estimation with the described penalty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this penalty on classification in the low-sample regime, classification with M/EEG neuroimaging data, and image recovery with synthetic and real data background subtracted image recovery tasks. We extensively analyse the application of our penalty on the complex task of identifying predictive regions from low-sample high-dimensional fMRI brain data, we show that our method is particularly useful compared to existing methods in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and stability.

Moreover, EEG datasets are often inherently multidimensional, comprising information in time, along different channels, subjects, trials, etc. Additional information may be conveyed by expanding the signal into even more dimensions, e.g. incorporating spectral features applying wavelet transform. The underlying sources might show differences in each of these modes. Therefore, tensor-based blind source separation techniques which can extract the sources of interest from such multiway arrays, simultaneously exploiting the signal characteristics in all dimensions, have gained increasing interest. Canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) has been successfully used to extract epileptic seizure activity from wavelet-transformed EEG data (Bioinformatics 23(13):i10-i18, 2007; NeuroImage 37:844-854, 2007), where each source is described by a rank-1 tensor, i.e. by the combination of one particular temporal, spectral and spatial signature. However, in certain scenarios, where the seizure pattern is nonstationary, such a trilinear signal model is insufficient. Here, we present the application of a recently introduced technique, called block term decomposition (BTD) to separate EEG tensors into rank- (L (r) ,L (r) ,1) terms, allowing to model more variability in the data than what would be possible with CPD. In a simulation study, we investigate the robustness of BTD against noise and different choices of model parameters. Furthermore, we show various real EEG recordings where BTD outperforms CPD in capturing complex seizure characteristics.

In this study, we perform a comparative analysis of different signal processing techniques for each BCI system stage concerning steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP), which includes: (1) feature extraction performed by different spectral methods (bank of filters, Welch's method and the magnitude of the short-time Fourier transform); (2) feature selection by means of an incremental wrapper, a filter using Pearson's method and a cluster measure based on the Davies-Bouldin index, in addition to a scenario with no selection strategy; (3) classification schemes using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM) and extreme learning machines (ELM). The combination of such methodologies leads to a representative and helpful comparative overview of robustness and efficiency of classical strategies, in addition to the characterization of a relatively new classification approach (defined by ELM) applied to the BCI-SSVEP systems.

Minimizing intra class variations in Multi-class Common Spatial Patterns for Motor Imagery EEG signals	2014 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS (ICIIS)			English	Proceedings Paper	9th Int Conf Ind Information Syst (ICIIS2014)	DEC 15-17, 2014	gwalior, INDIA	AB Vajpayee Indian Inst Information Techn Management		Common Spatial Patterns; Optimization; Brain Computer Interfaces	FILTERS	Brain Computer Interfaces have come a long way and have found practical use today. One of its major applications is controlling prosthetic devices for severely motor disabled patients. The Common Spatial Patterns is one the most efficient algorithms for extracting discriminative patterns for motor imagery tasks. The algorithm projects the data into a space where the discrimination between the classes is maximized. This algorithm is best suited for a two class paradigm. However, efficient algorithms for jointly approximately diagonalizing a set of matrices have made it possible to extend it to multi class problems. In this paper we use the QDIAG algorithm to approximately diagonalize variance matrices for more than two classes and our contribution to this is the optimization of the obtained filters so as to reduce the inter class dissimilarities for better discrimination. The results obtained show that this algorithm achieves better classification accuracies than other multi class feature extraction techniques.

Electroencephalographic Variation during End Maintenance and Emergence from Surgical Anesthesia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; RIGHTING REFLEX; THALAMOCORTICAL NEURONS; SPINDLE OSCILLATIONS; CONTROLLED INFUSION; SLEEP-DEPRIVATION; BISPECTRAL INDEX; SPECTRAL EDGE; WOMEN EMERGE; EEG CHANGES	The re-establishment of conscious awareness after discontinuing general anesthesia has often been assumed to be the inverse of loss of consciousness. This is despite the obvious asymmetry in the initiation and termination of natural sleep. In order to characterize the restoration of consciousness after surgery, we recorded frontal electroencephalograph (EEG) from 100 patients in the operating room during maintenance and emergence from general anesthesia. We have defined, for the first time, 4 steady-state patterns of anesthetic maintenance based on the relative EEG power in the slow-wave (<14 Hz) frequency bands that dominate sleep and anesthesia. Unlike single-drug experiments performed in healthy volunteers, we found that surgical patients exhibited greater electroencephalographic heterogeneity while re-establishing conscious awareness after drug discontinuation. Moreover, these emergence patterns could be broadly grouped according to the duration and rapidity of transitions amongst these slow-wave dominated brain states that precede awakening. Most patients progressed gradually from a pattern characterized by strong peaks of delta (0.5-4 Hz) and alpha/spindle (8-14 Hz) power ('Slow-Wave Anesthesia') to a state marked by low delta-spindle power ('Non Slow-Wave Anesthesia') before awakening. However, 31% of patients transitioned abruptly from Slow-Wave Anesthesia to waking; they were also more likely to express pain in the post-operative period. Our results, based on sleep-staging classification, provide the first systematized nomenclature for tracking brain states under general anesthesia from maintenance to emergence, and suggest that these transitions may correlate with post-operative outcomes such as pain.

A Real-Time Magnetoencephalography Brain-Computer Interface Using Interactive 3D Visualization and the Hadoop Ecosystem	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						brain-computer interface; massive data management; machine learning algorithms; magnetoencephalographic (MEG); electroencephalography (EEG); 3D visualization; Hadoop Ecosystem	SIGNAL; SPACE	Ecumenically, the fastest growing segment of Big Data is human biology-related data and the annual data creation is on the order of zetabytes. The implications are global across industries, of which the treatment of brain related illnesses and trauma could see the most significant and immediate effects. The next generation of health care IT and sensory devices are acquiring and storing massive amounts of patient related data. An innovative Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for interactive 3D visualization is presented utilizing the Hadoop Ecosystem for data analysis and storage. The BCI is an implementation of Bayesian factor analysis algorithms that can distinguish distinct thought actions using magneto encephalographic (MEG) brain signals. We have collected data on five subjects yielding 90% positive performance in MEG mid- and post-movement activity. We describe a driver that substitutes the actions of the BCI as mouse button presses for real-time use in visual simulations. This process has been added into a flight visualization demonstration. By thinking left or right, the user experiences the aircraft turning in the chosen direction. The driver components of the BCI can be compiled into any software and substitute a user's intent for specific keyboard strikes or mouse button presses. The BCI's data analytics of a subject's MEG brainwaves and flight visualization performance are stored and analyzed using the Hadoop Ecosystem as a quick retrieval data warehouse.

Many workplaces occupy themselves with the processing of electroencephalographic signals. They solve mainly the issues of the detection epileptic states, Brain Computer Interface, or the detection of evocated potentials initiated by various stimuli (the light, sound, movement, etc.). As the duration of the brain reaction to a given stimulus range within tens of milliseconds, it is necessary to record the event as precisely as possible. The main aim of this paper is to describe a universal device which is able to record external stimuli during the measurement of the electroencephalographic. The designed device contains of a set of sensors and can be used with different measurement systems. The main advantages of this system are the universality, the short reaction time and the ability of recording several stimuli simultaneously.

J	Zhang, JH; Yin, Z; Wang, RB				Zhang, Jianhua; Yin, Zhong; Wang, Rubin			Recognition of Mental Workload Levels Under Complex Human-Machine Collaboration by Using Physiological Features and Adaptive Support Vector Machines	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Classification; machine learning; man-machine system; mental workload (MWL); psychophysiology	OPERATOR FUNCTIONAL-STATE; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; SITUATION AWARENESS; MOVEMENT ARTIFACTS; CLASSIFICATION; AUTOMATION; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM; TASK; EEG	In order to detect human operator performance degradation or breakdown, this paper proposes an adaptive support vector machine-based method to classify operator mental workload (MWL) into few discrete levels based on psychophysiological measures. Electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, and electrooculography signals were recorded continuously while the operator was performing safety-critical process control operations in a simulated human-machine system. In coarse-grained analysis, the adaptive exponential smoothing (AES) technique is used to smooth the psychophysiological data and to remove strong artifacts without requiring templates. The MWL level is classified every 30 s by using bounded support vector machine (BSVM) and tenfold cross-validation techniques. Locality preservation projection (LPP) technique is utilized to derive salient psychophysiological features by means of feature reduction. By combining the AES-LPP and BSVM methods, the accuracy of the coarse-grained MWL classification was significantly improved by 11-13%. On the other hand, to perform MWL classification with higher temporal resolution and cross-subject and cross-trial generalizability, finer-grained data analysis is also conducted to recognize MWL levels every 5 s based on a combination of adaptive BSVM (ABSVM) and AES techniques. In comparison with the use of the BSVM algorithm alone, a significant performance improvement by 10-20% is achieved by using the AES-ABSVM method in the finer-grained MWL classification.

J	Ge, J; Zhang, GP				Ge, Jing; Zhang, Guoping			Novel images extraction model using improved delay vector variance feature extraction and multi-kernel neural network for EEG detection and prediction	TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Human Health and Medical Engineering (HHME)	DEC 07, 2014	Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA	Informat Technol & Ind Engn Res Ctr		Bioimage processing; epileptic seizures detection; nonlinearity; neural network	EPILEPTIC SEIZURES	BACKGROUND: Advanced intelligent methodologies could help detect and predict diseases from the EEG signals in cases the manual analysis is inefficient available, for instance, the epileptic seizures detection and prediction. This is because the diversity and the evolution of the epileptic seizures make it very difficult in detecting and identifying the undergoing disease. Fortunately, the determinism and nonlinearity in a time series could characterize the state changes. Literature review indicates that the Delay Vector Variance (DVV) could examine the nonlinearity to gain insight into the EEG signals but very limited work has been done to address the quantitative DVV approach. Hence, the outcomes of the quantitative DVV should be evaluated to detect the epileptic seizures. OBJECTIVE: To develop a new epileptic seizure detection method based on quantitative DVV. METHODS: This new epileptic seizure detection method employed an improved delay vector variance (IDVV) to extract the nonlinearity value as a distinct feature. Then a multi- kernel functions strategy was proposed in the extreme learning machine (ELM) network to provide precise disease detection and prediction. RESULTS: The nonlinearity is more sensitive than the energy and entropy. 87.5% overall accuracy of recognition and 75.0% overall accuracy of forecasting were achieved. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed IDVV and multi- kernel ELM based method was feasible and effective for epileptic EEG detection. Hence, the newly proposed method has importance for practical applications.

J	Boudewyn, MA				Boudewyn, Megan A.			Individual Differences in Language Processing: Electrophysiological Approaches	LANGUAGE AND LINGUISTICS COMPASS			English	Article							WORKING-MEMORY CAPACITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LEXICAL QUALITY; READING SKILL; COMPREHENSION; ATTENTION; MECHANISMS; RESOLUTION; KNOWLEDGE; CONTEXT	Language processing is a complex task that requires both specialized cognitive processes (e.g. speech decoding) and more general cognitive processes (e.g. working memory). Research on how individual differences in these processes influence language processing and comprehension has primarily relied on behavioral methods, such as reaction time measures, self-paced reading, and eye-tracking. However, a growing number of studies have used electrophysiological (EEG) techniques to study individual differences in language processing. EEG and event-related potential (ERP) methods provide a unique link between neural activity and cognitive processing and can be used to draw specific inferences about the neural basis of language processing and its variability. The primary goal of this paper is to showcase EEG/ERP studies that have made significant contributions to the study of individual differences in how the brain processes language, over and above what would be possible using behavioral methods alone. A secondary goal of this paper is to highlight several methodological issues specific to research on individual differences in language processing and identify ways in which EEG/ERP studies can take advantage of what has been learned from previous research to minimize these issues.

This extensive study in seizure prediction considers the 278 patients from the European Epilepsy Database, collected in three epilepsy centres: Hopital Pitie-la-Salpetriere, Paris, France; Universitatsklinikum Freiburg, Germany; Centro Hospitalar e Universitario de Coimbra, Portugal. For a considerable number of patients it was possible to find a patient specific predictor with an acceptable performance, as for example predictors that anticipate at least half of the seizures with a rate of false alarms of no more than 1 in 6 h (0.15 h(-1)). We observed that the epileptic focus localization, data sampling frequency, testing duration, number of seizures in testing, type of machine learning, and preictal time influence significantly the prediction performance. The results allow to face optimistically the feasibility of a patient specific prospective alarming system, based on machine learning techniques by considering the combination of several univariate (single-channel) electroencephalogram features. We envisage that this work will serve as benchmark data that will be of valuable importance for future studies based on the European Epilepsy Database. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Chen, SW; Lai, YC				Chen, Szi-Wen; Lai, Yeh-Chi			A signal-processing-based technique for P300 evoked potential detection with the applications into automated character recognition	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Brain computer interface (BCI); Electroencephalogram (EEG); Evoked potentials; Linear discriminant function (LDF); P300	MENTAL PROSTHESIS; MOTOR IMAGERY; BRAIN; DEVICE; BCI	In the past decade, many researchers have dedicated their efforts to exploring brain computer interface (BCI) technology. With a growing number of investigations into the BCI and its related areas, BCI systems nowadays are not only developed for the disabled but also for the normal and healthy people. In this paper, a signal-processing-based technique with its applications into the development of automated character recognition is introduced. The task of the pattern recognition to such a BCI design problem was mainly accomplished based on the detection of P300 evoked potentials. We approached this detection problem by employing a template-matching-based method to extract the morphological information from EEG signals first, and then applying a linear discriminant function (LDF) to the features selected for pattern classification. The entire detection process was further implemented on an existing BCI system platform, called the BCI2000 system. The algorithm performance was evaluated using an existing reliable database provided by BCI Competition 2003. Numerical experimental results produced by the database indicated that the proposed algorithm actually achieved 100% character recognition accuracy.

We manually labeled 3,277 documents as describing one or more seizures vs no seizures, and as describing epileptiform discharges vs no epileptiform discharges. We then used Naive Bayes to develop a system able to automatically classify EEG reports into these categories. Our system consisted of normalization techniques, extraction of key sentences, and automated feature selection using cross validation. As candidate features we used key words and special word patterns called elastic word sequences (EWS). Final feature selection was accomplished via sequential backward selection. We used cross validation to predict out of sample performance. Our automated feature selection procedure resulted in a classifier with 38 features for seizure detection, and 23 features for epileptiform discharge detection. The average [95% CI] area under the receiver operating curve was 99.05 [98.79, 99.32]% for detecting reports with seizures, and 96.15 [92.31, 100.00]% for detecting reports with epileptiform discharges. The methodology described herein greatly reduces the manual labor involved in identifying large cohorts of patients for retrospective neurophysiological studies of patients with epilepsy.

The cure for epilepsy is surgery and medication. Some patients are not cured with surgery and medicine. One third of the cases still remain with unrestrained epilepsy. There is an existing need of constant monitoring for epileptic seizures in this kind of cases. Treatment can be better provided by the doctors if seizure or any atypical brain activity is predicted before its happening or preventive measures can be taken by the patients themselves also if occurrence of the seizure is predicted beforehand. In inter-ictal and postictal periods brain behaves normally. In case of epilepsy, long time EEG recording are essential from days to week. This ultimately reside the patients in the hospital for too many days. Our proposed methodology is on the way to predict the epileptic seizure prior to its occurrence and administer the brain abnormality in real time. There is no such epileptic seizure prediction algorithm using EEG for clinical applications. Our aim is to learn and develop a good epileptic seizure prediction method/algorithm using scalp EEG i.e. noninvasive approach or by using HVR. The proposed pattern detection approach to be used in real time monitoring for patients of epilepsy has great potential and it can be helpful in civilizing the quality of life of the patients. This paper is to review the current state of research and to compare the performance of different algorithms for real-time classification of electroencephalogram signals and the seizure prediction.

Many BCIs are "synchronous'' systems, in which the system sets the timing of the interaction and tries to infer what control command the subject is issuing at each prompting. In contrast, in "asynchronous'' BCIs subjects pace the interaction and the system must determine when the subject's control command occurs. In this paper we propose a new idea for BCI which draws upon the strengths of both approaches. The subjects are externally paced and the BCI is able to determine when control commands are issued by decoding the subject's intention for initiating control in dedicated time slots. A single task with randomly interleaved trials was designed to test whether it can be used as stimulus for inducing initiation and non-initiation states when the sensory and motor requirements for the two types of trials are very nearly identical. Further, the essential problem on the discrimination between initiation state and non-initiation state was studied. We tested the ability of EEG spectral power to distinguish between these two states. Among the four standard EEG frequency bands, beta band power recorded over parietal-occipital cortices provided the best performance, achieving an average accuracy of 86% for the correct classification of initiation and non-initiation states. Moreover, delta band power recorded over parietal and motor areas yielded a good performance and thus could also be used as an alternative feature to discriminate these two mental states. The results demonstrate the viability of our proposed idea for a BCI design based on conventional EEG features. Our proposal offers the potential to mitigate the signal detection challenges of fully asynchronous BCIs, while providing greater flexibility to the subject than traditional synchronous BCIs.

Prior to onset in adolescence or young adulthood a prodromal period of abnormal symptoms lasting weeks to years has been identified and operationalized as clinically high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia. However, only a minority of subjects prospectively identified with CHR convert to schizophrenia, thereby limiting enthusiasm for early intervention(s). This study utilized objective resting electroencephalogram (EEG) quantification to determine whether CHR constitutes a cohesive entity and an evoked potential to assess CHR cortical auditory processing. Methods: This study constitutes an EEG-based quantitative neurophysiological comparison between two unmedicated subject groups: 35 neurotypical controls (CON) and 22 CHR patients. After artifact management, principal component analysis (PCA) identified EEG spectral and spectral coherence factors described by associated loading patterns. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) determined factors' discrimination success between subjects in the CON and CHR groups. Loading patterns on DFA-selected factors described CHR-specific spectral and coherence differences when compared to controls. The frequency modulated auditory evoked response (FMAER) explored functional CON-CHR differences within the superior temporal gyri. Results: Variable reduction by PCA identified 40 coherence-based factors explaining 77.8 % of the total variance and 40 spectral factors explaining 95.9 % of the variance. DFA demonstrated significant CON-CHR group difference (P < 0.00001) and successful jackknifed subject classification (CON, 85.7 %; CHR, 86.4 % correct). The population distribution plotted along the canonical discriminant variable was clearly bimodal. Coherence factors delineated loading patterns of altered connectivity primarily involving the bilateral posterior temporal electrodes. However, FMAER analysis showed no CON-CHR group differences. Conclusions: CHR subjects form a cohesive group, significantly separable from CON subjects by EEG-derived indices. Symptoms of CHR may relate to altered connectivity with the posterior temporal regions but not to primary auditory processing abnormalities within these regions.

We show that the proposed features are theoretically rigorously supported, as well as capture the sleep information hidden inside the signals. The features are used as input to multiclass support vector machines with the radial basis function to automatically classify sleep stages. The effectiveness of the classification based on the proposed features is shown to be comparable to human expert classification-the proposed classification of awake, REM, N1, N2, and N3 sleeping stages based on the respiratory signal (resp. respiratory and EEG signals) has the overall accuracy 81.7% (resp. 89.3%) in the relatively normal subject group. In addition, by examining the combination of the respiratory signal with the electroencephalographic signal, we conclude that the respiratory signal consists of ample sleep information, which supplements to the information stored in the electroencephalographic signal.

As we move through an environment, we are constantly making assessments, judgments and decisions about the things we encounter. Some are acted upon immediately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions-our implicit 'labeling' of the world. In this paper, we use physiological correlates of this labeling to construct a hybrid brain-computer interface (hBCI) system for efficient navigation of a 3D environment. Approach. First, we record electroencephalographic (EEG), saccadic and pupillary data from subjects as they move through a small part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate the neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective interest to them. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using semi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to the labeled ones. Finally, the system plots an efficient route to help the subjects visit the 'similar' objects it identifies. Main results. We show that by exploiting the subjects' implicit labeling to find objects of interest instead of exploring naively, the median search precision is increased from 25% to 97%, and the median subject need only travel 40% of the distance to see 84% of the objects of interest. We also find that the neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers' inference of subjects' implicit labeling. Significance. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of objects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting in an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user's interests.

Identifying, detecting and adapting learning algorithms to non-stationary environments is a fundamental task in many data mining scenarios; however it is often a major challenge for current methodologies. Data analysis in the context of time-varying statistical moments is a very active research direction in machine learning and in computational statistics; but theoretical insights into latent causes of non-stationarity in empirical data are very scarce. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of the trajectory classification error statistic in order to detect a significant variation in the underlying dynamics of data collected in multiple stages. We analysed qualitatively the conditions leading to observable changes in non-stationary data generated by Duffing nonlinear oscillators; which are ubiquitous models of complex classification problems. Analyses are further benchmarked in a dataset consisting of atmospheric pollutants time series.

Looking for a face in the crowd: Fixation-related potentials in an eye-movement visual search task	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Visual search; EEG; Faces; Natural scenes; Oddball	SINGLE-TRIAL; SACCADE GENERATION; BRAIN POTENTIALS; LAMBDA WAVES; EEG; MODEL; BLINK; P300; TOPOGRAPHY; COMPONENTS	Despite the compelling contribution of the study of event related potentials (ERPs) and eye movements to cognitive neuroscience, these two approaches have largely evolved independently. We designed an eye-movement visual search paradigm that allowed us to concurrently record EEG and eye movements while subjects were asked to find a hidden target face in a crowded scene with distractor faces. Fixation event-related potentials (fERPs) to target and distractor stimuli showed the emergence of robust sensory components associated with the perception of stimuli and cognitive components associated with the detection of target faces. We compared those components with the ones obtained in a control task at fixation: qualitative similarities as well as differences in terms of scalp topography and latency emerged between the two. By using single trial analyses, fixations to target and distractors could be decoded from the EEG signals above chance level in 11 out of 12 subjects.

Common spatial pattern (CSP) is an effective algorithm for feature extraction in motor imagery based BCI systems. However, many studies have proved that the performance of CSP depends heavily on the frequency band of EEG signals used for the construction of covariance matrices. The use of different frequency bands to extract signal features may lead to different classification performances, which are determined by the discriminative and complementary information they contain. In this study, the broad frequency band (8-30 Hz) is divided into 10 sub-bands of band width 4 Hz and overlapping 2 Hz. Binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) is used to find the best sub-band set to improve the performance of CSP and subsequent classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved an average improvement of 6.91% in cross-validation accuracy when compared to broad band CSP.

In the proposed system, we utilize a filter bank and sub-band common spatial pattern (SBCSP) to extract features from raw EEG data. A self-organizing neural fuzzy inference network (SONFIN) is then applied for a recognition task. In order to improve the classification performance, we form a committee of networks and employ fuzzy integral (FI) to attain a joint decision. To further optimize the fusion approaches, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is exploited to globally update parameters used in the fusion stage. In consequence, our experimental result shows that the proposed fuzzy fusion system possesses superior performance compared to other comparative models.

Among proven devices such as fmgerprint readers and cameras that can sense the human eye's iris pattern, we introduced a number of users to a sequence of 'grandmother images', or emotionally evoked stimuli-response images from other users, as well as one of their own, for the purpose of authentication. We performed testing and evaluation of the Authenticity Privacy and Security (APS) brainwave biometrics, similar to the internal organ of the human eye's iris which cannot easily be altered. 'Aha' recognition through stimulus-response habituation can serve as a biomarker, similar to keystroke dynamics analysis for inter and intra key fluctuation time of a memorized PIN number (FIST). Using a non-tethered Electroencephalogram (EEG) wireless smartphone/pc monitor interface, we explore the appropriate stimuli-response biomarker present in DTAB low frequency group waves. Prior to login, the user is shown a series of images on a computer display. They have been primed to click their mouse when the image is presented. DTAB waves are collected with a wireless EEG and are sent via Smartphone to a cloud based processing infrastructure. There, we measure fluctuations in DTAB waves from a wireless, non-tethered, single node EEG device between the Personal Graphic Image Number (PGIN) stimulus image and the response time from an individual's mental performance baseline. We hope Higher Order Statistics (HOS) in typing and PGIN can reveal intrinsic personal traits/habits and increase EEG specificity through stimulus-response neuro-biomarkers. Towards that goal, we describe an infrastructure that supports distributed verification for web-based EEG authentication. The performance of machine learning on the relative Power Spectral Density EEG data may uncover features required for subsequent access to web or media content. Our approach provides a scalable framework wrapped into a robust Neuro-Informatics toolkit, viable for use in the Biomedical and mental health communities, as well as numerous consumer applications.

In this study, a simulated driving environment was implemented to study the neural correlation of braking intention in diverse driving situations. We further investigated to what extent these neural correlates can be used to detect a participant's braking intention prior to the behavioral response. A feature combination method was proposed for the enhancement of detection performance and additional classification of emergency braking triggered by stimuli and voluntary braking. It consists of event-related potential (ERP), readiness potential (RP), and event-related desynchronization (ERD) features. Fifteen participants drove a virtual vehicle and were exposed to the diversified traffic situations in the constructed simulator framework, while technical signals (i.e., gas pedal and brake pedal), electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals were measured. After that, the neural correlation of the measured signals was analyzed. The proposed framework shows excellent detection performance for various kinds of driver's braking intention. Our study suggests that a driver's braking intention is characterized by specific neural patterns of sensory perception and processing, as well as motor preparation and execution, which can be utilized by smart vehicle technology.

However, objective and quantitative outcome measures assessing cognitive workload have not been standardized for HMI research. The present study examines the efficacy of a simple event-related potential (ERP) measure of cortical effort during myoelectric control of a virtual limb for use as an outcome tool. Participants trained and tested on two methods of control, direct control (DC) and pattern recognition control (PRC), while electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded. Eighteen healthy participants with intact limbs were tested using DC and PRC under three conditions: passive viewing, easy, and hard. Novel auditory probes were presented at random intervals during testing, and significant task-difficulty effects were observed in the P200, P300, and a late positive potential (LPP), supporting the efficacy of ERPs as a cognitive workload measure in HMI tasks. LPP amplitude distinguished DC from PRC in the hard condition with higher amplitude in PRC, consistent with lower cognitive workload in PRC relative to DC for complex movements. Participants completed trials faster in the easy condition using DC relative to PRC, but completed trials more slowly using DC relative to PRC in the hard condition. The results provide promising support for ERPs as an outcome measure for cognitive workload in HMI research such as prosthetics, exoskeletons, and other assistive devices, and can be used to evaluate and guide new technologies for more intuitive HMI control.

Methods: Selected EEGs recorded in patients over 1 year old were classified into four groups: A. Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) with intermixed electrical seizures. B. PLEDs without seizures. C. Electrical seizures and no PLEDs. D. No PLEDs or seizures. Recordings were analyzed by the Persyst P12 software, and compared to the raw EEG, interpreted by two experienced neurophysiologists; Positive percent agreement (PPA) and false-positive rates/hour (FPR) were calculated. Results: We assessed 98 recordings (Group A = 21 patients; B = 29, C = 17, D = 31). Total duration was 82.7 h (median: 1 h); containing 268 seizures. The software detected 204 (= 76.1%) seizures; all ictal events were captured in 29/38 (76.3%) patients; in only in 3 (7.7%) no seizures were detected. Median PPA was 100% (range 0-100; interquartile range 50-100), and the median FPR 0/h (range 0-75.8; interquartile range 0-4.5); however, lower performances were seen in the groups containing periodic discharges. Conclusion: This analysis provides data regarding the yield of the ASD in a particularly difficult subset of EEG recordings, showing that periodic discharges may bias the results. Significance: Ongoing refinements in this technique might enhance its utility and lead to a more extensive application. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Recently, considerable research has been conducted in order to potentially automate signal classification for assisting in disease diagnosis. However, the biosignal type (ECG, EEG, EMG or other) needs to be known prior to the classification process. If the given biosignal is of an unknown type, none of the existing methodologies can be utilized. In this paper, a blind biosignal classification model ((BSC)-S-2 Model) is proposed in order to identify the source biosignal type automatically, and thus ultimately benefit the diagnostic decision. The approach employs time series algorithms for constructing the model. It uses a dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm with clustering to discover the similarity between two biosignals, and consequently classifies disease without prior knowledge of the source signal type. The empirical experiments presented in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the method as well as the scalability of the approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Muldner, K; Burleson, W				Muldner, Kasia; Burleson, Winslow			Utilizing sensor data to model students' creativity in a digital environment	COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Creativity; Student modeling; Eye tracking; EEG; Skin conductance; Intelligent Tutoring Systems	POSITIVE AFFECT; EMOTION; EYE; CATEGORIZATION; MOTIVATION; KNOWLEDGE; THINKING; SUPPORT; SYSTEMS; AGENT	While creativity is essential for developing students' broad expertise in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields, many students struggle with various aspects of being creative. Digital technologies have the unique opportunity to support the creative process by (1) recognizing elements of students' creativity, such as when creativity is lacking (modeling step), and (2) providing tailored scaffolding based on that information (intervention step). However, to date little work exists on either of these aspects. Here, we focus on the modeling step. Specifically, we explore the utility of various sensing devices, including an eye tracker, a skin conductance bracelet, and an EEG sensor, for modeling creativity during an educational activity, namely geometry proof generation. We found reliable differences in sensor features characterizing low vs. high creativity students. We then applied machine learning to build classifiers that achieved good accuracy in distinguishing these two student groups, providing evidence that sensor features are valuable for modeling creativity.

J	Rehbaum, H; Farina, D				Rehbaum, Hubertus; Farina, Dario			Adaptive common average filtering for myocontrol applications	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						EMG; Signal processing; Noise reduction; Adaptive filter; Myocontrol	SURFACE-EMG; CROSS-TALK; EEG	The use of electromyography (EMG) for the control of upper-limb prostheses has received great interest in neurorehabilitation engineering since decades. Important advances have been performed in the development of machine learning algorithms for myocontrol. This paper describes a novel adaptive filter for EMG preprocessing to be applied as conditioning stage for optimal subsequent information extraction. The aim of this filter is to improve both the quality (signal-to-noise ratio) and the selectivity of the EMG recordings. The filter is based on the classic common average reference (CAR), often used in EEG processing. However, while CAR is stationary, the proposed filter, which is referred to as adaptive common average reference (ACAR), is signal-dependent and its spatial transfer function is adapted over time. The ACAR filter is evaluated in this study for noise reduction and selectivity. Furthermore, it is proven that its application improves the performance of both pattern recognition and regression methods for myoelectric control. It is concluded that the proposed novel filter for EMG conditioning is a useful preprocessing tool in myocontrol applications.

Reduced Overhead Error Compensation for Energy Efficient Machine Learning Kernels	2015 IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN (ICCAD)	ICCAD-IEEE ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design		English	Proceedings Paper	34th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)	NOV 02-06, 2015	IEEE Council Elect Design Automat, Austin, TX	IEEE, ACM, Assoc Comp Machinery, Assoc Comp Machinery SIGDA, IEEE Electron Devices Soc, Taiwan Minist Educ CAD Contest, IEEE Circuits & Syst Soc	IEEE Council Elect Design Automat		DESIGN	Low overhead error -resiliency techniques such as RAZOR [1] and algorithmic noise -tolerance (ANT) [2] have proven effective in reducing energy consumption. ANT has been shown to be particularly effective for signal processing and machine learning kernels. In ANT, an explicit estimator block compensates for large magnitude errors in a main block. The estimator represents the overhead in ANT and can be as large as 30%. This paper presents a low overhead ANT technique referred to as ALG-ANT. In ALG-ANT, the estimator is embedded inside the main block via algorithmic reformulation and thus completely eliminates the overhead associated with ANT. However, ALG-ANT is algorithm -specific. This paper demonstrates the ALG-ANT concept in the context of a finite impulse response (FIR) filter kernel and a dot product kernel, both of which are commonly employed in signal processing and machine learning applications. The proposed ALG-ANT FIR filter and dot product kernels are applied to the feature extractor (FE) and SVM classification engine (CE) of an EEG seizure classification system. Simulation results in a commercial 45 nm CMOS process show that ALGANT can compensate for error rates of up to 0.41 (errors in FE only), and up to 0.19 (errors in FE and CE) and maintain the true positive rate ptp > 0.9 and false positive rate pfp < 0.01. This represents a greater than 3 -orders -of -magnitude improvement in error tolerance over the conventional architecture. This error tolerance is employed to reduce energy via the use of voltage overscaling (VOS). ALG-ANT is able to achieve 44.3% energy savings when errors are in FE only, and up to 37.1% savings when errors are in both FE and CE.

Specifically, it focuses on a decoder based on the event-related (de) synchronization (ERD/ERS) of the sensorimotor area. The EEG experiment, performed with healthy subjects, is structured as a 3 x 2 factorial design, consisting of two factors: "finger tapping task" and "leg condition." The former is divided into three levels (BMI classes), being left hand finger tapping, right hand finger tapping and no movement (Idle); while the latter is composed by two levels: leg perturbed (Pert) and leg not perturbed (NoPert). Specifically, the subjects' leg was periodically perturbed by an assistive robot in 5 out of 10 sessions of the experiment and not moved in the remaining sessions. The aim of this study is to verify that the decoding performance of the finger tapping task is comparable between the two conditions NoPert and Pert. Accordingly, a classifier is trained to output the class of the finger tapping, given as input the features associated with the ERD/ERS. Individually for each subject, the decoding performance is statistically compared between the NoPert and Pert conditions. Results show that the decoding performance is notably above chance, for all the subjects, under both conditions. Moreover, the statistical comparison do not highlight a significant difference between NoPert and Pert in any subject, which is confirmed by feature visualization.

Learning to decode human emotions from event-related potentials	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Affective computing; Emotion valence recognition; Feature reduction; Clustering; Event-related potentials (ERPs)	AROUSAL; FEARFUL	Reported works on electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition systems generally employ the principles of supervised learning to build subject-dependent (single/intra-subject) models. Building subject-independent (multiple/inter-subject) models is a harder problem due to the EEG data variability between subjects. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide a framework for selection of a small number of basic temporal features, event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes, and latencies that are sufficiently robust to discriminate emotion states across multiple subjects. Second, we test comparatively the feasibility of six standard unsupervised (clustering) techniques to build intra-subject and inter-subject models to discriminate emotion valence in the ERPs collected while subjects were viewing high arousal images with positive or negative emotional content.

Methods: Three neurophysiologists reviewed the reported findings of the first 30 minutes of 118 cEEGs, then used CSA to guide subsequent review ("CSA-guided review" protocol). Reviewers viewed 120 seconds of raw EEG data surrounding suspicious CSA segments. The same neurophysiologists performed independent page-by-page visual interpretation ("conventional review") of all cEEGs. Independent conventional review by 2 additional, more experienced neurophysiologists served as a gold standard. We compared review times and detection rates for seizures and other pathologic patterns relative to conventional review. Results: A total of 2,092 hours of cEEG data were reviewed. Average times to review 24 hours of cEEG data were 8 (+/- 4) minutes for CSA-guided review vs 38 (+/- 17) minutes for conventional review (p < 0.005). Studies containing seizures required longer review: 10 (+/- 4) minutes for CSA-guided review vs 44 (+/- 20) minutes for conventional review (p < 0.005). CSA-guided review was sensitive for seizures (87.3%), periodic epileptiform discharges (100%), rhythmic delta activity (97.1%), focal slowing (98.7%), generalized slowing (100%), and epileptiform discharges (88.5%). Conclusions: CSA-guided review reduces cEEG review time by 78% with minimal loss of sensitivity compared with conventional review. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence that screening of cEEG with CSAs efficiently and accurately identifies seizures and other EEG abnormalities as compared with standard cEEG visual interpretation.

This concept can be extended to complex motor tasks by decoding the type of the attempted movement in a multi-class BCI. Therefore, the objective of this study was to detect movements from real-time EEG and classify two movement types associated with the movement kinetics. EEG traces corresponding to executed and imagined movements of 12 healthy subjects and attempted movements of six stroke patients were detected using a template matching technique. Signal segments were characterized by six features and classified with a support vector machine. The system correctly detected and classified 57 +/- 3%, 53 +/- 6%, and 47 +/- 7% of the executed, imaginary, and attempted movements, respectively. The performance of the detector was +/- 80%, and the classifier performance was in the range 63-70%. There were on average 1.6-1.9 false positive detections per minute. The results indicate that it is possible to detect executed, imaginary, and attempted movements in real time and classify movement kinetics. With improved performance, this could potentially be combined with functional electrical stimulation to promote neurorehabilitation by providing meaningful afferent feedback according to the attempted task.

Owing to the inherent difficulties in EEG signal processing and neural decoding, many of the feature extraction algorithms are complex and computationally demanding. Presently, software does exist to perform real-time feature extraction and classification of EEG signals. However, the requirement of a personal computer is a major obstacle in bringing these technologies to the home and mobile user affording ease of use. We present the FPGA design and novel architecture of a generalized platform that provides a set of predefined features and preprocessing steps that can be configured by a user for BCI applications. The preprocessing steps include power line noise cancellation and baseline removal while the feature set includes a combination of linear and nonlinear, univariate and bivariate measures commonly utilized in BCIs. We provide a comparison of our results with software and also validate the platform by implementing a seizure detection algorithm on a standard dataset and obtained a classification accuracy of over 96%. A gradual transition of BCI systems to hardware would prove beneficial in terms of compactness, power consumption and much faster response to stimuli.	[Wijesinghe, L. P.; Wickramasuriya, D.

In reality BMIs are very complex devices and only recently the increase in computing power of microprocessors enabled a boom in BMI research that continues almost unabated to this date, the high point being the insertion of electrode arrays into the brains of 5 human patients in a clinical trial run by Cyberkinetics with few other clinical tests still in progress. Meanwhile several EEG-based BMI devices (non-invasive BMIs) were launched commercially. Modern electronics and dry electrode technology made possible to drive the cost of some of these devices below few hundred dollars. However, the initial excitement of the direct control by brain waves of a computer or other equipment is dampened by large efforts required for learning, high error rates and slow response speed. All these problems are directly related to low information transfer rates typical for such EEG-based BMIs. In invasive BMIs employing multiple electrodes inserted into the brain one may expect much higher information transfer rates than in EEG-based BMIs because, in theory, each electrode provides an independent information channel. However, although invasive BMIs require more expensive equipment and have ethical problems related to the need to insert electrodes in the live brain, such financial and ethical costs are often not offset by a dramatic improvement in the information transfer rate. Thus the main topic of this review is why in invasive BMIs an apparently much larger information content obtained with multiple extracellular electrodes does not translate into much higher rates of information transfer? This paper explores possible answers to this question by concluding that more research on what movement parameters are encoded by neurons in motor cortex is needed before we can enjoy the next generation BMIs.

Both conventional manual and automatic sleep-wakefulness scoring are rule based tasks which use brain waves measured by Electroencephalogram (EEG) and activity detected by Electromyography (EMG) of skeletal muscles. Several works have been conducted trying to provide an automatic sleep-scoring system on the basis of machine learning methods. In this study we try to understand the reasons behind the complexity of this problem and we emphasize the importance of normalization procedure that leads to a better stage discrimination comparing different classification methods.

J	Postle, BR				Postle, Bradley R.			The cognitive neuroscience of visual short-term memory	CURRENT OPINION IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES			English	Review								Our understanding of the neural bases of visual short-term memory (STM), the ability to mentally retain information over short periods of time, is being reshaped by two important developments: the application of methods from statistical machine learning, often a variant of multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalographic (EEG) data sets; and advances in our understanding of the physiology and functions of neuronal oscillations. One consequence is that many commonly observed physiological 'signatures' that have previously been interpreted as directly related to the retention of information in visual STM may require reinterpretation as more general, state-related changes that can accompany cognitive-task performance. Another is important refinements of theoretical models of visual STM.

Moving Brain-Controlled Devices Outside the Lab: Principles and Applications	RECENT PROGRESS IN BRAIN AND COGNITIVE ENGINEERING	Trends in Augmentation of Human Performance		English	Article; Book Chapter						Brain-computer interface; Shared control; Hybrid control; Motor imagery; Error potentials; Cognitive states; Spelling; Telepresence robot; Car driving	COMPUTER INTERFACES; MOTOR IMAGERY; COMMUNICATION; POTENTIALS; PEOPLE; STROKE; BCI; NEUROPROSTHESES; CLASSIFICATION; WHEELCHAIR	This chapter provides an overview of the functionality and the underlying principles of the brain-computer interfaces (BCI) developed by the Chair in Non-Invasive Brain-Machine Interface (CNBI) of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), as well as exemplary applications where those have been successfully evaluated. Our laboratory mainly develops non-invasive BCI systems based on electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and, thus, devoid of medical hazards, real-time, portable, relatively low-cost and minimally obtrusive. Our research is pushing forward asynchronous paradigms offering a spontaneous, user-driven and largely ecological interaction. Furthermore, we stand on the machine-learningway to BCI with emphasis on personalization, configurability and adaptability, coupled with mutual learning training protocols, so that elaborate signal processing and pattern recognition methods are optimally combined with the user's learnable modulation of brain signals towards high and robust performances and universal usability. Additionally, cognitive mental state monitoring is employed to shape or refine the interaction. Shared-control approaches allow smart, context-aware robotics to complement the BCI channel for more fine-grained control and reduction of the user's mental workload. Last but not least, hybrid BCI designs exploit additional physiological signals to augment the BCI modality and enrich the control paradigm, thus also exploiting potential residual capabilities of disabled end-users. The applicability and effectiveness of the aforementioned principles is hereby demonstrated in four exemplary applications evaluated with both able-bodied and motor-disabled end-users. These applications include a hybrid, motor imagery (MI)-based speller, a telepresence robot equipped with shared-control, cognitive mental state monitoring paradigms able to recognize and correct errors, and, finally, a car driving application where a passive BCI enabled on a smart car assists towards increased safety and improved driving experience. Remarkably, our results show that the performance of end-users with disabilities was similar to that of a group of healthy users, who were more familiar with the experiment and the environment. This demonstrates that end-users are able to successfully use BCI technology.

Currently, most BCI systems are synchronous. They rely on cues or tasks to which a subject has to react In order to design an asynchronous BCI one needs to be able to robustly detect an idle class. In this study, we examine whether multi-modal neuroimaging, based on simultaneous EEG and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements, can assist in the robust detection of the idle class within a sensory motor rhythm-based BCI paradigm. We propose two types of subject-dependent classification strategies to combine the information of both modalities. Our results demonstrate that not only idle-state decoding can be significantly improved by exploiting the complementary information of multi-modal recordings, but also it is possible to minimize the delay of the system, caused by the slow inherent hemodynamic response of the NIRS signal.

Detection of the onset of upper-limb movements based on the combined analysis of changes in the sensorimotor rhythms and slow cortical potentials	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						electroencephalography; voluntary movement; stroke; bereitcshaftspotential; event-related desynchronization	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EVENT-RELATED DESYNCHRONIZATION; HUMAN VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; MOTOR IMAGERY; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; INTENTION; NEUROPROSTHESIS; SYSTEM	Objective. Characterizing the intention to move by means of electroencephalographic activity can be used in rehabilitation protocols with patients' cortical activity taking an active role during the intervention. In such applications, the reliability of the intention estimation is critical both in terms of specificity 'number of misclassifications' and temporal accuracy. Here, a detector of the onset of voluntary upper-limb reaching movements based on the cortical rhythms and the slow cortical potentials is proposed. The improvement in detections due to the combination of these two cortical patterns is also studied. Approach. Upper-limb movements and cortical activity were recorded in healthy subjects and stroke patients performing self-paced reaching movements. A logistic regression combined the output of two classifiers: (i) a naive Bayes classifier trained to detect the event-related desynchronization preceding the movement onset and (ii) a matched filter detecting the bereitschaftspotential. The proposed detector was compared with the detectors by using each one of these cortical patterns separately. In addition, differences between the patients and healthy subjects were analysed. Main results. On average, 74.5 +/- 13.8% and 82.2 +/- 10.4% of the movements were detected with 1.32 +/- 0.87 and 1.50 +/- 1.09 false detections generated per minute in the healthy subjects and the patients, respectively. A significantly better performance was achieved by the combined detector (as compared to the detectors of the two cortical patterns separately) in terms of true detections (p = 0.099) and false positives (p = 0.0083). Significance. A rationale is provided for combining information from cortical rhythms and slow cortical potentials to detect the onsets of voluntary upper-limb movements. It is demonstrated that the two cortical processes supply complementary information that can be summed up to boost the performance of the detector. Successful results have been also obtained with stroke patients, which supports the use of the proposed system in brain-computer interface applications with this group of patients.

Participants responded to a middle target letter flanked by compatible or incompatible flankers. The target was surrounded by a small or large circular cue which was presented simultaneously or 500 ms prior. Poor decoders showed a greater RT cost for incompatible stimuli preceded by large cues and less RT benefit for compatible stimuli. Poor decoders also showed reduced modulation of ERPs by cue-size at left hemisphere posterior sites (N1) and by flanker compatibility at right hemisphere posterior sites (N1) and frontal sites (N2), consistent with processing differences in fronto-parietal attention networks. These findings have potential implications for understanding the relationship between spatial attention and phonological decoding in dyslexia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Yaghouby, F; Sunderam, S				Yaghouby, Farid; Sunderam, Sridhar			Quasi-supervised scoring of human sleep in polysomnograms using augmented input variables	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Automatic sleep scoring; Supervised; Unsupervised; Quasi-supervised; EEG; PSG; Hidden Markov model; Gaussian mixture	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; AGREEMENT; SYSTEM	The limitations of manual sleep scoring make computerized methods highly desirable. Scoring errors can arise from human rater uncertainty or inter-rater variability. Sleep scoring algorithms either come as supervised classifiers that need scored samples of each state to be trained, or as unsupervised classifiers that use heuristics or structural clues in unscored data to define states. We propose a quasi-supervised classifier that models observations in an unsupervised manner but mimics a human rater wherever training scores are available. EEG, EMG, and EOG features were extracted in 30s epochs from human-scored polysomnograms recorded from 42 healthy human subjects (18-79 years) and archived in an anonymized, publicly accessible database. Hypnograms were modified so that: 1. Some states are scored but not others; 2. Samples of all states are scored but not for transitional epochs; and 3. Two raters with 67% agreement are simulated. A framework for quasi-supervised classification was devised in which unsupervised statistical models-specifically Gaussian mixtures and hidden Markov models-are estimated from unlabeled training data, but the training samples are augmented with variables whose values depend on available scores. Classifiers were fitted to signal features incorporating partial scores, and used to predict scores for complete recordings. Performance was assessed using Cohen's K statistic. The quasi-supervised classifier performed significantly better than an unsupervised model and sometimes as well as a completely supervised model despite receiving only partial scores. The quasi-supervised algorithm addresses the need for classifiers that mimic scoring patterns of human raters while compensating for their limitations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The disease is defined by seizure semiology and the typical electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern (hypsarrhythmia). Recent insights into the evolutionary process of the pathophysiology of this disease in the maturing brain possibly open up an altered approach in diagnostics and treatment. A major aim is preserving the developmental chances in children at risk. This review gives an overview on therapeutic and diagnostic guidelines and also discusses new perspectives in the comprehension of infantile epileptic encephalopathy.

We combine filter bank and sub-band common spatial pattern (SBCSP) to extract features from EEG data in the preprocessing phase, and then LDA classifiers are applied to classify brain activities to identify either left or right hand imagery. To further foster the performance of the proposed system, a fuzzy integral (FI) approach is employed to fuse information sources, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is exploited to globally update parameters in the fusion structure. Consequently, our experimental results indicate that the proposed system provides superior performance compared to other approaches.

These rehabilitation devices are possibly too supportive during the exercises. Neurophysiological signals might be one way of avoiding slacking and providing robotic support only when the brain is particularly responsive to peripheral input. We tested the feasibility of three-dimensional robotic assistance for reaching movements with a multi-joint exoskeleton during motor imagery (MI)-related desynchronization of sensorimotor oscillations in the beta-band. We also registered task-related network changes of cortical functional connectivity by electroencephalography via the imaginary part of the coherence function. Healthy subjects and stroke survivors showed similar patterns but different aptitudes of controlling the robotic movement. All participants in this pilot study with nine healthy subjects and two stroke patients achieved their maximum performance during the early stages of the task. Robotic control was significantly higher and less variable when proprioceptive feedback was provided in addition to visual feedback, i.e., when the orthosis was actually attached to the subject's arm during the task. A distributed cortical network of task-related coherent activity in the theta-band showed significant differences between healthy subjects and stroke patients as well as between early and late periods of the task. Brain-robot interfaces (BRIs) may successfully link three-dimensional robotic training to the participants' efforts and allow for task-oriented practice of activities of daily living with a physiologically controlled multi-joint exoskeleton. Changes of cortical physiology during the task might also help to make subject specific adjustments of task difficulty and guide adjunct interventions to facilitate motor learning for functional restoration, a proposal that warrants further investigation in a larger cohort of stroke patients.

The temporal lexical route visually maps whole words to their lexical entries, whilst the nonlexical route decodes words phonologically via parietal cortex. Readers typically employ the lexical route for familiar words, but poor comprehension plus precocity at mechanically 'sounding out' words suggests that differences might exist in autism. Combined MEG/EEG recordings of adults with autistic spectrum conditions (ASC) and controls while reading revealed preferential recruitment of temporal areas in controls and additional parietal recruitment in ASC. Furthermore, a lack of differences between semantic word categories was consistent with previous suggestion that people with ASC may lack a 'default' lexical-semantic processing mode. These results are discussed with reference to dual-route models of reading.

EEG-based Time and Spatial Interpretation of Activation Areas for Relaxation and Words Writing between Poor and Capable Dyslexic Children	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			PARIETAL CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION	Symptoms of dyslexia such as difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition, and/or poor spelling as well as decoding abilities, are easily misinterpreted as laziness and defiance amongst school children. Indeed, 37.9% of 699 school dropouts and failures are diagnosed as dyslexic. Currently, Screening for dyslexia relies heavily on therapists, whom are few and subjective, yet objective methods are still unavailable. EEG has long been a popular method to study the cognitive processes in human such as language processing and motor activity. However, its interpretation is limited to time and frequency domain, without visual information, which is still useful. Here, our research intends to illustrate an EEG-based time and spatial interpretation of activated brain areas for the poor and capable dyslexic during the state of relaxation and words writing, being the first attempt ever reported. From the 2D distribution of EEG spectral at the activation areas and its progress with time, it is observed that capable dyslexics are able to relax compared to poor dyslexics. During the state of words writing, neural activities are found higher on the right hemisphere than the left hemisphere of the capable dyslexics, which suggests a neurobiological compensation pathway in the right hemisphere, during reading and writing, which is not observed in the poor dyslexics.

THE EFFECTS OF FACIAL COLOR AND INVERSION ON THE N170 EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL (ERP) COMPONENT	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						face processing; facial color; face inversion; electroencephalogram; N170; SVM	FACE INVERSION; CONTRAST REVERSAL; INVERTED FACES; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; SHAPE; SENSITIVITY; IDENTITY; STIMULI; NEURONS	Faces are important for social interaction because much can be perceived from facial details, including a person's race, age, and mood. Recent studies have shown that both configural (e.g. face shape and inversion) and surface information (e.g. surface color and reflectance properties) are important for face perception. Therefore, the present study examined the effects of facial color and inverted face properties on event-related potential (ERP) responses, particularly the N170 component. Stimuli consisted of natural and bluish-colored faces. Faces were presented in both upright and upside down orientations. An ANOVA was used to analyze N170 amplitudes and verify the effects of the main independent variables. Analysis of N170 amplitude revealed the significant interactions between stimulus orientation and color. Subsequent analysis indicated that N170 was larger for bluish-colored faces than natural-colored faces, and N170 to natural-colored faces was larger in response to inverted stimulus as compared to upright stimulus. Additionally, a multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) investigated face-processing dynamics without any prior assumptions. Results distinguished, above chance, both facial color and orientation from single-trial electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Decoding performance for color classification of inverted faces was significantly diminished as compared to an upright orientation. This suggests that processing orientation is predominant over facial color. Taken together, the present findings elucidate the temporal and spatial distribution of orientation and color processing during face processing. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

High level of dynamism in the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal reasons us to look toward evolutionary algorithm (EA). Motivated by these two facts, in this work a hybrid GA-PSO based K-means clustering technique has been used to distinguish two class motor imagery (MI) tasks. The proposed hybrid GA-PSO based K means clustering is found to outperform genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) based K-means clustering techniques in terms of both accuracy and execution time. The lesser execution time of hybrid GA-PSO technique makes it suitable for real time BCI application. Time frequency representation (TFR) techniques have been used to extract the feature of the signal under investigation. TFRs based features are extracted and relying on the concept of event related synchronization (ERD) and desynchronization (ERD) feature vector is formed.

Exchanging medical information using communication technologies to provide health care services for mutual availability of therapeutic case studies amongst various geographically distant diagnostic centers or hospitals is a very common practice now a days. However, during the exchange of medical data which is of critical importance, unauthorized entities may interfere. These entities may also modify the data which is unacceptable. In this chapter, we propose a novel approach to design a robust online biomedical content authentication and tamper detection system, where a watermark is embedded on the biomedical information to be sent, to protect its integrity and safety. In the current work, the medical data exchanged is an Electroencephalogram Signal (EEG signal), and the watermark that is embedded is the logo of the hospital or Electronic Patient Record (EPR). The proposed process is accomplished by coloring the EEG signal data in the file which can be sent to the authorized user by sending the data file or URL. The receiver decodes the received file and extracts the embedded watermark. The similarity between the original and received watermark claims that the medical data has not been tampered. And thus, this proposed intelligent web based system of binary image watermarking into the EEG data, along with the high level of robustness, imperceptibility and payload that it provides, proposed system can serve as an accurate authentication and tamper detection system.

A victim maybe be given sufficiently high dose of anticonvulsant medication, in order to prevent seizures, but they may suffer from side effects. In 20-40% of cases with epilepsy, medication is not effective, even after surgical removal of brain tissues that cause epilepsy, many continue to still experience unprompted seizures. In spite of the fact that seizures occur sporadically, the patients suffer from persistent anxiety, due to possibility of a seizure occurring. The potential to help the patients in leading a more normal life can be done with the help of Seizure forecasting systems. If we are able to predict seizures as early as possible then we have the chance of effectively aborting the seizure using responsive neurostimulation. However if we fail to detect the seizure in its early stages then it becomes very hard to abort seizures. This model aims to create a suitable model to detect the seizure in its early stages so that proper actions can be taken.

This makes it difficult to perform research that is strong in all its aspects as well as to judge a study or application on its merits. On the occasion of the special topic "Using neurophysiological signals that reflect cognitive or affective state" we here summarize often occurring pitfalls and recommendations on how to avoid them, both for authors (researchers) and readers. They relate to defining the state of interest, the neurophysiological processes that are expected to be involved in the state of interest, confounding factors, inadvertently "cheating" with classification analyses, insight on what underlies successful state estimation, and finally, the added value of neurophysiological measures in the context of an application.

C	Shankar, S			IEEE	Shankar, Sheela			Assessment of the Effect of Variations in Eye Blinks on a Face Recognition Algorithm	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL ADVANCE COMPUTING CONFERENCE (IACC)	IEEE International Advance Computing Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Advance Computing Conference (IACC 2015)	JUN 12-13, 2015	Bangalore, INDIA			Eye Blink Strength; EEG; Face recognition; LBP; PCA; SVM		Currently face recognition has reached a certain degree of maturity when operating under constrained environments. When it comes to real time situations, the system degrades sharply in handling variations like illumination, occlusions, skin tone, cosmetics, image misalignment, age, pose, etc., inherent in the face images acquired. Hence understanding and eliminating the effects of each of these factors is crucial to any face recognition system. This paper deals with studying the effect of variances in the Eye Blink Strengths (EBS) on a face image undergoing face recognition, thereby testing the efficiency of face recognition algorithm. The study makes exclusive usage of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technology to detect eye blinks and to measure their corresponding EBS values using Electroencephalograph (EEG) device. The face recognition algorithm under test was the amalgamation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Local Binary Pattern (LBP) based feature extraction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classification. EBS is assessed using an inexpensive, portable, non-invasive EEG device. The efficiency of the face recognition algorithm to withstand the eye blinks with varying degree of EBS values for the given face images was determined. It was found that the proposed methodology of test case generation can be effectively be used to evaluate various other face recognition algorithms against varying eye blinks.

Identification of Brain Regions of Interest for Epilepsy Surgery Planning Using Support Vector Machines	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; OUTCOMES	In patients with intractable epilepsy, surgical resection is a promising treatment; however, post surgical seizure freedom is contingent upon accurate identification of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Identification of the SOZ in extratemporal epilepsy requires invasive intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings as well as resource intensive and subjective analysis by epileptologists. Expert inspection yields inconsistent localization of the SOZ which leads to comparatively poor post surgical outcomes for patients. This study employs recordings from 6 patients undergoing resection surgery in order to develop an automated and scalable system for identifying regions of interest (ROIs). Leveraging machine learning techniques and features used for seizure detection, a classification system was trained and tested on patients with Engel class I to class IV outcomes, demonstrating superior performance in the class I patients. Further, classification using features based upon both high frequency and low frequency oscillations was best able to identify channels suited for resection. This study demonstrates a novel approach to ROI identification and provides a path for developing tools to improve outcomes in epilepsy surgery.

Action prediction based on anticipatory brain potentials during simulated driving	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						driving simulator; movement intention detection; slow cortical potential (SCP); contingent negative variation (CNV); brain-computer interface (BCI); anticipation; electroencephalogram (EEG)	EEG; TIME	Objective. The ability of an automobile to infer the driver's upcoming actions directly from neural signals could enrich the interaction of the car with its driver. Intelligent vehicles fitted with an on-board brain-computer interface able to decode the driver's intentions can use this information to improve the driving experience. In this study we investigate the neural signatures of anticipation of specific actions, namely braking and accelerating. Approach. We investigated anticipatory slow cortical potentials in electroencephalogram recorded from 18 healthy participants in a driving simulator using a variant of the contingent negative variation (CNV) paradigm with Go and No-go conditions: count-down numbers followed by 'Start'/'Stop' cue. We report decoding performance before the action onset using a quadratic discriminant analysis classifier based on temporal features. Main results. (i) Despite the visual and driving related cognitive distractions, we show the presence of anticipatory event related potentials locked to the stimuli onset similar to the widely reported CNV signal (with an average peak value of -8 mu V at electrode Cz). (ii) We demonstrate the discrimination between cases requiring to perform an action upon imperative subsequent stimulus (Go condition, e.g. a 'Red' traffic light) versus events that do not require such action (No-go condition; e.g. a 'Yellow' light); with an average single trial classification performance of 0.83 +/- 0.13 for braking and 0.79 +/- 0.12 for accelerating (area under the curve). (iii) We show that the centro-medial anticipatory potentials are observed as early as 320 +/- 200 ms before the action with a detection rate of 0.77 +/- 0.12 in offline analysis. Significance. We show for the first time the feasibility of predicting the driver's intention through decoding anticipatory related potentials during simulated car driving with high recognition rates.

Previous literature interprets this effect as a pre-attentive and unconscious processing of sensory stimuli. By contrast, a violation to auditory global regularities, i. e. based on repeating groups of sounds, is typically detectable when subjects can consciously perceive them. Here, we challenge the notion that global detection implies consciousness by testing the neural response to global violations in a group of 24 patients with post-anoxic coma (three females, age range 45-87 years), treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia and sedation. By applying a decoding analysis to electroencephalographic responses to standard versus deviant sound sequences, we found above-chance decoding performance in 10 of 24 patients (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P < 0.001), despite five of them being mildly hypothermic, sedated and unarousable. Furthermore, consistently with previous findings based on the mismatch negativity the progression of this decoding performance was informative of patients' chances of awakening (78% predictive of awakening). Our results show for the first time that detection of global regularities at neural level exists despite a deeply unconscious state.

Ten subjects performed 19 consecutive task periods using the ARMin robot while difficulty was varied along two scales. Three physiological modalities were measured: electroencephalography, autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses (electrocardiography, skin conductance, respiration, skin temperature) and eye tracking. After each task period, reference workload and effort values were collected using the NASA Task Load Index. Machine learning was used to estimate workload and effort from physiological data. All three physiological modalities performed significantly better than random, particularly using nonlinear estimation algorithms. The most important ANS responses were respiration and skin conductance, while the most important electroencephalographic information was obtained from frontal and central sites. However, all three physiological modalities were outperformed by task performance and movement data. This suggests that future studies should try to demonstrate advantages of physiological measurements over other information sources.

A Recurrence-Based Approach for Feature Extraction in Brain-Computer Interface Systems	TRANSLATIONAL RECURRENCES: FROM MATHEMATICAL THEORY TO REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS	Springer Proceedings in Mathematics & Statistics		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Symposium on Recurrence Plots	AUG, 2013	Chicago, IL				EEG	The feature extraction stage is one of the main tasks underlying pattern recognition, and, is particularly important for designing Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), i.e. structures capable of mapping brain signals in commands for external devices. Within one of the most used BCIs paradigms, that based on Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP), such task is classically performed in the spectral domain, albeit it does not necessarily provide the best achievable performance. The aim of this work is to use recurrence-based measures in an attempt to improve the classification performance obtained with a classical spectral approaches for a five-command SSVEP-BCI system. For both recurrence and spectral spaces, features were selected using a cluster measure defined by the Davies-Bouldin index and the classification stage was based on linear discriminant analysis. As the main result, it was found that the threshold e of the recurrence plot, chosen so as to yield a recurrence rate of 2.5 %, defined the key discriminant feature, typically providing a mean classification error of less than 2 % when information from 4 electrodes was used. Such classification performance was significantly better than that attained using spectral features, which strongly indicates that RQA is an efficient feature extraction technique for BCI.

Brain-computer interfaces coupled with robotic assistive technologies such as robotic hand orthosis have the potential to provide rehabilitation strategies that promote brain plasticity for these patients. This paper presents the design of a control signal based on EEG signal processed using common spatial patterns and linear discriminant analysis to identify hand motor imagery. The control signal is implemented on a robotic hand orthosis so that it activates when a healthy subject performs motor imagery of her/his right hand, simulating an online signal acquisition. The mechatronic orthosis performance was always as indicated by the control signal, and the systems online performance for detecting motor imagery was of nearly 80% of correct classification. The system may be improved by using other classification algorithms however results show that it is ready to be tested with motor impaired patients.	[Cantillo-Negrete, J.; Carino-Escobar, R.

The system distinguishes between 'Normal' and 'Seizure' state using on-the-fly calculated features representing the statistical measures for specifically filtered signals from the raw data. It was noticed that for a large number of cases, the seizure waveforms manifest higher energy components during the seizure episodes as compared to the normal brain activity in specific bands of frequencies. Same is also true in the reverse fashion for a separate band of frequency that changes the energy levels from higher to lower when a patient goes from Normal to a Seizure state. This fact has been exploited in this paper and filter has been developed to isolate the seizure band. The rule base has been developed on the calculated measures for the filtered signal from this band-filter and classification is performed on the basis of certain empirical thresholds. Since the complexity of calculations have been deliberately kept quite low, the algorithm is highly suitable for implementation in a small micro-controller environment with near-real-time operation. This gives an enhanced advantage over the existing EEG based seizure detection systems due to their complex pattern classification methodologies. Based on the presented technique, a wearable ubiquitous system can be easily developed with applications in personal healthcare and clinical usage. In this case, the users are not necessarily restricted to the clinical environment in which many devices are connected to the patient externally. The wearable devices allow the user to continue daily activities while being monitored for seizure activities.

Brain-machine interfaces (BMI) are an emerging therapeutic option that can allow paralyzed patients to gain control over assistive technology devices (ATDs). BMI approaches can be broadly classified into invasive (based on intracranially implanted electrodes) and noninvasive (based on skin electrodes or extracorporeal sensors). Invasive BMIs have a favorable signal-to-noise ratio, and thus allow for the extraction of more information than noninvasive BMIs, but they are also associated with the risks related to neurosurgical device implantation. Current noninvasive BMI approaches are typically concerned, among other issues, with long setup times and/or intensive training. Recent studies have investigated the attitudes of paralyzed patients eligible for BMIs, particularly patients affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These studies indicate that paralyzed patients are indeed interested in BMIs. Little is known, however, about the degree of knowledge among paralyzed patients concerning BMI approaches or about how patients retrieve information on ATDs. Furthermore, it is not yet clear if paralyzed patients would accept intracranial implantation of BMI electrodes with the premise of decoding improvements, and what the attitudes of a broader range of patients with diseases such as stroke or spinal cord injury are towards this new kind of treatment. Approach. Using a questionnaire, we surveyed 131 paralyzed patients for their opinions on invasive BMIs and their attitude toward invasive BMI treatment options. Main results. The majority of the patients knew about and had a positive attitude toward invasive BMI approaches. The group of ALS patients was especially open to the concept of BMIs. The acceptance of invasive BMI technology depended on the improvements expected from the technology. Furthermore, the survey revealed that for paralyzed patients, the Internet is an important source of information on ATDs. Significance. Websites tailored to prospective BMI users should be further developed to provide reliable information to patients, and also to help to link prospective BMI users with researchers involved in the development of BMI technology.

An important issue in BCI research is multidimensional control. Potential applications include BCI controlled computer mouse, document and email processing, web browser, wheelchair and neuroprosthesis. The challenge for EEG-based multidimensional control is to obtain multiple independent control signals from the noisy EEG data. For this purpose, hybrid BCIs may yield better performance than BCIs those use only one type of brain pattern. In this project, we first developed a hybrid system for 2-D cursor control. In our system, two independent signals based on MI and P300 were produced from EEG for the vertical and horizontal movement control of the cursor respectively, and the cursor can be moved from an arbitrary initial position to a randomly given target position. Furthermore, a hybrid feature was extracted for selecting the target-of-interest and rejecting the target-of-no-interest, as fast and accurate as possible. In this way, a BCI mouse was implemented. Then an internet browser and a mail client were developed based on the BCI mouse. Moreover, we extended this hybrid BCI system to control a virtual car/wheelchair. On the other hand, we also developed a P300 and SSVEP-based hybrid BCI not only to improve the classification performance, but also to validate the possibility of clinical applications, e.g., detection of residual cognitive function and covert awareness in patients with disorders of consciousness.

Here we present a new means of resolving this spatial organization using a combination of non-invasive observables (EEG, MEG, and MRI), model-based estimates of spectrotemporal patterns of neural activation, and multivariate pattern analysis. The method exploits both the fine-grained temporal patterning of auditory cortical responses and the millisecond scale temporal resolution of EEG and MEG. Participants listened to 400 English words while MEG and scalp EEG were measured simultaneously. We estimated the location of cortical sources using the MRI anatomically constrained minimum norm estimate (MNE) procedure. We then combined a form of multivariate pattern analysis (representational similarity analysis) with a spatiotemporal searchlight approach to successfully decode information about patterns of neuronal frequency preference and selectivity in bilateral superior temporal cortex. Observed frequency preferences in and around Heschl's gyrus matched current proposals for the organization of tonotopic gradients in primary acoustic cortex, while the distribution of narrow frequency selectivity similarly matched results from the fMRI literature. The spatial maps generated by this novel combination of techniques seem comparable to those that have emerged from fMRI or ECOG studies, and a considerable advance over earlier MEG results.

Robust disruptions in electroencephalogram cortical oscillations and large-scale functional networks in autism	BMC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						ASD; EEG; Functional networks; Biomarker; Classification; Autism; Power spectra; Validation	COMPLEX BRAIN NETWORKS; SPECTRUM QUOTIENT AQ; INFANT EEG ACTIVITY; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; PHASE-SYNCHRONIZATION; PROMISING APPROACH; ASPERGERS-SYNDROME; VOLUME-CONDUCTION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; OCCIPITAL CORTEX	Background: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are increasingly prevalent and have a significant impact on the lives of patients and their families. Currently, the diagnosis is determined by clinical judgment and no definitive physiological biomarker for ASD exists. Quantitative biomarkers obtainable from clinical neuroimaging data - such as the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) - would provide an important aid to clinicians in the diagnosis of ASD. The interpretation of prior studies in this area has been limited by mixed results and the lack of validation procedures. Here we use retrospective clinical data from a well-characterized population of children with ASD to evaluate the rhythms and coupling patterns present in the EEG to develop and validate an electrophysiological biomarker of ASD. Methods: EEG data were acquired from a population of ASD (n = 27) and control (n = 55) children 4-8 years old. Data were divided into training (n = 13 ASD, n = 24 control) and validation (n = 14 ASD, n = 31 control) groups. Evaluation of spectral and functional network properties in the first group of patients motivated three biomarkers that were computed in the second group of age-matched patients for validation. Results: Three biomarkers of ASD were identified in the first patient group: (1) reduced posterior/anterior power ratio in the alpha frequency range (8-14 Hz), which we label the "peak alpha ratio", (2) reduced global density in functional networks, and (3) a reduction in the mean connectivity strength of a subset of functional network edges. Of these three biomarkers, the first and third were validated in a second group of patients. Using the two validated biomarkers, we were able to classify ASD subjects with 83 % sensitivity and 68 % specificity in a post-hoc analysis. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that clinical EEG can provide quantitative biomarkers to assist diagnosis of autism. These results corroborate the general finding that ASD subjects have decreased alpha power gradients and network connectivities compared to control subjects. In addition, this study demonstrates the necessity of using statistical techniques to validate EEG biomarkers identified using exploratory methods.

One of the difficulties in dealing with these data sets, and in the development of automated machine learning systems which use them as input, is the lack of reliable ground truth information. In this paper we present a new web-based platform for visualization, retrieval and annotation of biosignals by non-technical users, aimed at improving the process of ground truth collection for biomedical applications. Moreover, a novel extendable and scalable data representation model and persistency framework is presented. The results of the experimental evaluation with possible users has further confirmed the potential of the presented framework.

A real-time BCI system can improve the quality of life of patients with severe neuromuscular disorders by enabling them to communicate with the outside world. In this paper, the implementation of a 2-class real-time BCI system based on the event related desynchronization (ERD) of the sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) is described. Methods: Off-line measurements were conducted on 12 healthy test subjects with 3 different feedback systems (cross, basket and bars). From the collected electroencephalogram (EEG) data, the optimum frequency bands for each of the subjects were determined first through an exhaustive search on 325 bandpass filters. The features were then extracted for the left and right hand imaginary movements using the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) method. Subsequently, a Bayes linear classifier (BLC) was developed and used for signal classification. These three subject-specific settings were preserved for the on-line experiments with the same feedback systems. Results: Six of the 12 subjects were qualified for the on-line experiments based on their high off-line classification accuracies (CAs > 75 %). The overall mean on-line accuracy was found to be 80%. Conclusions: The subject-specific settings applied on the feedback systems have resulted in the development of a successful real-time BCI system with high accuracies.

Beyond these, BCIs are also considered in the context of post-stroke motor rehabilitation. Such research usually focuses on exploiting information decoded from sensorimotor activity of the brain. Here, we propose to extend this current focus beyond sensorimotor to also include associative brain areas. In this pilot study, we present an adaptive neurofeedback training paradigm to upregulate particular EEG activity that is likely to enhance poststroke motor rehabilitation. Our experimental results support the interpretation that the neurofeedback paradigm enables subjects to up-regulate intended activity and sustain that modulation in inter-trial resting periods in a state that we believe can support motor learning performance. These results serve as a beginning on viability of our claim on integrating a neurofeedback approach to BCI-based motor rehabilitation protocols.

PERFORAMNCE ENHANCEMENT FOR AUTOMATED ANALYSIS IN HUMAN BRAIN SIGNAL PROCESSING TO FINDING ALZHEIMER'S SYNDROME USING INTELLIGENT TECHNIQUES	IIOAB JOURNAL			English	Article						Electroencephalograph (EEG); Alzheimer; Back Propagation Network (BPN); Independent Component analysis (ICA, Non-Linear Energy Operator (NLEO); Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)		Today efficient brain signal recognition is limited to find different brain diseases; using hardware like Electroencephalogram (EEG), Magnetoencephalograms (MEG), and Functional MRI (fMRI). Alternatively, abnormal brain waves have shown to be associated with particular brain disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy). But the problem with this approach is that there are not many algorithms that could efficiently extract signals from a brain to find Alzheimer's disease. In this research paper, we suggest the design of new algorithm which could do this job of translating brain signals to digital text data for Alzheimer's disease. We propose a new approach using which the problem of recognizing brain signals for Alzheimer's disease can be solved. We also provide the implementation details of this software. For the implementation of our idea, we propose a new intelligent technique Architecture. The technique adopted by the EEG signals used in brain for Alzheimer's disease, guided and stimulated us to design this research work. Details regarding the automatic preprocessing and decoding interpretation that would be essential and the shortcomings are also included in the research work.	[Gurumurthy, Sasikumar; Tripathy, B.

J	Matsumoto, M; Hori, J				Matsumoto, Mariko; Hori, Junichi			Classification of silent speech using support vector machine and relevance vector machine	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						EEG; Silent speech; Brain computer interface (BCI); Support vector machine (SVM); Relevance vector machine (RVM); Adaptive collection	SYSTEM	To provide speech prostheses for individuals with severe communication impairments, we investigated a classification method for brain computer interfaces (BCIs) using silent speech. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded using scalp electrodes when five subjects imagined the vocalization of Japanese vowels, /a/, /i/, /u/, /e/, and /o/ in order and in random order, while the subjects remained silent and immobilized. For actualization, we tried to apply relevance vector machine (RVM) and RVM with Gaussian kernel (RVM-G) instead of support vector machine with Gaussian kernel (SVM-G) to reduce the calculation cost in the use of 19 channels, common special patterns (CSPs) filtering, and adaptive collection (AC). Results show that using RVM-G instead of SVM-G reduced the ratio of the number of efficient vectors to the number of training data from 97% to 55%. At this time, the averaged classification accuracies (CAs) using SVM-G and RVM-G were, respectively, 77% and 79%, showing no degradation. However, the calculation cost was more than that using SVM-G because RVM-G necessitates high calculation costs for optimization. Furthermore, results show that CAs using RVM-G were weaker than SVM-G when the training data were few. Additionally, results showed that nonlinear classification was necessary for silent speech classification. This paper serves as a beginning of feasibility study for speech prostheses using an imagined voice. Although classification for silent speech presents great potential, many feasibility problems remain. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Resizing artificial neural networks for automatic detection of epileptiform discharges: a comparison between Principal Component and Linear Discriminant Analysis	2015 TWELVE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRONICS COMPUTER AND COMPUTATION (ICECCO)			English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference on Electronics Computer and Computation (ICECCO)	SEP 27-30, 2015	Suleyman Demirel Univ, Almaty, KAZAKHSTAN	Turgut Ozal Univ, Inter Ataturk Alatoo Univ	Suleyman Demirel Univ	artificial neural networks; epileptiform patterns; principal component analysis; linear discriminant analysis; size reduction	EEG; EPILEPSY; SIGNALS	Among the all of the different Artificial Intelligence tools, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are widely used for automated pattern recognition and classification process. One of its many applications in Biomedical Engineering is its use in the development of accurate and reliable methods for automatic identification of epileptiform discharges in long term electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Several methods have been proposed using neural networks as a classifier in which either segments of EEG signal or features extracted from them are presented as ANN input stimuli. Depending on the sampling frequency and signal size, the networks can become quite large, which would affect the performance of a system where this process is inserted. A solution to reduce the dimensionality of the networks is the use of methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the input stimuli and consequently the size of the network. This study aims to analyze and compare the application of PCA and LDA as a tool for dimensionality reduction neural networks that use morphological descriptors to perform the automatic detection of epileptiform discharges. The average efficiency performance of the neural networks with components and LDA selected descriptors as input stimuli was, respectively, 85.58% and 82.28% which is close to the average efficiency (85.46%) achieved with the whole group of descriptors. Throughout the simulations performed in this study we could not detect any apparent relation, direct or otherwise, between the input size reduction and the neural network performance results. However, after simulations we could observe that Principal Component Analysis was better for resizing the neural networks since it had a slightly better efficiency performance at the same time that it reduced the input size in approximately 56%.

To perform this, we would consider the fuzziness involved in sudden left bent, where the driver is supposed to take sudden 90 degrees left turn during acceleration. This requires classification of motor imagery signals during acceleration and steering left control. The fuzzy-recurrent neural network classifier offers better performance using proposed differential evolution-induced feature selection technique, when compared with principal component analysis in such situation and provides the highest classification accuracy of 98.472%. In addition, false classification rate/misclassification rate is also found much higher when using principal component analysis instead of proposed differential evolution-induced feature selection algorithm. The performance of the proposed differential evolution-induced fuzzy recurrent neural network classifier has been compared with a list of standard classifiers including linear support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor and support vector machines with radial basis function kernel, where fuzzy-recurrent neural network classifier outperforms its competitors with an average classification accuracy of 95.472% and 95.647 for steering left and acceleration motor intensions respectively.

Analyzing EEG signals to detect unexpected obstacles during walking	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						BCI; Obstacle detection; Lower limb rehabilitation; EEG; Wearable robot; Exoskeleton	CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; TREADMILL WALKING; MOVEMENT; CLASSIFICATION; COMPONENTS; CORTEX; STATE	Background: When an unexpected perturbation in the environment occurs, the subsequent alertness state may cause a brain activation responding to that perturbation which can be detected and employed by a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). In this work, the possibility of detecting a sudden obstacle appearance analyzing electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is assessed. For this purpose, different features of EEG signals are evaluated during the appearance of sudden obstacles while a subject is walking on a treadmill. The future goal is to use this procedure to detect any obstacle appearance during walking when the user is wearing a lower limb exoskeleton in order to generate an emergency stop command for the exoskeleton. This would enhance the user-exoskeleton interaction, improving the safety mechanisms of current exoskeletons. Methods: In order to detect the change in the brain activity when an obstacle suddenly appears, different features of EEG signals are evaluated using the recordings of five healthy subjects. Since the change in the brain activity occurs in the time domain, the features evaluated are: common spatial patterns, average power, slope, and the coefficients of a polynomial fit. A Linear Discriminant Analysis-based classifier is used to differentiate between two conditions: the appearance or not of an obstacle. The evaluation of the performance to detect the obstacles is made in terms of accuracy, true positive (TP) and false positive (FP) rates. Results: From the offline analysis, the best performance is achieved when the slope or the polynomial coefficients are used as features, with average detection accuracy rates of 74.0 and 79.5%, respectively. These results are consistent with the pseudo-online results, where a complete EEG recording is segmented into windows of 500 ms and overlapped 400 ms, and a decision about the obstacle appearance is made for each window. The results of the best subject were 11 out of 14 obstacles detected with a rate of 9.09 FPs/min, and 10 out of 14 obstacles detected with a rate of 6.34 FPs/min using slope and polynomial coefficients features, respectively. Conclusions: An EEG-based BCI can be developed to detect the appearance of unexpected obstacles. The average accuracy achieved is 79.5% of success rate with a low number of false detections. Thus, the online performance of the BCI would be suitable for commanding in a safely way a lower limb exoskeleton during walking.

In high dimensional settings the sample covariance is known to perform poorly, hence regularization strategies such as analytic shrinkage of Ledoit/Wolf are applied. In the standard setting, i.i.d. data is assumed, however, in practice, time series typically exhibit strong autocorrelation structure, which introduces a pronounced estimation bias. Recent work by Sancetta has extended the shrinkage framework beyond i.i.d. data. We contribute in this work by showing that the Sancetta estimator, while being consistent in the high-dimensional limit, suffers from a high bias in finite sample sizes. We propose an alternative estimator, which is (1) unbiased, (2) less sensitive to hyperparameter choice and (3) yields superior performance in simulations on toy data and on a real world data set from an EEG-based Brain-Computer-Interfacing experiment.

This type of epilepsy is rare and has not been well described yet. Knowledge of the characteristics of PCE is important for the interpretation of presurgical evaluation and better surgical strategy. The purpose of this study was to better characterise the clinical and neurophysiological features of PCE. Methods This retrospective analysis included seven intractable PCE patients. Six patients had postcingulate ictal onset identified by stereotactic EEG (SEEG) evaluations. One patient had a postcingulate tumour. We analysed clinical semiology, the scalp EEG/SEEG findings and cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP). Results The classifications of scalp EEG were various, including non-localisible, lateralised to the seizure onset side, regional parieto-occipital, regional frontocentral and regional temporal. Three of seven patients showed motor manifestations, including bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures and hypermotor seizures. In these patients, ictal activities spread to frontal (lateral premotor area, orbitofrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, anteior cingulate gyrus) and parietal (precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, inferior parietal lobule (IPL), postcentral gyrus) areas. Four patients showed dialeptic seizures or automotor seizures, with seizure spread to medial temporal or IPL areas. CCEP was performed in four patients, suggesting electrophysiological connections from the posterior cingulate gyrus to parietal, temporal, mesial occipital and mesial frontal areas. Conclusions This study revealed that the network from the posterior cingulate gyrus and the semiology of PCE (motor manifestation vs dialeptic/automotor seizure) varies depending upon the seizure spread patterns.

J	Subasi, A				Subasi, Abdulhamit			A decision support system for diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders using DWT and evolutionary support vector machines	SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING			English	Article						Electromyography (EMG); Discrete wavelet transform (DWT); Parameter tuning; Evolutionary support vector machines (ESVMs); Genetic algorithms (GAs)	NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; EXTRACTION; EEG	Support vector machines (SVMs) have been widely used in many pattern recognition problems. Generally, the performance of SVM classifiers is affected by the selection of the kernel parameters. However, SVM does not offer the mechanism for proper setting of their control parameters. The objective of this research is to optimize the parameters without degrading the SVM classification accuracy in diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders. An evolutionary approach for designing an SVM-based classifier (ESVM) by optimization of automatic parameter tuning using genetic algorithm is proposed. To illustrate and evaluate the efficiency of ESVM, a typical application to EMG signals classification using normal, myopathic, and neurogenic datasets is adopted. In the proposed method, the EMG signals were decomposed into the frequency sub-bands using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and a set of statistical features was extracted from the sub-bands to represent the distribution of wavelet coefficients. It is shown that ESVM can obtain a high accuracy of 97 % using tenfold cross-validation for the EMG datasets. ESVM is developed as an efficient tool, so that various SVMs can be used conveniently as the core of ESVM for diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders.

Most of these applications rely on synchronous tasks with different user's evaluations associated to correct and wrong events. Asynchronous detection during the continuous evaluation of the task, however, has to cope with background noise and an increased number of misdetections common in event-related potential detection. This paper studies a different characteristic that may carry additional information to be exploited by asynchronous ErrP detectors: brain connectivity coherence patterns appearing while the user monitors the continuous operation of a device. The results obtained with five subject revealed the presence of an error potential in an asynchronous reaching task an showed an increase in the coherency within the theta band.

Music-induced emotions can be predicted from a combination of brain activity and acoustic features	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Music; Affective state prediction; EEG; Acoustic features; Machine learning	PHYSIOLOGICAL-CHANGES; RECOGNITION; PREFERENCE; RESPONSES; THERAPY; TEMPO; MOOD	It is widely acknowledged that music can communicate and induce a wide range of emotions in the listener. However, music is a highly-complex audio signal composed of a wide range of complex time- and frequency-varying components. Additionally, music-induced emotions are known to differ greatly between listeners. Therefore, it is not immediately clear what emotions will be induced in a given individual by a piece of music. We attempt to predict the music-induced emotional response in a listener by measuring the activity in the listeners electroencephalogram (EEG). We combine these measures with acoustic descriptors of the music, an approach that allows us to consider music as a complex set of time-varying acoustic features, independently of any specific music theory. Regression models are found which allow us to predict the music-induced emotions of our participants with a correlation between the actual and predicted responses of up to r = 0.234,p < 0.001. This regression fit suggests that over 20% of the variance of the participant's music induced emotions can be predicted by their neural activity and the properties of the music. Given the large amount of noise, non-stationarity, and non-linearity in both EEG and music, this is an encouraging result.

Tight real-time constraints, miniaturization, and low power are critical issues exacerbated by applications requiring the implant of electronic devices in the patient's body. Among them, neurocontrolled motor prostheses are on the cutting edge of the research in the field, requiring the real-time neural signal decoding to extract the patient's movement intention in order to control the mechatronic device. Despite the literature in the field, how to implement a highly-portable and reliable integrated platform is still an open question. In this paper, we propose a field-programmable gate array-based prototype of an multi-processor system-on-chip embedded architecture that implements an online neural signal decoding algorithm. The prototype is capable of respecting the real-time constraints posed by the application when clocked at less than 50 MHz. Considering that the application workload is extremely data dependent and unpredictable, the architecture has to be dimensioned taking into account critical worst-case operating conditions to ensure robustness. To compensate the resulting over-provisioning of the system architecture, a software-controllable power management has been integrated. Experimental results demonstrate the real-time behavior and allow evaluating the usefulness of the proposed power management technique on public databases.

Recent technological advances in neural interfacing with robotic rehabilitation devices are promising in the context of gait rehabilitation. Here, the X1, NASA's powered robotic lower limb exoskeleton, is introduced as a potential diagnostic, assistive, and therapeutic tool for stroke rehabilitation. Additionally, the feasibility of decoding lower limb joint kinematics and kinetics during walking with the X1 from scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) signals - the first step towards the development of a brain-machine interface (BMI) system to the X1 exoskeleton - is demonstrated.

The former starts from the study of the detailed functioning of a small number of neuronal assemblies, while the latter tries to decode brain functioning by considering the brain as a whole. This review discusses the top-down approach and the use of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to describe global brain properties. The main idea behind this approach is that the concurrence of several areas is required for the brain to instantiate a specific behavior/functioning. A central issue is therefore the study of brain functional connectivity and the concept of brain networks as ensembles of distant brain areas that preferentially exchange information. Importantly, the human brain is a dynamic device, and MEG is ideally suited to investigate phenomena on behaviorally relevant timescales, also offering the possibility of capturing behaviorally-related brain connectivity dynamics.

They have been widely claimed to be the neurological correlates of semantic and syntactic anomalies, respectively, but evidence accumulated over the last decade has raised some serious doubts about that interpretation. In this paper, I first review some of this evidence and then present an alternative way to think about the issue. My suggestion is built on Shannon's concept of noisy-channel decoding by tables of typical sets, and it is thus fundamentally statistical in nature. I show that a proper application of Shannon's concepts to the reading process provides an interesting reinterpretation of our notion of "syntax," thus questioning some fundamental assumptions of linguistics.

Better defining intracranial electroencephalographic morphological patterns at seizure-onset could improve the understanding of such mechanisms. To this end, we investigated intracranial electroencephalographic seizure-onset patterns associated with different epileptogenic lesions, and defined high-frequency oscillation correlates of each pattern. We analysed representative seizure types from 33 consecutive patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy and a structural magnetic resonance imaging lesion (11 mesial temporal sclerosis, nine focal cortical dysplasia, six cortical atrophy, three periventricular nodular heterotopia, three polymicrogyria, and one tuberous sclerosis complex) who underwent depth-electrode electroencephalographic recordings (500 Hz filter, 2000 Hz sampling rate). Patients were included only if seizures arose from contacts located in lesional/peri-lesional tissue, and if clinical manifestations followed the electrographic onset. Seizure-onset patterns were defined independently by two reviewers blinded to clinical information, and consensus was reached after discussion. For each seizure, pre-ictal and ictal sections were selected for high-frequency oscillation analysis. Seven seizure-onset patterns were identified across the 53 seizures sampled: low-voltage fast activity (43%); low-frequency high-amplitude periodic spikes (21%); sharp activity at 13 Hz (15%); spike-and-wave activity (9%); burst of high-amplitude polyspikes (6%); burst suppression (4%); and delta brush (4%). Each pattern occurred across several pathologies, except for periodic spikes, only observed with mesial temporal sclerosis, and delta brush, exclusive to focal cortical dysplasia. However, mesial temporal sclerosis was not always associated with periodic spikes nor focal cortical dysplasia with delta brush. Compared to other patterns, low-voltage fast activity was associated with a larger seizure-onset zone (P = 0.04). Four patterns, sharp activity at 13 Hz, low-voltage fast activity, spike-and-wave activity and periodic spikes, were also found in regions of seizure spread, with periodic spikes only emerging from mesial temporal sclerosis. Each of the seven patterns was accompanied by a significant increase in high-frequency oscillations upon seizure-onset. Overall, our data indicate that: (i) biologically-distinct epileptogenic lesions share intracranial electroencephalographic seizure-onset patterns, suggesting that different pathological substrates can affect similarly networks or mechanisms underlying seizure generation; (ii) certain pathologies are associated with intracranial electroencephalographic signatures at seizure-onset, e.g. periodic spikes which may reflect mechanisms specific to mesial temporal sclerosis; (iii) some seizure-onset patterns, including periodic spikes, can also be found in regions of spread, which cautions against relying on the morphology of the initial discharge to define the epileptogenic zone; and (iv) high-frequency oscillations increase at seizure-onset, independently of the pattern.

A conventional hearing screening test's applicability is limited as it requires a feedback response from the subject under test. To overcome such problems, the primary focus of this study is to develop an intelligent hearing ability level assessment system using auditory evoked potential signals (AEP). AEP signal is a non-invasive tool that can reflect the stimulated interactions with neurons along the stations of the auditory pathway. The AEP responses of fourteen normal hearing subjects to auditory stimuli ( 20 dB, 30 dB, 40 dB, 50 dB and 60 dB) were derived from electroencephalogram ( EEG) recordings. Higuchi's fractal method is applied to extract the fractal features from the recorded AEP signals. The extracted fractal features were then associated to different hearing perception levels of the subjects. Feed-forward and feedback neural networks are employed to distinguish the different hearing perception levels. The performance of the proposed intelligent hearing ability level assessment found to exceed 85% accuracy. This study indicates that AEP responses to the auditory stimuli to the normal hearing persons can predict the higher order auditory stimuli followed by the lower order auditory stimuli and consequently the state of auditory development of subjects	[Paulraj, M.

Different from data sets such as DEAP [15] and MAHNOB-HCI [31], DECAF contains (1) brain signals acquired using the Magnetoencephalogram (MEG) sensor, which requires little physical contact with the user's scalp and consequently facilitates naturalistic affective response, and (2) explicit and implicit emotional responses of 30 participants to 40 one-minute music video segments used in [15] and 36 movie clips, thereby enabling comparisons between the EEG versus MEG modalities as well as movie versus music stimuli for affect recognition. In addition to MEG data, DECAF comprises synchronously recorded near-infra-red (NIR) facial videos, horizontal Electrooculogram (hEOG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), and trapezius-Electromyogram (tEMG) peripheral physiological responses. To demonstrate DECAF's utility, we present (i) a detailed analysis of the correlations between participants' self-assessments and their physiological responses and (ii) single-trial classification results for valence, arousal and dominance, with performance evaluation against existing data sets. DECAF also contains time-continuous emotion annotations for movie clips from seven users, which we use to demonstrate dynamic emotion prediction.

Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease Using Enhanced Probabilistic Neural Network	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Computer-aided diagnosis; Parkinson's disease; Enhanced probabilistic neural networks	WAVELET-CHAOS METHODOLOGY; EEG-BASED DIAGNOSIS; SWEDDS PATIENTS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BRAIN; MODELS; SCANS; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; COMPUTATION	Early and accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains challenging. Neuropathological studies using brain bank specimens have estimated that a large percentages of clinical diagnoses of PD may be incorrect especially in the early stages. In this paper, a comprehensive computer model is presented for the diagnosis of PD based on motor, non-motor, and neuroimaging features using the recently-developed enhanced probabilistic neural network (EPNN). The model is tested for differentiating PD patients from those with scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDDs) using the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, an observational, multi-center study designed to identify PD biomarkers for diagnosis and disease progression. The results are compared to four other commonly-used machine learning algorithms: the probabilistic neural network (PNN), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm, and classification tree (CT). The EPNN had the highest classification accuracy at 92.5 % followed by the PNN (91.6 %), k-NN (90.8 %) and CT (90.2 %). The EPNN exhibited an accuracy of 98.6 % when classifying healthy control (HC) versus PD, higher than any previous studies.

Most BMI systems are designed exclusively to control devices using low-level commands, or high-level commands when devices with pre-programmed functionalities are available. In this paper, we build on our previous work on BMI-based Learning System in which we presented a different approach for designing BMI systems that incorporate learning capabilities that relieve the user from tedious low-level control. In this work, we extend the capabilities of our framework to allow a user to be able to teach and evaluate a robotic system by using a BMI. We provide general system architecture and demonstrate its applicability in new domains such as teaching a humanoid robot object manipulation skills and evaluating its performance. Our approach consists of 1) tele-operating robot's actions while robot's camera collects object's visual properties, 2) learning manipulation skills (i.e. push-left, lift-up, etc.) by approximating a posterior probability of commonly performed actions when observing similar properties, and 3) evaluating robot's performance by considering brain-based error perception of the human while he/she passively observes the robot performing the learned skill. This technique consists of monitoring EEG signals to detect a brain potential called error related negativity (ERN) that spontaneously occurs when the user perceives an error made by the robot. By using human error perception, we demonstrate that it is possible to evaluate robot actions and provide feedback to improve its learning performance. We present results from five human subjects who successfully used our framework to teach a humanoid robot how to manipulate diverse objects, and evaluate robot skills by visual observation.

The network activity patterns in the awake resting state and in the actively behaving state in rodents are not well understood, and a better tool for differentiating these states can provide insights on healthy brain functions and its alteration with disease. Therefore, we simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFPs) bilaterally in motor cortex and striatum, and measured locomotion from healthy, freely behaving rats. Here we analyze spectral characteristics of the obtained signals and present an algorithm for automatic discrimination of the awake resting and the behavioral states. We used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and utilized features obtained by applying discrete wavelet transform (DWT) on LFPs, which arose as a solution with high accuracy.

J	Amihai, I; Kozhevnikov, M				Amihai, Ido; Kozhevnikov, Maria			Arousal vs. Relaxation: A Comparison of the Neurophysiological and Cognitive Correlates of Vajrayana and Theravada Meditative Practices	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; POWER SPECTRUM ANALYSIS; ARTERIAL-PRESSURE; STRESS-MANAGEMENT; HUMAN EEG; SLEEP; ATTENTION; STATES; ELECTROCARDIOGRAM; OSCILLATIONS	Based on evidence of parasympathetic activation, early studies defined meditation as a relaxation response. Later research attempted to categorize meditation as either involving focused or distributed attentional systems. Neither of these hypotheses received strong empirical support, and most of the studies investigated Theravada style meditative practices. In this study, we compared neurophysiological (EEG, EKG) and cognitive correlates of meditative practices that are thought to utilize either focused or distributed attention, from both Theravada and Vajrayana traditions. The results of Study 1 show that both focused (Shamatha) and distributed (Vipassana) attention meditations of the Theravada tradition produced enhanced parasympathetic activation indicative of a relaxation response. In contrast, both focused (Deity) and distributed (Rig-pa) meditations of the Vajrayana tradition produced sympathetic activation, indicative of arousal. Additionally, the results of Study 2 demonstrated an immediate dramatic increase in performance on cognitive tasks following only Vajrayana styles of meditation, indicating enhanced phasic alertness due to arousal. Furthermore, our EEG results showed qualitatively different patterns of activation between Theravada and Vajrayana meditations, albeit highly similar activity between meditations within the same tradition. In conclusion, consistent with Tibetan scriptures that described Shamatha and Vipassana techniques as those that calm and relax the mind, and Vajrayana techniques as those that require 'an awake quality' of the mind, we show that Theravada and Vajrayana meditations are based on different neurophysiological mechanisms, which give rise to either a relaxation or arousal response. Hence, it may be more appropriate to categorize meditations in terms of relaxation vs. arousal, whereas classification methods that rely on the focused vs. distributed attention dichotomy may need to be reexamined.

Methods: Children and adolescents who had vertical perithalamic hemispherotomy at the Medical University Wien (MUW) paediatric epilepsy centre were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Inclusion criteria were: complete clinical, neurophysiological and neuropsychological data, seizure freedom and a minimum follow-up of 12 months after surgery. The language quotients (LQ) prior to surgery and at last follow-up were calculated for each child. In addition, associations between pre- to post-surgical changes in LQ and the following variables were examined: age at epilepsy-onset, age at surgery and duration of epilepsy prior to surgery, aetiology, side of surgery, interictal EEG including sleep organization before and 12 months after surgery and antiepileptic-drug (AED) withdrawal state at last follow-up. Analyses were carried out in SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Nonparametric Wilcoxon and chi-square tests were applied, as required. Results: Data from 28 children (14 female) were analyzed. The median age at epilepsy surgery was 64.5 months. The median follow-up after surgery was 3.0 years (+/- 2.6 years, range 12 months to 12 years). Significant gains in LQs at last follow-up were found in 31% of the children (p=0.008). Short disease duration prior to surgery, acquired pathology, lack of epileptiform EEG discharges in the contralateral hemisphere and/or normalization of EEG sleep patterns after surgery, and successful AED withdrawal were linked to favourable language outcomes. Conclusion: Successful and early hemispherotomy results in improvement of language function in the intact hemisphere. (C) 2015 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We also carried out a systematic review of the literature on OLE. Thirty-five consecutive patients who underwent occipital resection for epilepsy were included. Diagnoses were made following presurgical evaluations, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), scalp video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, and intracranial EEG monitoring. At last follow-up, seizure outcome was classified using the Engel classification scheme. Twenty-five of 35 patients experienced/had experienced a parts per thousand yen1 type of aura before the seizure. Invasive recordings were used to define the epileptogenic area in 30 of 35 patients (85.7 %). All patients underwent occipital lesionectomies or topectomies. Histopathology revealed: cortical dysplasias, gliosis, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, ganglioglioma, and tuberous sclerosis. After a mean follow-up of 44 months, 25 patients (71.4 %) were seizure free (Engel class I), 3 (8.6 %) rarely had seizures (Engel class II), 5 (14.3 %) improved more than 75 % (Engel class III), and 2 (5.7 %) had no significant improvement (Engel class IV). Preoperatively, 12 of 33 patients (36.4 %) had visual field deficits. Postoperatively, 25 patients (75.8 %) had new or aggravated visual field deficits. The management of OLE has been aided greatly by the availability of high-resolution diagnosis. Postoperative visual field deficits occur in a significant proportion of patients. Comprehensive intracranial EEG coverage of all occipital surfaces helps to define the epileptogenic area and preserve visual function, especially in cases of focal cortical dysplasia undetectable by MRI.

However, a small channel subset is favored for not only machine learning feasibility, but also practicality in commercial and clinical BCI applications. An embedded channel selection approach based on grouped automatic relevance determination is proposed. The proposed Gaussian conjugate group-sparse prior and the embedded nature of the concerned Bayesian linear model enable simultaneous channel selection and feature classification. Moreover, with the marginal likelihood (evidence) maximization technique, hyper-parameters that determine the sparsity of the model are directly estimated from the training set, avoiding time-consuming cross-validation. Experiments have been conducted on P300 speller BCIs. The results for both public and in-house datasets show that the channels selected by our techniques yield competitive classification performance with the state-of-the-art and are biologically relevant to P300.

Detection of motor imagery of hand/arm has been extensively studied for stroke rehabilitation. This paper firstly investigates the detection of motor imagery of swallow (MI-SW) and motor imagery of tongue protrusion (MI-Ton) in an attempt to find a novel solution for post-stroke dysphagia rehabilitation. Detection of MI-SW from a simple yet relevant modality such as MI-Ton is then investigated, motivated by the similarity in activation patterns between tongue movements and swallowing and there being fewer movement artifacts in performing tongue movements compared to swallowing. Approach. Novel features were extracted based on the coefficients of the dual-tree complex wavelet transform to build multiple training models for detecting MI-SW. The session-to-session classification accuracy was boosted by adaptively selecting the training model to maximize the ratio of between-classes distances versus within-class distances, using features of training and evaluation data. Main results. Our proposed method yielded averaged cross-validation (CV) classification accuracies of 70.89% and 73.79% for MI-SW and MI-Ton for ten healthy subjects, which are significantly better than the results from existing methods. In addition, averaged CV accuracies of 66.40% and 70.24% for MI-SW and MI-Ton were obtained for one stroke patient, demonstrating the detectability of MI-SW and MI-Ton from the idle state. Furthermore, averaged session-to-session classification accuracies of 72.08% and 70% were achieved for ten healthy subjects and one stroke patient using the MI-Ton model. Significance. These results and the subjectwise strong correlations in classification accuracies between MI-SW and MI-Ton demonstrated the feasibility of detecting MI-SW from MI-Ton models.

Methods: This retrospective analysis included 56 children aged <18 years (M:F = 26:30; mean age: 12.3 +/- 4.0 years) diagnosed PNES on video-EEG monitoring. The semiological characteristics like pattern of bodily movements, emotional signs, stereotypy, ictal vocalization, responsiveness, delay in diagnosis etc. were recorded. We analyzed our data as per previous adult classifications and proposed a modified classification. Results: There were 190 recorded attacks (range: 1-9, median: 3) recorded. The age at onset of PNES was 8.9 +/- 4.1 years (range: 04-15.8 years; median: 9 years), age at diagnosis: 11.9 +/- 4,1 years (range: 2-17; median: 12.0 years), delay in diagnosis: 3.2 +/- 3.7 years (range: 0-15; median: 2.0 years). Anxiety disorder was seen in 9 (16.1%), stress in 6 (10.7%) children. Flexion/extension bodily movements were seen in 40 (70.1%), negative emotional signs in 17 (30.4%) and tremors in 14 (25%) cases. Thirty-three (58.9%) patients diagnosed as having true seizures initially and were on anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), 14 patients (25.0%) initially diagnosed of PNES which remained unchanged after VEEG, nine patients (16.1%) had both PNES and true seizufes. Twenty-six (46.4%) of our patients into the existing classifications. We then classified our patients into categories of a modified new classification: Hypermotor: 13 (23.2%), partial motor: 8 (14.3%), affective/emotional behaviour phenomena: 2 (3.6%), dialeptic: 8 (14.3%), 'aura': 3 (5.4%), mixed: 22 (39.3%). Conclusion: Incorrect diagnosis of epilepsy leads to unnecessary drug treatment. A detailed analysis of semiology and classification helps in early diagnosis of PNES. A modified systematic classification of PNES is proposed which would help in better standardization of PNES. (C) 2013 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Deep-electrode implantation was performed in the bilateral mesial temporal lobes of seven patients. Following the implantation of the deep electrodes through the monitored designed path, the epileptogenic zones were determined with the assistance of a robot system. Deep electrode electroencephalograms were recorded prior to and following RFTC. Treatment outcomes were evaluated by computed tomography scans and Engel classification criteria. The procedure was well tolerated by all patients with no patients suffered from severe permanent complications. After follow-ups for 34-62 months, four patients achieved Engel class I, including three patients with Ia classification, two patients were classified as Engel class IVa and one patient was classified as Engel class IVc. Therefore, robot-assisted frameless stereotaxy for deep electrode implantation and RFTC is indicated to be a safe and effective method that may be used effectively in clinical practice.

The goal of this paper is to propose a method for hypermotor seizure detection based on accelerometers that are attached to the extremities. Methods: Supervised methods that are commonly used in literature need annotation of data and hence require expert (neurologist) interaction resulting in a substantial cost. In this paper an unsupervised method is proposed that uses extreme value statistics and seizure detection based on a model of normal behavior that is estimated using all recorded and unlabeled data. In this way the expensive interaction can be avoided. Results: When applying this method to a labeled dataset, acquired from 7 patients, all hypermotor seizures are detected in 5 of the 7 patients with an average positive predictive value (PPV) of 53%. For evaluating the performance on an unlabeled dataset, seizure events are presented to the system as normal movement events. Since hypermotor seizures are rare compared to normal movements, the very few abnormal events have a negligible effect on the quality of the model. In this way, it was possible to evaluate the system for 3 of the 7 patients when 3% of the training set was composed of seizure events. This resulted in sensitivity scores of 80%, 22% and 90% and a PPV of 89%, 21% and 44% respectively. These scores are comparable with a state-of-the-art supervisal machine learning based approach which requires a labeled dataset. Conclusions: A person-dependent epileptic seizure detection method has been designed that requires little human interaction. In contrast to traditional machine learning approaches, the imbalance of the dataset does not cause substantial difficulties. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, relatively little is known about how hedonic valence of touch is processed at the cortical level. Here we investigated the electrophysiological correlates of affective tactile sensation during caressing of the right forearm with pleasant and unpleasant textile fabrics. We show dissociation between more physically driven differential brain responses to the different fabrics in early somatosensory cortex the well-known mu-suppression (10-20 Hz) and a beta-band response (25-30 Hz) in presumably higher-order somatosensory areas in the right hemisphere that correlated well with the subjective valence of tactile caressing. Importantly, when using single trial classification techniques, beta-power significantly distinguished between pleasant and unpleasant stimulation on a single trial basis with high accuracy. Our results therefore suggest a dissociation of the sensory and affective aspects of touch in the somatosensory system and may provide features that may be used for single trial decoding of affective mental states from simple electroencephalographic measurements.

Hence, effective techniques for video arousal recognition are highly required. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for recognizing arousal levels by integrating low-level audio-visual features derived from video content and human brain's functional activity in response to videos measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). At first, a set of audio-visual features which have been demonstrated to be correlated with video arousal are extracted. Then, the fMRI-derived features that convey the brain activity of comprehending videos are extracted based on a number of brain regions of interests (ROIs) identified by a universal brain reference system. Finally, these two sets of features are integrated to learn a joint representation by using a multimodal deep Boltzmann machine (DBM). The learned joint representation can be utilized as the feature for training classifiers. Due to the fact that fMRI scanning is expensive and time-consuming, our DBM fusion model has the ability to predict the joint representation of the videos without fMRI scans. The experimental results on a video benchmark demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework and the superiority of integrated features.

Commonly designed BCIs use band power changes in single channel electroencephalograms (EEGs) to discriminate different MI tasks. In this paper, we studied the information about interactions of spatially separated brain areas by considering the relationships between brain source signals through functional connectivity. We investigated dynamic time-frequency connectivity patterns during four motor imagery movements including left hand, right hand, both feet and tongue by means of Coherence measure estimated from multivariate adaptive autoregressive model coefficients. To tackle the volume conduction problem, sensor space signals were transformed into source space using independent component analysis technique. We showed distinct time-varying Coherence for different motor imageries. For tongue MI movement, bilateral connectivity was observed in hand areas of both hemispheres. The similar connectivity was detected for feet MI task, but with more focus on right hemisphere. During right and left hand MI, bilateral and contralateral brain connectivities were observed respectively. Results provided valuable information for possible classification of MI tasks by considering brain source functional connectivity patterns for BCIs.	[Hamedi, Mahyar; Salleh, Sh-Hussain; Samdin, S.

J	Yilmaz, O; Birbaumer, N; Ramos-Murguialday, A				Yilmaz, Ozge; Birbaumer, Niels; Ramos-Murguialday, Ander			Movement related slow cortical potentials in severely paralyzed chronic stroke patients	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						stroke; movement related slow cortical potentials; EEG; movement preparation; intention to move	SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; READINESS-POTENTIALS; CORTEX; REHABILITATION; RECOVERY; REORGANIZATION; HEMIPARESIS; INVOLVEMENT; TOPOGRAPHY	Movement-related slow cortical potentials (SCPs) are proposed as reliable and immediate indicators of cortical reorganization in motor learning. SCP amplitude and latency have been reported as markers for the brain's computational effort, attention and movement planning. SCPs have been used as an EEG signature of motor control and as a main feature in Brain-Machine-Interfaces (BMIs). Some reports suggest SCPs are modified following stroke. In this study, we investigated movement-related SCPs in severe chronic stroke patients with no residual paretic hand movements preceding and during paretic (when they try to move) and healthy hand movements. The aim was to identify SCP signatures related to cortex integrity and complete paralysis due to stroke in the chronic stage. Twenty severely impaired (no residual finger extension) chronic stoke patients, of whom ten presented subcortical and ten cortical and subcortical lesions, underwent EEG and EMG recordings during a cue triggered hand movement (open/close) paradigm. SCP onset appeared and peaked significantly earlier during paretic hand movements than during healthy hand movements. Amplitudes were significantly larger over the midline (Cz, Fz) for paretic hand movements while contralateral (C4, F4) and midline (Cz, Fz) amplitudes were significantly larger than ipsilateral activity for healthy hand movements. Dividing the participants into subcortical only and mixed lesioned patient groups, no significant differences observed in SCP amplitude and latency between groups. This suggests lesions in the thalamocortical loop as the main factor in SCP changes after stroke. Furthermore, we demonstrated how, after long-term complete paralysis, post-stroke intention to move a paralyzed hand resulted in longer and larger SCRs originating in the frontal areas. These results suggest SCP are a valuable feature that should be incorporated in the design of new neurofeedback strategies for motor neurorehabilitation.

We aimed to improve sensitivity and specificity of prediction methods, and to reduce the number of false alarms. Methods: Relative combinations of sub-band spectral powers of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings across all possible channel pairs were utilized for tracking gradual changes preceding seizures. By using a specifically developed feature selection method, a set of best candidate features were fed to support vector machines in order to discriminate cerebral state as preictal or non-preictal. Results: Proposed algorithm was evaluated on continuous long-term multichannel scalp and invasive recordings (183 seizures, 3565 h). The best results demonstrated a sensitivity of 75.8% (66 out of 87 seizures) and a false prediction rate of 0.1 h (1). Performance was validated statistically, and was superior to that of analytical random predictor. Conclusion: Applying machine learning methods on a reduced subset of proposed features could predict seizure onsets with high performance. Significance: Our method was evaluated on long-term continuous recordings of overall about 5 months, contrary to majority of previous studies using short-term fragmented data. It is of very low computational cost, while providing acceptable levels of alarm sensitivity and specificity. (C) 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Decoding of Wrist and Finger Movement from Electroencephalography Signal	2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRONICS, COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (IEEE CONECCT)	IEEE International Conference on Electronics Computing and Communication Technologies		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (IEEE CONECCT)	JAN 06-07, 2014	Indian Inst Sci, Bangalore, INDIA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Commun Soc, IEEE Signal Proc Soc, IEEE Bangalore Sect	Indian Inst Sci	Adaptive Auto-Regressive Model; Brain-Computer Interfacing; Distance Likelihood Ratio Test; Electro-encephalography; Extreme Energy Ratio; Fisher Linear Discriminant; Naive Bayes; Radial Basis Function based Support Vector Machine; Sequential Forward Feature Selection	INTERFACES	The emergence of brain-computer interfacing has made the control of robots through thought a reality. Such realtime application calls for fast processing and accurate classification of brain signals. In this paper, we address the twolevel classification of motor imagery signals, where the user differentiates between clockwise/counter-clockwise movement of wrist and the opening/closing of the fingers. For this purpose, parameters of adaptive autoregressive (AAR) models and Extreme Energy Ratio criterion (EER) are employed as features, which are fed to standard classifiers for comparison. It concludes the features extracted based on EER, selected by sequential forward search and classified using radial basis function kernelized support vector machine, provides optimum performance of the classification process for implementation in real-time scenario, with an average accuracy 90.24% and a time complexity of 8.2449 seconds.

Automatic Identification and Classification of Muscle Spasms in Long-Term EMG Recordings	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Automatic classification; clonus; motor units; spasticity; spinal cord injury (SCI)	SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; MOTOR UNITS; CLONUS; SPASTICITY; PATTERNS; EEG	Spinal cord injured (SCI) individuals may be afflicted by spasticity, a condition in which involuntary muscle spasms are common. EMG recordings can be analyzed to quantify this symptom of spasticity but manual identification and classification of spasms are time consuming. Here, an algorithm was created to find and classify spasm events automatically within 24-h recordings of EMG. The algorithm used expert rules and time-frequency techniques to classify spasm events as tonic, unit, or clonus spasms. A companion graphical user interface (GUI) program was also built to verify and correct the results of the automatic algorithm or manually defined events. Eight channel EMG recordings were made from seven different SCI subjects. The algorithm was able to correctly identify an average (+/- SD) of 94.5 +/- 3.6% spasm events and correctly classify 91.6 +/- 1.9% of spasm events, with an accuracy of 61.7 +/- 16.2%. The accuracy improved to 85.5 +/- 5.9% and the false positive rate decreased to 7.1 +/- 7.3%, respectively, if noise events between spasms were removed. On average, the algorithm was more than 11 times faster than manual analysis. Use of both the algorithm and the GUI program provide a powerful tool for characterizing muscle spasms in 24-h EMG recordings, information which is important for clinical management of spasticity.

Classification of motor imagery performance in acute stroke	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Meeting	JUN 03-07, 2013	Pacific Grove, CA	Natl Inst Hlth, Natl Sci Fdn		BCI; stroke rehabilitation; event-related desynchronization	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MENTAL PRACTICE; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; PREMOTOR CORTEX; RECOVERY; TRIAL; BCI; REHABILITATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION	Objective. Effective motor imagery performance, seen as strong suppression of the sensorimotor rhythm, is the key element in motor imagery therapy. Therefore, optimization of methods to classify whether the subject is performing the imagery task is a prerequisite. An optimal classification method should have high performance accuracy and use a small number of channels. We investigated the additional benefit of the common spatial pattern filtering (CSP) to a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier, for different channel configurations. Methods. Ten hemispheric acute stroke patients and 11 healthy subjects were included. EEGs were recorded using 60 channels. The classifier was trained with a motor execution task. For both healthy controls and patients, analysis of recordings was initially limited to 3 and 11 electrodes recording from the motor cortex area, and later repeated using 45 electrodes. Results. No significant improvement on the addition of CSP to LDA was found (in both cases, the area under the receiving operating characteristic (AU-ROC) approximate to 0.70 (acceptable)). We then repeated the LDA+CSP method on recordings of 45 electrodes, since the use of imagery neuronal circuits may well extend beyond the motor area. AU-ROC rose to 0.90, but no virtual 'most responsible' electrode was observed. Finally, in mild-to-moderate stroke patients we could successfully use the EEG data recorded from the healthy hemisphere to train the classifier (AU-ROC approximate to 0.70). Significance. Including only the channels on the unaffected motor cortex is sufficient to train a classifier.	[Tangwiriyasakul, Chayanin; Mocioiu, Victor; van Putten, Michel J. A. M.; Rutten, Wim L.

MRP feature extraction is challenging since multi-channel brain signals are high dimensional and often contains various artifacts. The discriminative spatial pattern (DSP) algorithm successfully improves the signal-to-noise ratio of MRPs. However, abundant labeled training data are required for DSP to learn reliable spatial filters for each subject respectively. This is inconvenient for the applications of BCIs. In this paper, we propose a regularized DSP (RDSP) algorithm for MRP feature extraction, which does not need any labeled training data for a new subject. The regularization function of RDSP is built on empirical maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to reduce the differences not only in marginal distribution but also in conditional distribution between subjects. RDSP transfers the common discriminative spatial filters across subjects and updates them iteratively by semi-supervised learning. Experiment results on BCI competition datasets show the effectiveness of RDSP.

We devised a new paradigm that targets higher-level cognitive processes to transmit information from the user to the BCI. We instructed five ALS patients and eleven healthy subjects to either activate self-referential memories or to focus on processes without mnemonic content, while recording a high-density electroencephalogram (EEG). Both tasks are likely to modulate activity in the default mode network (DMN) without involving sensorimotor pathways. We find that the two tasks can be distinguished from bandpower modulations in the theta- (3-7 Hz) and alpha-range (8-13 Hz) in fronto-parietal areas, consistent with modulation of neural activity in primary nodes of the DMN. Training a support vector machine (SVM) to discriminate the two tasks on theta-and alpha-power in the precuneus, as estimated by a beamforming procedure, resulted in above chance-level decoding accuracy after only one experimental session. Therefore, the presented work could serve as a basis for a novel tool which allows for simple, reliable communication with patients in late stages of ALS.

J	Verma, GK; Tiwary, US				Verma, Gyanendra K.; Tiwary, Uma Shanker			Multimodal fusion framework: A multiresolution approach for emotion classification and recognition from physiological signals	NEUROIMAGE			English	Review						Multimodal fusion; Multiresolution; Emotion recognition; Wavelet transforms; Discrete wavelet transforms; Physiological signals; EEG; SVM; KNN	FACIAL EXPRESSION; EVENT DETECTION; INFORMATION; APPRAISAL; EXPERTS; WORLD; MODEL	The purpose of this paper is twofold: (i) to investigate the emotion representation models and find out the possibility of a model with minimum number of continuous dimensions and (ii) to recognize and predict emotion from the measured physiological signals using multiresolution approach. The multimodal physiological signals are: Electroencephalogram (EEG) (32 channels) and peripheral (8 channels: Galvanic skin response (GSR), blood volume pressure, respiration pattern, skin temperature, electromyogram (EMG) and electrooculogram (EOG)) as given in the DEAP database. We have discussed the theories of emotion modeling based on i) basic emotions, ii) cognitive appraisal and physiological response approach and iii) the dimensional approach and proposed a three continuous dimensional representation model for emotions. The clustering experiment on the given valence, arousal and dominance values of various emotions has been done to validate the proposed model. A novel approach for multimodal fusion of information from a large number of channels to classify and predict emotions has also been proposed. Discrete Wavelet Transform, a classical transform for multiresolution analysis of signal has been used in this study. The experiments are performed to classify different emotions from four classifiers. The average accuracies are 81.45%, 74.37%, 57.74% and 75.94% for SVM, MLP, KNN and MMC classifiers respectively. The best accuracy is for 'Depressing' with 85.46% using SVM. The 32 EEG channels are considered as independent modes and features from each channel are considered with equal importance. May be some of the channel data are correlated but they may contain supplementary information. In comparison with the results given by others, the high accuracy of 85% with 13 emotions and 32 subjects from our proposed method clearly proves the potential of our multimodal fusion approach.

In contrast, gaze aversions in line-drawn faces do not produce these N170 differences (Rossi et al., 2014), suggesting that physical stimulus properties or experimental context may drive these effects. Here we investigated the role of stimulus-induced context on neurophysiological responses to dynamic gaze. Sixteen healthy adults viewed line-drawn and real faces, with dynamic eye aversion and direct gaze transitions, and control stimuli (scrambled arrays and checkerboards) while continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded. EEG data from 2 temporo-occipital clusters of 9 electrodes in each hemisphere where N170 activity is known to be maximal were selected for analysis. N170 peak amplitude and latency, and temporal dynamics from Event Related Spectral Perturbations (ERSPs) were measured in 16 healthy subjects. Real faces generated larger N170s for averted vs. direct gaze motion, however, N170s to real and direct gaze were as large as those to respective controls. N170 amplitude did not differ across line drawn gaze changes. Overall, bilateral mean gamma power changes for faces relative to control stimuli occurred between 150-350 ms, potentially reflecting signal detection of facial motion. Our data indicate that experimental context does not drive N170 differences to viewed gaze changes. Low-level stimulus properties, such as the high sclera/iris contrast change in real eyes likely drive the N170 changes to viewed aversive movements.

Methods Fourteen primary insomnia patients and 11 good sleepers were included in the analysis. Participants completed one night of polysomnography in the sleep lab. Power spectra were calculated during the NREM (Non-rapid eyes movements) and the REM (Rapid eyes movements) sleep periods at prefrontal, occipital, temporal and central electrode positions. Results During the NREM sleep, the power spectra did not differ between groups in the prefrontal cortex; while primary insomnia patients exhibited a higher beta power spectrum and a lower delta power spectrum compared to good sleepers in other areas. During the REM sleep, the beta1 power spectrum was lower in the prefrontal cortex in primary insomnia patients compared to good sleepers; while no significant difference between groups was obtained for the other areas. Conclusions The present study shows a specific prefrontal sleep pattern during the whole sleep period. In addition, we suggest that primary insomnia patients displayed a dysfunction in the reactivation of the limbic system during the REM sleep and we give additional arguments in favor of a sleep-protection mechanism displayed by primary insomnia patients.

To gain an insight into the neurobiological processes linked to facial affect recognition, we investigated both induced and evoked oscillatory activity by calculating the Event Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) and the Inter Trial Coherence (ITC) during facial affect recognition. Fearful and neutral faces as well as nonface patches were presented to 24 patients with schizophrenia and 24 matched healthy controls while EEG was recorded. The participants' task was to recognize facial expressions. Because previous findings with healthy controls showed that facial feature decoding was associated primarily with oscillatory activity in the theta band, we analyzed ERSP and ITC in this frequency band in the time interval of 140-200 ms, which corresponds to the N170 component. Event-related theta activity and phase-locking to facial expressions, but not to nonface patches, predicted emotion recognition performance in both controls and patients. Event-related changes in theta amplitude and phase-locking were found to be significantly weaker in patients compared with healthy controls, which is in line with previous investigations showing decreased neural synchronization in the low frequency bands in patients with schizophrenia. Neural synchrony is thought to underlie distributed information processing. Our results indicate a less effective functioning in the recognition process of facial features, which may contribute to a less effective social cognition in schizophrenia.

The problem caused by the sparse and unsteady feature of BCI command, a two-layer shared-control strategy is proposed to steer the intelligent wheelchair. The first one is a machine decision layer which responsible for enabling/disabling the BCI command in a certain context, such as bifurcations and multiple-directions caused by new obstacles in the environment or deadlocks. The second one is a human intention matching layer which is used to generate suitable motion command with consideration of the human user's ability of driving the wheelchair, as well as the situation awareness of potential directions in a known environment. To achieve efficient navigation and position under condition of decoding uncertainly of BCI, the paper provides a navigation system to validate user's commands. And a steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) of the BCI as the human machine interface (HMI), the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is applied to analyze the frequency components of SSVEP in electroencephalogram(EEG). Experiments have been performed by a number of able-bodied volunteers in a structured known environment. The experiment results show that all volunteers are able to successfully operate the wheelchair with a high level of robustness.

However, current systems still struggle with a level of unreliability requiring improvement, so that the full potential of these systems can be used in the future. Here, we suggest to improve the performance and robustness of classification outcomes by postprocessing the raw score values with the history of previous classifications. For this several postprocessing methods that operate on the classification outcomes are investigated. In particular, the data was classified after preprocessing using a support vector machine ( SVM). The output of the SVM, i.e. the raw score values, were postprocessed using previously obtained scores to account for trends in the classification result. The respective methods differ in the way the transformation is performed. The idea is to use trends, like the rise of the score values approaching an upcoming movement, to yield a better prediction in terms of detection accuracy and/or an earlier time point. We present results from different subjects where upcoming voluntary movements of the right arm were predicted using movement related cortical potentials from the EEG. The results illustrate that better and earlier predictions are indeed possible with the suggested methods. However, the best postprocessing method was rather subject-specific. Finally, we use straightforward ensemble approaches to exemplify how the methods can be directly used in an application and how this can influence the overall movement prediction performance. Depending on the requirements of the application at hand, postprocessing the classification scores as suggested here can be used to find the best compromise between prediction accuracy and time point.

Classic studies propose that templates are encoded insustained activity of sensory neurons. However, stimulus encoding is itself dynamic, tracing a complex trajectory through activity space. Which part of this trajectory is pre-activated to reflect the template? Here were corded magneto- and electroencephalography during a visual target-detection task, and used pattern analyses to decode template, stimulus, and decision-variable representation. Our findings ran counter to the dominant model of sustained pre-activation. Instead, template information emerged transiently around stimulus onset and quickly subsided. Cross-generalization between stimulus and template coding, indicating a shared neural representation, occurred only briefly. Our results are compatible with the proposal that template representation relies on a matched filter, transforming input into task-appropriate output. This proposal was consistent with asigned difference response at the perceptual decision stage, which can be explained by a simple neural model.

The developed navigation control interface relies on Steady State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP), whose features are discriminated in real time in the electroencephalographic (EEG) data by means of the CNN. The proposed approach has been evaluated through navigation by walking in an immersive and plausible virtual environment (VE), thus enhancing the involvement of the participant and his perception of the VE. Results show that the BCI based on a CNN can be profitably applied for decoding SSVEP features in navigation scenarios, where a reduced number of commands needs to be reliably and rapidly selected. The participant was able to accomplish a waypoint walking task within the VE, by controlling navigation through of the only brain activity.

Volumetric imaging of brain activity with spatial-frequency decoding of neuromagnetic signals	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Wavelet; Spatial filter; Magnetoencephalography; High-frequency oscillation; Neuroimaging; Brain	EVOKED MAGNETIC-FIELDS; OSCILLATIONS; MEG; EPILEPSY; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; LOCALIZATION; BEAMFORMER; CHILDREN; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; RECONSTRUCTION	Background: The brain generates signals in a wide frequency range (similar to 2840 Hz). Existing magnetoencephalography (MEG) methods typically detect brain activity in a median-frequency range (1-70 Hz). The objective of the present study was to develop a new method to utilize the frequency signatures for source imaging. New method: Morlet wavelet transform and two-step beamforming were integrated into a systematic approach to estimate magnetic sources in time-frequency domains. A grid-frequency kernel (GFK) was developed to decode the correlation between each time-frequency representation and grid voxel. Brain activity was reconstructed by accumulating spatial- and frequency-locked signals in the full spectral data for all grid voxels. To test the new method, MEG data were recorded from 20 healthy subjects and 3 patients with verified epileptic foci. Results: The experimental results showed that the new method could accurately localize brain activation in auditory cortices. The epileptic foci localized with the new method were spatially concordant with invasive recordings. Comparison with existing methods: Compared with well-known existing methods, the new method is objective because it scans the entire brain without making any assumption about the number of sources. The novel feature of the new method is its ability to localize high-frequency sources. Conclusions: The new method could accurately localize both low- and high-frequency brain activities. The detection of high-frequency MEG signals can open a new avenue in the study of the human brain function as well as a variety of brain disorders. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The CAP is composed by A-phases that are related to a change in amplitude, frequency or both from the background activity epochs, called B-phases. Depending on the type of increase the A-phase could be classified as A1, A2 or A3 subtype. This paper proposes the usage of the Teager Energy Operator (TEO) to analyze the amplitude changes in the different frequency-bands to detect A-phases subtypes. The TEO classification performance is compared with the performance of a state-of-the art EEG feature, applied previously for CAP scoring and referred as the macro-micro structure descriptor (MMSD). In general, the TEO is the best feature and the improved results were obtained in the delta band for the A1 and A2 sub-types. More precisely, a sensitivity and specificity of 80.31% and 82.93% were obtained for the A1 subtype, respectively. A2 phases were detected with 76.96% of sensitivity and 73.22% of specificity. The two features detected A3 subtype with approximately the same sensitivity (approx. 70%) and specificity (approx. 75%), however the results were improved by considering the highest frequency band. These results are consistent with the frequency content of the different subphases.

The training of WNNs involves the configuration of the weight values between neurons. The backpropagation training algorithm, which is a gradient-descent method, can be used for this training purpose. Nonetheless, the solutions found by this algorithm often get trapped at local minima. In this paper, a harmony search-based algorithm is proposed for the training of WNNs. The training of WNNs, thus can be formulated as a continuous optimization problem, where the objective is to maximize the overall classification accuracy. Each candidate solution proposed by the harmony search algorithm represents a specific WNN architecture. In order to speed up the training process, the solution space is divided into disjoint partitions during the random initialization step of harmony search algorithm. The proposed training algorithm is tested onthree benchmark problems from the UCI machine learning repository, as well as one real life application, namely, the classification of electroencephalography signals in the task of epileptic seizure detection. The results obtained show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional harmony search algorithm in terms of overall classification accuracy.

The possibility of detecting movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) at the single trial level has been explored for closing the motor control loop with brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for neurorehabilitation. A distinct feature of MRCPs is that the movement kinetic information is encoded in the brain potential prior to the onset of the movement, which makes it possible to timely drive external devices to provide sensory feedback according to the efferent activity from the brain. The aim of this study was to compare methods for the detection (different spatial filters) and classification (features extracted from various domains) of MRCPs from continuous electroencephalography recordings from executed and imagined movements from healthy subjects (n = 24) and attempted movements from stroke patients (n = 6) to optimize the performance of MRCP-based BCIs for neurorehabilitation. Approach. The MRCPs from four cue-based tasks were detected with a template matching approach and a set of spatial filters, and classified with a linear support vector machine using the combination of temporal, spectral, timescale, or entropy-based features. Main results. The best spatial filter (large Laplacian spatial filter (LLSF)) resulted in a true positive rate of 82 +/- 9%, 78 +/- 12% and 72 +/- 9% (with detections occurring similar to 200 ms before the onset of the movement) for executed, imagined and attempted movements (stroke patients). The best feature combination (temporal and spectral) led to pairwise classification of 73 +/- 9%, 64 +/- 10% and 80 +/- 12%. When the detection was combined with classification, 60 +/- 10%, 49 +/- 10% and 58 +/- 10% of the movements were both correctly detected and classified for executed, imagined and attempted movements. A similar performance for detection and classification was obtained with optimized spatial filtering. Significance. A simple setup with an LLSF is useful for detecting cued movements while the combination of features from the time and frequency domain can optimize the decoding of kinetic information from MRCPs; this may be used in neuromodulatory BCIs.

In fact, these techniques allow now to measure the MW with a high time resolution (e.g. few seconds). Despite such advancements, one of the outstanding problems of these techniques regards their ability to maintain a high reliability over time (e.g. high accuracy of classification even across consecutive days) without performing any recalibration procedure. Such characteristic will be highly desirable in real world applications, in which human operators could use such approach without undergo a daily training of the device. In this work, we reported that if a simple classifier is calibrated by using a low number of brain spectral features, between those ones strictly related to the MW (i.e. Frontal and Occipital Theta and Parietal Alpha rhythms), those features will make the classifier performance stable over time. In other words, the discrimination accuracy achieved by the classifier will not degrade significantly across different days (i.e. until one week). The methodology has been tested on twelve Air Traffic Controls (ATCOs) trainees while performing different Air Traffic Management (ATM) scenarios under three different difficulty levels.

Using network dynamic fMRI for detection of epileptogenic foci	BMC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Epilepsy; Seizure; fMRI; Power spectrum scale invariance; Autocorrelation function; Classification; Complexity; Chaos; Fractal	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EEG-FMRI; BRAIN NETWORKS; SMALL-WORLD; MRI; DYSREGULATION; PATTERNS; SURGERY; SPIKES	Background: Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders. It remains medically intractable for about one-third of patients with focal epilepsy, for whom precise localization of the epileptogenic zone responsible for seizure initiation may be critical for successful surgery. Existing fMRI literature points to widespread network disturbances in functional connectivity. Per previous scalp and intracranial EEG studies and consistent with excessive local synchronization during interictal discharges, we hypothesized that, relative to same regions in healthy controls, epileptogenic foci would exhibit less chaotic dynamics, identifiable via entropic analyses of resting state fMRI time series. Methods: In order to first validate this hypothesis on a cohort of patients with known ground truth, here we test individuals with well-defined epileptogenic foci (left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy). We analyzed voxel-wise resting-state fMRI time-series using the autocorrelation function (ACF), an entropic measure of regulation and feedback, and performed follow-up seed-to-voxel functional connectivity analysis. Disruptions in connectivity of the region exhibiting abnormal dynamics were examined in relation to duration of epilepsy and patients' cognitive performance using a delayed verbal memory recall task. Results: ACF analysis revealed constrained (less chaotic) functional dynamics in left temporal lobe epilepsy patients, primarily localized to ipsilateral temporal pole, proximal to presumed focal points. Autocorrelation decay rates differentiated, with 100 % accuracy, between patients and healthy controls on a subject-by-subject basis within a leave-one-subject out classification framework. Regions identified via ACF analysis formed a less efficient network in patients, as compared to controls. Constrained dynamics were linked with locally increased and long-range decreased connectivity that, in turn, correlated significantly with impaired memory (local left temporal connectivity) and epilepsy duration (left temporal - posterior cingulate cortex connectivity). Conclusions: Our current results suggest that data driven functional MRI methods that target network dynamics hold promise in providing clinically valuable tools for identification of epileptic regions.

This definition has been used since the era of Hughlings Jackson, and does not take into account subsequent advances made in epilepsy and neuroscience research. The clinical diagnosis of a seizure is empirical, based upon constellations of certain signs and symptoms, while simultaneously ruling out a list of potential imitators of seizures. Seizures should be delimited in time, but the borders of ictal (during a seizure), interictal (between seizures) and postictal (after a seizure) often are indistinct. EEG recording is potentially very helpful for confirmation, classification and localization. About a half-dozen common EEG patterns are encountered during seizures. Clinicians rely on researchers to answer such questions as why seizures start, spread and stop, whether seizures involve increased synchrony, the extent to which extra-cortical structures are involved, and how to identify the seizure network and at what points interventions are likely to be helpful. Basic scientists have different challenges in use of the word 'seizure,' such as distinguishing seizures from normal behavior, which would seem easy but can be very difficult because some rodents have EEG activity during normal behavior that resembles spike-wave discharge or bursts of rhythmic spiking. It is also important to define when a seizure begins and stops so that seizures can be quantified accurately for pre-clinical studies. When asking what causes seizures, the transition to a seizure and differentiating the pre-ictal, ictal and post-ictal state is also important because what occurs before a seizure could be causal and may warrant further investigation for that reason. These and other issues are discussed by three epilepsy researchers with clinical and basic science expertise.

The system allows you to create complex stimuli for the perception that the subject uses a visual, acoustic or olfactory system. For registration of biological signals earmarked voice recording and electroencephalogram (EEG). Since stimulus material acts on three different channels of human perception, in the biotechnical system includes means of visual, audio-visual and olfactory stimulation. All system components are integrated into the control unit shown in the form of a personal computer with pre-installed special software. A feature of the system work scenario is the registration sample speech only after the marked changes in the electroencephalogram caused by the perception of the appropriate stimulus. This approach increases the credibility of the sampling of speech, which can then be used to form the rules of recognition of types of emotions. With this system were formed multimodal database comprising 280 different russian speakers phrases and corresponding EEG recording. The goals of experiments are studies attribute spaces are invariant to the physical nature of the signal and adequately reflects the emotional response of the subject, and testing the hypothesis of invariance of attributes allocated to the national characteristics of speech signals. In order to study the dynamics of emotional response developed a method that allows to explore a variety of discrete portions of biological signals. The technique is based on the idea of shifting the window, which is carried out static analysis. For each window are used as classical methods of calculation of the spectrum of the signal, and the methods of nonlinear dynamics. System showed enough high accuracy interpreting both the EEG pattern (83%) and with the speech samples (96%) of the multimodal base emotions and objects taken from German base Emo-DB (92%). Evaluation of different emotional states a person can be used in the diagnosis of psychosomatic and psychomotor disturbances.

Setting: Hospital, homes of subjects, and a primary care facility. Participants: Subjects (N=4; 3 men, 1 woman) who were in a minimally conscious state (age range, 27-53y; 1-12y after brain injury). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Awareness detection was determined from sensorimotor patterns that differed for each motor imagery task. BCI performance was determined from the mean classification accuracy of brain patterns by using a BCI signal processing framework and assessment of performance in multiple sessions. Results: All subjects demonstrated significant and appropriate brain activation during the initial assessment, and real-time feedback was provided to improve arousal. Consistent activation was observed in multiple sessions. Conclusions: The electroencephalogram-based assessment showed that patients in a minimally conscious state may have the capacity to operate a simple BCI-based communication system, even without any detectable volitional control of movement.

It is an area that has not been fully explored in the developing countries like Nigeria. The aim of the present study is to determine the pattern of presentation of late onset epilepsy with the view to identifying the etiologic as well as describe their electro-clinical pattern. Methods 120 consecutive patients presenting at the University College Hospital with LOE were recruited. A detailed history was obtained in every case, and complete neurological examination was performed. EEGs were done in all patients. Contrast CT Scans and MRI were performed. Result One hundred and twenty subjects comprising 71 (59.2%) males and 49 (40.8%) females were studied. The ages of the patients ranged between 25 and 85 years with a mean of 53years (sd = 14.6). The ages at onset of epilepsy ranged between 25 and 84 years with a mean of 52 (sd=14.8). All the subjects had classifiable seizure types, 31 (25.8%) had generalized seizure. The most common type of seizure was partial seizure diagnosed in 89 (74.2%) subjects. Fifty two (43.3%) of the subjects had abnormal neurological findings. Twenty one (30.9%) had cerebral infarcts and 20 (29.4%) had cerebral tumor. Those with symptomatic epilepsy were more likely to have neurologic deficit, simple partial seizure, secondarily generalized seizure, focal epileptiform discharges and focal slow waves. Conclusion The most common abnormalities in LOE were cerebral infarct and brain tumor. A careful history, neurological examination and an EEG are adequate in the initial work-up of patients with LOE.

Motor imagery-induced EEG patterns in individuals with spinal cord injury and their impact on brain-computer interface accuracy	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Meeting	JUN 03-07, 2013	Pacific Grove, CA	Natl Inst Hlth, Natl Sci Fdn		brain-computer interface; spinal cord injury; motor imagery; electroencephalogram	FUNCTIONAL ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; HAND; NEUROPROSTHESIS; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; PATIENT; PEOPLE; STATES; GRASP; MODE	Objective. Assimilating the diagnosis complete spinal cord injury (SCI) takes time and is not easy, as patients know that there is no 'cure' at the present time. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can facilitate daily living. However, inter-subject variability demands measurements with potential user groups and an understanding of how they differ to healthy users BCIs are more commonly tested with. Thus, a three-class motor imagery (MI) screening (left hand, right hand, feet) was performed with a group of 10 able-bodied and 16 complete spinal-cord-injured people (paraplegics, tetraplegics) with the objective of determining what differences were present between the user groups and how they would impact upon the ability of these user groups to interact with a BCI. Approach. Electrophysiological differences between patient groups and healthy users are measured in terms of sensorimotor rhythm deflections from baseline during MI, electroencephalogram microstate scalp maps and strengths of inter-channel phase synchronization. Additionally, using a common spatial pattern algorithm and a linear discriminant analysis classifier, the classification accuracy was calculated and compared between groups. Main results. It is seen that both patient groups (tetraplegic and paraplegic) have some significant differences in event-related desynchronization strengths, exhibit significant increases in synchronization and reach significantly lower accuracies (mean (M) = 66.1%) than the group of healthy subjects (M = 85.1%). Significance. The results demonstrate significant differences in electrophysiological correlates of motor control between healthy individuals and those individuals who stand to benefit most from BCI technology (individuals with SCI). They highlight the difficulty in directly translating results from healthy subjects to participants with SCI and the challenges that, therefore, arise in providing BCIs to such individuals.

EPILEPSI			Turkish	Article						Pedigree; bathing epilepsy; autosomal dominant; hot water epilepsy		Objectives: Hot water epilepsy (HWE), also called as bathing epilepsy is a reflex epilepsy in which seizures are triggered by the stimulus of bathing in hot water. The relationship between epilepsy syndromes and genetic have been known for a long time. In this study, we aimed to determine the inheritance pattern of the five HWE cases with a positive family history. Methods: Pedigrees of the five index cases had a positive family history were drawn and their family members were interviewed. Age, sex, seizure types (classified according to ILAE Task Force on Classification and Terminology), seizure frequency, neurological examination findings, if available EEG and MRI results of patients were recorded. Results: Sixteen patients from five families were included in the study. The patients (ten male, six female) were between 15 and 73 years of age. Four families without consanguineous marriage had patients with HWE at least two generations. One family with consanguineous marriage had with HWE two generations. Conclusion: When analyzed pedigrees, except one family, the disease appears at least two generation in the same family without consanguineous marriage. Our data suggest that the HWE may be an autosomal dominant inherited disorder with low- penetrance and lowexpressivity.

However, most current studies of epileptic seizure prediction focus on high sensitivity and low false-positive rate only and lack the flexibility for a variety of epileptic seizures and patients' physical conditions. Therefore, a novel dynamic update framework for epileptic seizure prediction is proposed in this paper. In this framework, two basic sample pools are constructed and updated dynamically. Furthermore, the prediction model can be updated to be the most appropriate one for the prediction of seizures' arrival. Mahalanobis distance is introduced in this part to solve the problem of side information, measuring the distance between two data sets. In addition, a multichannel feature extraction method based on Hilbert-Huang transform and extreme learning machine is utilized to extract the features of a patient's preseizure state against the normal state. At last, a dynamic update epileptic seizure prediction system is built up. Simulations on Freiburg database show that the proposed system has a better performance than the one without update. The research of this paper is significantly helpful for clinical applications, especially for the exploitation of online portable devices.

But, to the best of our knowledge, nobody has ever built an actual device that implements this function. Therefore we present the "Inventometer", a fun and playful wearable device that measures and displays epiphanometric data to a real light bulb, so its wearer and others in the environment are alerted to "aha! moments" ("eureka moments"), epiphanies, inventions, and idea formation in the brain/mind of the wearer. It senses brainwave signals indicative of epiphanies, and indicates to others a continuously varying epiphanometric quantity by adjusting the light output of the bulb. It uses simple machine learning on EEG (electroencephalogaph) brainwave signals to automatically detect and quantify the novelty of ideas formed in the brain. Long exposure photographs made while one or more Inventometer wearers walk around a room result in a Phenomenal Augmented Reality (Augmented Reality of or pertaining to physical phenomena and phenomenology). In particular, these "epiphanographs", over time, indicate what sorts of things in an environment tended to stimulate epiphanies and to what degree epiphanogrammetry as a possible new field of study. Brain Games are designed so multiple people can compete using their minds much like people competing using their bodies (e.g. arm wrestling). The "brightest" people in a room become visible by way of their epiphanographs. But with their wearable display bulbs glowing brightly, they also serve as a distraction to each other, thus introducing a richly complex and competitive collective biofeedback gaming space. The device is meant to appeal to people of all ages, from children to university students, and thus forms a good teaching for making skills, science, and engineering (e.g. power electronics, 3D printing, etc.). It is also an ongoing research project.

The hybrid intelligent system aims to exploit the advantages of the constituent models and, at the same time, alleviate their limitations. It is able to learn incrementally from data samples (owing to Fuzzy Min-Max neural network), explain its predicted outputs (owing to the Classification and Regression Tree), and achieve high classification performances (owing to Random Forest). To evaluate the effectiveness of the hybrid intelligent system, three benchmark medical data sets, viz., Breast Cancer Wisconsin, Pima Indians Diabetes, and Liver Disorders from the UCI Repository of Machine Learning, are used for evaluation. A number of useful performance metrics in medical applications which include accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, as well as the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve are computed. The results are analyzed and compared with those from other methods published in the literature. The experimental outcomes positively demonstrate that the hybrid intelligent system is effective in undertaking medical data classification tasks. More importantly, the hybrid intelligent system not only is able to produce good results but also to elucidate its knowledge base with a decision tree. As a result, domain users (i.e., medical practitioners) are able to comprehend the prediction given by the hybrid intelligent system; hence accepting its role as a useful medical decision support tool.

However, the actual speed at which the human brain can distinguish familiar from unknown faces still remains debated. In particular, it is not clear whether familiarity can be extracted from rapid face individualization or if it requires additional time consuming processing. We recorded scalp EEG activity in 28 subjects performing a go/no-go, famous/non-famous, unrepeated, face recognition task. Speed constraints were used to encourage subjects to use the earliest familiarity information available. Event related potential (ERP) analyses show that both the N170 and the N250 components were modulated by familiarity. The N170 modulation was related to behaviour: subjects presenting the strongest N170 modulation were also faster but less accurate than those who only showed weak N170 modulation. A complementary Multi-Variate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) confirmed ERP results and provided some more insights into the dynamics of face recognition as the N170 differential effect appeared to be related to a first transitory phase (transitory bump of decoding power) starting at around 140 ms, which returned to baseline afterwards. This bump of activity was henceforth followed by an increase of decoding power starting around 200 ms after stimulus onset. Overall, our results suggest that rather than a simple single-process, familiarity for faces may rely on a cascade of neural processes, including a coarse and fast stage starting at 140 ms and a more refined but slower stage occurring after 200 ms.

Fast Oscillatory Commands from the Motor Cortex Can Be Decoded by the Spinal Cord for Force Control	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						conductance-based model; cortical oscillation; force control; motoneuron; motor control; simulation	EFFECTIVE CORTICOSPINAL INTERACTION; TASK-DEPENDENT MODULATION; PRECISION GRIP TASK; EEG-EMG COHERENCE; CORTICOMUSCULAR COHERENCE; MUSCLE FORCE; VOLUNTARY CONTRACTIONS; ISOMETRIC COMPENSATION; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; DISCHARGE PROPERTIES	Oscillations in the beta and gamma bands (13-30 Hz; 35-70 Hz) have often been observed in motor cortical outputs that reach the spinal cord, acting on motoneurons and interneurons. However, the frequencies of these oscillations are above the muscle force frequency range. A current view is that the transformation of the motoneuron pool inputs into force is linear. For this reason possible roles for these oscillations are unclear, since if this transformation is linear, the high frequencies in the motoneuron inputs (e.g., 20 Hz from pyramidal tract neurons) would be filtered out by the muscle and have no effect on force control. A biologically inspired mathematical model of the neuromuscular system was used to investigate the impact of high-frequency cortical oscillatory activity on force control. The model simulation results evidenced that a typical motoneuron pool has a nonlinear behavior that enables the decoding of a high-frequency oscillatory input. An input at a single frequency (e.g., beta band) leads to an increase in the steady-state force generated by the muscle. When the input oscillation was amplitude modulated at a given low frequency, the force oscillated at this frequency. In both cases, the mechanism relies on the recruitment and derecruitment of motor units in response to the oscillatory descending drive. Therefore, the results from this study suggest a potential role in force control for cortical oscillations at frequencies at or above the beta band, despite the low-pass behavior of the muscles.

We have developed an asynchronous brain-machine interface (BMI)-based lower limb exoskeleton control system based on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). Approach. By decoding electroencephalography signals in real-time, users are able to walk forward, turn right, turn left, sit, and stand while wearing the exoskeleton. SSVEP stimulation is implemented with a visual stimulation unit, consisting of five light emitting diodes fixed to the exoskeleton. A canonical correlation analysis (CCA) method for the extraction of frequency information associated with the SSVEP was used in combination with k-nearest neighbors. Main results. Overall, 11 healthy subjects participated in the experiment to evaluate performance. To achieve the best classification, CCA was first calibrated in an offline experiment. In the subsequent online experiment, our results exhibit accuracies of 91.3 +/- 5.73%, a response time of 3.28 +/- 1.82 s, an information transfer rate of 32.9 +/- 9.13 bits/min, and a completion time of 1100 +/- 154.92 s for the experimental parcour studied. Significance. The ability to achieve such high quality BMI control indicates that an SSVEP-based lower limb exoskeleton for gait assistance is becoming feasible.

J	Kashihara, K				Kashihara, Koji			A brain-computer interface for potential non-verbal facial communication based on EEG signals related to specific emotions	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neutral faces; source localization; aversive conditioning; face recognition; electroencephalogram; brain computer interfaces	HUMAN NEURAL SYSTEM; FACE; PERCEPTION; CORTEX; RESPONSES; FAMILIAR; FUSIFORM; IMAGERY; GAZE	Unlike assistive technology for verbal communication, the brain-machine or brain-computer interface (BMI/BCI) has not been established as a non-verbal communication tool for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Face-to-face communication enables access to rich emotional information, but individuals suffering from neurological disorders, such as ALS and autism, may not express their emotions or communicate their negative feelings. Although emotions may be inferred by looking at facial expressions, emotional prediction for neutral faces necessitates advanced judgment. The process that underlies brain neuronal responses to neutral faces and causes emotional changes remains unknown. To address this problem, therefore, this study attempted to decode conditioned emotional reactions to neutral face stimuli. This direction was motivated by the assumption that if electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can be used to detect patients' emotional responses to specific inexpressive faces, the results could be incorporated into the design and development of BMI/BCI-based non-verbal communication tools. To these ends, this study investigated how a neutral face associated with a negative emotion modulates rapid central responses in face processing and then identified cortical activities. The conditioned neutral face-triggered event-related potentials that originated from the posterior temporal lobe statistically significantly changed during late face processing (600-700 ms) after stimulus, rather than in early face processing activities, such as P1 and N170 responses. Source localization revealed that the conditioned neutral faces increased activity in the right fusiform gyrus (FG). This study also developed an efficient method for detecting implicit negative emotional responses to specific faces by using EEG signals. A classification method based on a support vector machine enables the easy classification of neutral faces that trigger specific individual emotions. In accordance with this classification, a face on a computer morphs into a sad or displeased countenance. The proposed method could be incorporated as a part of non-verbal communication tools to enable emotional expression.

This study investigates the foundations of these metacognitive abilities, specifically focusing on the relationship between confidence and error judgments in human perceptual decision making. Electroencephalography studies have identified the error positivity (Pe)-an event-related component observed following incorrect choices-as a robust neural index of participants' awareness of their errors in simple decision tasks. Here we assessed whether the Pe also varies in a graded way with participants' subjective ratings of decision confidence, as expressed on a 6-point scale after each trial of a dot count perceptual decision task. We observed clear, graded modulation of the Pe by confidence, with monotonic reduction in Pe amplitude associated with increasing confidence in the preceding choice. This effect was independent of objective accuracy. Multivariate decoding analyses indicated that neural markers of error detection were predictive of varying levels of confidence in correct decisions, including subtle shifts in high-confidence trials. These results suggest that shared mechanisms underlie two forms of metacognitive evaluation that are often treated separately, with consequent implications for current theories of their neurocognitive basis.

However, the resting state is an uncontrolled condition and its heterogeneity is neither sufficiently understood nor accounted for. We test the hypothesis that subjects exhibit unstable wakefulness, i.e., drift into sleep during typical resting-state experiments. Analyzing 1,147 resting-state functional magnetic resonance data sets, we revealed a reliable loss of wakefulness in a third of subjects within 3 min and demonstrated the dynamic nature of the resting state, with fundamental changes in the associated functional neuroanatomy. Implications include the necessity of wakefulness monitoring and modeling, taking measures to maintain a state of wakefulness, acknowledging the possibility of sleep and exploring its consequences, and especially the critical assessment of possible false-positive or false-negative results.

Online Control of a Humanoid Robot through Hand Movement Imagination using CSP and ECoG based Features	2015 37TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 25-29, 2015	Milan, ITALY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				Intention recognition through decoding brain activity could lead to a powerful and independent Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI) allowing for intuitive control of devices like robots. A common strategy for realizing such a system is the motor imagery (MI) BCI using electro-encephalography (EEG). Changing to invasive recordings like electrocorticography (ECoG) allows extracting very robust features and easy introduction of an idle state, which might simplify the mental task and allow the subject to focus on the environment. Especially for multi-channel recordings like ECoG, common spatial patterns (CSP) provide a powerful tool for feature optimization and dimensionality reduction. This work focuses on an invasive and independent MI BCI that allows triggering from an idle state, and therefore facilitates tele-operation of a humanoid robot. The task was to lift a can with the robot's hand. One subject participated and reached 95.4 % mean online accuracy after six runs of 40 trials. To our knowledge, this is the first online experiment with a MI BCI using CSPs from ECoG signals.

Often these findings exist at different scales of observation, and are not reconciled into a common understanding. Here we develop a new, multiscale mathematical model of cortical electric activity with realistic mesoscopic connectivity. Relating the model dynamics to experimental and clinical findings leads us to propose three classes of dynamical mechanisms for the onset of focal seizures in a unified framework. These three classes are: (i) globally induced focal seizures; (ii) globally supported focal seizures; (iii) locally induced focal seizures. Using model simulations we illustrate these onset mechanisms and show how the three classes can be distinguished. Specifically, we find that although all focal seizures typically appear to arise from localised tissue, the mechanisms of onset could be due to either localised processes or processes on a larger spatial scale. We conclude that although focal seizures might have different patient-specific aetiologies and electrographic signatures, our model suggests that dynamically they can still be classified in a clinically useful way. Additionally, this novel classification according to the dynamical mechanisms is able to resolve some of the previously conflicting experimental and clinical findings.

In this paper, a machine learning (ML) scheme is presented to automate the diagnose process. It is achieved by discriminating the study participants, i. e., the MDD patients and healthy controls based on the features computed from event-related potential (ERP) data. The ERP features such as the P300 amplitudes and the latencies are computed from the study participants at central locations, i. e, Fz, Cz, and Pz. The ERP features are further used as input to the proposed ML scheme. It is followed by rank-based feature selection involving criteria: t-test, receiver operating characteristics (roc) and wilcoxon. For classification purposes, the logistic regression (LR) classifier is utilized. Finally, the P300 intensities are observed significantly higher in the healthy controls as compared with the MDD patients. In addition, the larger P300 latencies are found in the MDD patients as compared with the healthy controls. Based on the differences of ERP features between the 2 groups, the highest classification accuracy is achieved, i. e., 90.5%. It is concluded that the input features such as the P300 intensities and latencies can discriminate the MDD patients from healthy controls based on a single channel ERP data. In conclusion, the ERP features can be utilized to automate the diagnosis of MDD.

The experimentation consisted in the alternated realization of basic arithmetic mental calculations and resting periods. EEG data were analyzed using sliding windows of 2s length. The experimental population was comprised of fifteen healthy subjects who participated in three sessions on different days. The features used for the classification process were the power spectral density over the beta band ([14-35] Hz) and the scaling exponent obtained via detrended fluctuation analysis. Both indices were estimated over four channels, specifically selected for each subject. The performance was evaluated using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) by measuring the overall classification performance of each experimental session with a cross-validation procedure, and by transferring the model obtained from one session to the others called inter Session Validation (iSV). The best AUC values computed in each cross-validation session were: 0.87 +/- 0.067, 0.89 +/- 0.056 and 0.88 +/- 0.040 respectively; and the iSV provided a value of 0.67 +/- 0.122. These high values indicate that a mental calculation paradigm and a combination of features can efficiently control a BCI system. Notwithstanding that several days passed between sessions, the AUC mean value estimated for the iSV is similar to the performance of a motor imagery-BCI calibrated on the same day.

Even the simplest reaching task results from a movement planning phase as well as a movement execution phase. To facilitate the neural decoding of human reaching, brain activity in both movement planning and execution phases should be investigated. Many related studies focused on the correlation between movement kinematics and brain activity during movement execution or imagery. In this paper, we studied whether particular reaching parameters were encoded in the brain activity recorded by high-density EEG during the movement planning phase. Alpha and beta power over ten brain regions during the movement planning phase were correlated with reaction time/endpoint error during execution. The planning phase was divided into 2 movement planning intervals: 1) [0 250] ms and 2) [250 500] ms, with respect to the target onset to study the temporal characteristics of the power changes. Our results show that the greater the increase of the alpha band power in the left frontal region and the smaller the decrease of the beta band power in the right frontal region in the movement planning interval 2, the longer is the reaction time. A decrease of the beta band power in the motor and frontal regions from the two planning intervals correspond to a higher endpoint error. Moreover, higher alpha band power in the movement planning interval 2 over left parietal regions was related to smaller endpoint errors.

The system distinguishes between 'Normal', 'Pre-Seizure' and 'Seizure' states using on-the-fly calculated features representing the statistical measures for specifically filtered signals from the raw data. It was noticed that for a large number of cases, the seizure waveforms manifest higher energy components during the seizure episodes as compared to the normal brain activity in specific bands of frequencies. Same is also true for a separate band of frequency where the energy levels change from higher to lower when a patient goes from Normal to a Seizure state. This fact has been exploited in this paper and specific filter has been developed to isolate the seizure band. The Fuzzy inference system (FIS) has been developed on the calculated measures for the filtered signal from this band and classification is performed on the basis of certain experimental thresholds. The complexity of calculations has been kept quite low which makes the algorithm highly suitable for implementation in a small micro-controller environment with near-real-time operation. This gives a more practical functionality for such a system to be used in a wearable fashion over the existing Electroencephalogram (EEG) based seizure detection systems due to their complex pattern classification methodologies. Based on the presented technique, a wearable ubiquitous system can be easily developed with applications in personal healthcare and clinical usage. In this case, the users are not necessarily restricted to the clinical environment in which many devices are connected to the patient externally. The wearable devices allow the user to continue daily activities while being monitored for seizure incidents. This will provide them with a window of 30 seconds before a seizure would occur. Although, a small amount of time, but can be very useful for the patient to change his/her position in order to avoid additional harm that could be inflicted on them while they are seizing. For example, a person is driving or handling power tools can stop, a person carrying a baby can lie-down, etc.	[Shakir, Mohamed; Malik, Aamir Saeed; Kamel, Nidal] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Ctr Intelligent Signal & Imaging Res, Neurosignal Proc Grp, Perak, Malaysia; [Qidwai, Uvais] Qatar Univ, Dept Comp Engn, KINDI Res Ctr, Doha, Qatar		Shakir, M (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Ctr Intelligent Signal & Imaging Res, Neurosignal Proc Grp, Perak, Malaysia.	uqidwai@qu.edu.qa	Malik, Aamir S/C-6904-2009	Malik, Aamir S/0000-0003-1085-3157					9	1	1	0	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-0-9893193-1-7				2014							276	279						4	Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Multidisciplinary	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science; Engineering	BE0UQ					2022-08-02	WOS:000367072600034

How does the brain represent the spatial location of objects? Retinotopic early visual cortex has precise location information but can only segment simple objects. On the other hand, higher visual areas can resolve complex objects but only have coarse location information. Thus coarse location of complex objects might be represented by either (a) feedback from higher areas to early retinotopic areas or (b) coarse position encoding in higher areas. We tested these alternatives by presenting various kinds of first- (edge-defined) and second-order (texture) objects. We applied multivariate classifiers to the pattern of EEG amplitudes across the scalp at a range of time points to trace the temporal dynamics of coarse location representation. For edge-defined objects, peak classification performance was high and early and thus attributable to the retinotopic layout of early visual cortex. For texture objects, it was low and late. Crucially, despite these differences in peak performance and timing, training a classifier on one object and testing it on others revealed that the topography at peak performance was the same for both first-and second-order objects. That is, the same location information, encoded by early visual areas, was available for both edge-defined and texture objects at different time points. These results indicate that locations of complex objects such as textures, although not represented in the bottom-up sweep, are encoded later by neural patterns resembling the bottom-up ones. We conclude that feedback mechanisms play an important role in coarse location representation of complex objects.

In this work, we present a seizure-detection processor that directly uses compressively-sensed electroencephalograms (EEGs) for embedded signal analysis. In addition to addressing communication, this has two advantages for local computation. First, with compressive sensing, reconstruction costs are typically severe, precluding embedded analysis; directly analyzing the compressed signals circumvents reconstruction costs, enabling embedded analysis within applications. Second, compared to Nyquist-sampled signals, the use of compressed representations reduces the computational energy of signal analysis due to the reduced number of signal samples. We describe an algorithmic formulation as well as a hardware architecture that enables two strong power-management knobs, wherein application-level performance can scale with computational energy. The two knobs are parameterized as follows: 1) xi, which quantifies the amount of data compression, and 2) nu, which determines the approximation error within the proposed compressed-domain processing algorithm. For xi and nu in the range 2-24x, the energy to extract signal features (over 18 channels) is 70.8-1.3 nJ, and the detector's performance for sensitivity, latency, and specificity is 96-91%, 4.7-5.3 sec., and 0.17-0.30 false-alarms/hr., respectively (compared to a baseline performance of 96%, 4.6 sec., and 0.15 false-alarms/hr.).

Independent of the invasiveness of the BCI systems tested, no sustained direct brain control and communication was demonstrated in a patient in CLIS so far. This suggested a more fundamental theoretical problem of learning and attention in brain communication with BCI/BMI, formulated in the extinction-of-thought hypothesis. While operant conditioning and goal-directed thinking seems impaired in complete paralysis, classical conditioning of brain responses might represent the only alternative. First experimental studies in CLIS using semantic conditioning support this assumption. Evidence that quality-of-life in locked-in-state is not as limited and poor as generally believed draise doubts that "patient wills" or "advanced directives"signed long-before the locked-in-state are useful. On the contrary, they might be used as an excuse to shorten anticipated long periods of care for these patients avoiding associated financial and social burdens. Current state and availability of BCI/BMI systems urge a broader societal discourse on the pressing ethical challenges associated with the advancements in neurotechnology and BCI/BMI research.

J	Tsanousa, A; Laskaris, N; Angelis, L				Tsanousa, Athina; Laskaris, Nikolaos; Angelis, Lefteris			A novel single-trial methodology for studying brain response variability based on archetypal analysis	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						MEG; Event-related dynamics; Information mining; Archetypal analysis; Trial-to-trial variability	EVOKED-RESPONSES; POTENTIAL COMPONENTS; DYNAMICS; EEG; NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; WAVELETS; SIGNALS; STATES	The objective of this paper is to present a methodology for deriving an intelligible synopsis of single-trial (ST) variability in brain responses. An algorithmic procedure, relying on temporal patterning and built over archetypal analysis, is introduced. Archetypical brain waves are first derived from the ensemble of brain responses and then used to unfold the observed variability. Using these archetypes as anchor points, homogeneous groups of ST-responses are detected and contrasted with each other. The new methodology incorporates steps for organizing the variability and presenting it by means of low-dimensional maps. Magnetoencephalographic responses from a visual stimulation paradigm are used for demonstrating and validating the approach. The results show that a small number of archetypes is sufficient for describing reliably the response variability. The groups of ST-responses, delineated around these archetypes, reflect differences in the way the ongoing activity interacts with the incoming stimulus. Estimates of signal-to-noise ratio are utilized in order to demonstrate that there is a significant informatior loss when response variability is left untreated. Moreover, ensemble averaging is employed for uniquely recovering the "true" response. Archetypal analysis provides a concise description of response variability which potentially can contribute in the understanding of its origin. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Participants passively listened to vocalizations or pseudo-utterances conveying anger, sadness, or happiness as the EEG was recorded. Simultaneous effects of vocal expression type and emotion were analyzed for three ERP components (N100, P200, late positive component). Emotional vocalizations and speech were differentiated very early (N100) and vocalizations elicited stronger, earlier, and more differentiated P200 responses than speech. At later stages (450-700 ms), anger vocalizations evoked a stronger late positivity (LPC) than other vocal expressions, which was similar but delayed for angry speech. Individuals with high trait anxiety exhibited early, heightened sensitivity to vocal emotions (particularly vocalizations). These data provide new neurophysiological evidence that vocalizations, as evolutionarily primitive signals, are accorded precedence over speech-embedded emotions in the human voice.

Methods: From our epilepsy surgery series, we identified 29 patients who underwent surgery for seizures, including certain types of generalised seizures, according to their ictal semiology. We systematically reviewed the brain imaging, video-EEG, surgical operation, and pathological findings data of these patients. Results: All patients had at least one type of generalised seizure according to the semiology; these seizures included epileptic spasms, myoclonic seizures, tonic seizures, atonic seizures and atypical absence seizures. Eight patients had a single type of seizure, 11 patients had two types of seizures, and 10 patients had more than two types of seizures. In addition to symptomatic generalised seizures, complex partial seizures were also recorded in eight patients. In 24 patients, the ictal semiology showed slight asymmetric movements in certain types of seizures. Generalised interictal epileptic discharges were recorded in 24 patients; and generalised ictal epileptic discharges as the only EEG pattern were recorded in 13 patients. Intracranial recording was performed in 20 patients; 10 of whom showed a rhythm of fast activities at the initiation of the seizures. Functional hemispherectomy was performed for three patients with hemispheric Lesions. Focal resection of the epileptogenic zone was performed in 26 patients. The resected epileptogenic zones involved a single lobe in 10 patients, two lobes in 11 patients, and three Lobes in 5 patients; the parietal lobe was the most commonly involved lobe (in 19 cases). Scar lesions (in 17 patients) were most commonly observed on pathological examination. At the last follow-up (mean 18 +/- 8.3 months, range 12-48), 17 (58.6%) patients were seizure-free. Conclusions: Certain patients with local brain lesions can have seizures with specific types of generalised semiology. An appropriate operation may be helpful for a portion of these patients.

ULTRA-SLOW FREQUENCY BANDS REFLECTING POTENTIAL COHERENCE BETWEEN NEOCORTICAL BRAIN REGIONS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						schizophrenia; Ultra Low Frequency; classification; MEG; PLV; SVM	NEURAL ACTIVITY; EEG COHERENCE; DELTA WAVES; SYNCHRONIZATION; MECHANISMS; CORTEX; POWER	Recent studies of electromagnetic ultra-slow waves (60.1 Hz) have suggested that they play a role in the integration of otherwise disassociated brain regions supporting vital functions (Ackermann and Borbely, 1997; Picchioni et al., 2010; Knyazev, 2012; Le Bon et al., 2012). We emphasize this spectral domain in probing sensor coherence issues raised by these studies using Hilbert phase coherences in the human MEG. In addition, we ask: will temporal-spatial phase coherence in regional brain oscillations obtained from the ultraslow spectral bands of multi-channel magnetoencephalograms (MEG) differentiate resting, "task-free" MEG records of normal control and schizophrenic subjects? The goal of the study is a comparison of the relative persistence of intra-regional phase locking values (PLVs), among 10, region-defined, sensors in examined in the resting multichannel, MEG records as a function of spectral frequency bands and diagnostic category. The following comparison of Hilbert-transform-engendered relative phases of each designated spectral band was made using their pair-wise PLVs. This indicated the proportion of shared cycle time in which the phase relations between the index location and reference leads were maintained. Leave one out, bootstrapping of the PLVs via a support vector machine (SVM), classified clinical status with 97.3% accuracy. It was generally the case that spectral bands <= 1.0 Hz generated the highest values of the PLVs and discriminated best between control and patient populations. We conclude that PLV analysis of the oscillatory patterns of MEG recordings in the ultraslow frequency bands suggest their functional significance in intra-regional signal coherence and provide a higher rate of classification of patients and normal subjects than the other spectral domains examined.

Materials and MethodsInterictal resting state fMRI and high-resolution MRI were performed on 14 left and 10 right TLE patients. Functional topology measures were calculated from fMRI using graph theory, and used to lateralize the epileptogenic hemisphere using quadratic discriminant analysis. Leave-one-out cross-validation prediction accuracy of CADFIG was compared to performance based on expert manual analysis (MA) of MRI, using video EEG as the "gold standard" for focus lateralization. ResultsCADFIG correctly lateralized 95.8% (23/24) of cases, compared to 66.7% (16/24) with expert MA of MRI. Combining MA with CADFIG allowed all cases (24/24) to be correctly lateralized. CADFIG correctly identified the affected hemisphere for all patients (8/8) where MRI failed to lateralize. ConclusionCADFIG based on fMRI lateralized the affected hemisphere in TLE with superior performance compared to expert MA of MRI. These results demonstrate that functional patterns in fMRI can be used with automated machine learning for diagnostic lateralization in TLE. Addition of fMRI-based tests to existing protocols for identifying the affected hemisphere in presurgical assessment can improve diagnostic accuracy and surgical outcome in TLE.J. Magn. Reson.

Therefore, denoising of signals is essential for accurate diagnosis of different heart diseases. This study examines and compares three different denoising techniques, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Multiscale Principal Component Analysis (MSPCA), and their influence on ECG signal classification. In order to extract significant features from ECG signals, wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) technique is employed. To classify ECG signals, ensemble machine learning classifier called Rotation Forest is proposed for classification task. In this study, three different systems, namely PCA-WPD-Rotation Forest, ICA-WPD-Rotation Forest and MSPCA-WPD-Rotation Forest were analyzed and evaluated in terms of three different statistical metrics, namely F-measure, AUC value and overall accuracy. To evaluate performances of proposed systems, MIT-BIH database is used. Obtained experimental results showed that MSPCA-WPD-Rotation Forest system resulted in the highest performances when compared to PCA-WPD-Rotation Forest and ICA-WPD-Rotation Forest. Therefore, in this study following system for classification of ECG signals is proposed: MSPCA as the first component for denoising, WPD as the second component which extracts important features from ECG signals and Rotation Forest as the third component which performs classification of ECG signals. The comparison to other systems for classification of EEG signals shown that proposed system outperforms other systems on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database under investigated conditions.

Such 'applications' were already explored by artists who introduced artistic EEG applications in the early 'seventies' of the previous century. These early explorations were not yet supported by advanced signal process methods, simply because there was no computing support possible, and interest in artistic applications faded until it reappeared in more recent years. Research in neuroscience, signal processing, machine learning and applications in medical, assistive BCIs prevailed. It was supported by computer science that provided real-time and off-line processing to analyze and store large amounts of streaming or collected data. With the possibility to access cheap shared and distributed storage and processing power, as it became available in the last decade of the previous century and the first decade of this century, different kinds of BCI applications, following a general interest in digital games, interactive entertainment and social media, became visible. These are domains where experience, fun and emotions are more important than efficiency, robustness and control. BCI provides user and application with a new modality that can be manipulated and interpreted, in addition to other input modalities. This has been explored, but mostly from the point of view of a single user interacting with an application. In this chapter we look at BCI applications where more than one user is involved. Games are among the possible applications and there are already simple games where gamers compete or collaborate using brain signal information from one or more players. We consider extensions of current applications by looking at different types of multi-user games, including massively multi-player online role-playing games. We mention research -distinguishing between active and passive BCI-on multi-participant BCI in non-game contexts that provides us with information about the possibilities of collaborative and competitive multi-brain games and that allows us to develop a vision on such games. The results of the literature study are collected in a table where we distinguish between the various forms of interaction between players (participants) in collaborative and competitive games and team activities.

However due to their lack of contributions, compared to other frequency ranges, to decode effector kinematics especially in ECoG signals, spatiotemporal dynamics of ECoG b oscillations has not been examined despite the larger areas that ECoG arrays can cover than standard intracortical multielectrode arrays. Here, we used ECoG grids to cover large areas of motor cortex and some somatosensory cortex in monkeys while they performed an unconstrained reaching and a lever pulling task at two force levels in three dimensional space. We showed that under the pulling task b power increased around movement onset. However, the b phases were locked around the movement onsets and their peak timings were spatially aligned in the motor cortex. These results may indicate that spatiotemporal dynamics of b oscillation conveys task relevant information and that ECoG arrays will be useful to study larger spatiotemporal patterns in the motor cortex, or any cortical areas in general, than intracortical multielectrode arrays.

Non-negative matrix factorization of multimodal MRI, fMRI and phenotypic data reveals differential changes in default mode subnetworks in ADHD	NEUROIMAGE			English	Review						fMRI; Multimodal data; NMF; ADHD; Phenotype; MRI; Latent variables; Biomarkers; Sparsity; Machine learning; Topic modeling; Attention deficit; Default mode	ABNORMAL FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; EEG/FMRI ANALYSIS; DISORDER ADHD; RESTING-STATE; NETWORK; HYPERACTIVITY; GENE; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; CINGULATE	In the multimodal neuroimaging framework, data on a single subject are collected from inherently different sources such as functional MRI, structural MRI, behavioral and/or phenotypic information. The information each source provides is not independent; a subset of features from each modality maps to one or more common latent dimensions, which can be interpreted using generative models. These latent dimensions, or "topics," provide a sparse summary of the generative process behind the features for each individual. Topic modeling, an unsupervised generative model, has been used to map seemingly disparate features to a common domain. Weuse Non-NegativeMatrix Factorization (NMF) to infer the latent structure of multimodal ADHD data containing fMRI, MRI, phenotypic and behavioral measurements. We compare four different NMF algorithms and find that the sparsest decomposition is also the most differentiating between ADHD and healthy patients. Weidentify dimensions that map to interpretable, recognizable dimensions such as motion, default mode network activity, and other such features of the input data. For example, structural and functional graph theory features related to default mode subnetworks clustered with the ADHD-Inattentive diagnosis. Structural measurements of the default mode network (DMN) regions such as the posterior cingulate, precuneus, and parahippocampal regions were all related to the ADHD-Inattentive diagnosis. Ventral DMN subnetworks may have more functional connections in ADHD-I, while dorsal DMN may have less. ADHD topics are dependent upon diagnostic site, suggesting diagnostic differences across geographic locations. We assess our findings in light of the ADHD-200 classification competition, and contrast our unsupervised, nominated topics with previously published supervised learning methods. Finally, we demonstrate the validity of these latent variables as biomarkers by using them for classification of ADHD in 730 patients. Cumulatively, this manuscript addresses how multimodal data in ADHD can be interpreted by latent dimensions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Yao, L; Meng, JJ; Sheng, XJ; Zhang, DG; Zhu, XY				Yao, Lin; Meng, Jianjun; Sheng, Xinjun; Zhang, Dingguo; Zhu, Xiangyang			A novel calibration and task guidance framework for motor imagery BCI via a tendon vibration induced sensation with kinesthesia illusion	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface; illusory movement; imagined movement	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; BETA-SYNCHRONIZATION; ERD/ERS PATTERNS; SET-UP; COMMUNICATION; MOVEMENT; EEG; STROKE; AREAS; STATE	Objective. Lack of efficient calibration and task guidance in motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interface (BCI) would result in the failure of communication or control, especially in patients, such as a stroke with motor impairment and intact sensation, locked-in state amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in which the sources of data for calibration may worsen the subsequent decoding. In addition, enhancing the proprioceptive experience in MI might improve the BCI performance. Approach. In this work, we propose a new calibrating and task guidance methodology to further improve the MI BCI, exploiting the afferent nerve system through tendon vibration stimulation to induce a sensation with kinesthesia illusion. A total of 30 subjects' experiments were carried out, and randomly divided into a control group (control-group) and calibration and task guidance group (CTG-group). Main results. Online experiments have shown that MI could be decoded by classifier calibrated solely using sensation data, with 8 of the 15 subjects in the CTG-Group above 80%, 3 above 95% and all above 65%. Offline chronological cross-validation analysis shows that it has reached a comparable performance with the traditional calibration method (F(1, 14) = 0.14, P = 0.7176). In addition, the discrimination accuracy of MI in the CTG-Group is significantly 12.17% higher on average than that in the control-group (unpaired-T test, P = 0.0086), and illusory sensation indicates no significant difference (unpaired-T test, p = 0.3412). The finding of the existed similarity of the discriminative brain patterns and grand averaged ERD/ERS between imagined movement (actively induced) and illusory movement (passively evoked) also validates the proposed calibration and task guidance framework. Significance. The cognitive complexity of the illusory sensation task is much lower and more objective than that of MI. In addition, subjects' kinesthetic experience mentally simulated during the MI task might be enhanced by accessing sensory experiences from the illusory stimulation. This sensory stimulation aided BCI design could help make MI BCI more applicable.

Often the areas to adapt and to monitor progress are selected a priori. Less explored, however, has been the notion of automatically emerging activation in a particular area or subregions within that area recruited above and beyond the rest of the brain. Likewise, the notion of evoking such a signal as an amodal, abstract one remaining robust across different sensory modalities could afford some exploration. Here we develop a simple binary control task in the context of brain-computer interface (BCI) and use a Bayesian sparse probit classification algorithm to automatically uncover brain regional activity that maximizes task performance. We trained and tested 19 participants using the visual modality for instructions and feedback. Across training blocks we quantified coupling of the frontoparietal nodes and selective involvement of visual and auditory regions as a function of the real-time sensory feedback. The testing phase under both forms of sensory feedback revealed automatic recruitment of the prefrontal cortex with a parcellation of higher strength levels in Brodmann's areas 9, 10, and 11 significantly above those in other brain areas. We propose that the prefrontal signal may be a neural correlate of externally driven intended direction and discuss our results in the context of various aspects involved in the cognitive control of our thoughts.

EPGP Investigators	Auras in generalized epilepsy	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							JUVENILE MYOCLONIC EPILEPSY; SEIZURE CLASSIFICATION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC FEATURES; SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEW; CLINICAL-FEATURES; EEG; SYMPTOMS; ABSENCE	Objective: We studied the frequency of auras in generalized epilepsy (GE) using a detailed semi-structured diagnostic interview. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, participants with GE were drawn from the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (EPGP). Responses to the standardized diagnostic interview regarding tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures were then examined. This questionnaire initially required participants to provide their own description of any subjective phenomena before their "grand mal seizures." Participants who provided answers to these questions were considered to have an aura. All participants were then systematically queried regarding a list of specific symptoms occurring before grand mal seizures, using structured (closed-ended) questions. Results: Seven hundred ninety-eight participants with GE were identified, of whom 530 reported grand mal seizures. Of these, 112 (21.3%) reported auras in response to the open-ended question. Analysis of responses to the closed-ended questions suggested that 341 participants (64.3%) experienced at least one form of aura. Conclusions: Auras typically associated with focal epilepsy were reported by a substantial proportion of EPGP subjects with GE. This finding may support existing theories of cortical and subcortical generators of GE with variable spread patterns. Differences between responses to the open-ended question and closed-ended questions may also reflect clinically relevant variation in patient responses to history-taking and surveys. Open-ended questions may underestimate the prevalence of specific types of auras and may be in part responsible for the underrecognition of auras in GE. In addition, structured questions may influence participants, possibly leading to a greater representation of symptoms.

Subject-to-Subject Adaptation to Reduce Calibration Time in Motor Imagery-based Brain-Computer Interface	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc			COMPONENTS	In order to enhance the usability of a motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (BCI), it is highly desirable to reduce the calibration time. Due to inter-subject variability, typically a new subject has to undergo a 2030 minutes calibration session to collect sufficient data for training a BCI model based on his/her brain patterns. This paper proposes a new subject-to-subject adaptation algorithm to reliably reduce the calibration time of a new subject to only 3-4 minutes. To reduce the calibration time, unlike several past studies, the proposed algorithm does not require a large pool of historic sessions. In the proposed algorithm, using only a few trials from the new subject, first, the new subject's data is adapted to each available historic session separately. This is done by a linear transformation minimizing the distribution difference between the two groups of EEG data. Thereafter, among the available historic sessions, the one matched the most to the new subject's adapted data is selected as the calibration session. Consequently, the previously trained model based on the selected historic session is entirely used for the classification of the new subject's data after adaptation. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a publicly available dataset with 9 subjects. For each subject, the calibration session is selected only from the calibration sessions of the eight other subjects. The experimental results showed that our proposed algorithm not only reduced the calibration time by 85%, but also performed on average only 1.7% less accurate than the subject-dependent calibration results.

A magnetoencephalography study of visual processing of pain anticipation	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						magnetoencephalography; neuromatrix; pain; pain anticipation; visual cortex	SPINAL-CORD STIMULATION; MEG-DATA; CORTEX; NEURONS; BRAIN; PERCEPTION; INTENSITY; FIGURE; MEMORY; EEG	Anticipating pain is important for avoiding injury; however, in chronic pain patients, anticipatory behavior can become maladaptive, leading to sensitization and limiting function. Knowledge of networks involved in pain anticipation and conditioning over time could help devise novel, better-targeted therapies. With the use of magnetoencephalography, we evaluated in 10 healthy subjects the neural processing of pain anticipation. Anticipatory cortical activity elicited by consecutive visual cues that signified imminent painful stimulus was compared with cues signifying nonpainful and no stimulus. We found that the neural processing of visually evoked pain anticipation involves the primary visual cortex along with cingulate and frontal regions. Visual cortex could quickly and independently encode and discriminate between visual cues associated with pain anticipation and no pain during preconscious phases following object presentation. When evaluating the effect of task repetition on participating cortical areas, we found that activity of prefrontal and cingulate regions was mostly prominent early on when subjects were still naive to a cue's contextual meaning. Visual cortical activity was significant throughout later phases. Although visual cortex may precisely and time efficiently decode cues anticipating pain or no pain, prefrontal areas establish the context associated with each cue. These findings have important implications toward processes involved in pain anticipation and maladaptive pain conditioning.

J	Ling, Z; Yue, C; Li, WJ; Fan, J				Zou Ling; Chen Yue; Li Wenjie; Jing Fan			Electroencephalogram Feature Detection and Classification in People with Internet Addiction Disorder with Visual Oddball Paradigm	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Event-Related Potentials; P300; Independent Component Analysis; Channel Selection; Pattern Recognition	COMPONENT ANALYSIS	In this paper, the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were recorded from ten healthy and ten Internet Addiction (IA)-afflicted university students during a visual oddball paradigm. First, the original signals were preprocessed to remove some artifacts using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm. Then, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to select a subset of channels that preserve most of the information compared to the full set of 64 channels. Finally, features of P300 waves were extracted from the event related potentials (ERPs) and compared across the target ERPs and non-target ERPs, as well as across the IA group and control group. The extracted features were further used to train four classifiers: Fisher Linear Discriminate Analysis (FLDA), Back Propagation (BP) Neural Network, Bayesian Classifier (BC) and Bayesian Regularization Back Propagation (BRBP) Neural Network. The active channels were located in the frontal, parietal, occipital and parietal-occipital areas for both healthy and IA-afflicted university students. The latency of 42 trials' averaged ERPs under target stimulation was longer than that of 558 trials' averaged ERPs under non-target stimulation (p < 0.05), and the amplitude of 42 trials' averaged ERPs under target stimulation was larger than that of 558 trials' averaged ERPs under non-target (p < 0.05). It showed significant difference in P300 amplitudes between healthy subjects and Internet Addition subjects. The amplitudes of Internet Addition were lower (p < 0.05). The classification accuracy could reach above 93% using Bayesian-based method in active areas, while it was lower than 90% in central areas. The results show that there are negative influences on the brain response and memory abilities of IA-afflicted university students. The paper deals with practical digital filter implementation to suppress 50 Hz power noise using integer coefficients filters. Very fast and simple solution enables to suppress both basic and harmonic components of power noise with nonlinear distortions. Real ECG signals were used to test effectiveness of power noise suppression. Accuracy is evaluated for basic sinusoidal and rectangular wave of noise.

Delirium Detection Based on Monitoring of Blinks and Eye Movements	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Delirium; eye movements; electroencephalogram; electro-oculogram	INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; CONFUSION ASSESSMENT METHOD; CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; POSTOPERATIVE DELIRIUM; ACTIVITY PATTERNS; CAM-ICU; METAANALYSIS; VALIDATION; MULTICENTER; RELIABILITY	Objective: To investigate whether delirious patients differ from nondelirious patients with regard to blinks and eye movements to explore opportunities for delirium detection. Methods: Using a single-center, observational study in a tertiary hospital in the Netherlands, we studied 28 delirious elderly and 28 age-and gender-matched (group level) nondelirious elderly, postoperative cardiac surgery patients. Patients were evaluated for delirium by a geriatrician, psychiatrist, or neurologist using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria. Blinks were automatically extracted from electro-oculograms and eye movements from electroencephalography recordings using independent component analysis. The number and duration of eye movements and blinks were compared between patients with and without delirium, based on the classification of the delirium experts described above. Results: During eyes-open registrations, delirious patients showed, compared with nondelirious patients, a significant decrease in the number of blinks per minute (median: 12 [interquartile range {IQR}: 5-18] versus 18 [IQR: 8-25], respectively; p = 0.02) and number of vertical eye movements per minute (median: 1 [IQR: 0-13] versus 15 [IQR: 2-54], respectively; p = 0.01) as well as an increase in the average duration of blinks (median: 0.5 [IQR: 0.36-0.95] seconds versus 0.34 [IQR: 0.23-0.53] seconds, respectively; p < 0.01). During eyes-closed registrations, the average duration of horizontal eye movements was significantly increased in delirious patients compared with patients without delirium (median: 0.41 [IQR: 0.15-0.75] seconds versus 0.08 [IQR: 0.06-0.22] seconds, respectively; p < 0.01). Conclusion: Spontaneous eye movements and particularly blinks appear to be affected in delirious patients, which holds promise for delirium detection.

Specificity and sensitivity of visual evoked potentials in the diagnosis of schizophrenia: Rethinking VEPs	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Biomarker; Electrophysiology; Neurophysiology; Diagnostic; Visual system; VEP	SENSORY PROCESSING DEFICITS; DYSFUNCTION	Alterations of the visual evoked potential (VEP) component P1 at the occipital region represent the most extended functional references of early visual dysfunctions in schizophrenia (SZ). However, P1 deficits are not reliable enough to be accepted as standard susceptibility markers for use in clinical psychiatry. We have previously reported a novel approach combining a standard checkerboard pattern-reversal stimulus, spectral resolution VEP, source detection techniques and statistical procedures which allowed the correct classification of all patients as SZ compared to controls. Here, we applied the same statistical approach but to a single surface VEP in contrast to the complex EEG source analyses in our previous report. P1 and N1 amplitude differences among spectral resolution VEPs from a POz-F3 bipolar montage were computed for each component. The resulting F-values were then Z-transformed. Individual comparisons of each component of P1 and N1 showed that in 72% of patients, their individual Z-score deviated from the normal distribution of controls for at least one of the two components. Crossvalidation against the distribution in the SZ-group improved the detection rate to 93%. In all, six patients were misclassified. Clinical validation yielded striking positive (78.13%) and negative (92.69%) predictive values. The here presented procedure offers a potential clinical screening method for increased susceptibility to SZ which should then be followed by high density electrode array and source detection analyses. The most important aspect of this work is represented by the fact that this diagnostic technique is low-cost and involves equipment that is feasible to use in typical community clinics.

Factors affecting epilepsy treatment outcomes in Nigeria	ACTA NEUROLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article						anti-epileptic drugs; epilepsy; prognostic factors; seizure control	RISK-FACTORS; MEDICATION; CLASSIFICATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITY; PROGNOSIS; PATTERNS; PEOPLE; EEG	ObjectivesEpilepsy is a complex chronic illness with variable treatment outcomes determined by factors specific to each affected person. We investigated prognostic factors for epileptic seizure outcome after 2years of anti-epileptic drug (AED) monotherapy. Materials and methodsTwo hundred and thirty-four AED naive epilepsy patients were started on AED monotherapy and monitored for 2years for seizure control. Patients on AED polytherapy were excluded. Prognostic factors investigated were socio-demographics characteristics, age of onset of epilepsy, etiology and precipitants of seizures, presenting seizure types, duration of epilepsy before initiation of AED, family support for treatment, compliance to AED, and clinic attendance. ResultsPatients were 160 (68.4%) males and 74 (31.6%) females, with mean ages of 26.210.4 and 30.7 +/- 16.0years, respectively. Mean age of onset of epilepsy was 19.0 +/- 15.0years. None of the patients was treated with AED for first seizures, although 75% received traditional and spiritual therapy. Majority were single and of low socioeconomic background, and treatment was funded mainly by parents/guardians. About 88% presented with partial seizures, and carbamazepine was the commonest AED used followed by phenytoin sodium. At the end of 2years of AED, 147 (63%) achieved complete seizure control, and significant prognostic factors were female sex, age older than 20years at presentation, secondary and tertiary education attainment, being employed, family support, regular clinic attendance, AED compliance, and generalized epilepsy. ConclusionsPatients with epilepsy are more likely to achieve complete seizure control when they are older, educated, and employed or supported by family members to buy their AEDs and attend clinics regularly.

In this paradigm, wearable vibrotactile rings are used to stimulate both the skin on both wrists. Subjects are required to perform the mental tasks according to the randomly presented cues (i.e., left hand motor imagery, right hand motor imagery, left stimulation sensation or right stimulation sensation). Two-way ANOVA statistical analysis showed a significant group effect (F (2,20) = 7.17, p = 0.0045), and the Benferroni-corrected multiple comparison test (with alpha = 0.05) showed that the hybrid modality group is 11.13% higher on average than the motor imagery group, and 10.45% higher than the selective sensation group. The hybrid modality experiment exhibits potentially wider spread usage within ten subjects crossed 70% accuracy, followed by four subjects in motor imagery and five subjects in selective sensation. Six subjects showed statistically significant improvement (p < 0.0045 Benferroni-corrected) in hybrid modality in comparison with both motor imagery and selective sensation. Furthermore, among subjects having difficulties in both motor imagery and selective sensation, the hybrid modality improves their performance to 90% accuracy. The proposed hybrid modality BCI has demonstrated clear benefits for those poorly performing BCI users. Not only does the requirement of motor and sensory anticipation in this hybrid modality provide basic function of BCI for communication and control, it also has the potential for enhancing the rehabilitation during motor recovery.

TIME COURSE OF THE INFLUENCE OF MUSICAL EXPERTISE ON THE PROCESSING OF VOCAL AND MUSICAL SOUNDS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						music; voice; vocalizations; speech prosody; ERPs; expertise	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; SPATIOTEMPORAL ANALYSIS; SPECTRAL COMPLEXITY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; MUSICIANS; SPEECH; ERP; RESPONSES; LANGUAGE; PERCEPTION	Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have suggested that different cerebral regions preferentially process human voice and music. Yet, little is known on the temporal course of the brain processes that decode the category of sounds and how the expertise in one sound category can impact these processes. To address this question, we recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) of 15 musicians and 18 non-musicians while they were listening to short musical excerpts (piano and violin) and vocal stimuli (speech and non-linguistic vocalizations). The task of the participants was to detect noise targets embedded within the stream of sounds. Event-related potentials revealed an early differentiation of sound category, within the first 100 ms after the onset of the sound, with mostly increased responses to musical sounds. Importantly, this effect was modulated by the musical background of participants, as musicians were more responsive to music sounds than non-musicians, consistent with the notion that musical training increases sensitivity to music. In late temporal windows, brain responses were enhanced in response to vocal stimuli, but musicians were still more responsive to music. These results shed new light on the temporal course of neural dynamics of auditory processing and reveal how it is impacted by the stimulus category and the expertise of participants. (C) 2015 IBRO.

The key criterion for reliability of brain-computer interface ( BCI) devices is their stability and robustness in natural environments in the presence of spurious signals and artifacts. Approach. To improve stability and robustness, a generalized additive model (GAM) is proposed for BCI decoder identification. Together with partial least squares (PLS), GAM can be applied to treat high-dimensional data and it is compatible with real-time applications. For evaluation of prediction quality, along with standard criteria such as Pearson correlation, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), additional criteria, mean absolute differential error (MADE) and dynamic time warping (DTW) distance, are chosen. These criteria reflect the smoothness and dissimilarity of the predicted and observed signals in the presence of phase desynchronization. Main results. The efficiency of the GAM-PLS model is tested on the publicly available database of simultaneous recordings of the continuous three-dimensional hand trajectories and epidural electrocorticogram signals of the Japanese macaque. GAM-PLS outperforms the generic PLS and improves the evaluation criteria: 22% (Pearson correlation), 8% (RMSE), 13% (MAE), 31% (MADE), 20% (DTW). Significance. Motor-related BCIs are systems to improve the quality of life of individuals with severe motor disabilities. The improvement of the reliability of the BCI decoder is an important step toward real-life applications of BCI technologies.

J	Sela, I				Sela, Itamar			Visual and auditory synchronization deficits among dyslexic readers as compared to non-impaired readers: a cross-correlation algorithm analysis	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						dyslexia; asynchrony; crossmodal integration; EEG; ERP; cross-correlation analysis	MODAL BINDING; SPECIAL-ISSUE; SPEECH; BRAIN; PERCEPTION; CHILDREN; RESPONSES; PRINT; DISCRIMINATION; OSCILLATIONS	Visual and auditory temporal processing and crossmodal integration are crucial factors in the word decoding process. The speed of processing (SOP) gap (Asynchrony) between these two modalities, which has been suggested as related to the dyslexia phenomenon, is the focus of the current study. Nineteen dyslexic and 17 non-impaired University adult readers were given stimuli in a reaction time (RT) procedure where participants were asked to identify whether the stimulus type was only visual, only auditory or crossmodally integrated. Accuracy, RT, and Event Related Potential (ERP) measures were obtained for each of the three conditions. An algorithm to measure the contribution of the temporal SOP of each modality to the crossmodal integration in each group of participants was developed. Results obtained using this model for the analysis of the current study data, indicated that in the crossmodal integration condition the presence of the auditory modality at the pre-response time frame (between 170 and 240 ms after stimulus presentation), increased processing speed in the visual modality among the non-impaired readers, but not in the dyslexic group. The differences between the temporal SOP of the modalities among the dyslexics and the non-impaired readers give additional support to the theory that an asynchrony between the visual and auditory modalities is a cause of dyslexia.

Moreover, the role of direction of movement has not received much attention even though it is an essential component allowing us to determine the intentions of the moving agent, and thus permitting the anticipation of potential social interactions. In this study, we examined event-related responses (ERPs) in 15 healthy human participants to light point walkers and their scrambled counterparts, whose movements occurred either in the radial or in the lateral plane. Compared to scrambled motion (SM), biological motion (BM) showed an enhanced negativity between 210 and 360ms. A source localization algorithm (sLORETA) revealed that this was due to an increase in superior and middle temporal lobe activity. Regarding direction, we found that radial BM produced an enhanced P1 compared to lateral BM, lateral SM and radial SM. This heightened P1 was due to an increase in activity in extrastriate regions, as well as in superior temporal, medial parietal and medial prefrontal areas. This network is known to be involved in decoding the underlying intentionality of the movement and in the attribution of mental states. The social meaning signaled by the direction of biological motion therefore appears to trigger an early response in brain activity.

Invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) may provide a permanent solution to this problem by directly linking the brain to lower extremity prostheses. To justify the pursuit of such invasive systems, the feasibility of BCI controlled overground walking should first be established in a noninvasive manner. To accomplish this goal, we developed an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI to control a functional electrical stimulation (FES) system for overground walking and assessed its performance in an individual with paraplegia due to SCI. Methods: An individual with SCI (T6 AIS B) was recruited for the study and was trained to operate an EEG-based BCI system using an attempted walking/idling control strategy. He also underwent muscle reconditioning to facilitate standing and overground walking with a commercial FES system. Subsequently, the BCI and FES systems were integrated and the participant engaged in several real-time walking tests using the BCI-FES system. This was done in both a suspended, off-the-ground condition, and an overground walking condition. BCI states, gyroscope, laser distance meter, and video recording data were used to assess the BCI performance. Results: During the course of 19 weeks, the participant performed 30 real-time, BCI-FES controlled overground walking tests, and demonstrated the ability to purposefully operate the BCI-FES system by following verbal cues. Based on the comparison between the ground truth and decoded BCI states, he achieved information transfer rates > 3 bit/s and correlations > 0.9. No adverse events directly related to the study were observed. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates for the first time that restoring brain-controlled overground walking after paraplegia due to SCI is feasible. Further studies are warranted to establish the generalizability of these results in a population of individuals with paraplegia due to SCI. If this noninvasive system is successfully tested in population studies, the pursuit of permanent, invasive BCI walking prostheses may be justified. In addition, a simplified version of the current system may be explored as a noninvasive neurorehabilitative therapy in those with incomplete motor SCI.

Often it is desired to interpret the outcome of these methods with respect to the cognitive processes under study. Here we discuss which methods allow for such interpretations, and provide guidelines for choosing an appropriate analysis for a given experimental goal: For a surgeon who needs to decide where to remove brain tissue it is most important to determine the origin of cognitive functions and associated neural processes. In contrast, when communicating with paralyzed or comatose patients via brain-computer interfaces, it is most important to accurately extract the neural processes specific to a certain mental state,These-equally-important but complementary objectives require differentanalysis methods. Determining the origin of neural processes in time or space from the parameters of a data-driven model requires what we call a forward model of the data; such a model explains how the measured data was generated from the neural sources. Examples are general linear models (GLMs). Methods for the extraction of neural information from data can be considered as backward models, as they attempt to reverse the data generating process. Examples are multivariate classifiers. Here we demonstrate that the parameters of forward models are neurophysiologically interpretable in the sense that significant nonzero weights are only observed at channels the activity of which is related to the brain process under study. In contrast, the interpretation of backward model parameters can lead to wrong conclusions regarding the spatial or temporal origin of the neural signals of interest, since significant nonzero weights may also be observed at channels the activity of which is statistically independent of the brain process under study. As a remedy for the linear case, we propose a procedure for transforming bacicward models into forward models. This procedure enables the neurophysiological interpretation of the parameters of linear backward models. We hope that this work raises awareness for an often encountered problem and provides a theoretical basis for conducting better interpretable multivariate neuroimaging analyses. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Inferring resting-state connectivity is often based on correlations, which are sensitive to indirect connections, leading to an inaccurate representation of the real backbone of the network. The precision matrix is a better representation for whole brain connectivity, as it considers only direct connections. The network structure can be estimated using the graphical lasso (GL), which achieves sparsity through l(1)-regularization on the precision matrix. In this paper, we propose a structural connectivity adaptive version of the GL, where weaker anatomical connections are represented as stronger penalties on the corresponding functional connections. We applied beamformer source reconstruction to the resting state MEG recordings of 81 subjects, where 29 were healthy controls, 22 were single-domain amnestic Mild Cognitive Impaired (MCI), and 30 were multiple-domain amnestic MCI. An atlas-based anatomical parcellation of 66 regions was obtained for each subject, and time series were assigned to each of the regions. The fiber densities between the regions, obtained with deterministic tractography from diffusion-weighted MRI, were used to define the anatomical connectivity. Precision matrices were obtained with the region specific time series in five different frequency bands. We compared our method with the traditional GL and a functional adaptive version of the GL, in terms of log-likelihood and classification accuracies between the three groups. We conclude that introducing an anatomical prior improves the expressivity of the model and, inmost cases, leads to a better classification between groups. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The vital repair and regeneration tasks carried out during sleep are essential for our physical, mental and emotional health. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder that is characterized by repeated pauses in breathing during sleep. These pauses, or apneas, deplete the brain and the rest of the body of oxygen and disrupt the normal sleep cycle. OSA is associated with a number of adverse safety and health consequences, including excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, which increase the risk for motor vehicle and work-related accidents. OSA also results in an increased risk for hypertension, cardiovascular disease, the development of diabetes and even premature death. The gold standard method for diagnosing OSA patients is polysomnography (PSG). PSG is an overnight sleep test that monitors a participant's biophysical changes (EEG, ECG, etc.) that occur during sleep. Despite its wide use and multi-parametric nature, there are multiple complications associated with that test that make it ineffective as an early-stage diagnosis tool. In this paper, we propose a daytime OSA screening tool that addresses the shortcomings of PSG. The framework consists of a data collection component that acquires information about the subject being tested, and a prediction component that analyzes the collected data and makes a diagnosis. We identify patients' key physiological, psychological and contextual features and apply advanced machine learning algorithms to build effective prediction models that help identify OSA patients in the comfort of their own home. The system was deployed in a pilot sleep apnea study of 16 patients. Results demonstrate the proposed system's great potential in helping sleep specialists in the initial assessment of patients with suspected OSA.

J	Baulac, M				Baulac, M.			MTLE with hippocampal sclerosis in adult as a syndrome	REVUE NEUROLOGIQUE			English	Article						Temporal lobe epilepsy; Hippocampal sclerosis; Brain imaging-prognosis	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SEIZURES; LOCALIZATION; MUTATIONS; PATTERNS; ATROPHY; LONG; LATERALIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; DYSFUNCTION	Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis, (MTLE-HS) is a well characterized disorder which associates electroclinical features suggestive of seizure onset in the mesial or limbic structures of the temporal lobe, and hippocampal sclerosis. This underlying pathology differentiates MTLE-HS from MTLE due to other pathological substrates. Typically, when MTLE-HS is diagnosed, a typical course of the disease can be retrospectively recognized, including early prolonged febrile seizures, a latent period, onset in mid-to-late childhood, auras that may initially occur in isolation, periods of seizure remission during adolescence or early adulthood. Then the condition progresses, associating elaborated seizures, progressive drug-resistance and cognitive, mainly memory, disorders of variable intensity. The seizures have a relatively gradual onset/offset, developing over 1-2 minutes, with partial awareness at the onset, and lasting for 2 to 10 minutes. Auras are common, with visceral, autonomic, psycho-affective, experiential components, presenting less frequently diverse sensory or sensorial symptoms. Awareness is generally preserved at onset, but then loss of consciousness occurs, with initial motionless stare, and automatisms, which typically are oro-alimentary, vocal or gestural, accompanied by motor signs such as contralateral dystonic posturing. A dysphasia is frequent when the focus is in the dominant hemisphere, often prolonged by a post-ictal dysphasia and confusion. Interictal EEG shows anterior or mid-temporal spikes/sharp ipsilaterally to the focus, in combination with non-epileptiform regional slowing. These changes may be bilateral but usually predominates ipsilaterally. Ictal EEG changes are marked by rhythmic temporal alpha or theta activity within 30 seconds of clinical onset. The hallmark is the presence of hippocampal sclerosis, demonstrable on coronal MRI sequences by unilateral (or asymmetrical) decrease in hippocampal volume and increase in signal on T2-weighted sequences. The diagnosis of MTLE is crucial because of its frequent poor prognosis under antiepileptic drugs, and of the possibility of excellent results after resective surgery. PET scanning shows a typical antero-mesial hypometabolism extending to the pole and lateral aspects of the temporal lobe. Presurgical investigations may also include depth-electrode recordings in case of doubt about more extensive or bilateral onsets. They demonstrate and lateralize the amygdalo-hippocampal discharges, some of them remaining apparently asymptomatic in the absence of extrahippocampal spreading. These interactions between hippocampal and extrahippocampal networks confer its specificity to MTLE-HS, together with its remarkable natural course. This entity is diagnostically essential, whether it should be regarded as an epileptic syndrome, disease or a distinctive constellation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Clinical value of magnetoencephalographic spike propagation represented by spatiotemporal source analysis: Correlation with surgical outcome	EPILEPSY RESEARCH			English	Article						Magnetoencephalography (MEG); Temporal lobe epilepsy; Epilepsy surgery; Spike propagation; Minimum norm estimate (MNE)	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SPACE SEPARATION METHOD; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; INTERICTAL DISCHARGES; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; NORMAL MRI; SURGERY; EEG	Objective: To investigate the correlation between spike propagation represented by spatiotemporal source analysis of magnetoencephalographic (MEG) spikes and surgical outcome in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: Thirty-seven patients were divided into mesial (n=27) and non-mesial (n=10) groups based on the presurgical evaluation. In each patient, ten ipsilateral spikes were averaged, and spatiotemporal source maps of the averaged spike were obtained by using minimum norm estimate. Regions of interest (ROIs) were created including temporoparietal, inferior frontal, mesial temporal, anterior and posterior part of the lateral temporal cortex. We extracted activation values from the source maps and the threshold was set at half of the maximum activation at the peak latency. The leading and propagated areas of the spike were defined as those ROIs with activation reaching the threshold at the earliest and at the peak latencies, respectively. Surgical outcome was assessed based on Engel's classification. Binary variables were created from leading areas (restricted to the anterior and mesial temporal ROIs or not) and from propagation areas (involving the temporoparietal ROI or not), and for surgical outcome (Class I or not). Fisher's exact test was used for significance testing. Results: In total and mesial group, restricted anterior/mesial temporal leading areas were correlated with Class I (p < 0.05). Temporoparietal propagation was correlated with Class II-IV (p < 0.05). For the non-mesial group, no significant relation was found. Conclusions: Spike propagation patterns represented by spatiotemporal source analysis of MEG spikes may provide useful information for prognostic implication in presurgical evaluation of epilepsy.

J	Cho, H; Ahn, M; Kim, K; Jun, SC				Cho, Hohyun; Ahn, Minkyu; Kim, Kiwoong; Jun, Sung Chan			Increasing session-to-session transfer in a brain-computer interface with on-site background noise acquisition	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						session-to-session transfer; brain-computer interface; zero-training; on-site background noise; regularized spatiotemporal filter	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; FILTERS; CLASSIFICATION	Objective. A brain-computer interface (BCI) usually requires a time-consuming training phase during which data are collected and used to generate a classifier. Because brain signals vary dynamically over time (and even over sessions), this training phase may be necessary each time the BCI system is used, which is impractical. However, the variability in background noise, which is less dependent on a control signal, may dominate the dynamics of brain signals. Therefore, we hypothesized that an understanding of variations in background noise may allow existing data to be reused by incorporating the noise characteristics into the feature extraction framework; in this way, new session data are not required each time and this increases the feasibility of the BCI systems. Approach. In this work, we collected background noise during a single, brief on-site acquisition session (approximately 3 min) immediately before a new session, and we found that variations in background noise were predictable to some extent. Then we implemented this simple session-to-session transfer strategy with a regularized spatiotemporal filter (RSTF), and we tested it with a total of 20 cross-session datasets collected over multiple days from 12 subjects. We also proposed and tested a bias correction (BC) in the RSTF. Main results. We found that our proposed session-to-session strategies yielded a slightly less or comparable performance to the conventional paradigm (each session training phase is needed with an on-site training dataset). Furthermore, using an RSTF only and an RSTF with a BC outperformed existing approaches in session-to-session transfers. Significance. We inferred from our results that, with an on-site background noise suppression feature extractor and pre-existing training data, further training time may be unnecessary.

Here we extended this work by recording both ERP and oscillatory EEG activity (event-related spectral perturbations, ERSPs) to line-drawn faces depicting eye and mouth movements (Eyes: Direct vs Away; Mouth: Closed vs Open) and non-face motion controls. Neural activity was measured in 2 occipito-temporal clusters of 9 electrodes, one in each hemisphere. Mouth opening generated larger N170s than mouth closing, replicating earlier work. Eye motion elicited robust N170s that did not differ between gaze conditions. Control condition differences were seen, and generated the largest N170. ERSP difference plots across conditions in the occipito-temporal electrode clusters (Eyes: Direct vs Away; Mouth: Closed vs Open) showed statistically significant differences in beta and gamma bands for gaze direction changes and mouth opening at similar post-stimulus times and frequencies. In contrast, control stimuli showed activity in the gamma ban with a completely different time profile and hemispheric distribution to facial stimuli. ERSP plots were generated in two 9 electrode clusters centered on central sites, C3 and C4. In the left cluster for a stimulus conditions, broadband beta suppression persisted from about 250 ms post-motion onset. In the cluster, beta suppression was seen for control conditions only. Statistically significant differences between conditions were confined between 4 and 15 Hz, unlike the occipito-temporal sites where differences occurred at much higher frequencies (high beta/gamma). Our data indicate that N170 amplitude is sensitive to the amount of movement in the visual field, independent of stimulus type. In contrast, occipito-temporal beta and gamma activity differentiates between facial am non-facial motion. Context and stimulus configuration likely plays a role in shaping neural responses, based on comparisons of the current data to previously reported studies. Broadband suppression of central beta activity, and significant low frequency differences were likely stimulus driven and not contingent on behavioral responses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

While the underlying neural principles are slowly becoming evident, most work has focused on transient stimuli and little is known about those mechanisms underlying audio-visual motion processing. We studied the facilitation of visual motion perception by auxiliary sounds, i.e. sounds that by themselves do not provide the specific evidence required for the perceptual task at hand. In our experiment human observers became significantly better at detecting visual random dot motion when this was accompanied by auxiliary acoustic motion rather than stationary sounds. EEG measurements revealed that both auditory and visual motion modulated low frequency oscillations over the respective sensory cortices. Using single trial decoding we quantified those oscillatory signatures permitting the discrimination of visual motion similar to the subject's task. This revealed visual motion-related signatures in low (1-4 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) bands that were significantly enhanced during congruent compared to disparate audio-visual conditions. Importantly, the auditory enhancement of these oscillatory signatures was predictive of the perceptual multisensory facilitation. These findings emphasise the importance of slow and alpha rhythms for perception in a multisensory context and suggest that acoustic motion can enhance visual perception by means of attention or priming-related mechanisms that are reflected in rhythmic activity over parieto-occipital regions.

The main function of BMIs is to detect, analyze and classify the modulation of EEG according to a user's intent and to decode it to demonstrate to others. Most of conventional BMIs with relatively high speed and high classification accuracy have a requisite that a user can open and move his/her eyes toward a target corresponding to user's intent and gaze at it. Locked-in patients, who have lost almost all motor function including facial muscle, cannot control the eye-movement as well as gaze. The present study aimed at developing a BMI which was independent of the eye-movement and eye-gaze as a final goal. In this paper, we discuss the feasibility of binary class of BMI available with eyes-closed condition using a recent our newly observation that the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) could be modulated by performing the mental tasks even in the eyes-close state. Temporal evolution of the modulation of SSVEP was investigated using the amplitude of SSVEP and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The amplitudes of fundamental SSVEP (10 Hz) averaged across 11 participants showed significant difference between the mental focusing task and relaxed runs from the onset of the flicker stimuli with the frequency of 10 Hz and the intensity of 5 lx, whereas those of the second harmonic SSVEP (20 Hz) gave only small difference without statistical significance. For the image recalling task, the amplitude differences between the fundamental SSVEPs in the task and relaxed conditions did not show significant difference, whereas the amplitude differences of the second harmonic SSVEP showed the main effect of the image recall task. The KL divergences for the fundamental SSVEP amplitude showed large differences at the onset of flicker stimuli and gradual decrease with time at P4 and O2 for the mental focus task, yet no such characteristic evolution was not seen in KL divergence for the second harmonic SSVEP. On the other hand, the KL divergences during the image recalling were increased with time for both the fundamental and second harmonic SSVEPs at most of the electrode sites. The classification accuracies of the proposed BMI exceeded 75 % in average across the subjects for both tasks using Fisher's linear discriminant analysis.

We have developed a neuroprosthetic hand that can be controlled by magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals to noninvasively evaluate subjects' ability to control a neuroprosthesis. Method Six nonparalyzed subjects performed grasping or opening movements of their right hand while the slow components of the MEG signals (SMFs) were recorded in an open-loop condition. The SMFs were used to train two decoders to infer the timing and types of movement by support vector machine and Gaussian process regression. The SMFs were also used to calculate estimated slow cortical potentials (eSCPs) to identify the origin of motor information. Finally, using the trained decoders, the subjects controlled a neuroprosthetic hand in a closed-loop condition. Results The SMFs in the open-loop condition revealed movement-related cortical field characteristics and successfully inferred the movement type with an accuracy of 75.0 +/- 12.9% (mean +/- SD). In particular, the eSCPs in the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the moved hand varied significantly enough among the movement types to be decoded with an accuracy of 76.5 +/- 10.6%, which was significantly higher than the accuracy associated with eSCPs in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex (58.1 +/- 13.7%; p = 0.0072, paired two-tailed Student's t-test). Moreover, another decoder using SMFs successfully inferred when the accuracy was the greatest. Combining these two decoders allowed the neuroprosthetic hand to be controlled in a closed-loop condition. Conclusions Use of real-time MEG signals was shown to successfully control the neuroprosthetic hand. The developed system may be useful for evaluating movement-related slow cortical potentials of severely paralyzed patients to predict the efficacy of invasive BMI.

Effects of Presentation Rate and Attention on Auditory Discrimination: A Comparison of Long-Latency Auditory Evoked Potentials in School-Aged Children and Adults	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MISMATCH-NEGATIVITY MMN; LANGUAGE-LEARNING IMPAIRMENTS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PROCESSING DEFICITS; SPEECH STIMULI; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL INDEXES; FREQUENCY DISCRIMINATION; READING DISABILITIES; SENSORY MEMORY	Decoding human speech requires both perception and integration of brief, successive auditory stimuli that enter the central nervous system as well as the allocation of attention to language-relevant signals. This study assesses the role of attention on processing rapid transient stimuli in adults and children. Cortical responses (EEG/ERPs), specifically mismatch negativity (MMN) responses, to paired tones (standard 100-100Hz; deviant 100-300Hz) separated by a 300, 70 or 10ms silent gap (ISI) were recorded under Ignore and Attend conditions in 21 adults and 23 children (6-11 years old). In adults, an attention-related enhancement was found for all rate conditions and laterality effects (L>R) were observed. In children, 2 auditory discrimination-related peaks were identified from the difference wave (deviant-standard): an early peak (eMMN) at about 100-300ms indexing sensory processing, and a later peak (LDN), at about 400-600ms, thought to reflect reorientation to the deviant stimuli or "second-look" processing. Results revealed differing patterns of activation and attention modulation for the eMMN in children as compared to the MMN in adults: The eMMN had a more frontal topography as compared to adults and attention played a significantly greater role in childrens' rate processing. The pattern of findings for the LDN was consistent with hypothesized mechanisms related to further processing of complex stimuli. The differences between eMMN and LDN observed here support the premise that separate cognitive processes and mechanisms underlie these ERP peaks. These findings are the first to show that the eMMN and LDN differ under different temporal and attentional conditions, and that a more complete understanding of children's responses to rapid successive auditory stimulation requires an examination of both peaks.

Infants' neural responses to facial emotion in the prefrontal cortex are correlated with temperament: a functional near-infrared spectroscopy study	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						functional near-infrared spectroscopy; infancy; temperament; negative emotionality; emotion; face processing; prefrontal cortex	ANTERIOR EEG ASYMMETRY; OPTICAL PATHLENGTH; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; TEMPORAL STABILITY; DEVELOPING BRAIN; EXPRESSIONS; ACTIVATION; CONTINUITY; HAPPY; DEACTIVATION	Accurate decoding of facial expressions is critical for human communication, particularly during infancy, before formal language has developed. Different facial emotions elicit distinct neural responses within the first months of life. However, there are broad individual differences in such responses, so that the same emotional expression can elicit different brain responses in different infants. In this study, we sought to investigate such differences in the processing of emotional faces by analyzing infants' cortical metabolic responses to face stimuli and examining whether individual differences in these responses might vary as a function of infant temperament. Seven-month-old infants (N = 24) were shown photographs of women portraying happy expressions, and neural activity was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Temperament data were collected using the Revised Infant Behavior Questionnaire Short Form, which assesses the broad temperament factors of Surgency/Extraversion (S/E), Negative Emotionality (NE), and Orienting/Regulation (O/R). We observed that oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) responses to happy face stimuli were negatively correlated with infant temperament factors in channels over the left prefrontal cortex (uncorrected for multiple comparisons). To investigate the brain activity underlying this association, and to explore the use of fNIRS in measuring cortical asymmetry, we analyzed hemispheric asymmetry with respect to temperament groups. Results showed preferential activation of the left hemisphere in low-NE infants in response to smiling faces. These results suggest that individual differences in temperament are associated with differential prefrontal oxyHb responses to faces. Overall, these analyses contribute to our current understanding of face processing during infancy, demonstrate the use of fNIRS in measuring prefrontal asymmetry, and illuminate the neural correlates of face processing as modulated by temperament.

The neural activity that governs our everyday lives involves an intricate coordination of many processes that can be attributed to a variety of brain regions. On the surface, many of these functions can appear to be controlled by specific anatomical structures; however, in reality, numerous dynamic networks within the brain contribute to its function through an interconnected web of neuronal and synaptic pathways. The brain, in its healthy or pathological state, can therefore be best understood by taking a systems-level approach. While numerous neuroengineering technologies exist, we focus here on three major thrusts in the field of systems neuroengineering: neuroimaging, neural interfacing, and neuromodulation. Neuroimaging enables us to delineate the structural and functional organization of the brain, which is key in understanding how the neural system functions in both normal and disease states. Based on such knowledge, devices can be used either to communicate with the neural system, as in neural interface systems, or to modulate brain activity, as in neuromodulation systems. The consideration of these three fields is key to the development and application of neuro-devices. Feedback-based neuro-devices require the ability to sense neural activity (via a neuroimaging modality) through a neural interface (invasive or noninvasive) and ultimately to select a set of stimulation parameters in order to alter neural function via a neuromodulation modality. Systems neuroengineering refers to the use of engineering tools and technologies to image, decode, and modulate the brain in order to comprehend its functions and to repair its dysfunction. Interactions between these fields will help to shape the future of systems neuroengineering-to develop neurotechniques for enhancing the understanding of whole-brain function and dysfunction, and the management of neurological and mental disorders.

J	Lorenz, R; Pascual, J; Blankertz, B; Vidaurre, C				Lorenz, Romy; Pascual, Javier; Blankertz, Benjamin; Vidaurre, Carmen			Towards a holistic assessment of the user experience with hybrid BCIs	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Meeting	JUN 03-07, 2013	Pacific Grove, CA	Natl Inst Hlth, Natl Sci Fdn		user experience; usability; user-centred; hybrid BCI; neuroprosthetics	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; CENTERED DESIGN; MENTAL WORKLOAD; PERFORMANCE; USABILITY	Objective. In recent years, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have become mature enough to immensely benefit from the expertise and tools established in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). One of the core objectives in HCI research is the design of systems that provide a pleasurable user experience (UX). While the majority of BCI studies exclusively evaluate common efficiency measures such as classification accuracy and speed, single research groups have begun to look at further usability aspects such as ease of use, workload and learnability. However, these evaluation metrics only cover pragmatic aspects of UX while still not considering the hedonic quality of UX. In order to gain a holistic perspective on UX, hedonic quality aspects such as motivation and frustration were also taken into account for our evaluation of three BCI-driven interfaces, which were proposed to be used as a two-stage neuroprosthetic control within the EU project MUNDUS. Approach. At the first stage, one of six possible actions was selected and either confirmed or cancelled at the second stage. For the experiment, a solely event-related-potential-based interface (ERP-ERP) and two hybrid solutions were tested that were controlled by ERP and motor imagery (MI)-resulting in the two possible combinations: ERP selection/MI confirmation (ERP-MI) or MI selection/ERP confirmation (MI-ERP). Behavioural, subjective and encephalographic (EEG) data of 12 healthy subjects were collected during an online experiment with the three graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Main results. Results showed a significantly greater pragmatic quality (in terms of accuracy, efficiency, workload, use quality and learnability) for the ERP-ERP and ERP-MI GUIs in contrast to the MI-ERP GUI. Consequently, the MI-ERP GUI is least suited for use as a neuroprosthetic control. With respect to the comparison of the ERP-ERP and ERP-MI GUIs, no significant differences in pragmatic and hedonic quality of UX were found. Since throughout better results were obtained for the conventional approach and it was most preferred by the subjects, the ERP-ERP GUI seems more suitable for its deployment in actual end-users. Nevertheless, for individuals with stable MI patterns, the hybrid interface can be provided as an additional option of choice within the MUNDUS framework. Significance. Although the paramount goal in BCI research still remains the improvement of classification accuracy and communication speed, it is of significance to note that it is equally important for end-users to keep up their motivation and prevent frustration. By including pragmatic as well as hedonic quality aspects, this study is the first effort to gain a holistic perspective of the UX while interacting with BCI-driven assistive technology aimed at actual end-users. The broad-scale methodology provided valuable insights into the underlying dynamics causing the users' experience to differ across the GUIs. The results will be used to refine a BCI-driven neuroprosthesis and test it with end-users.
