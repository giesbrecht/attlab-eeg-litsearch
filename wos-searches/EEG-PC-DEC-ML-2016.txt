The objective of this study was to characterize EEG signals of two different motor imagery tasks used to control a robotic articulator. With one-sided hand movement imagination resulting in EEG changes located contra and ipsilateral areas, time-courses of two different imagery tasks were investigated via instantaneous band power changes. We compared the features extracted from the EEG patterns with standard machine learning algorithms. We report frequency-based categorization of visualized imagery more relevant than machine learning methods.

Many existing methods estimate the uncorrelated instantaneous demixing of EEG signals to classify multiclass motor imagery (MI). However, the condition of uncorrelation does not hold true in practice, because the brain regions work with partial or complete collaboration. This work proposes a novel method, termed as a common Bayesian network (CBN), to discriminate multiclass MI EEG signals. First, with the constraints of a Gaussian mixture model on every channel, only related channels are selected to construct a normal Bayesian network. Second, the nodes that have both common and varying edges are selected to construct a CBN. Third, the probabilities on common edges are used to learn about the support vector machine for classification. To validate the proposed method, we conduct experiments on two well-known BCI datasets and perform a numerical analysis of the propose algorithm for EEG classification in a multiclass MI BCI. Experimental results show that the proposed CBN method not only has excellent classification performance, but also is highly efficient. Hence, it is suitable for the cases where a system is required to respond within a second.

Furthermore, novel cognitive computing platforms such as IBM's recently introduced neuromorphic TrueNorth chip allow for deploying deep learning techniques in an ultra-low power environment with a minimum device footprint. Merging deep learning and TrueNorth technologies for real-time analysis of brain-activity data at the point of sensing will create the next generation of wearables at the intersection of neurobionics and artificial intelligence.

EEG was decomposed by ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) into a small number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) based on intrinsic local characteristic time scale. The power, standard deviation, and analytic amplitude of first two IMFs expressed the difference between normal EEG and EEG affected by acupuncture. The two EEG patterns could be classified by extreme learning machine (ELM) with faster and better classification performance compared with BP. Similar classification accuracy of different channels indicated the global EEG pattern affected by acupuncture.

Application-and scenario-based tradeoffs are compared and reviewed for seizure detection and suppression algorithm and system which comprises electroencephalography (EEG) data acquisition, feature extraction, classification, and stimulation. Support vector machine achieves a good tradeoff among power, area, patient specificity, latency, and classification accuracy for long-term monitoring of patients with limited training seizure patterns. Design challenges of EEG data acquisition on a multichannel wearable environment for a patch-type sensor are also discussed in detail. Dual-detector architecture incorporates two area-efficient linear support vector machine classifiers along with a weight-and-average algorithm to target high sensitivity and good specificity at once. On-chip implementation issues for a patient-specific transcranial electrical stimulation are also discussed. The system design is verified using CHB-MIT EEG database [1] with a comprehensive measurement criteria which achieves high sensitivity and specificity of 95.1% and 96.2%, respectively, with a small latency of 1 s. It also achieves seizure onset and termination detection delay of 2.98 and 3.82 s, respectively, with seizure length estimation error of 4.07 s.

In this study, we investigated decoding stroke patients' gait intention through a wireless EEG system. To overcome patient-specific EEG patterns due to impaired cerebral cortices, common spatial patterns (CSP) was employed. We demonstrated that CSP filter can be used to maximize the EEG signal variance-ratio of gait and standing conditions. Finally, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classification was conducted, whereby the average accuracy of 73.2% and the average delay of 0.13 s were achieved for 3 chronic stroke patients. Additionally, we also found out that the inverse CSP matrix topography of stroke patients' EEG showed good agreement with the patients' paretic side.

This disorder can be diagnosed by non-invasive examinations, such as electroencephalography, whose records are called electroencephalograms (EEG). The EEG can be stored in medical databases for reusing in future. In these data, one can apply data mining process supported by machine learning techniques in order to find patterns that can be used for building predictive models. This paper presents an application of the cross-correlation technique and the kNN algorithm for classification in a set with 200 EEG segments in order to differentiate normal and epileptic (abnormal) signals. The results were evaluated using 10-fold crossvalidation and contingency table methods. With the evaluation using cross validation, it was not found statistically significant difference for classification using kNN. The contingency table results found that the kNN with k = 1 and k = 7 performed better for classifying abnormal and normal EEG, respectively. Also, the kNN with k = 1 and k = 7 were more likely to correctly classify normal and abnormal EEG, respectively.

The collected data includes three syllables (/ka:/, /fi:/ and /su:/), 6 vowels (/ae/, /e/, /au/, /a:/, /i:/ and /u:/) and resting in Persian. Database was collected based on 3 protocols from 5 subjects. The 3 protocols are including overt speech without vibration of the vocal cords, semi-overt speech (vocal track forming without pronouncing) and covert (silent) speech. Feature vectors include empirical mode decomposition combinations with common spatial patterns filters, were extracted from electroencephalography signals. Classification done by non-linear support vector machines. There was a significant difference between the results of extraction 5 feature vectors include energy, variance, zero crossing rate, skewness and kurtosis against the only variance feature vector from the common spatial patterns filtered data (on average and p-value <= 0.05, about 3% accuracy improvement). There was no significant difference between the results of vowels and syllables databases. There was also no significant difference between the results of three protocols, which indicates adequacy and advantage of the "covert speech" protocol.

Such problems render the performance of a Bel highly specific to subjects, requiring expensive and time-consuming individual calibration sessions to adapt Bel systems to new subjects. This work tackles the aforementioned problem in a Bayesian multi-task learning (MTL) framework to transfer common knowledge across subjects and sessions for the adaptation of a Bel to new subjects. In particular, a recent framework, that is able to exploit the structure of multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG), is extended by a Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression decoder for probabilistic binary classification. The derived model is able to explicitly learn spatial and spectral features, therefore making it further applicable for identification, analysis and evaluation of paradigm characteristics without relying on expert knowledge. An offline experiment with the new decoder shows a significant improvement in performance on calibration-free decoding compared to previous MTL approaches for rule adaptation and uninformed models while also outperforming them as soon as subject-specific data becomes available. We further demonstrate the ability of the model to identify relevant topographies along with signal band-power features that agree with neurophysiological properties of a common sensorimotor rhythm paradigm.

EEG cortical currents were estimated with a variational Bayesian method that uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data as a hierarchical prior. EEG and fMRI data were recorded from ten healthy participants during covert articulation of Japanese vowels /a/ and /i/, as well as during a no-imagery control task. Applying a sparse logistic regression (SLR) method to classify the three tasks, mean classification accuracy using EEG cortical currents was significantly higher than that using EEG sensor signals and was also comparable to accuracies in previous studies using electrocorticography. SLR weight analysis revealed vertices of EEG cortical currents that were highly contributive to classification for each participant, and the vertices showed discriminative time series signals according to the three tasks. Furthermore, functional connectivity analysis focusing on the highly contributive vertices revealed positive and negative correlations among areas related to speech processing. As the same findings were not observed using EEG sensor signals, our results demonstrate the potential utility of EEG cortical currents not only for engineering purposes such as brain-computer interfaces but also for neuroscientific purposes such as the identification of neural signaling related to language processing.

However, their performance for solving complex problems such as electroencephalography (EEG) classification has not been widely assessed. It is necessary to consider new approaches to select relevant information and for training SNN in order to improve their accuracy when applied to complex data classification. In this paper, we present a novel channel selection and classification method based on SNN trained with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for the classification of EEG signals associated to motor imagery. The proposed method was able to correctly identify the most relevant channels for different motor imagery tasks. The SNN trained with PSO achieved good classification performances for a well-studied public database using a minimal number of EEG channels, showing advantages against other approaches, regarding both performance and system requirements.

It allows observing events strongly associated with epilepsy or epileptic spikes and locating the brain regions that cause the symptoms of epilepsy. This paper presents an automated classification of EEG signals for the detection of epileptic seizures with Single-Channel using the wavelet transform and the Extreme Learning Machine. The aim is to create a system with reduced computation time and resources with the minimum number of required electrodes. The decision making process is comprised of three steps: (a) Preprocessing, (b) feature extraction based on the wavelet transform, and (c) classification by the Extreme Learning Machine. The proposed algorithm has been tested on three different data sets from the CHB-MIT scalp EEG database using only the FT10-T8 channel. The proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 94.85%.

Previous studies using electroencephalography (EEG) have focused on the slowing of oscillatory brain rhythms, coupled with complexity reduction of the corresponding time-series and their enhanced compressibility. These analyses have been typically carried out on single channels. However, limited investigations have focused on the possibility yielded by computational intelligence methodologies and novel machine learning approaches applied to multichannel schemes. The study at screening level on EEG recordings of subjects at risk could be useful to highlight the emergence of underlying AD progression (or at least support any further clinical investigation). In this work, the representational power of Deep Learning on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is exploited to generate suitable sets of features that are then able to classify EEG patterns of AD from a prodromal version of dementia (Mild Cognitive Impairment, MCI) and from age-matched Healthy Controls (HC). The processing system here used enforces a series of convolutional-subsampling layers in order to derive a multivariate assembly of latent, novel patterns, finally used to categorize sets of EEG from different classes of subjects. The final processor here proposed is able to reach an averaged 80% of correct classification with good performance on both sensitivity and specificity by using a Multilayered Feedforward Perceptron (MLP) of the standard type as a final block of the procedure.

Validation of non-REM sleep stage decoding from resting state fMRI using linear support vector machines	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Resting state fMRI; EEG; EEG-fMRI; Sleep; Classification	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; INTRINSIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; MRI; CLASSIFICATION; FLUCTUATIONS; WAKEFULNESS; MODULATION; FREQUENCY; DURATION	A growing body of literature suggests that changes in consciousness are reflected in specific connectivity patterns of the brain as obtained from resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI). As simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) is often unavailable, decoding of potentially confounding sleep patterns from rs-fMRI itself might be useful and improve data interpretation. Linear support vector machine classifiers were trained on combined rs-fMRI/EEG recordings from 25 subjects to separate wakefulness (S0) from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stages 1 (S1), 2 (S2), slow wave sleep (SW) and all three sleep stages combined (SX). Classifier performance was quantified by a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO-CV) and on an independent validation dataset comprising 19 subjects. Results demonstrated excellent performance with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUCs) close to 1.0 for the discrimination of sleep from wakefulness (S0 vertical bar SX), S0 vertical bar S1, S0 vertical bar S2 and S0|SW, and good to excellent performance for the classification between sleep stages (S1 vertical bar S2: similar to 0.9; S1 vertical bar SW:similar to 1.0; S2 vertical bar SW:similar to 0.8). Application windows of fMRI data from about 70 s were found as minimum to provide reliable classifications. Discrimination patterns pointed to subcortical-cortical connectivity and within-occipital lobe reorganization of connectivity as strongest carriers of discriminative information. In conclusion, we report that functional connectivity analysis allows valid classification of NREM sleep stages. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Altmann, A.; Schroeter, M.

Self-report is the gold standard for pain assessment in clinical practice, but it may not be available or reliable in some populations. Neuroimaging data, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), have the potential to be used to provide physiology-based and quantitative nociceptive pain assessment tools that complements self-report. However, existing neuroimaging-based nociceptive pain assessments only rely on the information in pain-evoked brain activities, but neglect the fact that the perceived intensity of pain is also encoded by ongoing brain activities prior to painful stimulation. Here, we proposed to use machine learning algorithms to decode pain intensity from both pre-stimulus ongoing and post-stimulus evoked brain activities. Neural features that were correlated with intensity of laser-evoked nociceptive pain were extracted from high-dimensional pre- and post-stimulus EEG and fMRI activities using partial least-squares regression (PLSR). Further, we used support vector machine (SVM) to predict the intensity of pain from pain-related time -frequency EEG patterns and BOLD-fMRI patterns. Results showed that combining predictive information in pre- and post-stimulus brain activities can achieve significantly better performance in classifying high-pain and low-pain and in predicting the rating of perceived pain than only using post-stimulus brain activities. Therefore, the proposed pain prediction method holds great potential in basic research and clinical applications.

The method using support vectors machine (SVM) based on the structure risk minimization provides us an effective way of learning machine. But solving the quadratic programming problem for training SVM becomes a bottleneck of using SVM because of the long time of SVM training. In this paper, a local-SVM method is proposed for modeling EEG signals. The local method is presented for improving the speed of the prediction of EEG signals. The experimental results show that the training of the local-SVM obtains a good behavior.

J	Washizawa, Y				Washizawa, Yoshikazu			Discriminative Metric Learning on Extended Grassmann Manifold for Classification of Brain Signals	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						brain computer interface (BCI); event-related synchronization and desynchronization (ERS/ERD); common spatial patterns (CSP); Grass-mann manifold; Mahalanobis distance	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; FILTERS	Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure the brain signal from spatially-distributed electrodes. In order to detect event-related synchronization and desynchronization (ERS/ERD), which are utilized for brain-computer/machine interfaces (BCI/BMI), spatial filtering techniques are often used. Common spatial potential (CSP) filtering and its extensions which are the spatial filtering methods have been widely used for BCIs. CSP transforms brain signals that have a spatial and temporal index into vectors via a covariance representation. However, the variance-covariance structure is essentially different from the vector space, and not all the information can be transformed into an element of the vector structure. Grassmannian embedding methods, therefore, have been proposed to utilize the variance-covariance structure of variational patterns. In this paper, we propose a metric learning method to classify the brain signal utilizing the covariance structure. We embed the brain signal in the extended Grassmann manifold, and classify it on the manifold using the proposed metric. Due to this embedding, the pattern structure is fully utilized for the classification. We conducted an experiment using an open benchmark dataset and found that the proposed method exhibited a better performance than CSP and its extensions.

An increasing number of researches have been emerged that assesses the cognitive aspects of video game players. This creates a need to classify the expert-novice level of a player. A novel approach to classify players expert-novice level is to use machine learning algorithm by considering recorded electroencephalography(EEG) signals of player while playing mobile games. In this research work, EEG signals of ten mobile game players is recorded by commercially available 14 channel EMOTIV headset. After preprocessing stage, a feature vector is created in such a way that from each channel, thirteen morphological features are extracted. The extracted features are used to train three different classification algorithms. The Naive Bayes performed with an accuracy of 89.89%. From results, it is evident that EEG can be used to classify the expert-novice level of a player using machine algorithms. These results can be useful in the development of new and interesting entertainment and educational mobile games taking into account the player's cognition using EEG.

This paper presents the use of decimation filters for filtering the EEG signal. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) technique is used to transform the filtered signal to a new time series in order to have optimal variance for the discrimination of different tasks. Fishers Discriminant Analysis (FDA) is applied to the CSP features and the FDA scores are fed to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The method is evaluated on BCI Competition III Dataset IVa and compared with other related state-of-the-art approaches. The results show that our method outperforms all other approaches in terms of average classification error rate. Compared to best performing method that uses only CSP features, the results obtained in this research offer on average a reduction of 1.07% in the classification error rate.

Automatic classification of 6-month-old infants at familial risk for language-based learning disorder using a support vector machine	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Infant; Machine learning; Support vector machine (SVM); EEG; Developmental language disorder; Network analysis	MINIMUM SPANNING TREE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; WHITE-MATTER; HUMAN-BRAIN; EEG; PLASTICITY; AUTISM; DISCRIMINATION; IMPAIRMENT; NETWORKS	Objectives: This study assesses the ability of a novel, "automatic classification" approach to facilitate identification of infants at highest familial risk for language-learning disorders (LLD) and to provide converging assessments to enable earlier detection of developmental disorders that disrupt language acquisition. Methods: Network connectivity measures derived from 62-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recording were used to identify selected features within two infant groups who differed on LLD risk: infants with a family history of LLD (FH+) and typically-developing infants without such a history (FH-). A support vector machine was deployed; global efficiency and global and local clustering coefficients were computed. A novel minimum spanning tree (MST) approach was also applied. Cross-validation was employed to assess the resultant classification. Results: Infants were classified with about 80% accuracy into FH+ and FH- groups with 89% specificity and precision of 92%. Clustering patterns differed by risk group and MST network analysis suggests that FH+ infants' EEG complexity patterns were significantly different from FH- infants. Conclusions: The automatic classification techniques used here were shown to be both robust and reliable and should provide valuable information when applied to early identification of risk or clinical groups. Significance: The ability to identify infants at highest risk for LLD using "automatic classification" strategies is a novel convergent approach that may facilitate earlier diagnosis and remediation.

We built a system for brain state modeling, which includes a web server that can process uploaded electroencephalographic (EEG) data, store the data in a local database, and perform data analysis on the stored EEG data. This paper introduces a mobile application that is able to interact with the web server to render selected data and display analysis results from the web server. We aim to build an efficient self-adjusting brain wave modeling system that can seamlessly capture and analyze EEG brainwave data. The platform provides user friendly interface with secure data storage and analytics capabilities for wave analysis, statistical analysis, and categorical classification using a number of wellestablished machine learning algorithms. We also present a systematic method to understand how the variation of raw data sets used in training models affects the accuracy of machine learning algorithms, and then analyze the performance of machine learning algorithms under various computational implementations. Overall, the study describes a successfully built incorporated data analysis platform, and provides preliminary insights into the performance of common machine learning algorithms on the brain wave data sets.

The filtering is implemented using multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD). The MEMD decomposes multivariate EEG signal into a finite set of time varying basis functions called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Several IMFs are suppressed to improve the intelligibility of the EEG for better classification. The features from pre-filtered EEG are extracted by using common spatial pattern (CSP) which is a spatial filtering approach. The two class MI classification is performed by support vector machine (SVM). The proposed method is evaluated by BCI competition III of dataset IVa. Its performance is higher compared to that of the recently developed algorithm.	[Saha, Sanjoy Kumar] Begum Rokeya Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Rangpur, Bangladesh; [Ali, Md.

We design a sleep experiment to collect waking EEG signals from eight subjects under three different sleep conditions: 8 hours sleep, 6 hours sleep, and 4 hours sleep. We utilize three machine learning approaches, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), and discriminative graph regularized extreme learning machine (GELM), to classify extracted EEG features of power spectral density (PSD). The accuracies of these three classifiers without feature selection are 36.68%, 48.28%, 62.16%, respectively. By using minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance (MRMR) algorithm and the brain topography, the classification accuracy of GELM with 9 features is improved largely and increased to 83.57% in average. To investigate critical frequency bands for measuring sleep quality, we examine the features of each band and observe their energy changing. The experimental results indicate that Gamma band is more relevant to measuring sleep quality.

With the development of electroencephalography (EEG) detection tools, mature and affordable mobile brainwave sensors have become available. Therefore, this study aims to predict attentional status with the difficulty of work based on the EEG signals, and apply the process of prediction to an Android application. In the study, 10 participants performed different tasks with NeuroSky's MindWave EEG device, which can collect participants' EEG signals. K-means clustering algorithm was used to estimate the boundary of different attentional status. Moreover, Q-value was used to evaluate the question difficulty. 20 participants were recorded gender, the EEG signals, question difficulty, results, and answer time, which were participant predictors. The attentional status was predicted by support vector machine (SVM) classifier.

Unlike conventional mood analyzing systems, the proposed method focuses on classifying real-time user moods by analyzing the user's brainwaves. Applying brainwave-related research in commercial services requires two elements - robust performance and comfortable fit of. This paper proposes a filter based on Regularized Common Spatial Patterns (RCSP) and presents its use in the implementation of mood classification for a music service via a wireless consumer electroencephalography (EEG) device that has only 14 pins. Despite the use of fewer pins, the proposed system demonstrates approximately 10% point higher accuracy in mood classification, using the same dataset, compared to one of the best EEG-based mood-classification systems using a skullcap with 32 pins (EU FP7 PetaMedia project). This paper confirms the commercial viability of brainwave-based mood-classification technology. To analyze the improvements of the system, the changes of feature variations after applying RCSP filters and performance variations between users are also investigated. Furthermore, as a prototype service, this paper introduces a mood-based music list management system called MyMusicShuffler based on the proposed mood-classification method.

Our study reports an SSVEP-BMI that, for the first time, decodes primarily based on top-down and not bottom-up visual information processing. The experimental setup presents a grid-shaped flickering line array that the participants observe while intentionally attending to a subset of flickering lines representing the shape of a letter. While the flickering pixels stimulate the participant's visual cortex uniformly with equal probability, the participant's intention groups the strokes and thus perceives a 'letter Gestalt'. We observed decoding accuracy of 35.81% (up to 65.83%) with a regularized linear discriminant analysis; on average 2.05-fold, and up to 3.77-fold greater than chance levels in multi-class classification. Compared to the EEG signals, an electrooculogram (EOG) did not significantly contribute to decoding accuracies. Further analysis reveals that the top-down SSVEP paradigm shows the most focalised activation pattern around occipital visual areas; Granger causality analysis consistently revealed prefrontal top-down control over early visual processing. Taken together, the present paradigm provides the first neurophysiological evidence for the top-down SSVEP BMI paradigm, which potentially enables multiclass intentional control of EEG-BMIs without using gaze-shifting.

Connectivity patterns among EEG electrodes in different frequency bands were extracted by multivariate autoregressive modeling while 19 nonmusicians listened to selected classical and Iranian musical excerpts. Musical selections were categorized according to the participants' average self-assessment results. Connectivity matrices were analyzed to identify distinct variations in the connectivity indices related to the categorized excerpts. We studied the correlation of inter-/intra-regional connectivity patterns with the self-reported evaluations of the musical selections. The perceived valence was positively correlated with the frontal inter-hemispheric flow, but negatively correlated with the parietal bilateral connectivity. Using the connectivity indices between different cortical areas and a support vector machine, we sought to distinguish trials in terms of the self-reported valence of perceived emotions and the familiarity of the musical genres. For 16 participants, the average classification accuracies in discriminating joyful from neutral, joyful from melancholic and familiar from unfamiliar trials were 93.7% 1.06%, 80.43% 1.74%, and 83.04% 1.47, respectively. Integration of different cortical areas is required for music perception and emotional processing. Thus, by studying the connectivity of brain regions, we may be able to develop a noninvasive assessment tool for investigating musical emotions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bad trials are commonly identified using peak-to-peak rejection thresholds that are set manually. This work proposes a solution to determine them automatically using cross-validation. We show that automatically selected rejection thresholds perform at par with manual thresholds, which can save hours of visual data inspection. We then use this automated approach to learn a sensor-specific rejection threshold. Finally, we use this approach to remove trials with finer precision and/or partially repair them using interpolation. We illustrate the performance on three public datasets. The method clearly performs better than a competitive benchmark on a 19-subject Faces dataset.

In general, peak model in the time domain analysis consists of a set of signal parameters, such as amplitude, width, and slope. Models including those proposed by Dumpala, Acir, Liu, and Dingle are routinely used to detect peaks in EEG signals acquired in clinical studies of epilepsy or eye blink. The optimal peak model is the most reliable peak detection performance in a particular application. A fair measure of performance of different models requires a common and unbiased platform. In this study, we evaluate the performance of the four different peak models using the extreme learning machine (ELM)-based peak detection algorithm. We found that the Dingle model gave the best performance, with 72 % accuracy in the analysis of real EEG data. Statistical analysis conferred that the Dingle model afforded significantly better mean testing accuracy than did the Acir and Liu models, which were in the range 37-52 %. Meanwhile, the Dingle model has no significant difference compared to Dumpala model.

While these multivariate methods have greatly advanced the field of neuroimaging, their application to electrophysiological data has been less common especially in the analysis of human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG, also known as electrocorticography or ECoG) data, which contains a rich spectrum of signals recorded from a relatively high number of recording sites. New method: In the present work, we introduce a novel approach to determine the contribution of different bandwidths of EEG signal in different recording sites across different experimental conditions using the Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) method. Comparison with existing method: To validate and compare the usefulness of our approach, we applied this method to an ECoG dataset that was previously analysed and published with univariate methods. Results: Our findings proved the usefulness of the MKL method in detecting changes in the power of various frequency bands during a given task and selecting automatically the most contributory signal in the most contributory site(s) of recording. Conclusions: With a single computation, the contribution of each frequency band in each recording site in the estimated multivariate model can be highlighted, which then allows formulation of hypotheses that can be tested a posteriori with univariate methods if needed.

Unscented Kalman Filter for Neural Decoding of Human Treadmill Walking from Non-invasive Electroencephalography	2016 38TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 16-20, 2016	Orlando, FL	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			BRAIN-MACHINE INTERFACES; SIGNALS; REHABILITATION; PREDICTION; STROKE; LIMB	The feasibility of decoding lower limb kinematics in human treadmill walking from noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) has been demonstrated with linear Wiener filter. However, nonlinear relationship between neural activities and limb movements may challenge the linear decoders in real-time brain computer interface (BCI) applications. In this study, we propose a nonlinear neural decoder using an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to infer lower limb joint angles from noninvasive scalp EEG signals during human treadmill walking. Our results demonstrate that lower limb joint angles during treadmill walking can be decoded from the fluctuations in the amplitude of slow cortical potentials in the delta band (0.1 - 3Hz). Overall, the average decoding accuracy were 0.43 +/- 0.18 for Pearson's r value and 1.82 +/- 3.07 for signal to noise ratio (SNR), and robust to ocular, muscle, or movement artifacts. Moreover, the signal preprocessing scheme and the design of UKF allow the implementation of the proposed EEG-based BCI for real-time applications. This has implications for the development of closed-loop EEG-based BCI systems for gait rehabilitation after stroke.

Decision making was executed in two stages. At first important features such as maximum, minimum, delta value, moment, kurtosis, skew, median, mean and standard deviation at different sub-bands are computed using the wavelet functions -Daubechies 8, Coiflet 6, Biorthogonal 4.4, Symlet 4. Finally, a learning-based algorithm like support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is implemented for classifying letters. From the analysis, Daubechies 8 is found the most suitable candidate among the wavelet families in this proposed research for accurate recognition of different letters. So the focus of this work is to recognize different letters through SVM classifier.

The peculiarity of these EEG signals is that they require ad hoc signals preprocessing by wavelet decomposition, and the definition of a set of features able to characterize the signals and to discriminate among different conditions. The proposed method is completely parameterized, aiming at a multiclass classification and it might be considered in the framework of machine learning. It is a two stages algorithm. The first stage is offline and it is devoted to the determination of a suitable set of features and to the training of a classifier. The second stage, the real-time one, is to test the proposed method on new data. In order to avoid redundancy in the set of features, the principal components analysis is adapted to the specific EEG signal characteristics and it is applied; the classification is performed through the support vector machine. Experimental tests on ten subjects, demonstrating the good performance of the algorithm in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, are also reported and discussed.

This paper proposes a method for recognizing emotions electroencephalography(EEG) based on relevance vector machine(RVM). Emotional states of two types as positive and negative were selected from a standard database of DEAP, with relevance vector machine and support vector machine(SVM) to apply classification and comparison. Experimental results show that RVM classification accuracy was 93.33% and the test run time was 0.0156s; while SVM classification accuracy was 78.67% and the test run time was 0.0211s. Compared with SVM, RVM's time complexity and test error rate are lower, and its classification performance is better.

We aim to develop a noninvasive hybrid BCI relying on two imaging modalities: Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD).

Current digital watermarking techniques for preserving the product ownership are rule-based and not directly deal with the data synchronization, therefore their decoding performance reduces significantly when the watermarked data is transmitted through a real communication channel. This paper proposes a pattern recognition framework to build a new blind watermark scheme for electroencephalography (EEG) data. Embedding a watermark is based on modifying mean modulation relationship of approximation coefficient in wavelet domain. Retrieving this watermark is done effectively using Support vector data description (SVDD) models trained with the correlation between modified frequency coefficients and the watermark sequence in wavelet domain. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme provides good imperceptibility and more robust against various signal processing techniques and common attacks such as random cropping, noise addition, low-pass filtering, and resampling.

The CSP is a statistical signal processing technique, which relies on sample based covariance matrix estimation to give discriminative information from raw EEG signals. The sample based estimation of covariance matrix becomes a problem when the number of training samples is limited, which causes the performance of CSP based brain computer interface (BCI) to degrade significantly. In this paper, we present a maximum entropy based CSP algorithm that incorporates principle of maximum entropy while estimating the sample based covariance matrix. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on publicly available data set samples. The classification results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional CSP algorithm by 13.38% on average.

FES in combination with Brain-computer interfacing (BCI) has a wide scope in rehabilitation because this system can directly link the cerebral motor intention of the users with its corresponding peripheral mucle activations. Such a rehabilitative system would contribute to improve the cortical and peripheral learning and thus, improve the recovery time of the patients. In this paper, we examine the effect of electrical stimulation by FES on the electroencephalography (EEG) during learning of a motor imagery task. The subjects are asked to perform four motor imagery tasks over six sessions and the features from the EEG are extracted using common spatial algorithm and decoded using linear discriminant analysis classifier. Feedback is provided in form of a visual medium and electrical stimulation representing the distance of the features from the hyperplane. Results suggest a significant improvement in the classification accuracy when the subject was induced with electrical stimulation along with visual feedback as compared to the standard visual one.

These problems have motivated the development of various automated seizure detection systems that can aid neurophysiologists in accurate diagnosis of epilepsy. The present study is focused on the development of a robust automated system for classification against low levels of supervised training. EEG data from two different repositories are considered for analysis and validation of the proposed system. The signals are decomposed into time-frequency sub bands till sixth level using dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). All details and last approximation coefficients are used to calculate features viz. energy, standard deviation, root-mean-square, Shannon entropy, mean values and maximum peaks. These feature sets are passed through a general regression neural network (GRNN) for classification with K-fold cross-validation scheme under varying train-to-test ratios. The current model yields ceiling level classification performance (accuracy, sensitivity & specificity) in all combinations of datasets (ictal vs non-ictal) in less than 0.028 s. The proposed scheme will not only maximize hit-rate and correct rejection rate but also will aid neurophysiologists in the fast and accurate diagnosis of seizure onset. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Gao, L; Cheng, W; Zhang, JH; Wang, J				Gao, Lin; Cheng, Wei; Zhang, Jinhua; Wang, Jue			EEG classification for motor imagery and resting state in BCI applications using multi-class Adaboost extreme learning machine	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS			English	Article							HAND ORTHOSIS; BRAIN; STIMULATION; PERFORMANCE; SYNCHRONIZATION; DISCRIMINATION; COMPLEXITY; PATTERNS; GRASP	Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems provide an alternative communication and control approach for people with limited motor function. Therefore, the feature extraction and classification approach should differentiate the relative unusual state of motion intention from a common resting state. In this paper, we sought a novel approach for multi-class classification in BCI applications. We collected electroencephalographic (EEG) signals registered by electrodes placed over the scalp during left hand motor imagery, right hand motor imagery, and resting state for ten healthy human subjects. We proposed using the Kolmogorov complexity (K-c) for feature extraction and a multi-class Adaboost classifier with extreme learning machine as base classifier for classification, in order to classify the three-class EEG samples. An average classification accuracy of 79.5% was obtained for ten subjects, which greatly outperformed commonly used approaches. Thus, it is concluded that the proposed method could improve the performance for classification of motor imagery tasks for multi-class samples.

We recorded EEG data while five subjects imagined different vowels, /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, and /u/. We divided each single trial dataset into thirty segments and extracted features (mean, variance, standard deviation, and skewness) from all segments. To reduce the dimension of the feature vector, we applied a feature selection algorithm based on the sparse regression model. These features were classified using a support vector machine with a radial basis function kernel, an extreme learning machine, and two variants of an extreme learning machine with different kernels. Because each single trial consisted of thirty segments, our algorithm decided the label of the single trial by selecting the most frequent output among the outputs of the thirty segments. As a result, we observed that the extreme learning machine and its variants achieved better classification rates than the support vector machine with a radial basis function kernel and linear discrimination analysis. Thus, our results suggested that EEG responses to imagined speech could be successfully classified in a single trial using an extreme learning machine with a radial basis function and linear kernel. This study with classification of imagined speech might contribute to the development of silent speech BCI systems.

Usually clinicians differentiate between generalized epileptic seizures and PNES based on clinical features and video-EEG. In this work, we investigate the use of machine learning techniques for automatic classification of generalized epileptic and non-epileptic events based only on multi-channel EEG data. For this purpose, we extract the signal patterns in the time domain and in the frequency domain and then combine all features across channels to characterize the spatio-temporal manifestation of seizures. Several classification algorithms are explored and evaluated on EEG epochs from 11 subjects in an inter-subject cross-validation setting. Due to large number of features feature ranking and selection is performed prior to classification using the ReliefF ranking algorithm within two different voting strategies. The classification models using feature subsets, achieved higher accuracy compared to the models using all features reaching 95% (Bayesian Network), 89% (Random Committee) and 87% (Random Forest) for binary classification (epileptic versus non-epileptic). The results demonstrate the competitiveness of this approach as opposed to previous methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The proposed SoC is the first work in literature that integrates a feature extraction (FE) engine, patient specific hardware-efficient NLSVM classification engine, 96 KB SRAM for EEG data storage and low-noise, high dynamic range readout circuits. To achieve on-chip integration of the NLSVM classification engine with minimum area and energy consumption, the FE engine utilizes time division multiplexing (TDM)-BPF architecture. The implemented log-linear Gaussian basis function (LL-GBF) NLSVM classifier exploits the linearization to achieve energy consumption of 0.39 mu J/operation and reduces the area by 28.2% compared to conventional GBF implementation. The readout circuits incorporate a chopper-stabilized DC servo loop to minimize the noise level elevation and achieve noise RTI of 0.81 mu. V-rms for 0.5-100 Hz bandwidth with an NEF of 4.0. The 5 x 5 mm(2) SoC is implemented in a 0.18 mu m 1P6M CMOS process consuming 1.83 /./ J/classification for 8-channel operation. SoC verification has been done with the Children's Hospital Boston-MIT EEG database, as well as with a specific rapid eye-blink pattern detection test, which results in an average detection rate, average false alarm rate and latency of 95.1%, 0.94% (0.27 false alarms/hour) and 2 s, respectively.

In this paper, we have proposed an efficient intelligent pattern recognition system for the classification of epileptic and non-epileptic electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. For this purpose, we used state-of-the-art machine learning technique, i.e., SVM (support vector machines) to classify epileptic and non-epileptic signals. Two (02) different classes of signals are used in this study, i.e., non-epileptic with open eyes and epileptic in seizure condition. One hundred (100) subjects from each class were employed for extraction of discriminatory features and classification purpose. After pre-processing of EEG signals, we use discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to decompose signals upto level 5. Then various features, i.e., energy, entropy and standard deviation are extracted from wavelet bands. Next, we use these features in the classification of signals. We achieved the classification accuracy of 100 % at delta band (0 to 3 Hz) and theta band (3 to 6 Hz). The comparisons with the previous studies show the significance of this system, which can be utilized in real-time as well as in offline clinical applications.

In this paper, a method for the selection of EEG electrodes and features in a discriminative manner is proposed. Given that EEG signals are unstable and non-linear, a non-linear analysis method, i.e., fuzzy entropy, is more appropriate. In this paper, unlike other methods using different signal sources and patterns, such as rest state and motor imagery, a novel paradigm using the stimuli of self-photos and non-self-photos is introduced. Ten subjects are selected to take part in this experiment, and fuzzy entropy is used as a feature to select the minimum number of electrodes that identifies individuals. The experimental results show that the proposed method can make use of two electrodes (FP1 and FP2) in the frontal area, while the classification accuracy is greater than 87.3%. The proposed biometric system, based on EEG signals, can provide each subject with a unique key and is capable of human recognition.

A hypothesis is set that the 3D materials are better than the 2D materials for learning and memory recall. To test the hypothesis, we proposed a classification system that will predict true or false recall for short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) after learning by either 2D or 3D educational contents. For this purpose, EEG brain signals are recorded during learning and testing; the signals are then analysed in the time domain using different types of features in various frequency bands. The features are then fed into a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier. The experimental results indicate that the learning and memory recall using 2D and 3D contents do not have significant differences for both the STM and the LTM.

Many studies were reported using different neuroimaging modalities for classification of the cognitive states of the human brain e.g., EEG, fMRI, MEG etc. However, functional MRI seems to be appropriate for these papers as due to its good spatial resolution and localizing the brain activated regions. In this paper, our objective is to identify the different cognitive brain states. For example, classifying the patterns of high and low cognitive loads. We acquired the fMRI data on the healthy participants. First, data is preprocessed to remove the artifacts and motions corrections. Next, regions of interest were extracted from functional brain volumes of the two states. Data reduction is also performed and data were passed to machine learning classifier i.e., support vector machine. The results showed that high and low cognitive loads were successfully classified with good accuracy.

This paper proposes a unified application of wavelet-based Maximum Entropy on the Mean (wMEM), as a channel selection method, for classifying two motor imagery (MI) tasks using optimal electroencephalography (EEG) sources. The EEG data, which are collected from publicly available BCI Competition III, are captured from five healthy individuals. This source optimization tool has been validated with a generic BCI framework, which utilizes common spatial pattern with and without regularization as preprocessing tools. However, the best classification accuracy attained is 98% using only 11 selected channels that is close to 100% attained using available 118 channels. This result summarizes how optimal EEG channels can be used to develop a BCI system without compromising the performance significantly.	[Hossain, Md. Shakhawat; Saha, Simanto; Habib, Md.

More and more attentions had been taken to the brain computer interface, because it is the only way for some special patients to communicate with the outside world. EEG has show significant potential as a non-invasive way for BCI. But it is very hard to decode useful information from EEG signals in a reliable and efficient way, and also very difficult to get desiable rehabilitation result by current rehabilitation system. To this end, we propose an integrated EEG-driven rehabilitation system with assistive robotic and virtual reality feedback for some stroke patients. The framework of our method contains follow steps: signals accquire, signals preprocess; feature extract; classificatoin and feedback to human. Many advance algorithm has been surveryed and combined to accquire a better result. We use common spatial pattern as the spatial feature of signals, and convert signals to spectral via fast fourier transform. With the spatial and spectral features, we use support vector machine to classify these features and reduce final classification result by a fusion algorithm. At last, the classification result has been used to control robot and virtual reality devices. This synchronous and closed-loop rehabilitation system can achieve benefits for some peoples who suffer from stroke.

The recorded EEG signal is adaptively segmented and the segments with low amplitudes are detected. Next, depending on the spatial distribution of the low-amplitude segments, the first part of the algorithm detects (dynamic) interburst intervals (dIBIs) and performs well on the relatively artifact-free EEG periods and well-defined burst-suppression EEG periods. However, on testing the algorithm on EEG recordings of more than 48 h per neonate, a significant number of misclassified and dubious detections were encountered. Therefore, as the next step, we applied machine learning classifiers to differentiate between definite dIBI detections and misclassified ones. The developed algorithm achieved a true positive detection rate of 98%, 97%, 88%, and 95% for four duration-related dIBI groups that we subsequently defined. We benchmarked our algorithm with an expert diagnostic interpretation of EEG periods (1 h long) and demonstrated its effectiveness in clinical practice. We show that the detection algorithm effectively discriminates challenging cases encountered within mild and moderate background abnormalities. The dIBI detection algorithm improves identification of neonates with good clinical outcome as compared to the classification based on the classical burst-suppression interburst interval.

The early treatment of Alzheimer's disease can significantly reduce deterioration. Early diagnosis is difficult, and early symptoms are frequently overlooked. While much of the literature focuses on disease detection, the use of electroencephalography (EEG) in Alzheimer's diagnosis has received relatively little attention. This study combines the fuzzy and associative Petri net methodologies to develop a model for the effective and objective detection of Alzheimer's disease. Differences in EEG patterns between normal subjects and Alzheimer patients are used to establish prediction criteria for Alzheimer's disease, potentially providing physicians with a reference for early diagnosis, allowing for early action to delay the disease progression.

Thus, optimal channel selection becomes a key factor for developing a more comfortable BCI. This study emphasized on a time-frequency (T-F) coherence method, called as Wavelet Coherence (WC), for selecting lesser number of channels. The selected sets of channels were then used to classify two motor imagery (MI) tasks, i.e., right hand (RH) and right foot (RF). The data was collected from publicly available dataset IVa from BCI Competition III. Common spatial pattern (CSP) with and without regularization were applied as preprocessing techniques. While the classification accuracy is 90% using available 118 channels for subject ay, we have achieved higher classification accuracy of 93 % using only 24 channels using CSP with regularization. Interestingly, the achieved classification accuracy for subject av is 67 % using 4 channels only, that outperform the classification accuracy (i.e., 61 %) achieved using 118 channels.

The advantage of DTCWT over discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was discussed in depth and the ERD/ERS phenomenon was verified at first. Then, the signal component related to sensory motor rhythms was extracted based on dual tree complex wavelet decomposition and reconstruction. Afterward, PSO algorithm was implemented to search the optimal time interval automatically for feature extraction. Finally, average energy, root mean square and signal variance were extracted as features and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was applied for classification. The results show that the proposed method can find the relatively optimal time interval for feature extraction automatically and the maximum classification accuracy is 90%, which is better than the BCI competition winner.

Electroencephalography plays an imperative role for diagnosis of epileptic seizures. But since, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are contaminated with artifacts, detection of epileptic activities is a difficult task even for an experienced neurophysiologist. Therefore, development of an automatic epileptic seizure detection system is essential to improve epilepsy diagnosis. Present research proposes a novel method for analyzing EEG signals using its sections to extract features. The developed scheme involved computation of statistical features which were then passed into the least-squares support vector machineclassifier with non-linear kernel. The performance of the classifier was tested with ten folds for cross-validation. The developed scheme showed mean accuracy of 97.19 % with 0.065 s computation time. Thus, this study holds promising ground for development of real-time automated epilepsy diagnosis system.

J	Li, MA; Luo, XY; Yang, JF				Li, Ming-ai; Luo, Xin-yong; Yang, Jin-fu			Extracting the nonlinear features of motor imagery EEG using parametric t-SNE	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Feature extraction; Motor imagery electroencephalography; Discrete wavelet transform; Parametric t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding; Visualization	DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; CLASSIFICATION; SIGNALS	When performing studies on brain computer interface based rehabilitation problems, researchers frequently encounter difficulty due to the curse of dimensionality and the nonlinear nature of Motor Imagery Electroencephalography (MI-EEG). Though many approaches have been proposed recently to address the feature extraction problem and have shown surprising performance, unfortunately, most of them are non-parametric or linear dimension reduction techniques, which are limited in utility for out of-sample extension for MI-EEG classification. To address the problem and obtain accurate MI-EEG features, a new unsupervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique termed parametric t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (P. t-SNE) is employed to extract the nonlinear features from MI-EEG. Considering that MI-EEG is a kind of non-stationary signal with remarkable time-frequency rhythmic distribution characteristics, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to extract the time frequency features of MI-EEG. Furthermore, P. t-SNE is applied to selected wavelet components to get the nonlinear features. They are then combined serially to construct the feature vector. Experiments are conducted on a publicly available dataset, and the experimental results show that the nonlinear features have great visualization performance with obvious clustering distribution, and the feature extraction method indicates excellent classification performance as evaluated by a support vector machine classifier. This paper suggests a manifold based technique for further analysis and classification research of MI EEG. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To date, amygdala volitional regulation could be obtained only via real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a highly inaccessible procedure. The current article presents high-impact neurobehavioral implications of a novel imaging approach that enables bedside monitoring of amygdala activity using fMRI-inspired electroencephalography (EEG), hereafter termed amygdala-electrical fingerprint (amyg-EFP). Simultaneous EEG/fMRI indicated that the amyg-EFP reliably predicts amygdala-blood oxygen level-dependent activity. Implementing the amyg-EFP in neurofeedback demonstrated that learned downregulation of the amyg-EFP facilitated volitional downregulation of amygdala-blood oxygen level-dependent activity via real-time fMRI and manifested as reduced amygdala reactivity to visual stimuli. Behavioral evidence further emphasized the therapeutic potential of this approach by showing improved implicit emotion regulation following amyg-EFP neurofeedback. Additional EFP models denoting different brain regions could provide a library of localized activity for low-cost and highly accessible brain-based diagnosis and treatment.

This method however requires the clean speech signals of both the attended and the unattended speaker to be available as reference signals, which is difficult to achieve from the noisy recorded microphone signals in practice. In addition, optimizing the parameters involved in the spatio-temporal filter design is of crucial importance in order to reach the largest possible decoding performance. In this paper, the influence of noisy acoustic reference signals and the spatio-temporal filter and regularization parameters on the decoding performance is investigated. The results show that to some extent the decoding performance is robust to noisy acoustic reference signals, depending on the noise type. Furthermore, we demonstrate the crucial influence of several parameters on the decoding performance, especially when the acoustic reference signals used for decoding have been corrupted by noise.

The combined classifier of EEG signals based on artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms was applied. Effectiveness of the classifier was shown in 4-class imaginary finger movement classification. Nine right-handed subjects participated in the study. The mean decoding accuracy using combined heterogeneous classifier committee was -60 +/- 10 %, max: 77 +/- 5 %, while application of homogeneous classifier based on committee of ANNs -52 +/- 9 % and 65 +/- 5 % correspondingly. This work supports the feasibility of the approach, which is presumed suitable for imaginary movements decoding of four fingers of one hand.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is an efficient modality for capturing brain signals with respect to stimuli. Total variation (TV) is an energy based feature which helps to discriminate epilepsy from normal pattern. This paper proposes an efficient epileptic detection system based on TV model. Existing methods use single feature for classification, whereas, combination of multiple relevant features helps for better understanding of epilepsy. This paper also discusses combined multi feature model with TV for efficient detection and classification of EEG signal subbands (gamma, beta, alpha, theta, and delta) using support vector machine. Results show 100% delta band based classification accuracy for combination of features such as TV and sample entropy. This research also shows that combination of multi features such as, Shannon, spectral, TV, and linear predictor coefficient gives good classification accuracy for most of the subbands.

Methods: Twenty-one healthy, right-handed subjects performed kinesthetic motor imagery of opening their left hand, while threshold-based classification of beta-band desynchronization resulted in proprioceptive robotic feedback. The experiment consisted of two blocks in a cross-over design. The participants rated their perceived mental effort nine times per block. In the adaptive block, the threshold was adjusted on the basis of these ratings whereas adjustments were carried out at random in the other block. Electroencephalography was used to examine the cortical activation patterns during the training sessions. Results: The perceived mental effort was correlated with the difficulty threshold of neurofeedback training. Adaptive threshold-setting reduced mental effort and increased the classification accuracy and positive predictive value. This was paralleled by an inter-hemispheric cortical activation pattern in low frequency bands connecting the right frontal and left parietal areas. Optimal balance of mental effort was achieved at thresholds significantly higher than maximum classification accuracy. Conclusion: Rating of mental effort is a feasible approach for effective threshold-adaptation during neurofeedback training. Significance: Closed-loop adaptation of the neurofeedback difficulty level facilitates reinforcement learning of brain self-regulation. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

In this work, an BCI system was developed where the operation of a quadcopter is controlled by identified brain concentration and eye blink patterns. A portable electroencephalography (EEG) headset is used to acquire neural signal around forehead and both eyes. Acquired EEG data are sent to a data processing computer wirelessly and processed in real-time. Identified brain concentration and eye blink patterns are associated with quadcopter operation commands and transmitted to the remote control that is modified to interface with the computer. The BCI system was evaluated by an experiment study and classification accuracy was calculated. Experimental results indicate that the system can achieve the expected performance without using EEG data from all channels and complicated data processing algorithms.

In particular, inspection of the concurrent recorded electroencephalograms (EEG) typically reveals a negative potential at fronto-central electrodes shortly following a response error (Ne or ERN) as well as an error-awareness-related positivity (Pe). Seemingly, the brain signal contains information about the occurrence of an error. Assuming a general error evaluation system, the question arises whether this information can be utilized in order to classify behavioral performance within or even across different cognitive tasks. In the present study, a machine learning approach was employed to investigate the outlined issue. Ne as well as Pe were extracted from the single-trial EEG signals of participants conducting a flanker and a mental rotation task and subjected to a machine learning classification scheme (via a support vector machine, SVM). Overall, individual performance in the flanker task was classified more accurately, with accuracy rates of above 85%. Most importantly, it was even feasible to classify responses across both tasks. In particular, an SVM trained on the flanker task could identify erroneous behavior with almost 70% accuracy in the EEG data recorded during the rotation task, and vice versa. Summed up, we replicate that the response-related EEG signal can be used to identify erroneous behavior within a particular task. Going beyond this, it was possible to classify response types across functionally different tasks. Therefore, the outlined methodological approach appears promising with respect to future applications.

The quality of fMRI data is best among other modalities such as Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG). In fMRI, normally number of features are more than the number of instances so it is necessary to select the features and do dimension reduction to remove noisy and redundant data. Many techniques and methods are used to select the significant features (voxels). In this paper, the significant voxels are selected within the anatomical region of interest (ROI) based on the absolute values. In this study, we have predicted the brain states using two machine learning algorithm, i.e, Radial basis function (RBF) network and Naive Bayes. A visual experiment with two categories is done. In conclusion, it is shown that less number of voxels and specific brain regions can increase the accuracy of prediction.

Recent MEG applications pose an emerging need of decoding brain states based on MEG signals originating from prespecified cortical regions. Toward this goal, we propose a novel region-of-interest-constrained discriminant analysis algorithm (RDA) in this paper. RDA integrates linear classification and beamspace transformation into a unified framework by formulating a constrained optimization problem. Our experimental results based on human subjects demonstrate that RDA can efficiently extract the discriminant pattern from prespecified cortical regions to accurately distinguish different brain states.

Fifty-five PNES video-EEG recordings were retrospectively analyzed by four epileptologists and one psychiatrist in a blind manner and classified into four distinct groups: Hypermotor (H), Akinetic (A), Focal Motor (FM), and with Subjective Symptoms (SS). Eleven signs and symptoms, which are frequently found in PNESs, were chosen for statistical validation of our classification. An artificial neural network (ANN) analyzed PNLS video recordings based on the signs and symptoms mentioned above. By comparing results produced by the ANN with classifications given by examiners, we were able to understand whether such classification was objective and generalizable. Through accordance metrics based on signs and symptoms (range: 0-100%), we found that most of the seizures belonging to class A showed a high degree of accordance (mean +/- SD 73% +/- 5%); a similar pattern was found for class SS (80% slightly lower accordance was reported for class H (58% +/- 18%)), with a minimum of 30%, in some cases. Low agreement arose from the FM group. Seizures were univocally assigned to a given class in 83.6% of seizures. The ANN classified PNESs in the same way as visual examination in 86.7%. Agreement between ANN classification and visual classification reached 83.3% (SD 17.8%) accordance for class H, 100% (SD = 22%) for class A, 83.3% (SD 21.2%) for class SS, and 50% (SD = 19.52%) for class FM. This is the first study in which the validity of a new PNLS classification was established and reached in two different ways. Video-EEG evaluation needs to be performed by an experienced clinician, but later on, it may be fed into ANN analysis, whose feedback will provide guidance for differential diagnosis. Our analysis, supported by the ML approach, showed that this model of classification could be objectively performed by video-EEG examination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this method, the reduction of dimensions is achieved by spectral decomposition of a given graph, which is defined by a geometrical distribution of electrodes on the head surface. The resulting subspace reduces the dimension of EEG signals, and therefore, the size of the sample co-variance matrix (SCM) of EEG can also be reduced. The reduction method is combined with a differential geometry-based approach called tangent space mapping (TSM) that can map a SCM in a Riemannian manifold onto an element in an Euclidean space called a tangent space. Thus, any machine learning algorithm that works in the Euclidean space can be applied. Results of two-class and four class classification of EEG during MI show that the proposed method of dimensionality reduction increases the recognition accuracy even in the case of a training dataset having a small number of elements.

This framework is quite general and can be applied to many eigenvalue problems in machine learning and pattern recognition, ranging from supervised learning to unsupervised learning, such as principal component analysis (PCA), Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA), common spatial pattern (CSP), and so on. The core assumption of our approach is that the leading eigenvectors of related GEPs lie in some subspace that can be approximated by a sparse linear combination of basis vectors. As a result, these GEPs can be jointly solved by a sparse coding approach. Empirical evaluation with both synthetic and benchmark real world datasets validates the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed techniques, especially for grouped multitask GEPs.

Using selected TF distributions (TFDs), TF feature extraction is performed on multi-channel recordings using channel fusion and feature fusion approaches. Following the findings of previous studies, a TF feature set is defined to include three complementary categories: signal related features, statistical features and image features. Multi-class strategies are then used to improve the classification algorithm robustness to artifacts. The optimal subset of TF features is selected using the wrapper method with sequential forward feature selection (SFFS). In addition, a new proposed measure for TF feature selection is shown to improve the sensitivity of the classifier (while slightly reducing total accuracy and specificity). As an illustration, the TF approach is applied to the design of a system for detection of seizure activity in real newborn EEG signals. Experimental results indicate that: (1) The compact kernel distribution (CKD) outperforms other TFDs in classification accuracy; (2) a feature fusion strategy gives better classification than a channel fusion strategy; e.g. using all TF features, the CKD achieves a classification accuracy of 82% with feature fusion, which is 4% more than the channel fusion approach; (3) the SFFS wrapper feature selection method improves the classification performance for all TFDs; e.g. total accuracy is improved by 4.6%; (4) the multi-class strategy improves the seizure detection accuracy in the presence of artifacts; e.g. a total accuracy of 86.61% with one vs. one multi-class approach is achieved i.e. 0.91% more than the binary classification approach. The results obtained on a large practical real data set confirm the improved performance capability of TF features for knowledge based systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Real time stress detection system based on EEG signals	BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH-INDIA			English	Article						Stress detection; Electroencephalography; Hilbert-Huang transform; Support vector machine; Machine learning	MEDICAL-STUDENTS	Stress has become a common emotion that students experience in day to day life. Several factors contribute to their stress and proven to have a detrimental effect on their performance. Hence, stress becomes ubiquitous in academic environment due to higher expectations in academic achievement, poor time management, and financial concerns. It has an adverse effect on the quality of their life affecting both physical and mental health. It is a guarantor for depression and suicidal risks if left unnoticed over a longer period. The traditional stress detection system is based on physiological signals and facial expression techniques. The major drawback is the uncertainty that arises due to numerous external factors like sweating, room temperature, anxiety. Some methods like hormone analysis have a drawback of invasive procedure. There is a need for a method that is non-invasive, precise, accurate and reliable. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a perfect tool as it is a non-invasive procedure. Also, it receives feedback from stress hormones; it can serve as reliable tool to measure stress. This research work aims to detect stress for students based on EEG as EEG displays a good correlation with stress. The EEG signal is pre-processed to remove artefacts and relevant time-frequency features are extracted using Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). The extracted features are manipulated to detect stress levels using hierarchical Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The results revealed the efficiency of the system to detect stress in real time using their brain wave.

However, these methods need a lot of preprocessing and postprocessing such as filtering, demean, and spatiospectral feature fusion, which influence the classification accuracy easily. In this paper, we utilize linear dynamical systems (LDSs) for EEG signals feature extraction and classification. LDSs model has lots of advantages such as simultaneous spatial and temporal feature matrix generation, free of preprocessing or postprocessing, and low cost. Furthermore, a low-rank matrix decomposition approach is introduced to get rid of noise and resting state component in order to improve the robustness of the system. Then, we propose a low-rank LDSs algorithm to decompose feature subspace of LDSs on finite Grassmannian and obtain a better performance. Extensive experiments are carried out on public dataset from "BCI Competition III Dataset IVa" and "BCI Competition IV Database 2a." The results show that our proposed three methods yield higher accuracies compared with prevailing approaches such as CSP and CSSP.

Epileptic MEG Spikes Detection Using Common Spatial Patterns and Linear Discriminant Analysis	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Epileptic spikes detection; MEG; common spatial patterns; linear discriminant analysis	AUTOMATIC DETECTION; EEG; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; CLASSIFICATION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; RECORDINGS; ALGORITHMS; EVENTS	Epilepsy is a brain disorder, where patients' lives are extremely disturbed by the occurrence of sudden unpredictable seizures. This paper develops patient-independent signal processing techniques based on common spatial patterns and linear discriminant analysis to detect epileptic activities (spikes) from multi-channel brain signal recordings. In contrast to current existing studies which heavily rely on the analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) data for the detection of epileptic activities, this research work considers magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings for the detection of epileptic spikes. This requires careful development since unlike EEG spikes, MEG spikes do not have well-defined morphological characteristics. Due to the recent advances in MEG technology, it became possible to consider MEG signals to detect and analyze epileptic activities, but efforts to develop signal processing tools in this area are still in its outset, as compared with those devoted to EEG signal processing.

Relevance vector classifier decision fusion and EEG graph-theoretic features for automatic affective state characterization	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Affective states; Graph theory; Electroencephalography; Relevance vector machines; Decision fusion	EMOTION RECOGNITION; BRAIN; MUSIC; CONNECTIVITY; OSCILLATIONS; SIGNALS; CONSCIOUSNESS; INFORMATION; ASYMMETRY; SELECTION	Objective characterization of affective states during music clip watching could lead to disruptive new technologies, such as affective brain-computer interfaces, neuromarketing tools, and affective video tagging systems, to name a few. To date, the majority of existing systems have been developed based on analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) patterns in specific brain regions. With music videos, however, a complex interplay of information transfer exists between various brain regions. In this paper, we propose the use of EEG graph-theoretic analysis to characterize three emotional ratings: valence, arousal, and dominance, as well as the "liking" subjective rating. For characterization, graph-theoretic features were used to classify emotional states through support vector machine (SVM) and relevance vector machine (RVM) classifiers. Moreover, fusion schemes at feature and decision levels were also used to improve classification performance. In general, our study shows that the EEG graph-theoretic features are better suited for emotion classification than traditionally used EEG features such as, spectral power features (SPF) and asymmetry index (AI) features. The percentage increase in classification performance, represented by F1-scores, obtained using the proposed methodologies relative to the traditionally used SPF and AI features ranged from: Valence (7-9%), Arousal (3-8%), Dominance (5-6%) and Liking (4-7%). These findings suggest that an EEG graph-theoretical approach along with a robust classifier can better characterize human affective states evoked during music clip watching. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These activities can be decoded by signal processing techniques. However, EEG recordings are always contaminated with artifacts which hinder the decoding process. Therefore, identifying and removing artifacts is an important step. Researchers often clean EEG recordings with assistance from independent component analysis (ICA), since it can decompose EEG recordings into a number of artifact-related and event-related potential (ERP)-related independent components. However, existing ICA-based artifact identification strategies mostly restrict themselves to a subset of artifacts, e.g., identifying eye movement artifacts only, and have not been shown to reliably identify artifacts caused by nonbiological origins like high-impedance electrodes. In this paper, we propose an automatic algorithm for the identification of general artifacts. The proposed algorithm consists of two parts: 1) an event-related feature-based clustering algorithm used to identify artifacts which have physiological origins; and 2) the electrodescalp impedance information employed for identifying nonbiological artifacts. The results on EEG data collected from ten subjects show that our algorithm can effectively detect, separate, and remove both physiological and nonbiological artifacts. Qualitative evaluation of the reconstructed EEG signals demonstrates that our proposed method can effectively enhance the signal quality, especially the quality of ERPs, even for those that barely display ERPs in the raw EEG. The performance results also show that our proposed method can effectively identify artifacts and subsequently enhance the classification accuracies compared to four commonly used automatic artifact removal methods.

Driver fatigue is a major case of traffic accidents worldwide and considered as a significant problem in recent decades. In this paper, a hybrid deep generic model (DGM)-based support vector machine is proposed for accurate detection of driver fatigue. Traditionally, a probabilistic DGM with deep architecture is quite good at learning invariant features, but it is not always optimal for classification due to its trainable parameters are in the middle layer. Alternatively, Support Vector Machine (SVM) itself is unable to learn complicated invariance, but produces good decision surface when applied to well-behaved features. Consolidating unsupervised high-level feature extraction techniques, DGM and SVM classification makes the integrated framework stronger and enhance mutually in feature extraction and classification. The experimental results showed that the proposed DBN-based driver fatigue monitoring system achieves better testing accuracy of 73.29 % with 91.10 % sensitivity and 55.48 % specificity. In short, the proposed hybrid DGM-based SVM is an effective method for the detection of driver fatigue in EEG.

Electroencephalography (EEG) based Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) systems can be defined to be a non-muscular pathway to operate rehabilitative devices using motor imagery signals captured from the motor activation areas in the brain. Supervised learning can help in prediction of motor imagery actions by processing raw EEG signals. However, dimension of the feature space plays a crucial role in this process. Large dimensional features not only increase the computational complexity but also the presence of redundant features causes reduction in classification accuracy. In this work, we intend to select the relevant features from the feature vector obtained by Power Spectrum Density estimation of the left/right motor imagery signals. BCI Competition 2008 - Graz dataset B has been used as the source of raw EEG data. To achieve this goal, we have used single-objective as well as many-objective version of Differential Evolution which optimizes the classifier's performance in terms of five metrics obtained from the Confusion Matrix. Support Vector Machine is used for fitness evaluation of the chosen feature subset as well as for classification of mental states. This work demonstrates the superiority of many-objective Differential Evolution in improving the accuracy due to reduction in feature dimension from an average of 60.56% to 82.60% while processing time of a test EEG sample reduces from 6.1 milliseconds to 5.6 milliseconds. The results obtained in this work are validated using Friedman Test.

This paper tries to accurately classify motor imagery imagination tasks: e.g. left and right hand movement using three different methods which are: (1) Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), (2) Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and (3) k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers. With ANFIS, different clustering methods are utilized which are Subtractive, Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) and K-means. These clustering methods are examined and compared in terms of their accuracy. Three features are studied in this paper including AR coefficients, Band Power Frequency, and Common Spatial pattern (CSP). The classification accuracies with two optimal channels C3 and C4 are investigated.

Gait adaptation to visual kinematic perturbations using a real-time closed-loop brain-computer interface to a virtual reality avatar	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain computer interfaces; visuomotor adaptation; gait adaptation; BCI-VR systems	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; CHRONIC STROKE; MACHINE INTERFACES; TREADMILL WALKING; KALMAN FILTER; REHABILITATION; INDIVIDUALS; RECOVERY; POSTSTROKE; IMPACT	Objective. The control of human bipedal locomotion is of great interest to the field of lower-body brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for gait rehabilitation. While the feasibility of closed-loop BCI systems for the control of a lower body exoskeleton has been recently shown, multi-day closed-loop neural decoding of human gait in a BCI virtual reality (BCI-VR) environment has yet to be demonstrated. BCI-VR systems provide valuable alternatives for movement rehabilitation when wearable robots are not desirable due to medical conditions, cost, accessibility, usability, or patient preferences. Approach. In this study, we propose a real-time closed-loop BCI that decodes lower limb joint angles from scalp electroencephalography ( EEG) during treadmill walking to control a walking avatar in a virtual environment. Fluctuations in the amplitude of slow cortical potentials of EEG in the delta band (0.1-3 Hz) were used for prediction; thus, the EEG features correspond to time-domain amplitude modulated potentials in the delta band. Virtual kinematic perturbations resulting in asymmetric walking gait patterns of the avatar were also introduced to investigate gait adaptation using the closed-loop BCI-VR system over a period of eight days. Main results. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using a closed-loop BCI to learn to control a walking avatar under normal and altered visuomotor perturbations, which involved cortical adaptations. The average decoding accuracies ( Pearson's r values) in real-time BCI across all subjects increased from ( Hip: 0.18 +/- 0.31; Knee: 0.23 +/- 0.33; Ankle: 0.14 +/- 0.22) on Day 1 to (Hip: 0.40 +/- 0.24; Knee: 0.55 +/- 0.20; Ankle: 0.29 +/- 0.22) on Day 8. Significance. These findings have implications for the development of a real-time closed-loop EEG-based BCI-VR system for gait rehabilitation after stroke and for understanding cortical plasticity induced by a closed-loop BCI-VR system.

The goal of this study is to promote classification of two types of imaginary movements, left and right hands, in an EMOTIV cap based system, using the Naive Bayes classifier. A preliminary analysis with respect to results obtained by other experiments in this field is also conducted. Processing of the electroencephalography (EEG) signals is done applying Common Spatial Pattern filters. The EPOC electrodes cap is used for EEG acquisition, in two test subjects, for two distinct trial formats. The channels picked are FC5, FC6, P7 and P8 of the 10-20 system, and a discussion about the differences of using C3, C4, P3 and P4 positions is proposed. Dataset 3 of the BCI Competition II is also analyzed using the implemented algorithms. The maximum classification results for the proposed experiment and for the BCI Competition dataset were, respectively, 79% and 85%. The conclusion of this study is that the picked positions for electrodes may be applied for BCI systems with satisfactory classification rates.

This paper will present the rehearsal effects based on electroencephalography (EEG) recorded data for multimedia contents. Three frequency based features are used to discriminate the three learning states mentioned as L1, L2 and L3 using machine learning algorithms. From these three learning states, L1 is the first learning state whether L2 and L3 are the rehearsal states of L1. The set of spectral features that are used for analysis are based on the intensity weighted mean frequency (IWMF), its bandwidth (IWBW), and spectral power density (PSD). For the analysis, the three brain waves investigated are the alpha waves, theta waves and delta waves. The results of the study show that the alpha waves produce de-synchronization from rest to learning state as compared to other EEG recorded waves. This de-synchronization lead to mental effort imposed by working memory during a learning task. The Alpha wave shows more accuracy in L1 using SVM classifier that is 85% using PSD features, 86% for IWFM and 78.4% using IBWB feature. The results also mention that L3 produces less classifier accuracy value as compared to the L2 and L1 for each of three extracted features. This indicates that L3 requires less mental effort during learning. The findings proved the rehearsal as a good phenomenon of long-term memorized learning.

J	Peker, M				Peker, Musa			An efficient sleep scoring system based on EEG signal using complex-valued machine learning algorithms	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Machine learning; EEG; Complex-valued nonlinear features; Complex-valued neural network; Sleep scoring	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; LYAPUNOV EXPONENTS; DOPPLER SIGNALS; CLASSIFICATION; CHANNEL; RECOGNITION; AGREEMENT; FEATURES	Sleep staging is a significant step in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. Sleep scoring is a time-consuming and difficult process. Given that sleep scoring requires expert knowledge, it is generally undertaken by sleep experts. In this study, a new hybrid machine learning method consisting of complex-valued nonlinear features (CVNF) and a complex-valued neural network (CVANN) has been presented for automatic sleep scoring using single channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals. First of all, we should note that in this context, nine nonlinear features have been obtained as those are often pkeferred for the classification of EEG signals. These obtained features were then converted into a complex-valued number format using a phase encoding method. In this way, a new complex-valued feature set was obtained for sleep scoring. The obtained attributes have been presented as input to the CVANN algorithm. We have used a number of different statistical parameters during the evaluation process. The results that have been obtained are based on two sleep standards: Rechtschaffen & Kales (R&K) and American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM). Finally, a 91.57% accuracy rate was obtained according to R&K standard; a 93.84% accuracy rate was obtained according to the AASM standard using the proposed method. We therefore observed that the proposed method is promising in terms of the sleep scoring. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper describes the design consideration of a multi-channel machine-learning based EEG classification and recording processors for wearable form-factor sensors. The goal is to optimize the detection performance while balancing the analog and digital signal processing to optimize its energy consumption. On-chip classification significantly helps achieving energy-efficiency by reducing the communication overhead of the data. With epileptic seizure detection and recording system examples, we start from choosing number of channels, the sampling rate, and how to effectively extract features out of the down-sampled data. After that, classification algorithms are also discussed in detail. When verified with the Children's Hospital Boston-Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CHB-MIT) EEG database, based on Repeated Random Sub-Sampling validation, the seizure detection sensitivity and specificity of the Non-Linear SVM are improved by 12.4% P and 3.56% P, respectively, compared to the Linear-SVM. The LSVM and NLSVM processors are fabricated in 0.18 mu m 1P6M CMOS and consume 1.52 mu J/classification and 1.34 mu J/classification, respectively. Finally, the on-chip memory requirements for storing the raw seizure data is discussed.

Our time-frequency analysis-based feature extraction is fine-tuned to capture sleep stage-specific signal features as described in the American Academy of Sleep Medicine manual that the human experts follow. We used ensemble learning with an ensemble of stacked sparse autoencoders for classifying the sleep stages. We used class-balanced random sampling across sleep stages for each model in the ensemble to avoid skewed performance in favor of the most represented sleep stages, and addressed the problem of misclassification errors due to class imbalance while significantly improving worst-stage classification. We used an openly available dataset from 20 healthy young adults for evaluation. We used a single channel of EEG from this dataset, which makes our method a suitable candidate for longitudinal monitoring using wearable EEG in real-world settings. Our method has both high overall accuracy (78%, range 75-80%), and high mean -score (84%, range 82-86%) and mean accuracy across individual sleep stages (86%, range 84-88%) over all subjects. The performance of our method appears to be uncorrelated with the sleep efficiency and percentage of transitional epochs in each recording.

For this purpose, we adopted a classification approach that predicts true and false memories in case of both short term memory (STM) and long term memory (LTM) and helps to decide whether there is a difference between the impact of 2D and 3D educational contents. In this approach, EEG brain signals are converted into topomaps and then discriminative features are extracted from them and finally support vector machine (SVM) which is employed to predict brain states. For data collection, half of sixty-eight healthy individuals watched the learning material in 2D format whereas the rest watched the same material in 3D format. After learning task, memory recall tasks were performed after 30 minutes (STM) and two months (LTM), and EEG signals were recorded. In case of STM, 97.5% prediction accuracy was achieved for 3D and 96.6% for 2D and, in case of LTM, it was 100% for both 2D and 3D. The statistical analysis of the results suggested that for learning and memory recall both 2D and 3D materials do not have much difference in case of STM and LTM.

We used direct brain stimulation, pre- and postsurgical behavioral measures, and intracranial electroencephalography to provide support for, and elaborate upon, the visual word form hypothesis. This hypothesis states that activity in the left midfusiform gyrus (lmFG) reflects visually organized information about words and word parts. In patients with electrodes placed directly in their lmFG, we found that disrupting lmFG activity through stimulation, and later surgical resection in one of the patients, led to impaired perception of whole words and letters. Furthermore, using machine-learning methods to analyze the electrophysiological data from these electrodes, we found that information contained in early lmFG activity was consistent with an orthographic similarity space. Finally, the lmFG contributed to at least two distinguishable stages of word processing, an early stage that reflects gist-level visual representation sensitive to orthographic statistics, and a later stage that reflects more precise representation sufficient for the individuation of orthographic word forms. These results provide strong support for the visual word form hypothesis and demonstrate that across time the lmFG is involved in multiple stages of orthographic representation.

The most common MTP BCI employs a time series of bandpass-filtered EEG potentials (referred to here as the potential time-series, PTS, model) for reconstructing the trajectory of a 3D limb movement using multiple linear regression. These studies report the best accuracy when a 0.5-2 Hz bandpass filter is applied to the EEG. In the present study, we show that spatiotemporal power distribution of theta (4-8 Hz), mu (8-12 Hz), and beta (12-28 Hz) bands are more robust for movement trajectory decoding when the standard PTS approach is replaced with time-varying bandpower values of a specified EEG band, ie, with a bandpower time-series (BTS) model. A comprehensive analysis comprising of three subjects performing pointing movements with the dominant right arm toward six targets is presented. Our results show that the BTS model produces significantly higher MTP accuracy (R similar to 0.45) compared to the standard PTS model (R similar to 0.2). In the case of the BTS model, the highest accuracy was achieved across the three subjects typically in the mu (8-12 Hz) and low-beta (12-18 Hz) bands. Additionally, we highlight a limitation of the commonly used PTS model and illustrate how this model may be suboptimal for decoding motion trajectory relevant information. Although our results, showing that the mu and beta bands are prominent for MTP, are not in line with other MTP studies, they are consistent with the extensive literature on classical multiclass sensorimotor rhythm-based BCI studies (classification of limbs as opposed to motion trajectory prediction), which report the best accuracy of imagined limb movement classification using power values of mu and beta frequency bands. The methods proposed here provide a positive step toward noninvasive decoding of imagined 3D hand movements for movement-free BCIs.

Motor imagery (MI) is one well-known basis for designing Electroencephalography (EEG)-based real-life BCI systems. However, EEG signals are often contaminated with severe noise and various uncertainties, imprecise and incomplete information streams. Therefore, this study proposes spectrum ensemble based on swam-optimized fuzzy integral for integrating decisions from sub-band classifiers that are established by a sub-band common spatial pattern (SBCSP) method. Firstly, the SBCSP effectively extracts features from EEG signals, and thereby the multiple linear discriminant analysis (MLDA) is employed during a MI classification task. Subsequently, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to regulate the subject-specific parameters for assigning optimal confidence levels for classifiers used in the fuzzy integral during the fuzzy fusion stage of the proposed system. Moreover, BCI systems usually tend to have complex architectures, be bulky in size, and require time-consuming processing. To overcome this drawback, a wireless and wearable EEG measurement system is investigated in this study. Finally, in our experimental result, the proposed system is found to produce significant improvement in terms of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a robotic arm can be reliably controlled using the proposed BCI system. This paper presents novel insights regarding the possibility of using the proposed MI-based BCI system in real-life applications.

However, it is not clear whether we may obtain a more precise spatial localization of the focus of attention based on the EEG signals during central fixation. In this study, we used a modified Posner cueing task with an endogenous cue to determine the degree to which information in the EEG signal can be used to track visual spatial attention in presentation sequences lasting 200 ms. We used a machine learning classification method to evaluate how well EEG signals discriminate between four different locations of the focus of attention. We then used a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) and a leave-one-out cross-validation framework to evaluate the decoding accuracy (DA). We found that ERP-based features from occipital and parietal regions showed a statistically significant valid prediction of the location of the focus of visuospatial attention (DA = 57%, p<.001, chance-level 25%). The mean distance between the predicted and the true focus of attention was 0.62 letter positions, which represented a mean error of 0.55 degrees of visual angle. In addition, ERP responses also successfully predicted whether spatial attention was allocated or not to a given location with an accuracy of 79% (p<.001). These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for visuospatial attention decoding and future paths for research are proposed.

CAP is a sleep phenomenon composed by consecutive sequences of A-phases (each A-phase could belong to a possible group A1, A2 or A3) observed during the non-REM sleep. Each A-phase is separated by a B-phase which has the basal frequency of the EEG during a specific sleep stage. The patterns formed by these sequences reflect the sleep instability and consequently help to understand the sleep process. Ten recordings from healthy good sleepers were included in this study. The current study investigates complexity, statistical and frequency signal properties of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings at the transitions: B-phase-A-phase. In addition, classification between the onset-offset of the A-phases and B-phase was carried out with a kNN classifier. The results showed that EEG signal presents significant differences (p < 0.05) between A-phases and B-phase for the standard deviation, energy, sample entropy, Tsallis entropy and frequency band indices. The A-phase onset showed values of energy three times higher than B-phase at all the sleep stages. The statistical analysis of variance shows that more than 80 % of the A-phase onset and offset is significantly different from the B-phase. The classification performance between onset or offset of A-phases and background showed classification values over 80 % for specificity and accuracy and 70 % for sensitivity. Only during the A3-phase, the classification was lower. The results suggest that neural assembles that generate the basal EEG oscillations during sleep present an over-imposed coordination for a few seconds due to the A-phases. The main characteristics for automatic separation between the onset-offset A-phase and the B-phase are the energy at the different frequency bands.

Art			Using Wireless EEG Signals to Assess Memory Workload in the n-Back Task	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Classification; cognitive workload; electroencephalogram (EEG); feature selection; memory load; wireless neuroimaging systems	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; WORKING-MEMORY; BRAIN; LOAD; COGNITION; ARTIFACT	Assessment of mental workload using physiological measures, especially electroencephalography (EEG) signals, is an active area. Recently, a number of wireless acquisition systems to measure EEG and other physiological signals have become available. Few studies have applied such wireless systems to assess cognitive workload and evaluate their performance. This paper presents an initial step to explore the feasibility of a popular wireless system (EmotivEPOCheadset) to assess memoryworkload levels in a well-known n-back task. We developed a signal processing and classification framework, which integrated an automatic artifact removal algorithm, a broad spectrum of feature extraction techniques, a personalized feature scaling method, an information-theory-based feature selection approach, and a proximal-support-vectormachine-based classification model. The experimental results show that the wirelessly collected EEG signals can be used to classify different memory workload levels for nine participants. The classification accuracies between the lowest workload level (0-back) and active workload levels (1-, 2-, 3-back) were close to 100%. The best classification accuracy for 1- versus 2-back was 80%, and 1- versus 3-back was 84%. This study indicates that the wireless acquisition system and the advanced data analytics and pattern recognition techniques are promising to achieve real-time monitoring and identification of mental workload levels for humans engaged in a wide variety of cognitive activities in the modern society.

AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH FOR AUDITORY ATTENTION TRACKING USING SINGLE-TRIAL EEG	2016 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING PROCEEDINGS	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing ICASSP		English	Proceedings Paper	41st IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)	MAR 20-25, 2016	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Signal Proc Soc		auditory; attention; BCI; EEG	RESPONSES; SPEECH	Auditory selective attention plays a central role in the human capacity to reliably process complex sounds in multi-source environments. Stimulus reconstruction has been widely used for the investigation of selective auditory attention using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG). In particular, the influence of attention on sound representations in the brain has been modeled by linear time-variant filters and have been used to track the attentional state of individuals in multi-source environments. Detection of auditory attention is of interest and is important in the study of attention-related disorders and has potential application in the hearing aid and advertising industries. In analogy with the rake receiver from wireless communications, we propose a new strategy, adapting principles from minimum variance beamforming, to reconstruct stimuli for decoding the attentional state of listeners in a competing speaker environment. We show through experiments with real electrophysiological data how decoding accuracies can be improved using our proposed scheme.

The reason may pertain to the fact that these movements activate essentially the same neural networks. In this study, we aimed at testing whether repetitive pointing movements to each of the targets promotes the development of segregated neural patterns, resulting in enhanced decoding accuracy. Six human subjects generated slow or fast repetitive pointing movements with their right dominant arm to one of five targets distributed in 3D space, followed by repetitive imagery of movements to the same target or to a different target. Nine naive subjects generated both repetitive and non-repetitive slow actual movements to each of the five targets to test the effect of block design on decoding accuracy. In order to assure that base line drift and low frequency motion artifacts do not contaminate the data, the data were high-pass filtered in 4-30 Hz, leaving out the delta and gamma band. For the repetitive trials, the model decoded target location with 81% accuracy, which is significantly higher than chance level. The average decoding rate of target location was only 30% for the non-repetitive trials, which is not significantly different than chance level. A subset of electrodes, mainly over the contralateral sensorimotor areas, was found to provide most of the discriminative features for all tested conditions. Time proximity between trained and tested blocks was found to enhance decoding accuracy of target location both by target non-specific and specific mechanisms. Our findings suggest that movement repetition promotes the development of distinct neural patterns, presumably by the formation of target-specific kinesthetic memory. (C) 2016 IBRO.

EEG Based Gesture Mimicking by An Artificial Limb Using Cascade-Correlation Learning Architecture	2016 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	JUL 24-29, 2016	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Int Nueral Network Soc, Evolutionary Programming Soc, IET, IEEE BigData, Gulf Univ Sci & Technol		human machine interface; gesture mimicking; rehabilitation; electroencephalography; Kinect sensor; Jaco robot arm; cascade-correlation learning architecture	REHABILITATION	Patients with prosthesis defects find it is very difficult to perform day-to-day basic tasks which involve employment of their limbs. This motivates us to develop a system where an artificial limb is employed to mimic the arm gestures of the patients for assisting them. Towards developing this system, we have taken the help from the electroencephalography (EEG) signals acquired from the brain of the patients to build a bypass network (BPN) to direct the artificial limb. Since difficulties are already present in the arm movements of the patients (here subjects), thus only gestures of those subjects are not sufficient to build the proposed system. This research finds tremendous applications in rehabilitative aid for the disable persons. To concretize our goal we have developed an experimental setup, where the target subject (for training phase healthy subjects are taken into account) is asked to catch a ball while his/her brain (occipital, parietal and motor cortex) signals using EEG acquisition device and body gestures using Kinect sensor are simultaneously acquired. These data are mapped using four cascade-correlation learning architecture (CCLA) to train artificial limb (we have used Jaco robot arm) to move accordingly. Utilizing the mapping results obtained from these four CCLAs, a BPN is developed. When a rehabilitative patient is unable to catch the ball, then in that scenario, the artificial limb is helpful for assisting the patient to catch the ball with a high accuracy of 85.65%. The proposed system can be implemented not only for ball catching experiment but also in several applications where an artificial limb needs to perform a locomotive task based on EEG and body gesture.

Quaternion-Based Signal Analysis for Motor Imagery Classification from Electroencephalographic Signals	SENSORS			English	Article						motor imagery; electroencephalography (EEG); brain-computer interface (BCI); quaternion-based signal analysis (QSA)	COMPUTER; BCI; ENTROPY; TASKS; ROBOT; EEG	Quaternions can be used as an alternative to model the fundamental patterns of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in the time domain. Thus, this article presents a new quaternion-based technique known as quaternion-based signal analysis (QSA) to represent EEG signals obtained using a brain-computer interface (BCI) device to detect and interpret cognitive activity. This quaternion-based signal analysis technique can extract features to represent brain activity related to motor imagery accurately in various mental states. Experimental tests in which users where shown visual graphical cues related to left and right movements were used to collect BCI-recorded signals. These signals were then classified using decision trees (DT), support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) techniques. The quantitative analysis of the classifiers demonstrates that this technique can be used as an alternative in the EEG-signal modeling phase to identify mental states.

In this work, we have proposed a method to detect ictal patterns in EEG by selecting optimum number of features without compromising the overall accuracy of the system. In this paper, EEG signals were decomposed using wavelet packet transform and energy features were extracted. Then the most correlated features were fed into the k-Nearest Neighbor classifier.

This work reproduces the protocol design in two recent mental imagery studies with a larger group comprising 20 healthy volunteers. The main goal is assessing if modifications in the signal extraction techniques, training-testing/cross-validation routines, and hypotheses evoked in the statistical analysis, can provide solutions to the serious difficulties documented in the literature. The lack of robustness in the results advises for further search of alternative protocols more suitable for machine learning classification and of better performing signal treatment techniques.

In order to determine whether silent reading can improve mental tasks for BCI systems, this paper proposed a two-step experiment: mental tasks with speech imagery and mental tasks without speech imagery. Reading Chinese characters in mind is set as speech imagery. Since Chinese characters are monosyllabic, it is very convenient to read them in mind with related mental tasks simultaneously. Ten Chinese subjects are trained by two steps in this experiment. Feature vectors of EEG signals are extracted and classified by common spatial patterns (CSP) and support vector machine (SVM), respectively. Compared with just mental tasks, the accuracies between two tasks have been significantly improved by appending speech imagery, and the average of accuracies of ten subjects is increased from 76.3% to 82.3%. During the imagery period, the temporal stability of EEG signals is evaluated by Cronbach's alpha coefficients. The steadiness of signals is different between mental tasks, and EEG signals are more stabilization with speech imagery. The stability of brain activity is conducive to the operation of BCIs.

However this modality fails to identify 15-20% of DLB cases and thus other biomarkers may be useful. It is recognised electroencephalography (EEG) slowing and relative medial temporal lobe preservation are supportive features of DLB, although individually they lack diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, we investigated whether combined EEG and MRI indices could assist in the differential diagnosis of AD and DLB. Seventy two participants (21 Controls, 30 AD, 21 DLB) underwent resting EEG and 3 T MR imaging. Six EEG classifiers previously generated using support vector machine algorithms were applied to the present dataset. MRI index was derived from medial temporal atrophy (MTA) ratings. Logistic regression analysis identified EEG predictors of AD and DLB. A combined EEG-MRI model was then generated to examine whether there was an improvement in classification compared to individual modalities. For EEG, two classifiers predicted AD and DLB (model: chi(2) = 22.1, df = 2, p < 0.001, Nagelkerke R-2 = 0.47, classification = 77% (AD 87%, DLB 62%)). For MRI, MTA also predicted AD and DLB (model: chi(2) = 6.5, df = 1, p = 0.01, Nagelkerke R-2 = 0.16, classification = 67% (77% AD, 52% DLB). However, a combined EEG-MRI model showed greater prediction in AD and DLB (model: chi(2) = 31.1, df = 3, p < 0.001, Nagelkerke R-2 = 0.62, classification = 90% (93% AD, 86% DLB)). While suggestive and requiring validation, diagnostic performance could be improved by combining EEG and MRI, and may represent an alternative to dopaminergic imaging. (C) 2016 The Authors.

However, MI-BCI performance exhibits a wide variability across subjects, and the underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. Several studies have demonstrated that both the fronto-parietal attention network (FPAN) and MI are involved in high-level cognitive processes that are crucial for the control of BCIs. Therefore, we hypothesized that the FPAN may play an important role in MI-BCI performance. In our study, we recorded multi-modal datasets consisting of MI electroencephalography (EEG) signals, T1-weighted structural and resting-state functional MRI data for each subject. MI-BCI performance was evaluated using the common spatial pattern to extract the MI features from EEG signals. One cortical structural feature (cortical thickness (CT)) and two measurements (degree centrality (DC) and eigenvector centrality (EC)) of node centrality were derived from the structural and functional MRI data, respectively. Based on the information extracted from the EEG and MRI, a correlation analysis was used to elucidate the relationships between the FPAN and MI-BCI performance. Our results show that the DC of the right ventral intraparietal sulcus, the EC and CT of the left inferior parietal lobe, and the CT of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were significantly associated with MI-BCI performance. Moreover, the receiver operating characteristic analysis and machine learning classification revealed that the EC and CT of the left IPL could effectively predict the low-aptitude BCI users from the high-aptitude BCI users with 83.3% accuracy. Those findings consistently reveal that the individuals who have efficient FPAN would perform better on MI-BCI. Our findings may deepen the understanding of individual variability in MI-BCI performance, and also may provide a new biomarker to predict individual MI-BCI performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

EEG was decomposed by ensemble empirical mode decomposition into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) based on the intrinsic local characteristic time scale. Analytic amplitude, analytic frequency, and recurrence property quantified by recurrence quantification analysis were explored on IMFs, and the first two scales revealed difference between normal EEG and hypoxia EEG. Classification accuracy of hypoxia EEG and normal EEG could reach 67.8% before decline of neurobehavioral ability, which represented that hypoxia EEG pattern could be detected at an early stage. Classification accuracy of hypoxia EEG and normal EEG increased with time and deepened intensity of hypoxia was observed by regular shift of hypoxia EEG pattern with time in a three dimensional subspace. The reduced shift and classification accuracy after intermittent hypoxic training represented that hypoxia tolerance enhanced. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

To improve the accuracy, this paper introduces a classification system based on Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM). In the system, the combination of PCA and LDA is chosen as the method of feature extraction and the ML-ELM is used to classify. The ML-ELM has not only the advantage which ELM has but also better performance than ELM. In the experiment, our method is compared with the methods based on ELM, such as kernel-ELM, Constrained-ELM and V-ELM, and some state-of-the-art methods on the same dataset. The experimental results show that ML-ELM is much more suitable for motor imagery EEG data and has better performance than the others.

In the current project the very encouraging results are obtained using multimodal biomedical (brainwaves and peripheral physiological) signals in a unified processing approach allowing for the automatic semantic data description. The results thus support a hypothesis of the data-driven and bio-inspired signal processing approach validity for medical data semantic interpretation based on the sleep apnea events machine-learning-related classification.

Method: The participant spent three sessions exploring the system, and seven sessions playing a game focused on EEG feedback training of left and right arm motor imagery and a customised, training game paradigm was employed. Results: The participant showed improvement in the production of two distinct EEG patterns. The participant's performance was influenced by motivation, fatigue and concentration. Six weeks post-training the participant could still control the BCI and used this to type a sentence using an augmentative and alternative communication application on a wirelessly linked device. Conclusions: The results from this case study highlight the importance of creating a dynamic, relevant and engaging training environment for BCIs.	[Taherian, Sarvnaz; Owens, R.

Design of an efficient classifier is considerably important for the realization of a brain-computer interface (BCI) system based on motor imagery. This study introduces a Bayesian extreme learning machine (BELM) based method for accurate classification of motor imagery. By combing ELM and Bayesian inference, BELM achieves the smallest norm of output weights with automatically estimated regularization for alleviating the possible overfilling during calibration procedure. Effectiveness of the BELM-based method is validated on a public BCI dataset, in comparison with other two competing methods.

Here we aim to investigate methods to combine Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) in an asynchronous Sensory Motor rhythm (SMR)-based BCI. We attempted to classify 4 different executed movements, namely, Right-Arm-Left-Arm-Right-Hand-Left-Hand tasks. Previous studies demonstrated the benefit of EEG-fNIRS combination. However, since normally fNIRS hemodynamic response shows a long delay, we investigated new features, involving slope indicators, in order to immediately detect changes in the signals. Moreover, Common Spatial Patterns (CSPs) have been applied to both EEG and fNIRS signals. 15 healthy subjects took part in the experiments and since 25 trials per class were available, CSPs have been regularized with information from the entire population of participants and optimized using genetic algorithms. The different features have been compared in terms of performance and the dynamic accuracy over trials shows that the introduced methods diminish the fNIRS delay in the detection of changes.

Participants received visual feedback through so-called brain computer interface (BCI) used for detection of user-specific spatio-temporal EEG patterns associated with performed mental tasks. During the course study, all of the subjects were able to modulate their sensorimotor EEG by performing motor imagery of shoulder and fingers movements. Patterns during imagery of shoulder movements were found to have more pronounced contralateral localization, than those during hand movements' imagery. That led to significantly better classification accuracies of the most lateralized patterns when discriminating between left and right hand (72 and 58% corresponding to shoulder and hand motor imagery). Value of difference of patterns' lateralization indexes had shown strong correlation with classification accuracy, suggests it could be used as a good reference mark for choosing optimal motor imagery tasks for BCI application.

One of the proposed technologies is the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The BCI system uses electroencephalography (EEG) which is generated by the subject's mental activity as input, and converts it into commands. Some previous experiments have shown the capability of the BCI system to predict the movement intention before the actual movement is onset. Thus research has predicted the movement by discriminating between data in the "rest" condition, where there is no movement intention, with "pre-movement" condition, where movement intention is detected before actual movement occurs. This experiment, however, was done to analyze the system for which machine learning was applied to data obtained in a continuous time interval, between 3 seconds before the movement was detected until 1 second after the actual movement was onset. This experiment shows that the system can discriminate the "pre-movement" condition and "rest" condition by using the EEG signal in 7-30 Hz where the Mu and Beta rhythm can be discovered with an average True Positive Rate (TPR) value of 0.64 +/- 0.11 and an average False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.17 +/- 0.08. This experiment also shows that by using EEG signals obtained nearing the movement onset, the system has higher TPR or a detection rate in predicting the movement intention.

With successful classification of emotions, we could get instant feedback from users, gain better understanding of the human behavior while using the information technologies and thus make the systems and user interfaces more emphatic and intelligent. In our work, we focused on two approaches, namely emotions detection using facial expressions recognition and electroencephalography (EEG). Firstly, we analyzed existing tools that employ facial expressions recognition for emotion detection and compared them in a case study in order to acquire the notion of the state-of-the-art. Secondly, we proposed a method of emotion detection using EEG that employs existing machine learning approaches. We evaluated it on a standard dataset as well as with an experiment, in which participants watched emotion-evoking music videos. We used Emotiv Epoc to capture participants' brain activity. We achieved 53% accuracy in classifying a correct emotion, which is better compared to 19% accuracy of the existing facial expression based tool Noldus FaceReader.

Due to the noise existed in collected affective data, however, the performance of emotion recognition is still not satisfied. In fact, the issue of emotion recognition can be regarded as channel coding, which focuses on reliable communication through noise channels. Using affective data and its label, the redundant codeword would be generated to correct signals noise and recover emotional label information. Therefore, we utilize multi-label output codes method to improve accuracy and robustness of multi-dimensional emotion recognition by training a redundant codeword model, which is the idea of error-correcting output codes. The experiment results on DEAP dataset show that the multi-label output codes method outperforms other traditional machine learning or pattern recognition methods for the prediction of emotional multi-labels.

Geriatric depression symptoms coexisting with cognitive decline:. A comparison of classification methodologies	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Geriatric depression; Cognitive decline; Electroencephalography (EEG); Synchronization patterns; Random Forest; Random Tree; MLP Network; Support Vector Machines (SVM); Data mining; Elderly	EEG; IMPAIRMENT; BRAIN; NETWORKS	Geriatric depression is a pathological process that causes a great number of symptoms resulting in limited mental and physical functionality. The computation of oscillatory and synchronization patterns in certain brain areas may facilitate the early and robust identification of depressive symptoms. In this study electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded from 34 participants suffering from both cognitive impairment and geriatric depression (mean age 69.81) and 32 control subjects (mean age 70.33). Both groups were matched according to their cognitive status. The study aims at evaluating neurophysiological features of elderly participants suffering from depression and neurodegeneration. The current work focuses on the identification of depression symptoms that coexist with cognitive decline, the correlation of the examined neurophysiological features with geriatric depression combined with cognitive impairment and the investigation of the role of data mining techniques in the analysis of EEG data. The EEG features were estimated through synchronization analysis (Orthogonal Discrete Wavelet Transform). Depressive patterns were detected through data mining techniques. Random Forest, Random Tree, Multilayer Perceptron (MPL Network) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were employed for data classification. The efficiency of the classifiers varied from 92.42 to 95.45%. Random Forest demonstrated the highest accuracy (95.5%). Both synchronization and oscillatory features contributed to the decision trees' formation, with the former prevailing. Moreover, synchronization features significantly contributed to the decision trees' formation. In line with previous neuroscientific findings, synchronization among right frontal midline anteriofrontal regions showed great correlation with depressive symptoms. Evaluation of the classifiers indicated the Random Forest as being the most robust algorithm. Synchronization of certain brain regions is more indicative of identifying depression symptoms than oscillatory since synchronization features contributed the most to the formation of the classification trees.

A Naive Bayesian Approach to Lower Limb Classification from EEG Signals	2016 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL, INSTRUMENTATION, ENERGY & COMMUNICATION (CIEC)			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Control, Instrumentation, Energy & Communication (CIEC)	JAN 28-30, 2016	Univ Calcutta, Dept Appl Phys, Kolkata, INDIA	IEEE Kolkata Sect	Univ Calcutta, Dept Appl Phys	Brain-computer interface; Electroencephalography; Wavelet decomposition; Naive Bayesian; Lower limb Classification	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; MOVEMENTS; IMAGERY	Lower limb movement decoding is the primary objective for designing Brain-computer interface (BCI) controlled leg prosthesis. In this paper the main objective is to classify left-right leg movement directly from electroencephalography (EEG) signals by probabilistic Naive Bayesian approach. Wavelet based decomposition has been taken as feature extractor to take care of non-stationary nature of brain waves, that have been recorded from 12 healthy subjects. The proposed method achieved average accuracy of 78.33% with 11ms of execution time. Specificity, sensitivity, type 1 and type 2 error rate have also been determined for each case. Results of the classifier is compared with other standard classifiers and statistically validated by Friedman Test. Novelty of the paper lies in the fact that it considers the both frequency and spatial domain (location in time) features of EEG signal without sacrificing accuracy and very low execution time makes it feasible for real time application. It also shows the Naive Bayes classifier with uniform prior probability is better classifier than standard Naive Bayes classifier in recognizing left-right lower limb movement.

It often records artifacts which are the electrical activities originating from sites other than brain. The presence of artifacts is undesirable as it increases the probability of misinterpretation that may result in adverse clinical consequences. In this paper, we present a novel method of motion artifact removal from the EEG signals. The proposed method employs multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) with canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for the removal of motion artifacts from EEG signal. The mode alignment property of the multivariate empirical mode decomposition is used in EEG signal analysis where a similarity between different channels is the key to decode the signals. When compared with the results of existing methods for motion artifacts removal on the same data set, the MEMD-CCA is shown to perform better with 16 % increase in the percent artifact removal. Unlike the other competing methods, this method is totally algorithmic and does not require any manual intervention.

The data not only has comprehensive information about the application, but also has irrelevant information and noise which makes it difficult to reveal the patterns. This paper presents our preliminary research in selecting the optimal channels for the study of internet addiction with visual "Oddball" paradigm. A two-stage model was employed to select the most relevant channels about the task from the full set of 64 channels. First, channels were ranked according to power spectrum density (PSD) and Fisher ratio separately for each subject. Second, the occurrence rate of each channel among different subjects was computed. Channels whose occurrences was more than twice consisted the optimal combination. The optimal channels and other comparison combinations of channels (including the whole channels) were used to distinguish between the target and non-target stimuli with Fisher linear discriminant analysis method. Classification results showed that the channel selection method greatly reduced the abundant channels and guaranteed the classification accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. It can be concluded from the results that there is attention deficit on internet addicts.

Due to the large size of EEG data in long term clinical monitoring and the complex nature of epileptic seizures, seizure detection is both data-intensive and compute-intensive. Analysing EEG data for detecting seizures in real time has many applications, e.g., in automatic seizure detection or in allowing a timely alarm signal to be presented to the patient. In real time seizure detection, seizures have to be detected with negligible delay, thus requiring lightweight algorithms. MapReduce and its variations have been effectively used for data analysis in large dataset problems on general-purpose machines. In this study, we propose a parallel lightweight algorithm for epileptic seizure detection using Spark Streaming. Our algorithm not only classifies seizures in real time, it also learns an epileptic threshold in real time. We furthermore present "top-k amplitude measure" as a feature for classifying seizures in the EEG, that additionally assists in reducing data size. In a benchmark experiment we show that our algorithm can detect seizures in real time with low latency, while maintaining a good seizure detection rate. In short, our algorithm provides new possibilities in using private cloud infrastructures for real time epileptic seizure detection in EEG data.

Predicting Brain Stimulation Treatment Outcomes of Depressed Patients Through the Classification of EEG Oscillations	2016 38TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 16-20, 2016	Orlando, FL	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			NETWORK	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a mental disorder that is characterized by negative thoughts, mood and behavior. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has recently emerged as a promising brain-stimulation treatment for MDD. A standard tDCS treatment involves numerous sessions that run over a few weeks, however, not all participants respond to this type of treatment. This study aims to predict which patients improve in mood and cognition in response to tDCS treatment by analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) of MDD patients that was collected at the start of tDCS treatment. This is achieved through classifying power spectral density (PSD) of resting-state EEG using support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminate analysis (LDA) and extreme learning machine (ELM). Participants were labelled as improved/not improved based on the change in mood and cognitive scores. The obtained classification results of all channel pair combinations are used to identify the most relevant brain regions and channels for this classification task. We found the frontal channels to be particularly informative for the prediction of the clinical outcome of the tDCS treatment. Subject independent results reveal that our proposed method enables the correct identification of the treatment outcome for seven of the ten participants for mood improvement and nine of ten participants for cognitive improvement. This represents an encouraging sign that EEG-based classification may help to tailor the selection of patients for treatment with tDCS brain stimulation.

Detection of steering direction using EEG recordings based on sample entropy and time-frequency analysis	2016 38TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 16-20, 2016	Orlando, FL	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				Monitoring driver's intentions beforehand is an ambitious aim, which will bring a huge impact on the society by preventing traffic accidents. Hence, in this preliminary study we recorded high resolution electroencephalography (EEG) from 5 subjects while driving a car under real conditions along with an accelerometer which detects the onset of steering. Two sensor-level analyses, sample entropy and time-frequency analysis, have been implemented to observe the dynamics before the onset of steering. Thus, in order to classify the steering direction we applied a machine learning algorithm consisting of: dimensionality reduction and classification using principal-component-analysis (PCA) and support-vector-machine (SVM), respectively. The results showed an increase of the sample entropy and the estimated power values in the theta and alpha frequency bands, 100 ms before the onset of steering. The detection of steering direction depicted that sample entropy gives a higher classification accuracy (73.5% +/- 6.8) as compared to that of using the estimated power for theta and alpha frequency bands (62.6% +/- 5.6).

Leveraging the physical characteristics of a user reduces the burden of setting and remembering complex passwords, while enabling stronger security. Multi-factor systems lend further credence to this model, increasing security via multiple passive data points. In recent years, brainwaves have been shown to be another feasible source for biometric authentication. Physically unique to an individual in certain circumstances, the signals can also be changed by the user at will, making them more robust than static physical characteristics. No paradigm is impervious however, and even well-established medical technologies have deficiencies. In this work, a system for biometric authentication via brainwaves is constructed with electroencephalography (EEG). The efficacy of EEG biometrics via existing consumer electronics is evaluated, and vulnerabilities of such a system are enumerated. Impersonation attacks are performed to expose the extent to which the system is vulnerable. Finally, a multimodal system combining EEG with additional factors is recommended and outlined.

We propose a system which incorporates the emotion prediction system with a custom Smart Human Machine Interface (SHMI) for vehicle drivers to improve drive safety. This is achieved based on EEG signals and basic vehicle information's obtained from an OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) data. EEG signals are classified into four emotional states: happy, sad, relaxed and angry. In this paper, we present an initial development of the Smart Human Machine Interface (SHMI) for emotion detection for vehicle applications.

The online instructor cannot monitor whether the students remain focus during online autonomous learning. Along with the attention, emotions are also intrinsically related to the way that individuals interact with each other as well as machines. The behavior and emotions can be better understood by a human being to improve the communication but a machine cannot. This gives rise to lack of interest and knowledge gain. To overcome this limitation of the traditional E-learning system EEG sensors are been introduced. Using, EEG we can detect the emotion of the user, by actually looking inside the users brain to check user's mental state and signal waves are generated accordingly as the output which can be used to improve users learning experience.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) Based Authentication Leveraging Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP) Resulting From Exposure To Emotionally Significant Images	2016 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON TECHNOLOGIES FOR HOMELAND SECURITY (HST)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)	MAY 10-11, 2016	Waltham, MA	IEEE		Biometrics; EEG; BMI; Machine Learning; Visual Evoked Potential		Encephalogram (EEG) devices are one of the active research areas in human-computer interaction (HCI). They provide a unique brain-machine interface (BMI) for interacting with a growing number of applications. EEG devices interface with computational systems requiring access control. These controls rely on a number of authenticators, including "what you know", "what you have", and "what you are". The "what you are" authenticator, formally known as a biometrics authenticator, is increasingly gaining acceptance. An emerging approach in physiological biometrics is cognitive biometrics, which measures brain's response to stimuli. These stimuli can be measured by a number of devices, including EEG systems. This work shows an approach to authenticate users interacting with their computational devices through the use of EEG devices. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using a unique hard-to-forge trait as an absolute biometrics authenticator by exploiting the signals generated by different areas of the brain when exposed to visual stimuli. The outcome of this research highlights the importance of the prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes to capture unique responses to images that trigger emotional responses. Additionally, the utilization of logarithmic band power processing combined with LDA as the machine learning algorithm provides higher accuracy when compared against common spatial patterns or windowed means processing in combination with GMM and SVM machine learning algorithms.

The EEG signals produce a huge amount of redundant data or repeating information. This redundancy causes potential hurdles in EEG analysis. Hence, we propose to use this redundant information of EEG as a feature to discriminate and classify different EEG datasets. In this study, we have proposed a JPEG2000 based approach for computing data redundancy from multi-channels EEG signals and have used the redundancy as a feature for classification of EEG signals by applying support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron and k-nearest neighbors classifiers. The approach is validated on three EEG datasets and achieved high accuracy rate (95-99 %) in the classification. Dataset-1 includes the EEG signals recorded during fluid intelligence test, dataset-2 consists of EEG signals recorded during memory recall test, and dataset-3 has epileptic seizure and non-seizure EEG. The findings demonstrate that the approach has the ability to extract robust feature and classify the EEG signals in various applications including clinical as well as normal EEG patterns.

A Novel Approach for Ensuring the Privacy of EEG Signals using Application-specific Feature Extraction and AES Algorithm	2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INVENTIVE COMPUTATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICICT), VOL 2			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT)	AUG 26-27, 2016	Coimbatore, INDIA	IEEE, Electron Devices Soc, RVS Tech Campus, Invent Res Org		Waves; Electroencephalography (EEG); Privacy; Feature Extraction; Encryption		Human brain known commonly as an individual's computer is one of the complex organs in the body. The brain serves to control and coordinate the mental and physical actions. It has the capacity to store innumerable data. This data includes not only childhood memories but also those related to the present age. Tracking the electrical potentials or impulses, commonly known as brain waves, can be utilized for various purposes ranging from diagnosing diseases to decoding personality traits. This can be done using the technique of Electroencephalography (EEG). The amount of data available is exploding so also the opportunities of data mining thereby mounting privacy risks. The current practice either prevents the reuse of raw EEG signals or disrespects participants' right to privacy by using this data for purposes other than those consented to, by the individual. The aim of this work is to put a stop to such privacy risks by extracting and transferring only those features related to an application. Feature is a specific characteristic measurement of a pattern segment. EEG signal processing pertains mainly to feature extraction. There are different methods for extracting features from EEG signals. In this work, the features related to neurological diseases, namely epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease, are extracted using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and those related to Schizophrenia are extracted using Autoregressive (AR) method. For securing the raw data, it is doubly encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm and is kept under the control of each user. The proposed system thus ensures the privacy of an individual's EEG signals, and mitigates any risk that may arise if raw data is made available as such to the public.

In this paper, a feature extraction method of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals based on Extreme Learning Machine auto-encoder (ELM-AE) is applied. Firstly, the original data is classified by Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and the number of hidden layer's neuron with the highest accuracy is selected as the dimension of feature extraction. Then, ELM-AE's output weight learns to represent the features of the original data. Finally, the features are classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

An experimental evaluation was performed in a set of 200 EEG segments, in which the piecewise aggregate approximation (PAA) method was applied for 25 %, 50 %, and 75% settings of the original EEG segment length, generating three databases. Afterwards, cross-correlation (CC) method was applied in these databases in order to extract features. Subsequently, classifiers were built using J48, 1NN, and BP-MLP algorithms. These classifiers were evaluated by confusion matrix method. The evaluation found that the reduction of EEG segment length can increase or maintain performance of ML methods, compared to classifiers built from EEG segments with original length in order to differentiate normal signals from seizures.

Several recent studies have reported that target speaker identification is possible through electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. If the EEG system could be reduced to acceptable size while retaining the signal quality, hearing aids could benefit from the integration with concealed EEG. To compare the performance of a multichannel around-the-ear EEG system with high-density cap EEG recordings an envelope tracking algorithm was applied in a competitive speaker paradigm. The data from 20 normal hearing listeners were concurrently collected from the traditional state-of-the-art laboratory wired EEG system and a wireless mobile EEG system with two bilaterally-placed around-the-ear electrode arrays (cEEGrids). The results show that the cEEGrid ear-EEG technology captured neural signals that allowed the identification of the attended speaker above chance-level, with 69.3% accuracy, while cap EEG signals resulted in the accuracy of 84.8%. Further analyses investigated the influence of ear-EEG signal quality and revealed that the envelope tracking procedure was unaffected by variability in channel impedances. We conclude that the quality of concealed ear-EEG recordings as acquired with the cEEGrid array has potential to be used in the brain computer interface steering of hearing aids.

SRC methods have been used to analyze the EEG signals of epilepsy, cognitive impairment and brain computer interface (BCI), which made rapid progress including the improvement in computational accuracy, efficiency and robustness. However, these methods have deficiencies in real-time performance, generalization ability and the dependence of labeled sample in the analysis of the EEG signals. This mini review described the advantages and disadvantages of the SRC methods in the EEG signal analysis with the expectation that these methods can provide the better tools for analyzing EEG signals.

J	Uscumlic, M; Blankertz, B				Uscumlic, Marija; Blankertz, Benjamin			Active visual search in non-stationary scenes: coping with temporal variability and uncertainty	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; fixation related potentials; active visual search; eye tracking; temporal uncertainty	FIXATION-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; P300; CLASSIFICATION; TARGET; ACCUMULATION; OBJECT; EEG	Objective. State-of-the-art experiments for studying neural processes underlying visual cognition often constrain sensory inputs (e.g., static images) and our behavior (e.g., fixed eye-gaze, long eye fixations), isolating or simplifying the interaction of neural processes. Motivated by the non-stationarity of our natural visual environment, we investigated the electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of visual recognition while participants overtly performed visual search in non-stationary scenes. We hypothesized that visual effects (such as those typically used in human-computer interfaces) may increase temporal uncertainty (with reference to fixation onset) of cognition-related EEG activity in an active search task and therefore require novel techniques for single-trial detection. Approach. We addressed fixation-related EEG activity in an active search task with respect to stimulus-appearance styles and dynamics. Alongside popping-up stimuli, our experimental study embraces two composite appearance styles based on fading-in, enlarging, and motion effects. Additionally, we explored whether the knowledge obtained in the pop-up experimental setting can be exploited to boost the EEG-based intention-decoding performance when facing transitional changes of visual content. Main results. The results confirmed our initial hypothesis that the dynamic of visual content can increase temporal uncertainty of the cognition-related EEG activity in active search with respect to fixation onset. This temporal uncertainty challenges the pivotal aim to keep the decoding performance constant irrespective of visual effects. Importantly, the proposed approach for EEG decoding based on knowledge transfer between the different experimental settings gave a promising performance. Significance. Our study demonstrates that the non-stationarity of visual scenes is an important factor in the evolution of cognitive processes, as well as in the dynamic of ocular behavior (i.e., dwell time and fixation duration) in an active search task. In addition, our method to improve single-trial detection performance in this adverse scenario is an important step in making brain-computer interfacing technology available for human-computer interaction applications.

In this study, we used both sensor-level and source-level features extracted from EEG signals recorded during an auditory oddball task for the classification of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. EEG signals were recorded from 34 patients with schizophrenia and 34 healthy controls while each subject was asked to attend to oddball tones. Our results demonstrated higher classification accuracy when source-level features were used together with sensor-level features, compared to when only sensor-level features were used. In addition, the selected sensor-level features were mostly found in the frontal area, and the selected source-level features were mostly extracted from the temporal area, which coincide well with the well-known pathological region of cognitive processing in patients with schizophrenia. Our results suggest that our approach would be a promising tool for the computer-aided diagnosis of schizophrenia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Machine Learning Classifiers using Stochastic Logic	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 34TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER DESIGN (ICCD)	Proceedings IEEE International Conference on Computer Design		English	Proceedings Paper	34th IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)	OCT 02-05, 2016	Scottsdale, AZ	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Circuits & Syst Soc		Stochastic logic; Machine learning; Artificial Neural Network; Support Vector Machine; Seizure diagnosis; EEG signals; Synthesis		This paper presents novel architectures for machine learning based classifiers using stochastic logic. Two types of classifier architectures are presented. These include: linear support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). Stochastic computing systems require fewer logic gates and are inherently fault-tolerant. Thus, these structures are well suited for nanoscale CMOS technologies. These architectures are validated using seizure prediction from electroencephalogram (EEG) as an application example. To improve the accuracy of proposed stochastic classifiers, a novel approach based on linear transformation of input data is proposed for EEG signal classification using linear SVM classifiers. Simulation results in terms of the classification accuracy are presented for the proposed stochastic computing and the traditional binary implementations based datasets from one patient. Compared to conventional binary implementation, the accuracy of the proposed stochastic ANN is improved by 5.89%. Synthesis results are also presented for EEG signal classification. Compared to the traditional binary linear SVM, the hardware complexity, power consumption and critical path of the stochastic implementation are reduced by 78%, 74% and 53%, respectively. The hardware complexity, power consumption and critical path of the stochastic ANN classifier are reduced by 92%, 88% and 47%, respectively, compared to the conventional binary implementation.

Commonly the learning process is distributed between the user (reliable EEG pattern generation) and the machine (robust EEG pattern detection). Standard training approaches, however, typically do not allow users to gain meaningful levels of control. A better understanding of brain functioning or the use of sophisticated machine learning are ways to enhance control. Rethinking training paradigms is another option. In this paper, we enhance our game-based training approach by adding competitive elements. Winning is a powerful motivator that increases user engagement of the typically boring BCI training experience. We report on a user with cerebral palsy who successfully gained BCI control and played the classical Tic-Tac-Toe game against his caregiver.

To address this, we propose a novel approach of emotion recognition from EEG signals enhanced by users' profile, which is only required during training. Specifically, we propose to use discriminative Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DRBM) to capture the inherent relationships among users' profile, EEG signals and emotion labels. During training, the proposed RBM classifier learns the mapping function from EEG signals and users' profile to emotion labels through discriminative learning algorithm. During testing, users' emotion can be recognized from EEG signals through marginalizing over users' profile, since RBM is a generative model. Experimental results on three benchmark databases, i.e. the DEAP database, the MAHNOB-HCI database and the USTC-ERVS database, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in leveraging users' profile for enhancing emotion recognition from EEG signals and the superior emotion recognition performance of the proposed approach over existing approaches.

However, if achieved, more advanced non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCls) for the physically impaired could be realized. The most common motion trajectory prediction (MTP) BCI employs a time-series of band-pass filtered EEG potentials for reconstructing the 3D trajectory of limb movement using multiple linear regression (mLR). Most MTP BCI studies report the best accuracy using low delta (0.5-2Hz) band-pass filtered EEG potentials. In a recent study, we showed spatiotemporal power distribution of theta (4-8Hz), mu (8-12Hz), and beta (12-28Hz) EEG frequency bands contain richer information associated with movement trajectory. This finding is in line with the results in the extensive literature on traditional sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) based multiclass (MC) BCI studies, which report the best accuracy of limb movement classification using power values of mu and beta frequency bands. Here, we show the reconstruction of actual and imagined 3D limb movement trajectory with an MTP BCI using a time-series of bandpower values (BTS model). Furthermore, we show the proposed BTS model outperforms the standard potential time-series model (PTS model). The BTS model yielded best results in the mu and beta bands (R similar to 0.5 for actual and R similar to 0.2 for imagined movement reconstruction) and not in the low delta band, as previously reported for MTP studies using the PTS model. Our results show for the first time how mu and beta activity can be used for decoding imagined 3D hand movement from EEG.

Here, we introduce a different multi-category EEG signal processing technique, namely time-frequency (T-F) image representation of Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) descriptors and Fisher Vector (FV) encoding for automatic classification of EEG signals. Firstly the EEG signals are converted into T-F representation by using spectrograms of Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), which are used to obtain the T-F images. The obtained T-F images are then converted into 8-bits gray-scale images and then are divided into five sub-images corresponding to the frequency-bands of the rhythms. Then, the GLCM texture descriptors are employed to extract distinctive features which are fed into the FV encoding. Finally obtained features are fed to extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier as input for identifying abnormalities from EEG signals. The proposed method was applied to epileptic and sleep stages EEG datasets. The experimental outcomes are promising on both databases. It can be anticipated that upon its implementation in real-time practice, the proposed scheme will assist the researchers and physicians to advance the existing methods for detecting neurological diseases from EEG signals.

Optimized Bi-Objective EEG Channel Selection and Cross-Subject Generalization With Brain-Computer Interfaces	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Channel selection; dimension reduction; electroencephalography (EEG); motor imagery (MI); multi-objective optimization; subject variability	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MOTOR IMAGERY; DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; COMPONENTS; SIGNALS	Electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing to decode motor imagery (MI) involves high-dimensional features, which increases the computational complexity. To reduce this computational burden due to the large number of channels, an iterative multiobjective optimization for channel selection (IMOCS) is proposed in this paper. For a given MI classification task, the proposed method initializes a reference candidate solution and subsequently finds a set of the most relevant channels in an iterative manner by exploiting both the anatomical and functional relevance of EEG channels. The proposed approach is evaluated on the Wadsworth dataset for the right fist versus left fist MI tasks, while considering the cross-validation accuracy as the performance evaluation criteria. Furthermore, 12 other dimension reduction and channel selection algorithms are used for benchmarking. The proposed approach (IMOCS) achieved an average classification accuracy of about 80% when evaluated using 35 best-performing subjects. One-way analysis of variance revealed the statistical significance of the proposed approach with at least 7% improvement over other benchmarking algorithms. Furthermore, a cross-subject generalization of channel selection on untrained subjects shows that the subject-independent channels perform as good as using all channels achieving an average classification accuracy of 61%. These results are promising for the online brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm that requires low computational complexity and also for reducing the preparation time while conducting multiple session BCI experiments for a larger pool of subjects.

Human emotion might come from brain activities. However, the relationship between human emotion and brain activities is far from clear. In recent years, more and more researchers are trying to discover this relationship by recording brain signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with the associated emotion information extracted from other modalities such as facial expression. In this paper, machine learning based methods are used to model this relationship in the publicly available dataset DEAP (Database for Emotional Analysis using Physiological Signals). Different features are extracted from raw EEG recordings. Then Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (mRMR) was used for feature selection. These features are fed into machine learning methods to build the prediction models to extract the emotion information from EEG signals. The models are evaluated on this dataset and satisfactory results are achieved.

Its diagnosis is usually performed using electroencephalography technique. Since, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are highly susceptible to artifacts, epilepsy diagnosis is often challenging task. In addition, locating the origin of seizure patterns is even more tedious due to the non-linear nature of EEG signals. Therefore, automated seizure detection systems are highly important to overcome the said challenges. In this study, we have designed a procedure which integrates the seizure detection and localization process with ceiling level of efficiency. Here, we evaluated the energy and standard features using 'coiflets' wavelet packets. Then, the feature matrix was reduced by applying fast correlation based filter. Application of 5-Nearest Neighbour classifier resulted in mean accuracy of 99.3515 +/- 0.2518 % taking only 0.152 +/- 0.0344 seconds for execution. Later, independent component analysis over the ictal segments was applied and subsequently topographic scalps maps were plotted. The results successfully implied automated detection and visualization of ictal activities over the human scalp.

While the noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-MEMD) algorithm has been utilized to extract task-specific frequency bands from all channels in the same scale as the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), identifying and extracting the specific IMFs that contain significant information remain difficult. In this paper, a novel method has been developed to identify the information-bearing components in a low-dimensional subspace without prior knowledge. Our method trains a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) of the composite data, which is comprised of the IMFs from both the original signal and noise, by employing kernel spectral regression to reduce the dimension of the composite data. The informative IMFs are then discriminated using a GMM clustering algorithm, the common spatial pattern (CSP) approach is exploited to extract the task-related features from the reconstructed signals, and a support vector machine (SVM) is applied to the extracted features to recognize the classes of EEG signals during different motor imagery tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified by both computer simulations and motor imagery EEG datasets.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide appropriate information for identification of vigilance lapses; however, almost all of the previous EEG based vigilance monitoring studies require high density EEG montages, with the added inconvenience of conductive gels and the requirement for accurate placement of electrodes. In this paper we propose a practical machine learning approach for identification of vigilance lapses using EEG signals recorded from a very sparse electrode configuration with only 4 electrodes: 2 electrodes at the forehead and 2 electrodes behind the ears. This is a challenging problem since these four electrodes are easily contaminated by eye blinks and muscle artifacts. The performance of the proposed machine-learning based algorithm is demonstrated in a real world scenario where vigilance lapses are identified with about 95% accuracy.

It has been suggested as a viable mean to control robots, improve learning experience and even to classify thought patterns. This paper investigates the possibility of using the NeuroSky Mindwave headset, a very cheap and popular single electrode BCI, for such endeavors by means of unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Firstly, the raw Electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 10 different subjects were acquired while they performed various mental activities. The mental activities ranged from listening to relaxing music to doing mathematical calculations. Secondly, the EEG signals were filtered to obtain the Gamma, Beta, Alpha, Theta and Delta brainwaves. Finally, k-means, fuzzy c-means and Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) clustering algorithms have been applied to group the brainwaves according to their similarities. The performance of the cluster algorithms was benchmarked using distance metric maps, cluster silhouettes, Calinski-Harabasz index and Davies-Bouldin index. K-means clustering algorithm has showed some power of separating different mental activities into groups. The minimum Mean Silhouette Value has been found to be 0.475 when the number of clusters is 3 and the highest CH-index registered has been 65.7. These results show an interesting possibility for using the MindWave headset in applications where the number of mental activities to be harvested may not be greater than 2 or 3 at most.

The extracted EEG functional connectivity in different frequency bands were quantified and analyzed to identify characterizing patterns between each type of ED. Results revealed that the number of connections from different epileptogenic biomarkers and calculated for each frequency band were statistically different.

Mental arithmetic, left hand clench imagery, and left and right eye-movements are used to navigate the quadcopter. Mental arithmetic task (decoded by fNIRS from the prefrontal cortex) is used to move the quadcopter in forward direction. The left hand clench imagery (decoded by EEG) is used to increase/decrease the height of flight. Signals generated using eye movement in the left/right direction is used for the rotation of the quadcopter. The flight is monitored by the user using the feedback from the frontal camera. The system is unaware of the obstacles in the environment. A fail-safe switch is incorporated in the program using steady-state evoked visual potentials (SSVEP) activity generated at 6 Hz. The fail-safe mechanism stops the forward movement of the quadcopter and the user can adjust the direction of the quadcopter to avoid any collisions with obstacles. The fail-safe trigger can be disabled by focusing on the 6 Hz signal trigger to resume the movement. The experiments conducted on 3 subjects show the possibility of controlling the quadcopter with active commands with increased safety features. The results show the feasibility of increasing commands using hybrid EEG-NIRS for brain-computer interface with applications to quadcopter control.	[Khan, M.

In this paper, an EEG signal classification method based on sparse auto-encoders (SAE) and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed to greatly reduce the sample rate and enhance the efficiency of the vision detection. In practical application, sparse auto-encoder can get all the significant information at lower sample rate than sampled by Nyquist sampling principle. Due to this, it is widely used to extract higher layer features automatically. With the latter, it is used to obtain the high-dimensional pattern information of EEG signals, and map the input mode space into corresponding sparse space. This approach is precise enough to each sampling point rather than the conventional time window in the current researches and also has a better classification speed in comparison to other conventional methods. In order to ensure good classification rates (100%) for the EEG database, SVM is used to construct the generalized optimal classification hyper plane. Experimental result demonstrate that the classification rates in this work outperform the current state-of-the-art EEG seizure detection methods.

Emotions play an important role in corporate activities like organizing, planning, motivating etc. The negative emotions may lead to chronic emotional disorders like depression, anxiety, stress.Therefore, there is a need to analyse and classify these emotional changes through brain signals. The proposed paper aims to classify the types of emotions by observing EEG signals. There is always a problem of correlated data with EEG signals. This correlation results in redundancy of the data and increases computational time. This paper proposes the use of common spatial pattern to address the problem of correlated data and high dimensionality. The classification is carried out using support vector machine and the performance of the classifier is being measured in terms of accuracy of classification and standard deviation.

Regarding the used communication paradigm, a very large number of strategies exist and, recently, self-induced emotions have been introduced. However, in general the actual emotion-based BCIs are just binary, since they are capable of recognizing just a single emotion. A crucial node is the introduction of more than a single emotional state for improving the efficiency of a BCI. In order to be used in BCIs, signals from different emotional states have to be collected, recognized and classified. In the present paper, a method for mapping several emotional states was described and tested on EEG signals collected from a publicly available dataset for emotion analysis using physiological signals (DEAP). The proposed method, its experimental protocol, and preliminary numerical results on three different emotional states were presented and discussed. The method, based on multiple binary classification, was capable of optimizing the most discriminative channels and the features combination for each emotional state and of recognizing between several emotional states through a polling system.

Previous studies have indicated that musical training was related to better working memory and that these behavioral differences were associated with differences in neural activity in the brain. However, it was not clear whether musical training impacts memory in general, beyond working memory. By recruiting professional musicians with extensive training, we investigated if musical training has a broad impact on memory with corresponding electroencephalography (EEG) signal changes, by using working memory and long-term memory tasks with verbal and pictorial items. Behaviorally, musicians outperformed on both working memory and long-term memory tasks. A comprehensive EEG pattern study has been performed, including various univariate and multivariate features, time-frequency (wavelet) analysis, power-spectra analysis, and deterministic chaotic theory. The advanced feature selection approaches have also been employed to select the most discriminative EEG and brain activation features between musicians and non-musicians. High classification accuracy (more than 95%) in memory judgments was achieved using Proximal Support Vector Machine (PSVM). For working memory, it showed significant differences between musicians versus non-musicians during the delay period. For long-term memory, significant differences on EEG patterns between groups were found both in the pre-stimulus period and the post-stimulus period on recognition. These results indicate that musicians memorial advantage occurs in both working memory and long-term memory and that the developed computational framework using advanced data mining techniques can be successfully applied to classify complex human cognition with high time resolution.

Motor imagery is an important research area in brain computer interfacing. EEG signals related with motor imagery have characteristic frequencies originating from sensorimotor cortex. Common spatial patterns (CSP) method is a very popular and successful spatial filtering algorithm in motor imagery classification. However, CSP only optimizes spatial filters, subject specific frequency selection should be done manually, which is a meticulous process. Therefore, an automatic method for spectral filter optimization is needed. Proposed filter bank common spatio-spectral patterns (FBCSSP) algorithm optimizes spatial and spectral filters. FBCSSP method uses a network of a filter bank and two consecutive CSP layers so that proposed structure has a subject specific response in both spatial and spectral domains. We inspected the proposed method in terms of classification accuracy and physiological consistence of the created filters using publicly available data set. FBCSSP method gave higher classification accuracy than other spatio-spectral pattern methods in the literature. Also, obtained spatial and spectral filters were consistent with the spatial and spectral properties of motor imagery signals.

We introduce the space-by-time M/EEG decomposition, based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), which describes single-trial M/EEG signals using a set of non-negative spatial and temporal components that are linearly combined with signed scalar activation coefficients. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on an EEG dataset recorded during the performance of a visual categorization task. Our method extracts three temporal and two spatial functional components achieving a compact yet full representation of the underlying structure, which validates and summarizes succinctly results from previous studies. Furthermore, we introduce a decoding analysis that allows determining the distinct functional role of each component and relating them to experimental conditions and task parameters. In particular, we demonstrate that the presented stimulus and the task difficulty of each trial can be reliably decoded using specific combinations of components from the identified space-by-time representation. When comparing with a sliding-window linear discriminant algorithm, we show that our approach yields more robust decoding performance across participants. Overall, our findings suggest that the proposed space-by-time decomposition is a meaningful low-dimensional representation that carries the relevant information of single-trial M/EEG signals.

We aimed to investigate the clinical, electrophysiologic differences, and prognosis between HS patients with unusual epileptic foci in comparison with patients with typical foci. Materials and Methods: Patients diagnosed who were diagnosed as having mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with HS in our center were included. All magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results were investigated for the presence of two major criteria of HS diagnosis, namely T1 atrophy and T2 hyperintensity. All EEG and video-EEG investigations (a total of 496) were re-evaluated for unusual epileptic activities except T1/2, F7/8, T3/4 foci. Clinical and other laboratory data were retrospectively reevaluated by two investigators and the groups with usual and unusual epileptic activities for this syndrome were statistically compared. Results: A total of 124 patients including 20 (16.1%) with unusual epileptic activities (group 1) and 104 patients with typical foci (group 2) were evaluated. We observed 11 posterior temporal (T5/T6), four frontal (F3/F4), four frontopolar (Fp1/2), two occipital (O1/O2), three central (CP/FC) unusual foci, and two generalized epileptiform discharges in these 20 patients. Impaired background activity, nonspecific interictal diffuse slowing, and atypical seizure offset patterns were more frequently observed in group 1. Forty-nine patients underwent surgery after appropriate preoperative diagnostics; there was no significant difference in the postoperative outcome between the groups despite a tendency to better prognosis in group 2. Conclusion: Our study showed that unusual epileptic foci could be seen in 16.1% of patients with HS. Although some patients with HS have these atypical interictal EEG findings, they might obtain good post-operative outcomes when preoperative diagnostics are appropriately planned.

The brain activity is observed via Event Related Potentials (ERPs). ERPs are transient components in the Electroencephalography (EEG) generated in response to a stimulus. ERPs were collected while subjects were viewing images with positive or negative emotional content. Building inter-subject discrimination models is a challenging problem due to the high ERPs variability between individuals. We propose to solve this problem with the aid of the Echo State Networks (ESN) as a general framework for extracting the most relevant discriminative features between multiple subjects. The original feature vector is mapped into the reservoir feature space defined by the number of the reservoir equilibrium states. The dominant features are extracted iteratively from low dimensional combinations of reservoir states. The relevance of the new feature space was validated by experiments with standard supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. From one side this proof of concept application enhances the usability context of the reservoir computing for high dimensional static data representations by low-dimensional feature transformation as functions of the reservoir states. From other side, the proposed solution for emotion valence detection across subjects is suitable for brain studies as a complement to statistical methods. This problem is important because such decision making systems constitute "virtual sensors'' of hidden emotional states, which are useful in psychology science research and clinical applications.

To investigate the propagation of neuronal activity in certain frequency can help us reveal the mechanisms of information processing by brain. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the detection of effective connectivity and analyzes the complex brain network connection mode associated with motor imagery (MI) tasks. METHODS: The effective connectivity among the primary motor area is firstly explored using partial directed coherence (PDC) combined with multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) based on electroencephalography (EEG) data. Then a new approach is proposed to analyze the connection mode of the complex brain network via the information flow pattern. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that significant effective connectivity exists in the bilateral hemisphere during the tasks, regardless of the left-/right-hand MI tasks. Furthermore, the out-in rate results of the information flow reveal the existence of the contralateral lateralization. The classification performance of left-/right-hand MI tasks can be improved by careful selection of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). CONCLUSION: The proposed method can provide efficient features for the detection of MI tasks and has great potential to be applied in brain computer interface (BCI).

However, errors existing in BCI systems affect their performance greatly, which in turn confines the development and application of BCI technology. It has been demonstrated viable to extract error potential from electroencephalography recordings. Methods: This study proposed a new approach of fusing multiple-channel features from temporal, spectral, and spatial domains through two times of dimensionality reduction based on neural network. 26 participants (13 males, mean age = 28.8 +/- 5.4, range 20-37) took part in the study, who engaged in a P300 speller task spelling cued words from a 36-character matrix. In order to evaluate the generalization ability across subjects, the data from 16 participants were used for training and the rest for testing. Results: The total classification accuracy with combination of features is 76.7 %. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under ROC curve (AUC) further indicate the superior performance of the combination of features over any single features in error detection. The average AUC reaches 0.7818 with combined features, while 0.7270, 0.6376, 0.7330 with single temporal, spectral, and spatial features respectively. Conclusions: The proposed method combining multiple-channel features from temporal, spectral, and spatial domain has better classification performance than any individual feature alone. It has good generalization ability across subject and provides a way of improving error detection, which could serve as promising feedbacks to promote the performance of BCI systems.

New spectral thresholds improve the utility of the electroencephalogram for the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Diagnostic thresholds; EEG; Hepatic encephalopathy; Psychometry; Spectral analysis; Support vector machine learning	SPATIOTEMPORAL DECOMPOSITION; LIVER-TRANSPLANTATION; WORKING PARTY; EEG-ANALYSIS; CIRRHOSIS; SURVIVAL; ASSOCIATION; DERIVATION; DISEASE; IMPACT	Objective: The utility of the electroencephalogram (EEG) for the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy, using conventional spectral thresholds, is open to question. The aim of this study was to optimise its diagnostic performance by defining new spectral thresholds. Methods: EEGs were recorded in 69 healthy controls and 113 patients with cirrhosis whose neuropsychiatric status was classified using clinical and psychometric criteria. New EEG spectral thresholds were calculated, on the parietal P3-P4 lead derivation, using an extended multivariable receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Thresholds were validated in a separate cohort of 68 healthy controls and 113 patients with cirrhosis. The diagnostic performance of the newly derived spectral thresholds was further validated using a machine learning technique. Results: The diagnostic performance of the new thresholds (sensitivity 75.0%; specificity 77.4%) was better balanced than that of the conventional thresholds (58.3%; 93.2%) and comparable to the performance of a machine learning technique (72.9%; 76.8%). The diagnostic utility of the new thresholds was confirmed in the validation cohort. Conclusions: Adoption of the new spectral thresholds would significantly improve the utility of the EEG for the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. Significance: These new spectral EEG thresholds optimise the performance of the EEG for the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy and can be adopted without the need to alter data recording or the initial processing of traces.

Many theoretical and experimental researches have been conducted to recognize the emotions from verbal or nonverbal behaviors. It is well known that the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals contain rich information about the activities of the brain and they can reliably enable us to estimate the emotions if they are properly interpreted. In this paper, we propose a model to discriminate the emotional state of a person by analyzing his brain signals recorded during listening to the Quran and using a machine learning approach. It is assumed that listening to the Quran brings reverence, and hence two types of emotions emerge which are distinguished as happy and unhappy. In our analysis, we used the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of different bands as features and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a classifier. Experiments were conducted by 14 participants and they gave a classification accuracy rate 85.86%.

EEG signal (signal captured by Electroencephalograph) is utilized to show if a person is interested. This can be useful, such as for marketers to discover consumer's brain response towards product and identify whether the product is interesting. Learning algorithm classifies subject's brain response into one of two classes: "interested" or "not interested". Research on EEG signal regarding a person's interest is rare even no one explicitly discuss about it. It is vice versa for person's emotion or attention. That is why the observation of person's interest is done by adapting the handling on EEG signal that is usually used to identify emotion and attention. The handling includes EEG channels selection, learning algorithms selection, and frequency-based waves selection. This experiment, based on the handling, retrieves EEG signal from 12 EEG channels to get theta, alpha, and low beta wave. It involves the participants of 12 males and 20 females, 1922 years old. There are several algorithms that are fit and common to train EEG signal: SVM, ANN, KNN, and Naive Bayes. To get the best algorithm, this experiment compares the performance measure of these algorithms, the configuration of parameter, and the characteristics. The result shows that SVM and ANN can be chosen as the best algorithms. SVM yielded accuracy of 83.65% and F-measure average of 83.70% by using kernel function of radial basis function. Meanwhile, ANN yielded accuracy of 83.36% and F-measure average of 83.30% by using 1 hidden layer, 50 hidden neurons, learning rate of 0.1, and momentum of 0.2. In addition to have optimum performance and slight difference, both algorithms also have several excellences.

We conducted our experiments on a treadmill at Okm/h, 1.6km/h and 3km/h speed separately. The EEG data is accompanied by a large number of motion artifacts. First of all, in order to recover independent components from raw EEG signals under the premise of removing the motion artifacts in an effective way, the research idea of multiple gait feature extraction was proposed by combining the independent component extraction method and One-Versus-Rest Common spatial pattern analysis. Next, SWNN was constructed by merging complex network mechanism into traditional multi-layer feed-forward back propagation neural network. Based on comparing results of classification efficiency, it was clearly to conclude that the proposed method is feasible in dealing with the three motion states classification of running, walking and standing.

Unique Gaussian IDS-VGS characteristic of emerging gate/source-overlapped heterojunction Tunnel FET (SO-HTFET) is utilized to simplify the complexity of a SOM. For a given pattern, SO-HTFET- based SOM performs associative processing between the applied pattern feature and the stored neuron states. SO-HTFET reduces the SOM computing cell to just a single transistor. This is remarkable considering that a conventional digital SOM cell will require more than 100 transistors. IDS-VGS variance of SO-HTFET is modulated by varying its drain-to-source voltage (V-DS). This enables dynamic adaptation of distance measures in SO-HTFETbased SOM. Various SOM-modules are combined in a LAMSTAR network with link weights to facilitate deep learning and integration of various features of the applied pattern in a decision making process. Electroencephalogram (EEG) classification is studied using SO-HTFET-based LAMSTAR. SO-HTFET enables a higher number of hidden neurons in LAMSTAR by reducing the complexity of SOM and thereby, improves classification accuracy than a conventional design. EEG classification accuracy is specifically evaluated for fixed neuron and dynamic neuron approaches. The optimal variance of SO-HTFET IDS-VGS is extracted for these approaches.

J	Samek, W				Samek, Wojciech			On robust spatial filtering of EEG in nonstationary environments	IT-INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Brain-computer interfacing; robust signal processing; generalized eigenvalue problems; robust estimation; classification; nonstationarity		Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI) is a promising technology for patients that are severely motor-disabled, because it enables them to communicate and interact with the environment. A BCI system decodes user's intentions from brain signals, typically recorded with electroen-cephalography (EEG), and transmits them to a computer application that, e.g., controls a wheelchair. The efficiency of the system largely depends upon a reliable extraction of informative features from the high-dimensional EEG signal. Spatial filtering is a crucial step in this protocol, however, current approaches are prone to errors when data is contaminated by artifacts or is nonstationary. This article provides an overview of a dissertation, which has addressed the problem of robust spatial filtering in BCI. The contributions of the thesis range from the development of regularization schemes and a robust parameter estimator for spatial filtering, to the formulation of an information geometric view on the spatial filtering problem and the proposal of a new family of algorithms based on robust divergences. The developed methods and concepts are applicable to a variety of problems in machine learning and signal processing.

The epilepsy is characterized by recurrent and sudden seizures. Recently, researchers found that approximately 50% of epileptic patients feel auras (subjective phenomenon which precedes and indicates an epileptic seizure onset) associated to a physiological anomaly. In this research, a non-invasive seizure prediction methodology is developed in order to improve the quality of life of the patients with epilepsy, alerting them about potential seizure and avoiding falls, injuries, wounds or even death. The research addresses the recognition of patterns in electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrocardiographic (ECG) signals taken from 7 patients with focal epilepsy whom are treated at the Instituto de Epilepsia y Parkinson del Eje Cafetero-NEUROCENTRO-. The bio-signals were independently analyzed, at least 15 minutes before the seizure onset and in periods with no seizure were considered. The methodology considers the generation of features computed over the discrete wavelet transform of the EEG signal and others related to the heart rate variability in the ECG signal. Using feature selection techniques such as Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) with classification algorithms as cost functions (linear-Bayes and k-nearest neighbors classifier), we found which features have the most relevant information about pre-ictal state and which of them are the most appropriated for seizure forecasting, therefore we found that ECG signal could be a potential resource for predicting epileptic seizures, and we concluded that there are patterns in EEG and ECG signals that, via machine learning algorithms, can predict the epileptic seizure onset with a total average accuracy of 94%.

One of actively growing research in the past years is to measure human concentration using EEG. Obtaining relevant features for recognizing human concentration state becomes a challenging task due to the nature of EEG signals is a non-stationary. In the past research, various combinations of features have been employed. However, to improve the classification performance, determining the importance of each employed feature is crucially needed. In this study, feature scaling method is introduced to assign different weights for important features. Four different features are investigated in frequency domain using wavelet transform (WT). Then, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to scale the features while extreme learning machine (ELM) is used to classify between concentration and non-concentration states. The recorded EEG signals from Neurosky Mindwave are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique. The final results indicate that the proposed technique offers higher performance accuracy as compared to the methods without feature scaling.	[Li, K.

The proposed algorithm in this paper uses a fully data-driven multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) in order to obtain the mu and beta rhythms from the nonlinear EEG signals. Then, the strong uncorrelating transform complex common spatial patterns (SUTCCSP) algorithm is applied to the rhythms so that the complex data, constructed with the mu and beta rhythms, becomes uncorrelated and its pseudocovariance provides supplementary power difference information between the two rhythms. The extracted features using SUTCCSP that maximize the interclass variances are classified using various classification algorithms for the separation of the left- and right-hand motor imagery EEG acquired from the Physionet database. This paper shows that the supplementary information of the power difference between mu and beta rhythms obtained using SUTCCSP provides an important feature for the classification of the left-and right-hand motor imagery tasks. In addition, MEMD is proved to be a preferred preprocessing method for the nonlinear and nonstationary EEG signals compared to the conventional IIR filtering. Finally, the random forest classifier yielded a high performance for the classification of the motor imagery tasks.

J	Han, JS; Kim, GJ				Han, Jung-Soo; Kim, Gui-Jung			A method of unsupervised machine learning based on self-organizing map for BCI	CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						BCI; Self organizing map; Machine learning; Brainwave		Brain computer interface (BCI) is a technology that controls computers or machines using the thoughts or intentions of a person. EEG signal measured from the human scalp is reflected with thoughts and intentions of a person, and when using the signal processing technologies such as machine learning or pattern recognition, intentions of such users can be interpreted. This study has proposed an autonomous machine learning method applicable to BCI based on Kohonen's self-organizing map which is one of the representative methods of unsupervised learning. To achieve this, learning area adjustment method and autonomous machine learning rules using interactive functions were proposed. Learning area adjustment and machine learning have used the side control effects according to the interactive functions based on Kohonen's self-organizing map. After determining the winning neuron, the connection strength of neuron was adjusted according to the learning rules. As the learning area gradually decreased according to the increase in the number of learning, the flow towards the input of weighted value of output layer neuron was mitigated and an autonomous machine learning that can complete the learning as the network reaches the equilibrium state was proposed. This BCI technology that connects the brain and machines is predicted to be applicable to a variety of BCI applications in that unlike the existing manual mechanism, it is applied with person's brainwaves.

Most algorithms for EEG classification use spatial covariance matrices, that contain information about synchronisation and desynchronisation in human brain. Suggested algorithm involves Riemannian geometry in the space of symmetric and positive-definite matrices to measure distances between covariance matrices in more accurate fashion. Then Isomap algorithm is applied to the Riemannian pairwise distances to locate manifold, corresponding to human EEG signals, and arrange points, corresponding to covariance matrices, in low-dimensional space, preserving geodesical distances. Finally, linear discriminant analysis is applied for classification. Suggested algorithm is tested on Berlin BCI dataset and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms common spatial patterns and classification in tangent space.

Three types of epileptiform discharges (interictal spike, spike and slow wave complex, and repetitive spikes and slow wave complex) are classified by the quantification of functional connections presented in the regions of interest within different frequency bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, and Beta). These patterns are validated by performing analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results revealed that the number of connections from different epileptogenic biomarkers were statistically different. The functional connectivity maps were able to delineate the distinctive patterns that can be used to classify different types of epilepsy.

J	Peng, Y; Zheng, WL; Lu, BL				Peng, Yong; Zheng, Wei-Long; Lu, Bao-Liang			An unsupervised discriminative extreme learning machine and its applications to data clustering	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Extreme learning machine (ELM); Unsupervised learning; Manifold information; Discriminative information; Image clustering; EEG	NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; GEOMETRIC FRAMEWORK; RECOGNITION; ELM; APPROXIMATION; REGRESSION	Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), which was initially proposed for training single-layer feed-forward networks (SLFNs), provides us a unified efficient and effective framework for regression and multiclass classification. Though various ELM variants were proposed in recent years, most of them focused on the supervised learning scenario while little effort was made to extend it into unsupervised learning paradigm. Therefore, it is of great significance to put ELM into learning tasks with only unlabeled data. One popular approach for mining knowledge from unlabeled data is based on the manifold assumption, which exploits the geometrical structure of data by assuming that nearby points will also be close to each other in transformation space. However, considering the manifold information only is insufficient for discriminative tasks. In this paper, we propose an improved unsupervised discriminative ELM (UDELM) model, whose main advantage is to combine the local manifold learning with global discriminative learning together. UDELM can be efficiently optimized by solving a generalized eigenvalue decomposition problem. Extensive comparisons over several state-of-the-art models on clustering image and emotional EEG data demonstrate the efficacy of UDELM. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Multiclass Common Spatial Pattern with Artifacts Removal Methodology for EEG Signals	2016 4TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTATIONAL AND BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE (ISCBI)			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Symposium on Computational and Business Intelligence (ISCBI)	SEP 05-07, 2016	Olten, SWITZERLAND	IEEE, INNS India Reg Chapter, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz		EEG; BCI; CSP; Multiclass		Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm has been proved to be effective in Brain Computer Interface (BCI) for extracting features from Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals used in motor imagery tasks, but it is vulnerable to noise and the problem of over-fitting. Many algorithms have been devised to regularize CSP for two class problem, however they have not been effective when applied to multiclass CSP. The features extracted using the CSP are non-stationary in nature which increases the difficulty during classification. We propose a method to remove trials that are affected by noise before calculating the CSP. This helps in calculating eigenvectors which generates better CSP. To handle the non-stationarity in the EEG signal, Self-Regulated Interval Type-2 Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (SRIT2NFIS) was proposed in the literature for two class EEG classification problem. This paper extends the SRIT2NFIS to Multiclass CSP using Joint Approximate Diagonalization (JAD). The results are presented on standard dataset.

Pattern recognition for electroencephalographic signals based on continuous neural networks	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Signal classifier; Continuous neural networks; Electroencephalographic signals; Pattern recognition	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; SEIZURE DETECTION; EEG	This study reports the design and implementation of a pattern recognition algorithm to classify electroencephalographic (EEG) signals based on artificial neural networks (NN) described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The training method for this kind of continuous NN (CNN) was developed according to the Lyapunov theory stability analysis. A parallel structure with fixed weights was proposed to perform the classification stage. The pattern recognition efficiency was validated by two methods, a generalization-regularization and a k-fold cross validation (k = 5). The classifier was applied on two different databases. The first one was made up by signals collected from patients suffering of epilepsy and it is divided in five different classes. The second database was made up by 90 single EEG trials, divided in three classes. Each class corresponds to a different visual evoked potential. The pattern recognition algorithm achieved a maximum correct classification percentage of 97.2% using the information of the entire database. This value was similar to some results previously reported when this database was used for testing pattern classification. However, these results were obtained when only two classes were considered for the testing. The result reported in this study used the whole set of signals (five different classes). In comparison with similar pattern recognition methods that even considered less number of classes, the proposed CNN proved to achieve the same or even better correct classification results.

J	Atyabi, A; Shic, F; Naples, A				Atyabi, Adham; Shic, Frederick; Naples, Adam			Mixture of autoregressive modeling orders and its implication on single trial EEG classification	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Autoregressive analysis; Genetic algorithm; Particle Swarm Optimization; Electroencephalogram	EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; MENTAL TASKS; SIGNALS; PHASE	Autoregressive (AR) models are of commonly utilized feature types in Electroencephalogram (EEG) studies due to offering better resolution, smoother spectra and being applicable to short segments of data. Identifying correct AR's modeling order is an open challenge. Lower model orders poorly represent the signal while higher orders increase noise. Conventional methods for estimating modeling order include Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Final Prediction Error (FPE). This article assesses the hypothesis that appropriate mixture of multiple AR orders is likely to better represent the true signal compared to any single order. Better spectral representation of underlying EEG patterns can increase utility of AR features in Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems by increasing timely & correctly responsiveness of such systems to operator's thoughts. Two mechanisms of Evolutionary-based fusion and Ensemble-based mixture are utilized for identifying such appropriate mixture of modeling orders. The classification performance of the resultant AR-mixtures are assessed against several conventional methods utilized by the community including (1) A well-known set of commonly used orders suggested by the literature, (2) conventional order estimation approaches (e.g., AIC, BIC and FPE), (3) blind mixture of AR features originated from a range of well-known orders. Five datasets from BCI competition III that contain 2, 3 and 4 motor imagery tasks are considered for the assessment. The results indicate superiority of Ensemble-based modeling order mixture and evolutionary-based order fusion methods within all datasets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Accurate investigation and analysis of the EEG signals from a subject can interpret the inherent information about the intention of the person to some extent. The accuracy of such interpretation or detection can be of utmost importance for various brain computer interface (BCI) based applications. For instance, within the last decade, BCI has been widely investigated and employed to assist in the restoration of sensory and motor functions in paralyzed individuals. EEG typically contains numerous information about the cognitive thinking and intention of a person, particularly in terms of motor movements. Due to this, comprehensive methods of EEG signal arrangement and pattern recognition through signal classification techniques are required to precisely predict the intended set of movements. In this study, an EEG classification technique based on a combination of wavelet transform analysis and Neural Networks (NN) is presented. Daubechies wavelet decomposition (db8) has been employed to decompose the recorded EEG signals into four levels. These decomposed level details are then used to calculate the feature set which is input to NN classifier for further classification. A total of 6 features were used to perform feature wise classification, where Integrated EEG (IEEG) feature set has been found to possess the highest classification accuracy of 89.39 % with a NN classifier of 9 hidden layers. Whereas, a classification accuracy of 94.86 % was achieved when the features were arranged and cascaded horizontally in form of a dataset as input to a NN classifier of 5 hidden layers.

Accurate and effective EEG classification plays an important role in performance of BCI applications. In this paper, we propose a dictionary pair learning (DPL) method for EEG signal classification. In this method, we can learn a dictionary without costly L0 and L1 calculation and sparse coefficients have been calculated by linear projection instead of nonlinear sparse coding. We analyzed the performance of new method using EEG data from Ilia and IVa databases of BCI competition III. Experimental results showed that proposed method provides higher classification per: formance compared with other dictionary learning methods such as label consistent K Singular value decomposition (LC-KSVD). Based on our results, accuracy rates are as follows: 81.25%, 100%, 60.2%, 83.04% and 7937% for subjects "aa", "al", "av", "aw" and "ay", respectively from IVa database. Also, the average accuracy rate of 85.7% has been achieved for two-class classification of IIIa database. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

From a pattern recognition point of view, one key problem is how to represent the large amount of recorded EEG signals for further analysis such as classification. It is, first, important to extract useful features from raw EEG signals, and then use the extracted features for classification. The literature reports numerous signal processing techniques being employed for the feature extraction and classification stage. The main drawback of these methods is that they do not work well when the data size is very large. To tackle the problem, this chapter introduces a new classification algorithm combining a simple random sampling (SRS) technique and a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) to classify two-class EEG signals. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we tested it in the benchmark epileptic EEG database (EEG time series 2005; Andrzejak et al. 2001) and have reported the results in Sect. 4.3. For further assessment, we also evaluated the proposed method in the mental imagery EEG dataset: BCI Competition III (Data set V) (Chiappa and Millan 2005) and in Ripley data (1996), and these results are also provided in the experimental results section.

Music is considered as a powerful tool for arousing emotions in human beings. This study recognized happy, sad, love and anger emotions in response to audio music tracks from electronic, rap, metal, rock and hiphop genres. Participants were asked to listen to audio music tracks of 1 min for each genre in a noise free environment. The main objectives of this study were to determine the effect of different genres of music on human emotions and indicating age group that is more responsive to music. Thirty men and women of three different age groups (15-25 years, 26-35 years and 36-50 years) underwent through the experiment that also included self reported emotional state after listening to each type of music. Features from three different domains i.e., time, frequency and wavelet were extracted from recorded EEG signals, which were further used by the classifier to recognize human emotions. It has been evident from results that MLP gives best accuracy to recognize human emotion in response to audio music tracks using hybrid features of brain signals. It is also observed that rock and rap genres generated happy and sad emotions respectively in subjects under study. The brain signals of age group (26-35 years) gave best emotion recognition accuracy in accordance to the self reported emotions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Hierarchical multi-class SVM with ELM kernel for epileptic EEG signal classification	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Epileptic seizures; EEG classification; Support vector machine; Machine learning; Wavelet transformation	AUTOMATIC SEIZURE DETECTION; EMPLOYING LYAPUNOV EXPONENTS; RECURRENT NEURAL-NETWORK; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; WAVELET TRANSFORM; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; MACHINE; RECOGNITION; SYSTEM	In this paper, a novel hierarchical multi-class SVM (H-MSVM) with extreme learning machine (ELM) as kernel is proposed to classify electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for epileptic seizure detection. A clinical EEG benchmark dataset having five classes, obtained from Department of Epileptology, Medical Center, University of Bonn, Germany, is considered in this work for validating the clinical utilities. Wavelet transform-based features such as statistical values, largest Lyapunov exponent, and approximate entropy are extracted and considered as input to the classifier. In general, SVM provides better classification accuracy, but takes more time for classification and also there is scope for a new multi-classification scheme. In order to mitigate the problem of SVM, a novel multi-classification scheme based on hierarchical approach, with ELM kernel, is proposed. Experiments have been conducted using holdout and cross-validation methods on the entire dataset. Metrics namely classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and execution time are computed to analyze the performance of the proposed work. The results show that the proposed H-MSVM with ELM kernel is efficient in terms of better classification accuracy at a lesser execution time when compared to ANN, various multi-class SVMs, and other research works which use the same clinical dataset.

Therefore, more and more research on automatic seizure detection have been developed in recent years. The appropriate feature extraction method and efficient classifier are recognized to be crucial in the successful realization. In this paper, we first create a novel feature extraction method based on fuzzy conditional Renyi entropy (FCRE), which focuses on characterizing the physiological complexity of the underlying signal transduction processes. Then we propose an automatic seizure detection method FCRE-ELM, which integrates the fuzzy conditional Renyi entropy FCRE and extreme learning machine (ELM) for differentiating seizure EEGs from non-seizure EEGs or normal EEGs. The experimental results on the open EEG database have shown that the proposed method FCRE-ELM does a good job in epileptic seizure detection while preserving the efficiency and simplicity.

Filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) is an improved version of CSP by introducing multiple frequency filters and a stage of feature selection. In FBCSP, methods for the feature selection stage can be various, and there is no criteria to guide the selection. To make the selection of a specific feature selection method reasonable, this paper tries to obey a guideline that the feature selection method should match with the classification method. Based on the proposed criteria above, this paper employs fisher linear discriminant (FLD) for classification and a corresponding Relief method for features selection.

Its probabilistic counterpart by resolving the problem of overfitting as the main limitation of CSP attracted much attention, especially in the motor imaginary based brain computer interface (BCI) applications. Since the computational efficiency is a paramount issue in real-time EEG classification, in this paper, assuming additive isotropic noise, maximum a posteriori (MAP)-based iterative updating algorithm is applied. However, the performance of this algorithm depends on the model size which must be predetermined. To this end, three information based source number estimations including Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Minimum Description Length (MDL) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) were used. The experimental results on a publicly available Ma dataset from BCI competition III demonstrate higher classification accuracy compared to CSP and existing Tikhonov regularized CSP (TRCSP) models. In addition, a significant decrease in run-time was achieved using the proposed method.

The domain adaptation method, which is aimed at obtaining a common representation across training and test domains, is an effective method for reducing the distribution discrepancy. However, the existing domain adaptation strategies either employ a linear transformation or learn the nonlinearity mapping without a consistency constraint; they are not sufficiently powerful to obtain a similar distribution from highly non-stationary EEG signals. To address this problem, in this paper, a novel component, called the subspace alignment auto-encoder (SAAE), is proposed. Taking advantage of both nonlinear transformation and a consistency constraint, we combine an auto-encoder network and a subspace alignment solution in a unified framework. As a result, the source domain can be aligned with the target domain together with its class label, and any supervised method can be applied to the new source domain to train a classifier for classification in the target domain, as the aligned source domain follows a distribution similar to that of the target domain. We compared our SAAE method with six typical approaches using a public EEG dataset containing three affective states: positive, neutral, and negative. Subject to-subject and session-to-session evaluations were performed. The subject-to-subject experimental results demonstrate that our component achieves a mean accuracy of 77.88% in comparison with a state-of-the-art method, TCA, which achieves 73.82% on average. In addition, the average classification accuracy of SAAE in the session-to-session evaluation for all the 15 subjects in a dataset is 81.81%, an improvement of up to 1.62% on average as compared to the best baseline TCA. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method relative to state-of-the-art methods. It can be concluded that SAAE is a useful and effective tool for decreasing domain discrepancy and reducing performance degradation across subjects and sessions in the EEG based emotion recognition field.

This process results in lower energy of brain electric activity, dissimilarity between signals of different parts of the brain, and also changes in hierarchy of brain oscillators followed by changes in entropy and fractal dimension of EEG signals. Different types of neural network including, deep learning" methods of machine learning are able to decorrelate, thus parametrize input data. By comparison of learning results of raw data with parametrized data is possible to estimate the existence of other unknown EEG parameters, related to physiological aging. We used 30113 EEG records of healthy truck drivers. Segments 2 seconds long without artifacts were manually selected in standard 10/20 montage with linked ear reference. We used one section per 20 min record. Data were filtered between 0.5-60 Hz with sample frequency of 128Hz, then were divided to learning set containing 70% of records, validation and testing sets contained 15% each. Raw data of 19x256 samples were used for learning according to the age in range 18-70 years using "feed-forward back propagation" method of neural network with one hidden layer and "deep learning" of neural network with two hidden layers. Pre-analyzed data using conventional EEG bands energy, average coherence between all electrodes, fractal dimension and permutation entropy were also used for learning by both neural networks. Data were divided into 6 classes, each represented one decade. We used exact Fisher test for statistical success of the classification, all methods have p<0.0001. Classification based on "deep learning" method using raw data had highest success. This fact proves existence of predictors of age in EEG independent on energy, coherence, and entropy and fractal dimension.

The l(1)-norm-based expression of dispersion in CSP-L1 alleviates the negative impact of outliers. In this paper, we further improve the robustness of CSP-L1 by taking into account noise which does not necessarily have as large a deviation as with outliers. The noise modelling is formulated by using the waveform length of the EEG time course. With the noise modelling, we then regularize the objective function of CSP-L1, in which the l(1)-norm is used in two folds: one is the dispersion and the other is the waveform length. An iterative algorithm is designed to resolve the optimization problem of the regularized objective function. A toy illustration and the experiments of classification on real EEG data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Automatic epilepsy detection from EEG introducing a new edge weight method in the complex network	ELECTRONICS LETTERS			English	Article							TIME-SERIES	Automatic diagnosis of epilepsy using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is a hot topic in medical community as traditional diagnosis relies on tedious visual screening by highly trained clinicians from lengthy EEG recording. Hence, a new methodology to automatically detect epilepsy from EEG signals considering complex network as the principal dynamics of the epileptic EEG signals can be perfectly described by complex network is introduced. A novel edge weight method for visibility graph in the complex network for detection of epilepsy syndrome is presented. The effect of new edge weights for one key characteristic (such as, average weighted degree) of complex network is investigated. Finally, the extracted feature set is evaluated by two popular machine learning classifiers: support vector machine (SVM) with several kernel functions and linear discriminant analysis. The experimental results on Bonn University datasets show that the proposed approach is able to characterise the epilepsy from EEG signals generating up to 100% classification performance by SVM with polynomial kernel.

EEG-Based Affect States Classification using Deep Belief Networks	2016 DIGITAL MEDIA INDUSTRY AND ACADEMIC FORUM (DMIAF)			English	Proceedings Paper	Digital Media Industry and Academic Forum (DMIAF)	JUL 04-06, 2016	GREECE	Univ Patras, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Greece Sect				Affective states classification has become an important part of the Brain-Computer Interface (HCI) study. In recent years, affective computing systems using physiological signals, such as ECG, GSR and EEG has shown very promising results. However, like many other machine learning studies involving physiological signals, the bottle neck is always around the database acquisition and the annotation process. To investigate potential ways to address this small sample problem, this paper introduces a Deep Belief Networks (DBN) based learning system for the EEG-based affective processing system. Through the greedy-layer pretraining using unlabeled data as weIl as a supervised fine-tuning process, the DBN-based approaches significantly reduced the number of labeled samples required. The DBN methods also acted as an application specific feature selector, by examining the weight vector between the input feature vector and the first invisible layer, we can gain much needed insights on the spatial or spectral locations of the most discriminating features. In this study, DBNs are trained on the narrow-band spectral features extracted from multichannel EEG recordings. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed DBN-based learning system, we carried out an subject-independent affective states classification experiments on the DEAP database to classify 2-dimensional affect states. As a baseline to the proposed DBN approach, the same classification problem was also carried out using support vector machines (SVMs) and one-way ANOVA based feature selection process. The classification results shown that the proposed framework using Deep Belief Networks not only provided better classification performance, but also significantly lower the number of labeled data required to train such machine learning systems.

J	Peng, Y; Lu, BL				Peng, Yong; Lu, Bao-Liang			Discriminative manifold extreme learning machine and applications to image and EEG signal classification	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Extreme learning machine; Discriminative information; Manifold information; Image classification; EEG; Emotion recognition	REGRESSION; SYSTEM; RECOGNITION; FRAMEWORK; ENSEMBLE; ENTROPY	Extreme learning machine (ELM) uses a non-iterative method to train single-hidden-layer feed-forward networks (SLFNs), which has been proven to be an efficient and effective learning model for both classification and regression. The main advantage of ELM lies in that the input weights as well as the hidden layer biases can be randomly generated, which contributes to the analytical solution of output weights. In this paper, we propose a discriminative manifold ELM (DMELM) by simultaneously considering the discriminative information and geometric structure of data; specifically, we exploit the discriminative information in the local neighborhood around each data point. To this end, a graph regularizer based on a newly designed graph Laplacian to characterize both properties is formulated and incorporated into the ELM objective. In DMELM, the output weights can also be obtained in analytical form. Extensive experiments are conducted on image and EEG signal classification to evaluate the effectiveness of DMELM. The results show that DMELM consistently achieves better performance than original ELM and yields promising results in comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms, which suggests that both the discriminative as well as manifold information are beneficial to classification.

Two important features of EEG signals are liveliness and the robustness against falsification. However, a comprehensive study on human authentication using EEG signal is still remains. On the other hand, low-cost wireless EEG recording devices are now growing in the market places. Although these devices have the potential to many applications, researches have yet to be done to find the feasibility of these devices. In this study, we propose a method for human identification using EEG signals obtained from such low-cost devices. EEG signal is first preprocessed to remove noise and artifacts using Bandpass FIR filter. These signals are then divided into disjoint segments. Three feature extraction methods, namely multiscale shape description (MSD), multiscale wavelet packet statistics (WPS) and multiscale wavelet packet energy statistics (WPES) are then applied. These features are finally used to train a supervised error-correcting output code multiclass model (ECOC) using support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which ultimately can recognize humans from test EEG signals. A preliminary experiment with 9 EEG records from 9 subjects shows the true positive rate of 94.44% of the proposed method.	[Bashar, Md.

The effectiveness of regularization is often highly dependent on the selection of regularization parameters that are typically determined by cross-validation (CV). However, the CV imposes two main limitations on BCIs: 1) a large amount of training data is required from the user and 2) it takes a relatively long time to calibrate the classifier. These limitations substantially deteriorate the system's practicability and may cause a user to be reluctant to use BCIs. In this paper, we introduce a sparse Bayesian method by exploiting Laplace priors, namely, SBLaplace, for EEG classification. A sparse discriminant vector is learned with a Laplace prior in a hierarchical fashion under a Bayesian evidence framework. All required model parameters are automatically estimated from training data without the need of CV. Extensive comparisons are carried out between the SBLaplace algorithm and several other competing methods based on two EEG data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the SBLaplace algorithm achieves better overall performance than the competing algorithms for EEG classification.

There are numerous compelling applications in healthcare that can benefit from high performance automated decision support systems provided by deep learning technology, but they lack the comprehensive data resources required to apply sophisticated machine learning models. Further, for economic reasons, it is very difficult to justify the creation of large annotated corpora for these applications. Hence, automated annotation techniques become increasingly important. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of using an active learning algorithm to automatically annotate a large EEC corpus. The algorithm is designed to annotate six types of EEG events. Two model training schemes, namely threshold-based and volume-based, are evaluated. In the threshold-based scheme the threshold of confidence scores is optimized in the initial training iteration, whereas for the volume-based scheme only a certain amount of data is preserved after each iteration. Recognition performance is improved 2% absolute and the system is capable of automatically annotating previously unlabeled data. Given that the interpretation of clinical EEG data is an exceedingly difficult task, this study provides some evidence that the proposed method is a viable alternative to expensive manual annotation.

Critical Care EEG Monitoring Res	Sensitivity of quantitative EEG for seizure identification in the intensive care unit	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							AMPLITUDE-INTEGRATED ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; NONCONVULSIVE STATUS EPILEPTICUS; CEREBRAL FUNCTION MONITOR; CRITICALLY-ILL CHILDREN; DENSITY SPECTRAL ARRAY; TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; ELECTROGRAPHIC SEIZURES; TERMINOLOGY; CRITERIA; ADULTS	Objective: To evaluate the sensitivity of quantitative EEG (QEEG) for electrographic seizure identification in the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: Six-hour EEG epochs chosen from 15 patients underwent transformation into QEEG displays. Each epoch was reviewed in 3 formats: raw EEG, QEEG + raw, and QEEG-only. Epochs were also analyzed by a proprietary seizure detection algorithm. Nine neurophysiologists reviewed raw EEGs to identify seizures to serve as the gold standard. Nine other neurophysiologists with experience in QEEG evaluated the epochs in QEEG formats, with and without concomitant raw EEG. Sensitivity and false-positive rates (FPRs) for seizure identification were calculated and median review time assessed. Results: Mean sensitivity for seizure identification ranged from 51% to 67% for QEEG-only and 63%-68% for QEEG + raw. FPRs averaged 1/h for QEEG-only and 0.5/h for QEEG + raw. Mean sensitivity of seizure probability software was 26.2%-26.7%, with FPR of 0.07/h. Epochs with the highest sensitivities contained frequent, intermittent seizures. Lower sensitivities were seen with slow-frequency, low-amplitude seizures and epochs with rhythmic or periodic patterns. Median review times were shorter for QEEG (6 minutes) and QEEG + raw analysis (14.5 minutes) vs raw EEG (19 minutes; p = 0.00003). Conclusions: A panel of QEEG trends can be used by experts to shorten EEG review time for seizure identification with reasonable sensitivity and low FPRs. The prevalence of false detections confirms that raw EEG review must be used in conjunction with QEEG. Studies are needed to identify optimal QEEG trend configurations and the utility of QEEG as a screening tool for non-EEG personnel. Classification of evidence review: This study provides Class II evidence that QEEG + raw interpreted by experts identifies seizures in patients in the ICU with a sensitivity of 63%-68% and FPR of 0.5 seizures per hour.

J	Li, DZ; Xie, QW; Jin, QB; Hirasawa, K				Li, Dazi; Xie, Qianwen; Jin, Qibing; Hirasawa, Kotaro			A sequential method using multiplicative extreme learning machine for epileptic seizure detection	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT); Phase Space Reconstruction (PSR); Singular values of covariance matrix; Multiplicative extreme learning machine; Epileptic seizure detection	PHASE-SPACE RECONSTRUCTION; EEG SIGNALS; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; LYAPUNOV EXPONENTS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; CLASSIFICATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; REPRESENTATION; RECOGNITION	Epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders of the human brain, is unpredictable and irregular. There is much difficulty involved in its detection. Here, a sequential processing feature extraction method and a novel multiplicative extreme learning machine are proposed for using in the electroencephalogram (EEG) classification process towards epileptic seizure detection. Firstly, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) algorithm based on the frequency decomposition is used to obtain the sub-band wavelet coefficients. Secondly, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) phase space reconstruction (PSR) of the sub-band are calculated to reveal the nonlinear chaos characteristics of signals in the high dimension. Thirdly, and differing from other statistical methods, the singular values are calculated based on the covariance matrix of 2D or 3D phase space as features that reduce the correlation of each dimension and which demonstrate the crucial variance in the original EEG signals. A combination of the proposed sequential methods can extract the significant features of epileptic seizure signals for classification. Finally, a novel multiplicative extreme learning machine (M-ELM) is proposed for using in the classification process. As compared with the normal ELM, support vector machine (SVM) with different kernels and backpropagation (BP) neural networks, the use of M-ELM can further improve the classification accuracy rate of the seizure signals, seizure free signals and healthy signals from the public dataset. Tests of the proposed epilepsy detection approach can achieve the highest 100% detection accuracy with rapid calculation speed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper proposes a method to differentiate left, right and feet motor imagery movement according to two and three class classification using statistical features of the EEG signal of the subjects. For this purpose the collected EEG signals of three subjects are segmented and feed to discrete wavelet transform (DWT). DWT decomposes each EEG segmented signal to collect the relevant features. ANN classifies the three left, right and feet movement class trials data. Classification accuracy varies with respect to subject. This straightforward method can be used to design a well-organized BCI system with better accuracy.	[Rashid, Md.

We employ reduced number of channels without compromising performance notably. We apply three spatial filtering methods, i.e., Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), Regularized Common Spatial Pattern (RCSP) and Joint Approximate Diagonalization (JAD) as preprocessing. But, we emphasize on selecting specific EEG montages for BCI development. We achieve best 86.7% classification accuracy for subject k3b applying CSP using only 12 channels from sensorimotor regions instead of using 60 channels from the whole brain. Additionally, the average classification accuracies are 64.4% and 61.4% using 60 channels and 12 channels respectively. Also, the average computational latencies are 6.24s and 1.23s in cases of 60 channels and 12 channels respectively.

A reliable automatic classification and detection system would help to ensure an objective assessment thus facilitating treatments, and it would significantly improve the diagnosis of epilepsy. EEG signals could also be used for the long-term monitoring and treatment of patients. The main goal of this book is to explore the development of several methods that are capable of classifying different categories of EEG signal to help in the evaluation and treatment of brain diseases and abnormalities. This chapter outlines the book's objectives and its structures. This chapter also provides a description of the experimental databases and performance evaluation measures used in this research. Furthermore, this chapter discusses the commonly used methods of EEG signal classification.

Uncontrolled epilepsy poses a significant burden to society due to associated healthcare cost to treat and control the unpredictable and spontaneous occurrence of seizures. The objective of this research is to develop and present a novel classification framework that is utilised to discriminate interictal and preictal brain activities via quantitative analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. New method: Sample entropy-based features were extracted in parallel from 6 intracranial EEG channels, and then these features were fed to the extreme learning machine model for classification. Performance was evaluated on the basis of sensitivity and specificity and validation was performed using stratified cross-validation approach. Results: The proposed method can correctly distinguish interictal and preictal EEGs with a sensitivity of 86.75% and a specificity of 83.80%, on average, across 21 patients and 6 epileptic seizure origins. Comparison with existing method: Compared with traditional variance-based feature extraction, the proposed SampEn-based feature extraction method not only shows a significant improvement in the accuracy, but also has higher classification robustness and stability in terms of the much lower standard errors of classification accuracies across different evaluation periods. In addition, the proposed classification framework runs around 20 times faster than the support vector machine model during testing. Conclusions: The high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method makes it feasible to extend it to the development of a real-time EEG-based brain monitoring system for epileptic seizure prediction.

Event-Related Functional Network Identification: Application to EEG Classification	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Classification; connectivity; electroencephalographic (EEG); phase locking value (PLV); reactive band; threshold	GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; HUMAN BRAIN; BAND IDENTIFICATION; ADAPTIVE ESTIMATION; CONNECTIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; ORGANIZATION	Recent works on brain functional analysis have accentuated the importance of distributed functional networks and synchronized activity between networks in mediating cognitive functions. The network perspective is important to relate mechanisms of brain functions and the basis for classifying brain states. In this work, the network patterns related to neural tasks based on synchronization measure phase-locking value (PLV) in an electroencephalogram (EEG) are analyzed. Based on network dissimilarities between the rest and motor imagery tasks, important nodes and channel pairs corresponding to motor tasks are identified. A framework is developed to identify these most reactive channel pairs that form the subject-specific functional network. The identified functional network corresponding to tasks demonstrate significant PLV variation in line with the experiment protocol. With the selection of subject-specific reactive band, these channel pairs provide even higher variation corresponding to tasks. To demonstrate the potential of the developed framework to brain-computer interface, identified network patterns are employed as features for classification of tasks. Analysis performed with the two classes (left-hand and right-hand motor imagery EEG data) showed that the proposed approach yielded better classification results compared to earlier band-power based approaches for single trial analysis.

Inspired by importance of the attentional bias principle in human choice behaviour, we proposed a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model for efficient recognition of attentional bias. The model is based on the evolving spatio-temporal data machine NeuCube. The proposed model is tested on a case study experimental EEG data collected from a group of subjects exemplified here on a group of moderate drinkers when they were presented by different product features (in this case different features of drinks). The results showed a very high accuracy of discriminating attentional bias to non-target objects and their features when compared with a poor performance of traditional machine learning methods. Potential applications in neuromarketing and cognitive studies are also discussed.

However, the large number of attributes of EEG data is regarded as a curse for classifiers. This paper aims at dimensionality reduction of EEG signals. We use rough set theory to reduce the dimensions of EEG data. In particular, we use discernibility matrix (DM) to compute an indispensable set of attributes of the data so that the attribute set is reduced before classification. We then use Naive Bayes (NB) classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for classification of the EEG data containing only these attributes. We compare our method with the more popular Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We have used EEG dataset from BCI competition-H to perform the experiments. Accuracy, recall and precision are used as metrics to measure the performance of the classifiers with oriOnal dataset, PCA-reduced dataset and DM-reduced dataset. The classification results we obtained for the DM-reduced dataset are found to be as good as for the whole dataset without reduction and generally better than PCA-reduced dataset.

In this study, we seek to determine the two most discriminative directions of the cursor movement imagery EEG data among up/down/right/left movement imagery directions. The training and testing EEG data sets were recorded from three healthy human subjects in one week of delay. The motor imagery features were extracted using common spatial patterns (CSP), which is one of the most popular algorithms in the BC! community. Then, the features were classified by using the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) algorithms. The achieved results showed that imagination of up-right and down-left cursor movement imagery tasks were the two most discriminative di rections among the other task pairs.

In recent years, attempts have been made to detect the seizures using other modalities. In this study, we investigated the application of four accelerometers (ACM) attached to the limbs and surface electromyography (sEMG) electrodes attached to upper arms for the detection of tonic-clonic seizures. sEMG can identify the tension during the tonic phase of tonic-clonic seizure, while ACM is able to detect rhythmic patterns of the clonic phase of tonic-clonic seizures. Machine learning techniques, including feature selection and least-squares support vector machine classification, were employed for detection of tonic-clonic seizures from ACM and sEMG signals. In addition, the outputs of ACM and sEMG-based classifiers were combined using a late integration approach. The algorithms were evaluated on 1998.3 h of data recorded nocturnally in 56 patients of which seven had 22 tonic-clonic seizures. A multimodal approach resulted in a more robust detection of short and nonstereotypical seizures (91%), while the number of false alarms increased significantly compared with the use of single sEMG modality (0.28-0.5/12h). This study also showed that the choice of the recording system should be made depending on the prevailing pediatric patient-specific seizure characteristics and nonepileptic behavior.

Ll-norm-based common spatial patterns (CSP-L1) method is a recently developed technique that seeks robust spatial filters by using Ll-norm-based dispersions. However, the spatial filters obtained are still dense, and thus lack interpretability. This paper presents a regularized version of CSP-L1 with sparsity, termed as sp-CSPL1. It produces sparse spatial filters, which eliminate redundant channels and retain meaningful EEG signals. The sparsity is induced by penalizing the objective function of CSP-Ll with the Ll-norm. The sp-CSPL1 approach uses the Ll-norm twice for inducing sparsity and defining dispersions simultaneously. The presented sp-CSPL1 algorithm is evaluated on two publicly available EEG data sets, on which it shows significant improvement in classification accuracy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This mechanism thus does not involve the participation of motoric and muscular neurons. In recent progresses, things such as the variability of imagery activities and subject characteristics were found to be the main problems toward the development of reliable signal translation methods. In this paper, we propose an EEG signal translation system based on motoric imagery activities. The system includes band-pass filter and Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) for noise filtering and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction. Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic System is then used as the classifier for the produced features. The later identified classes, either 0 or 1, refer to the imagery cursor movement direction either upward or downward respectively. The training and testing data that used here are from BCI Competition II dataset 1a. The highest classification accuracy of the system was recorded at 85.2%.

Specially; Electroencephalogram (EEG), which is measured electrical activity of the brain and ionic current in neurons is result of these activities. A brain-computer interface (BCI) system uses these EEG signals to facilitate humans in different ways. P300 signal is one of the most important and vastly studied EEG phenomenon that has been studied in Brain Computer Interface domain. For instance, P300 signal can be used in BCI to translate the subject's intention from mere thoughts using brain waves into actual commands, which can eventually be used to control different electro mechanical devices and artificial human body parts. Since low Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) in P300 is one of the major challenge because concurrently ongoing heterogeneous activities and artifacts of brain creates lots of challenges for doctors to understand the human intentions. In order to address above stated challenge this research proposes a system so called Adaptive Error Detection method for P300-Based Spelling using Riemannian Geometry, the system comprises of three main steps, in first step raw signal is cleaned by preprocessing. In second step most relevant features are extracted using xDAWN spatial filtering along with covariance matrices for handling high dimensional data and in final step elastic net classification algorithm is applied after converting from Riemannian manifold to Euclidean space using tangent space mapping. Results obtained by proposed method are comparable to state-of-the-art methods, as they decrease time drastically; as results suggest six times decrease in time and perform better during the inter-session and inter-subject variability.

A discriminative subject-specific spatio-spectral filter selection approach for EEG based motor-imagery task classification	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Spectral filters; Band elimination; Spatiospectral filters; Non-stationarity; Interval type-2 neuro-Fuzzy inference system	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; COMPONENTS; PATTERNS	Motor-imagery tasks generate event related synchronization and de-synchronization in certain subject specific frequency ranges of the subject's ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) signals. The selection of frequency ranges for each subject is important for obtaining better classification accuracy of motor-imagery based Brain Computer Interface (BCI). Further, the spatial filters extracted corresponding to the selected spectral ranges also influence the classification accuracy. In this paper, a subject-specific spatio-spectral filter selection approach using a cognitive fuzzy inference system for classification of the motor-imagery tasks in a two step approach is presented. The cognitive fuzzy inference system (CFIS) employs an evolving interval type-2 system to classify the non-stationary features. The classifier employs a meta-cognitive sequential algorithm to determine both the structure and parameters of the CFIS. In the first step, the CFIS classifier is used to find the desired spectral filters by eliminating those frequency bands that do not affect the classification performance. In the second step, CFIS is used to eliminate those spatial filters which do not affect the performance. The performance of CFIS based spatio-spectral scheme has been evaluated using two publicly available BCI competition data sets and compared with other existing algorithms like FBCSP, DCSP and BSSFO. The results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the CSP method by approximately 15-18% and other algorithms like FBCSP, DCSP by 8-10%. Compared to a recently proposed algorithm BSSFO, it achieves an improvement of 2%, but is simpler in comparison to BSSFO. The main impact of the work is its ability to handle non-stationarity using interval type-2 sets and provide good classification performance. In general, the proposed CFIS algorithm can be applied in the field of expert and intelligent systems where it is necessary to deal with non-stationary signals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies showed that neural oscillations' patterns in Theta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma sub-bands play a main role in brain's emotional processing. The main goal of this study is to classify two different emotional states by means of EEG data recorded through a single-electrode EEG headset. Nineteen young subjects participated in an EEG experiment while watching a video clip that evoked three emotional states: neutral, relaxation and scary. Following each video clip, participants were asked to report on their subjective affect by giving a score between 0 to 10. First, recorded EEG data were preprocessed by stationary wavelet transform (SWT) based denoising to remove artifacts. Afterward, the distribution of power in time-frequency space was obtained using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and then, the mean value of energy was calculated for each EEG sub-band. Finally, 46 features, as the mean energy of frequency bands between 4 and 50 Hz, containing 689 instances-for each subject -were collected in order to classify the emotional states. Our experimental results show that EEG dynamics induced by horror and relaxing movies can be classified with average classification rate of 92% using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We also compared the performance of SVM to K-nearest neighbors (K-NN). The results show that K-NN achieves a better classification rate by 94% accuracy. The findings of this work are expected to pave the way to a new horizon in neuroscience by proving the point that only single-channel EEG data carry enough information for emotion classification.

Due to its non-invasive nature, it has been used in applications ranging from disorder detection, sleep analysis to Brain Machine Interface. A baseline state is required in all these applications to compare the required state with a reference state. In EEG analysis, Eyes Open (EO) and Eyes Closed (EC) relaxed states are the baselines used. The choice of baseline is important especially in Brain Machine Interface. Thus the system should be able to distinguish between these two states and hence the need for automated classification of EEG Baseline States. In the proposed approach, statistical features are used in classification of these two states along with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k Nearest Neighbour(k-NN) classifiers. Thirteen different statistical features are considered and it was found that the combination of kurtosis, IQR and MAD with k-NN classifier (k=7) gave the mean accuracy of 77.92%. The fact that kurtosis, IQR and MAD perform better implies that the underlying distributions of the two classes have significant difference.

In order to effectively recover the cortical dynamics from the EEG signals and improve the classification performance, plenty of studies focused on constructing subject-specific spatial and spectral filters, achieving considerable improvement in classification accuracy. However, almost all the approaches aimed to find one common subspace for projection of all the samples in different classes. Studies have shown that active channels and frequency information were not only subject-dependent but also class-dependent. Thus the variety of class-dependent spatial and spectral characteristics can provide further discriminative information for classification. In this paper, we proposed a tensorbased method which attempted to seek individual spatial and spectral subspaces for each class by which each class was projected into its own subspace separately such that they were easily to be classified. Finally, we added a regularization term in this model to avoid overfitting. We evaluated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method on two different datasets including one widely-used benchmark EEG dataset collected from healthy subjects and one self-collected EEG dataset collected from stroke patients. The results demonstrated its superior performance.

Due to the review character of the presentation a high overlap to the above mentioned contributions is unavoidable. When analysing cognition, it is often useful to combine information from various modalities (see e.g. Biessmann et al., 2011, Sui et al., 2012). In BCI recently multimodal fusion concepts have received great attention under the label hybrid BCI (Pfurtscheller et al., 2010, Muller-Putz et al. 2015, Dahne et al. 2015, Fazli et al. 2015) or as data analysis technique for extracting (non-) linear relations between data (see e.g. Biessmann et al., 2010, Biessmann et al., 2011, Fazli et al., 2009, 2011, 2012, Dahne et al., 2013, 2014a,b, 2015, Winkler et al. 2015). They are rooted in the modern machine learning and signal processing techniques that are now available for analysing EEG, for decoding mental states etc. (see Muller et al. 2008, Bunau et al. 2009, Tomioka and Muller, 2010, Blankertz et al., 2008, 2011, Lemm et al., 2011, Porbadnigk et al. 2015 for recent reviews and contributions to Machine Learning for BCI, see Samek et al. 2014 for a review on robust methods). Note that fusing information has also been a very common practice in the sciences and engineering (Waltz and Llinas, 1990). The talk will discuss a number of recent contributions from the BBCI group that have helped to broaden the spectrum of applicability for Brain Computer Interfaces and mental state monitoring in particular and for analysis of neuroimaging data in general. I will introduce a novel reliable method for estimating the Hurst exponent, a quantity that has recently become popular for describing network properties and is being used for diagnostic purposes (cf. Blythe et al. 2014). It is applied to estimate and analyse cognitive properties in neurophysiological data from BCI experiments (Samek et al. 2016).

It also raises important pathophysiologic issues concerning mechanisms of seizure generation. Until now, several seizure-onset patterns have been described using distinct recording methods (subdural, depth electrode), mostly in temporal lobe epilepsies or with heterogeneous neocortical lesions. Methods: We analyzed data from a cohort of 53 consecutive patients explored by stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) and with pathologically confirmed malformation of cortical development (MCD; including focal cortical dysplasia [FCD] and neurodevelopmental tumors [NDTs]). Results: We identified six seizure-onset patterns using visual and time-frequency analysis: low-voltage fast activity (LVFA); preictal spiking followed by LVFA; burst of polyspikes followed by LVFA; slow wave/DC shift followed by LVFA; theta/alpha sharp waves; and rhythmic spikes/spike-waves. We found a high prevalence of patterns that included LVFA (83%), indicating nevertheless that LVFA is not a constant characteristic of seizure onset. An association between seizure-onset patterns and histologic types was found (p = 001). The more prevalent patterns were as follows: (1) in FCD type I LVFA (23.1%) and slow wave/baseline shift followed by LVFA (15.4%); (2) in FCD type II burst of polyspikes followed by LVFA (31%), LVFA (27.6%), and preictal spiking followed by LVFA (27.6%); (3) in NDT, LVFA (54.5%). We found that a seizure-onset pattern that included LVFA was associated with favorable postsurgical outcome, but the completeness of the EZ resection was the sole independent predictive variable. Significance: Six different seizure-onset patterns can be described in FCD and NDT. Better postsurgical outcome is associated with patterns that incorporate LVFA.

A comparative study of feature ranking techniques for epileptic seizure detection using wavelet transform	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Electroencephalogram; Ranking techniques; Epilepsy; Least Square-Support Vector Machine	TIME-SERIES; EEG; ENTROPY	In this paper, an attempt is made to obtain optimal wavelet function and wavelet based Electroencephalograph (EEG) features for detection of epilepsy using appropriate feature ranking techniques. The EEG data includes normal, pre-ictal and ictal EEG signals. Initially, signals are decomposed using 16 discrete wavelets and the best basis wavelet is selected using Maximum Energy to Permutation Entropy ratio criterion. A range of statistical, fractal and entropy based features are calculated from selected wavelet coefficients. The performance of three different feature ranking techniques i.e. Fisher Score, ReliefF and Information Gain is investigated on computed features. Classification of the ranked features is performed by machine learning technique Least Square-Support Vector Machine. Features ranked through Fisher Score ranking technique show high discrimination ability and classified with high classification accuracy. Classification results ensure the suitability of proposed best basis wavelet based feature extraction methodology and Fisher Score ranking technique in epilepsy detection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To understanding criminal behavior, extracting the characteristic of brain waves have obviously crucial. According to hypothesis, particularly prefrontal lobes associated with the deception. This paper alleged to understanding the relationship between deception and truth from frontal lobe during some specific tasks by mapping their EEG signals. In the present study, multiplayer neural network are used for bio-signal classification to diversify between patterns of lie and truth types of EEG classes with the accuracy of around 96%. Brain activity have been captured and characterized with EEG by focusing alpha waves. During the test, lie detection identified and especially focus to detect lie in individual subjects, rather than group averages. In this research, the classification methods applied and EEG machine differentiated the specific patterns of brain activity from frontal lobes associated with deception and truth. The responses from the 3 subjects was discriminated correctly with 99%. The ranges of accuracy of test from three subjects was between 88% to 96%, there was an exception in round three with subject three with 46%. While the participants were playing with "Pokemon card", alpha waves were collected successfully.

Methods: We assessed the individualised prediction of psychosis by detecting specific patterns of beta and gamma oscillations using machine-learning algorithms. Prediction models were trained and tested on 53 neuroleptic-naive patients with a clinical high-risk for psychosis. Of these, 18 later transitioned to psychosis. All patients were followed up for at least 3 years. For an honest estimation of the generalisation capacity, the predictive performance of the models was assessed in unseen test cases using repeated nested cross-validation. Results: Transition to psychosis could be predicted from current-source density (CSD; area under the curve [AUC]=0.77), but not from lagged phase synchronicity data (LPS; AUC=0.56). Combining both modalities did not improve the predictive accuracy (AUC=0.78). The left superior temporal gyrus, the left inferior parietal lobule and the precuneus most strongly contributed to the prediction of psychosis. Conclusions: Our results suggest that CSD measurements extracted from clinical resting state EEG can help to improve the prediction of psychosis on a single-subject level.

J	Liu, Y; Zhang, H; Chen, M; Zhang, LQ				Liu, Ye; Zhang, Hao; Chen, Min; Zhang, Liqing			A Boosting-Based Spatial-Spectral Model for Stroke Patients' EEG Analysis in Rehabilitation Training	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Boosting; brain-computer interface (BCI); spatial-spectral analysis; stroke rehabilitation	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MOTOR IMAGERY; BCI; PATTERNS; SELECTION; RECOVERY; FILTERS; SYSTEM; SET	Studies have shown that a motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system can be used as a rehabilitation tool for stroke patients. Efficient classification of EEG from stroke patients is fundamental in the BCI-based stroke rehabilitation systems. One of the most successful algorithms for EEG classification is the common spatial patterns (CSP). However, studies have reported that the performance of CSP heavily relies on its operational frequency band and channels configuration. To the best of our knowledge, there is no agreed upon clinical conclusion about motor imagery patterns of stroke patients. In this case, it is not available to obtain the active channels and frequency bands related to brain activities of stroke patients beforehand. Hence, for using the CSP algorithm, we usually set a relatively broad frequency range and channels, or try to find subject-related frequency bands and channels. To address this problem, we propose an adaptive boosting algorithm to perform autonomous selection of key channels and frequency band. In the proposed method, the spatial-spectral configurations are divided into multiple preconditions, and a new heuristic supervisor of stochastic gradient boost strategy is utilized to train weak classifiers under these preconditions. Extensive experiment comparisons have been performed on three datasets including two benchmark datasets from the famous BCI competition III and BCI competition IV as well as one self-acquired dataset from stroke patients. Results show that our algorithm yields relatively higher classification accuracies compared with seven state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, the spatial patterns (spatial weights) and spectral patterns (bandpass filters) determined by the algorithm can also be used for further analysis of the data, e.g., for brain source localization and physiological knowledge exploration.

In this paper we use the synchronization information from electroencephalogram (EEG) channels through the Phase Locking Value (PLV) as a potential classification method for a Brain Computer Interface (BCI); this achieved using emotional schematic faces as stimuli in a motor imagery (MI) task. Based on the variations of the PLV values for each proposed task and for each participant, the principal channel pairs are identified. Selected channel pairs, corresponding with the accomplished task, present PLV patterns similarly to Evoked Potentials (ERS/ERD) which are widely used as classification features for MI based BCI.

Eye state classification is a kind of common time-series problem for detecting human cognitive state. One of approaches of EEG eye state classification is based on time series data. We propose a new neural fuzzy structure that is possible to use an eye state classification. The classification accuracy can be achieved by using the proposed approach in terms of the number of neurons in the hidden layer, which also leads types of membership function in fuzzy rules. The data of EEG signals for monitoring eye state saved by Machine Learning Repository, University of California, Irvine (UCI) is used for eye state benchmarking. We did experiments with 3 different networks for the architecture by changing the number of neurons in the hidden layer and random seed for weights. We found that tuning parameters asymmetrically gave us the best results through test cases. According to the test results, we have the best result with 4 neurons by managing parameters of standard deviations asymmetrically, with which showed a 4.0% average error rate with the test data.

However, conventional CSP algorithm is based on a single wide frequency band with a poor frequency selectivity which will lead to poor recognition accuracy. To solve this problem, a novel Partitioned CSP (PCSP) algorithm is proposed to find the most relevant spatial frequency distribution with motor imaginary, so that the algorithm has flexible frequency selectivity. Firstly, we partition the dataset into frequency components using a constant-bandwidth filters bank. Then, a features selection method based on the Bhattacharyya distance is adopted for PCSP features ranking, selection and evaluation. Subsequently, the PCSP features are used to obtain scores which reflect the classification capability and being used for EEG signal classification.

We investigated the neural correlates of workload buildup in a fine visuomotor task called the boundary avoidance task (BAT). The BAT has been known to induce naturally occurring failures of human-machine coupling in high performance aircraft that can potentially lead to a crash-these failures are termed pilot induced oscillations (PIOs). Approach. We recorded EEG and pupillometry data from human subjects engaged in a flight BAT simulated within a virtual 3D environment. Main results. We find that workload buildup in a BAT can be successfully decoded from oscillatory features in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Information in delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma spectral bands of the EEG all contribute to successful decoding, however gamma band activity with a lateralized somatosensory topography has the highest contribution, while theta band activity with a fronto-central topography has the most robust contribution in terms of real-world usability. We show that the output of the spectral decoder can be used to predict PIO susceptibility. We also find that workload buildup in the task induces pupil dilation, the magnitude of which is significantly correlated with the magnitude of the decoded EEG signals. These results suggest that PIOs may result from the dysregulation of cortical networks such as the locus coeruleus (LC)-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) circuit. Significance. Our findings may generalize to similar control failures in other cases of tight man-machine coupling where gains and latencies in the control system must be inferred and compensated for by the human operators. A closed-loop intervention using neurophysiological decoding of workload buildup that targets the LC-ACC circuit may positively impact operator performance in such situations.

We collected fourteen channels of brain electroencephalogram (EEG) signals transmitted by Emotiv Epoc+ Neuro Headset. Instead of emotiv's own processing and analysis methods, in our program, we wrote wCCA algorithm to preprocess EEG signals, and used Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) to extract the feature of EEG. Then, by KNN algorithm we classified the extracted features as imagining feet & righthand movement and neutral state, which correspond to the three control commands (turn forward, turn right, stop) respectively, so that it can control the motions of the simulated car constructed in SigViewer2.2.0. In addition, we applied the method of online-learning to greatly improving the classification accuracy, which avoid the time-consuming and laborious off-line training and is closer to real-time status of subjects. The simulation experiments results show that the methods of processing and classification in EEG have better feasibility and stability. It establishes a basis of practical application for EEG-controlled automobile.

The recorded EEG signal is transmitted to the computer and the upper limb robotic arm interface via a bluetooth. To obtain effective commands from brain, the recorded EEG signal is processed by a front filter, denoise filter, feature extraction, and classification, while the personal computer software and upper limb arm are driven by EEG-based commands. Through the encoders and gyroscopes on the upper limb arm, we can acquire some feedback signals in real time, such as joint angle, arm accelerated speed, and angular speed. The theory of wavelet denoising method, common spatial pattern algorithm and linear discriminant analysis algorithm are investigated in this paper. The simulations and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of these algorithms on EEG signal denoising, feature extraction, and classification.

However, voluntary control of sensorimotor (SMR) rhythms by imagining a movement can be skilful and unintuitive and usually requires a varying amount of user training. To boost the training process, a whole class of BCI systems have been proposed, providing feedback as early as possible while continuously adapting the underlying classifier model. The present work describes a cue-paced, EEG-based BCI system using motor imagery that falls within the category of the previously mentioned ones. Specifically, our adaptive strategy includes a simple scheme based on a common spatial pattern (CSP) method and support vector machine (SVM) classification. The system's efficacy was proved by online testing on 10 healthy participants. In addition, we suggest some features we implemented to improve a system's "flexibility" and "customizability," namely, (i) a flexible training session, (ii) an unbalancing in the training conditions, and (iii) the use of adaptive thresholds when giving feedback.

Neurotechnology can contribute to the usability assessment of products by providing objective measures of neural workload and can uncover usability impediments that are not consciously perceived by test persons. In this study, the neural processing effort imposed on the viewer of 3D television by shutter glasses was quantified as a function of shutter frequency. In particular, we sought to determine the critical shutter frequency at which the 'neural flicker' vanishes, such that visual fatigue due to this additional neural effort can be prevented by increasing the frequency of the system. Approach. Twenty-three participants viewed an image through 3D shutter glasses, while multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. In total ten shutter frequencies were employed, selected individually for each participant to cover the range below, at and above the threshold of flicker perception. The source of the neural flicker correlate was extracted using independent component analysis and the flicker impact on the visual cortex was quantified by decoding the state of the shutter from the EEG. Main Result. Effects of the shutter glasses were traced in the EEG up to around 67. Hz-about 20. Hz over the flicker perception threshold-and vanished at the subsequent frequency level of 77. Hz. Significance. The impact of the shutter glasses on the visual cortex can be detected by neurotechnology even when a flicker is not reported by the participants. Potential impact. Increasing the shutter frequency from the usual 50. Hz or 60. Hz to 77. Hz reduces the risk of visual fatigue and thus improves shutter-glass-based 3D usability.

EEG signals are highly subject specific and non-stationary. One of the most challenging tasks is to classify motion intentions since the recorded EEG signals have inherent non-stationarities which are due to changes in the signal properties over time within as well as across sessions. Thus it becomes difficult to achieve a stable operation of BCI. Method: We present a novel filtering method based on the multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) using subject independent BCI (MEMD-SI-BCI) for classification of motor imagery (MI) based EEG signals to achieve enhanced BCI. A subject independent BCI can be used immediately by the new user without using the user's training data. The MEMD method helps to utilize the cross channel information and enhance localization properties. It decomposes multichannel EEG signals into a set of multivariate intrinsic mode functions (MIMFs). These MIMFs can be considered narrow-band, amplitude and frequency modulated (AM-FM) signals. The statistical property, namely, mean frequency measure of these MIMFs has been used to combine these MIMFs to compute the enhanced EEG signals which have major contributions due to mu and beta rhythms over the motor cortex region. The objective of the proposed method is to filter EEG signals before feature extraction and classification to enhance the features separability and ultimately the BCI task classification performance. The common spatial pattern (CSP) feature has been computed from the enhanced EEG signals and has been used as a feature set for classification of left hand and right hand MIs using a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based classification method. Results: We have achieved an improvement of > 11% in the evaluation stage using the MEMD-SI-BCI method when compared with SI-BCI. Significance: This study helps to develop BCI systems with intuitive motor imaginations, thus facilitates broad use of noninvasive BCIs. We have evaluated our method on publicly available BCI competition IV dataset 2A and have obtained improved performance.

It identifies mental task patterns stored in electroencephalogram (EEG). So, it extracts brain electrical activities recorded by EEG and transforms them machine control commands. The main goal of BCI is to make available assistive environmental devices for paralyzed people such as computers and makes their life easier. This study deals with feature extraction and mental task pattern recognition on 2-D cursor control from EEG as offline analysis approach. The hemispherical power density changes are computed and compared on alpha-beta frequency bands with only mental imagination of cursor movements. First of all, power spectral density (PSD) features of EEG signals are extracted and high dimensional data reduced by principle component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) which are statistical algorithms. In the last stage, all features are classified with two types of support vector machine (SVM) which are linear and least squares (LS-SVM) and three different artificial neural network (ANN) structures which are learning vector quantization (LVQ), multilayer neural network (MLNN) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) and mental task patterns are successfully identified via k-fold cross validation technique.

In the literature, in fact, there are controversial results on EEG response to odorants. This study proposes a robust leave-one-subject-out classification method to recognize features extracted from EEG signals belonging to pleasant or unpleasant olfactory stimulation classes. An accuracy of 75% has been achieved in a group of 32 subjects. Moreover a set of features extracted from lateral electrodes emphasized that right and left hemispheres behave differently when the subjects are exposed to pleasant or unpleasant odours stimuli.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that measures and records the electrical activity of the brain, and is widely used in the detection and analysis of epileptic seizures. However, it is often difficult to identify critical changes in the EEG waveform by visual inspection, thus opening up a vast research challenges for developing automated methods for quantifying such subtle changes. Moreover, manual interpretation becomes complex due to nonlinear and non-stationary nature of the EEG signals. Hence, it is necessary to develop a quantitative method to automatically identify the normal and epileptic brain activities. In this study, we propose a supervised machine learning method to classify non-ictal (normal or preictal or interictal) and ictal (during seizure) brain activities from EEG signals. Several time-domain and time-frequency domain features are extracted to characterize EEG signals, which are then applied to linear discriminant analysis (LDA) or nonlinear support vector machine (SVM) classifier in order classify brain epilepsy. A preliminary experiment with two sets of EEG signals from `focal' and `nonfocal' channels (50 EEG signals per set, each of 10 second duration) of five subjects shows 79.20% accuracy of the epilepsy classification using a combination of features from the time frequency domain.

The effectiveness of the IT2FSVM classifier is evaluated based on a set of EEG samples which are collected from 10 patients at Peking university hospital. The EEG samples for the three seizure phases were captured by the 112 2-s 19 channel EEG epochs, where each patient was extracted for each sample. Feature extraction was used to reduce the feature vector of the EEG samples to 45 elements and the EEG samples with the reduced features are used for training the IT2FSVM classifier. The classification results obtained by the IT2FSVM are compared with three traditional classifiers namely Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbor and naive Bayes. The experimental results show that the IT2FSVM classifier is able to achieve superior learning capabilities with respect to the uncontaminated samples when compared with the three classifiers. In order to validate the level of robustness of the IT2FSVM, the original EEG samples are contaminated with Gaussian white noise at levels of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5. The simulation results show that the IT2FSVM classifier outperforms the traditional classifiers under the original dataset and also shows a high level of robustness when compared to the traditional classifiers with white Gaussian noise applied to it.

Brain-Computer-Interfaces (BCI) offers a mean of controlling prostheses for patients that otherwise are unable to operate such devices due to physical limitations. An issue with BCIs is that they tend to either require invasive recording methods, posing a surgical risk, or work by generating control signals from not task related brain activity patterns such as right vs. left hand, hand vs. leg or visual stimulation and therefore are not intuitive in their control. This research aims to test the possibility of controlling the grasp and release of an upper limb prosthetic terminal device by classifying Electroencephalogram (EEG) data from real hand grasping and releasing movement. Data from five healthy subjects were recorded using a consumer grade non-invasive Emotiv EPOC headset. During the measurement the subjects were asked to perform isometric finger extension and flexion of their right hand. In order to bring the EEG data into correlation with the executed movement a simultaneous electromyogram (EMG) recording is proposed as an alternative method to recordings of visual cued movement. Classified EMG data was used to generate markers in the EEG data and to epoch the data. In order to increase the signal to noise ratio and allow better classification, the EEG data was filtered and spectrally weighted common spatial patterns (spec-CSP) were used for feature extraction. Using linear discriminant analysis a classification rate of up to 73.2% between grasp and release was achieved. In this work, a novel EMG-assisted approach has been developed for classification of EEG data from hand grasp and release movements. It shows feasibility for a more intuitive control of upper limb prosthetic terminal device using low-cost BCI without the risk associated with invasive measurement. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) successfully meet the first goal with its adaptive engine, while nature-inspired algorithms are focusing on the feature selection (FS) process in order to eliminate less informative and less discriminant features. Besides engineering applications of ANN and FS algorithms, medical informatics is another emerging field using similar methods for medical data processing. Classification of psychiatric disorders is one of the major focus of medical informatics using artificial intelligence approaches. Being one of the most debilitating psychiatric diseases, bipolar disorder (BD) is frequently misdiagnosed as unipolar disorder (UD), leading to suboptimal treatment and poor outcomes. Thus, discriminating UD and BD at earlier stages of illness could therefore help to facilitate efficient and specific treatment. The use of quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) cordance as a biomarker has greatly enhanced the clinical utility of EEG in psychiatric and neurological subjects. In this context, the paper puts forward a study using two-step hybridized methodology: particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for FS process and ANN for training process. The noteworthy performance of ANN-PSO approach stated that it is possible to discriminate 31 bipolar and 58 unipolar subjects using selected features from alpha and theta frequency bands with 89.89 % overall classification accuracy.

In this chapter, we introduce a principal component analysis (PCA) method with the optimum allocation (OA) scheme, named as OA_PCA for extracting reliable characteristics from EEG signals. As EEG data from different channels are correlated and huge in number, the OA scheme is used to discover the most favourable representatives with minimal variability from a large number of EEG data, and the PCA is applied to construct uncorrelated components and also to reduce the dimensionality of the OA samples for enhanced recognition. To discover a suitable classifier for the OA_PCA feature set, four popular machine learning classifiers, such as LS-SVM, naive Bayes classifier (NB), k-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are applied and tested. Furthermore, our approaches are compared with some recent reported research work. This proposed method can also be applicable in biomedical signal processing and also in time series data analysis for acquiring evocative features when data size is large.

Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients have shown deficits in emotional recognition abilities although the research findings are inconclusive. This paper presents an investigation of six emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust) of twenty non-demented (Mini-Mental State Examination score >24) PD patients and twenty Healthy Controls (HCs) using Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based Brain Functional Connectivity (BFC) patterns. The functional connectivity index feature in EEG signals is computed using three different methods: Correlation (COR), Coherence (COH), and Phase Synchronization Index (PSI). Further, a new functional connectivity index feature is proposed using bispectral analysis. The experimental results indicate that the BFC change is significantly different among emotional states of PD patients compared with HC. Also, the emotional connectivity pattern classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier yielded the highest accuracy for the new bispectral functional connectivity index. The PD patients showed emotional impairments as demonstrated by a poor classification performance. This finding suggests that decrease in the functional connectivity indices during emotional stimulation in PD, indicating functional disconnections between cortical areas.

LMD, a new self-adaptive time-frequency analysis method, is applied to decompose the vibration signal into a set of product functions (PFs). Then, PE values of the first five PFs (PF-PE) are calculated to characterize the complexity of the vibration signal. Finally, for the purpose of less time-consuming and higher accuracy, ELM is used to identify and classify of gearbox in different fault types. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in diagnosing and classifying different states of gearbox in short time.

In this paper, we oversampled the EEG data in minority class to dynamically learn a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model based on a dynamical SMOTE (DySMOTE) approach in order to classify the MWL. The proposed approach consists of data sampling and a dynamical selection strategy, in which the probability of each sample being selected to update the weights and thresholds of the MLP is estimated in each epoch to derive an accurate classifier model. The DySMOTE approach was evaluated on the measured EEG data from eight subjects. The results showed that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of several performance metrics including geometric mean (G-mean) and classification accuracy (or correct classification rate) of individual classes of the MWL.

Comparative Efficacy of Pharmacological Treatment of Absence Epilepsy with Typical and Deviating (Complex) EEG Patterns	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						absence epilepsy; EEG; generalized 3-4 Hz spike/wave complexes (SWCs); deviating epileptiform EEG elements; combination of different EEG phenomena; valproic acid; Depakin	CHILDHOOD ABSENCE; ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUG; SEIZURES; CLASSIFICATION	In a group of 96 children and teenagers suffering from absence epilepsy, we compared the efficacy of treatment with a valproic acid derivative, Depakin (D). In 72 patients of group 1, the EEGs contained typical bursts similar to absence seizure phenomena (generalized 3-4 Hz spike/wave complexes, SWCs). In 24 patients, these EEG phenomena were combined with other types of epileptiform elements (generalized and focal irregular peak/wave complexes, single and grouped sharp waves, spikes, polyspikes, etc.). It was found that pharmacotherapy with D effectively eliminated SWCs generated in the resting state of the patients; epileptiform phenomena provoked by hyperventilation and rhythmic photostimulation were noticeably more resistant from this aspect. The efficacy of treatment with D was considerably higher in group 1 (patients with the EEG patterns including only SWCs) than in group 2 (patients with deviating EEG patterns containing, together with SWCs, epileptiform elements of other types). Six months after the D therapy initiation, complete elimination of typical 3-4 Hz SWCs was observed in 63.9% of group-1 patients and in 41.7% of group-2 patients.	[Maloletnev, V.

J	Buza, K; Koller, J				Buza, Krisztian; Koller, Julia			Classification of Electroencephalograph Data: A Hubness-aware Approach	ACTA POLYTECHNICA HUNGARICA			English	Article						electroencephalograph; nearest neighbor; classification; hubs	EEG; IDENTIFICATION; EPILEPSY	Classification of electroencephalograph (EEG) data is the common denominator in various recognition tasks related to EEG signals. Automated recognition systems are especially useful in cases when continuous, long-term EEG is recorded and the resulting data, due to its huge amount, cannot be analyzed by human experts in depth. EEG-related recognition tasks may support medical diagnosis and they are core components of EEG-controlled devices such as web browsers or spelling devices for paralyzed patients. State-of-the-art solutions are based on machine learning. In this paper, we show that EEG datasets contain hubs, i.e., signals that appear as nearest neighbors of surprisingly many signals. This paper is the first to document this observation for EEG datasets. Next, we argue that the presence of hubs has to be taken into account for the classification of EEG signals, therefore, we adapt hubness-aware classifiers to EEG data. Finally, we present the results of our empirical study on a large, publicly available collection of EEG signals and show that hubness-aware classifiers outperform the state-of-the-art time-series classifier.

This research proposed a recognition of attention state using wavelet filter and Support Vector Machine (SVM). It was divided by two states, that attention and inattention. EEG signal was extracted using Wavelet that filtered in the frequency range of 5-30 Hz. It is relevant with information of EEG signal against attention, that theta, alpha and beta waves. Therefore, using wavelet filter increased accuracy from 44-58% into 69-83%. Using SVM is simpler than using Neural Networks therefore could lead to convergence and shorter training time. Therefore, the system can be developed with a large training data. The classification system trained with four subjects to obtain the separation coefficient of linear hyperplane of SVM. It took less than one minute. Testing of four subjects gave an accuracy of 77-83%. The system that has been implemented into a software.

J	Li, MA; Guo, SD; Yang, JF; Sun, YJ				Li Mingai; Guo Shuoda; Yang Jinfu; Sun Yanjun			A novel EEG feature extraction method based on OEMD and CSP algorithm	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Motor imagery electroencephalogram; feature extraction; orthogonal empirical mode decomposition; common spatial pattern; adaptability	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; FILTER BANK; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION	The Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm is known to be effective in extracting discriminative features from Motor Imagery electroencephalograms (MI-EEG). However, its performance depends on the frequency bands that relate to brain activities associated with MI tasks. To achieve an accurate classification, several methods have been proposed to determine such a set of frequency bands. However, the existing methods cannot find the multiple subject-specific frequency bands adaptively. Based on the Orthogonal Empirical Mode Decomposition (OEMD), FIR filter and CSP algorithm, a novel feature extraction method called OEFCSP is proposed to effectively perform the autonomous extraction and selection of key individual spatial discriminative CSP features. A channel selection algorithm is applied to the band-pass filtered EEG signals to reduce the number of channels. Then, each remaining channel of the EEG signal is adaptively decomposed into multiple orthogonal Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) by OEMD, and each IMF is further equally divided into multiple sub-band signals by the band-pass filters. Subsequently, the CSP features are extracted from each sub-band signal and a feature ranking algorithm is employed to reorder the CSP features. Finally, a feature selection and classification algorithm is optimized to classify the selected CSP features. Experiments are conducted on a publicly available dataset, and the experimental results show that OEFCSP yields relatively higher classification accuracies compared to the existing approaches.

J	Khan, NA; Ali, S				Khan, Nabeel A.; Ali, Sadiq			CLASSIFICATION OF EEG SIGNALS USING ADAPTIVE TIME-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS	METROLOGY AND MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Adaptive Directional Time-Frequency Distribution; EEG signals; Time-Frequency features; Pattern recognition	SEIZURE DETECTION; REPRESENTATION; DESIGN	Time-Frequency (t-f) distributions are frequently employed for analysis of new-born EEG signals because of their non-stationary characteristics. Most of the existing time-frequency distributions fail to concentrate energy for a multicomponent signal having multiple directions of energy distribution in the t-f domain. In order to analyse such signals, we propose an Adaptive Directional Time-Frequency Distribution (ADTFD). The ADTFD outperforms other adaptive kernel and fixed kernel TFDs in terms of its ability to achieve high resolution for EEG seizure signals. It is also shown that the ADTFD can be used to define new time-frequency features that can lead to better classification of EEG signals, e.g. the use of the ADTFD leads to 97.5% total accuracy, which is by 2% more than the results achieved by the other methods.

EEG signals are measured by sensors placed in various positions of a person's head (channels). In this work, we address the problem of reducing the number of required sensors while maintaining a comparable performance. We evaluated a binary version of the Flower Pollination Algorithm under different transfer functions to select the best subset of channels that maximizes the accuracy, which is measured by means of the Optimum-Path Forest classifier. The experimental results show the proposed approach can make use of less than a half of the number of sensors while maintaining recognition rates up to 87%, which is crucial towards the effective use of EEG in biometric applications.

To avoid and alleviate these problems, we propose a method of a multilinear discriminant analysis with constraints to augment parameter reduction, regularization, and additional prior information for event-related potential (ERP)-based BCIs. The method reduces the number of parameters by multilinearization, regularizes the ill-posedness via subspaces that constrain the parameter spaces, and incorporates a brain functional connectivity through the constraints. The experimental results show that the proposed method improved the classification accuracy rates in a single-trial ERP processing.

Although BCI techniques have been developing quickly in recent decades, there remains a number of unsolved problems such as the improvement of MI signal classification. The translation of brain activities into EEG signals in BCI systems requires a robust and accurate classification to develop a communication system for motor disabled people. In BCIs, MI tasks generate brain activities, which are generally measured by EEG signals. The aim of this chapter is to introduce a method for the extraction of discriminatory information from the MI based EEG signals for BCI applications and then identify MI tasks based on the extracted features through the classification process. This chapter proposes a new approach, the ` Cross-correlation aided logistic regression model' called " CC-LR" for the identification of MI tasks. In this methodology, the cross-correlation (CC) technique is used for extracting information from MI EEG signals and the logistic regression (LR) method is employed to estimate the class labels of MI tasks using the extracted information as the input. This study investigates the performance of the CC technique for a randomly selected reference signal and also investigates the LR for efficient classification of the cross-correlated features.

Here, the user would determine the direction of end-point movement of a 3-degrees of freedom (DOF) robot arm using motor imagery electroencephalography signal with co-adaptive decoder (adaptivity between the user and the decoder) while a synergetic motor learning algorithm manages a peripheral redundancy in multi-DOF joints toward energy optimality through tacit learning. As in human motor control, torque control paradigm is employed for a robot to be adaptive to the given physical environment. The dynamic condition of the robot arm is taken into consideration by the learning algorithm. Thus, the user needs to only think about the end-point movement of the robot arm, which allows simultaneous multijoints control by BMI. The support vector machine-based decoder designed in this paper is adaptive to the changing mental state of the user. Online experiments reveals that the users successfully reach their targets with an average decoder accuracy of over 75% in different end-point load conditions.

We tested the utility of group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) for qEEG classification, focusing on the specific example of suppression ratio (SR). We included comatose CA patients hospitalized from April 2010 to October 2014, excluding CA from trauma or neurological catastrophe. We used Persyst(A (R))v12 to generate SR trends and used semi-quantitative methods to choose appropriate sampling and averaging strategies. We used GBTM to partition SR data into different trajectories and regression associate trajectories with outcome. We derived a multivariate logistic model using clinical variables without qEEG to predict survival, then added trajectories and/or non-longitudinal SR estimates, and assessed changes in model performance. Overall, 289 CA patients had ae<yen>36 h of EEG yielding 10,404 h of data (mean age 57 years, 81 % arrested out-of-hospital, 33 % shockable rhythms, 31 % overall survival, 17 % discharged to home or acute rehabilitation). We identified 4 distinct SR trajectories associated with survival (62, 26, 12, and 0 %, P < 0.0001 across groups) and CPC (35, 10, 4, and 0 %, P < 0.0001 across groups). Adding trajectories significantly improved model performance compared to adding non-longitudinal data. Longitudinal analysis of continuous qEEG data using GBTM provides more predictive information than analysis of qEEG at single time-points after CA.

Firstly, several audio-based features and visual-based features are extracted from video clips and EEG features are obtained by using Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD). Secondly, video features are selected using Double Input Symmetrical Relevance (DISR) and EEG features are selected by Decision Tree (DT). Thirdly, multimodal fusion using kernel-based ELM is adopted for classification by combing video and EEG features at decision-level. In order to test the validity of the proposed method, we design and conduct the EEG experiment to collect data that consisted of video clips and EEG signals of subjects. We compare our method separately with single mode methods of using video content only and EEG signals only on classification accuracy. The experimental results show that the proposed fusion method produces better classification performance than those of the video emotion recognition methods which use either video content or EEG signals alone.

The proposed communication system consists of a simple data acquisition protocol, which includes the basic needs of DE patients in their daily life, such as Food, Water, Toilet, Help, Aircon, Tv and Relax. The EEG signals for each task are recorded from ten subjects using a standard wireless EEG amplifier from eight different electrode positions. The recorded brain wave patterns are pre-processed and segmented into four frequency bands, namely Delta (delta), Theta (theta), Alpha (alpha) and Beta (beta). A simple feature extraction technique using cross-correlation (r) estimation has been proposed to extract the coefficients between any two frequency bands. Similarly, six permutation sets of four frequency bands for each electrode position are framed and the statistical features such as minimum (min), maximum (max), mean (mu), standard deviation (sigma), skewness (G) and kurtosis (K) are computed to form the feature sets. The extracted feature sets are classified using three different supervised non-parametric classification methods, namely, kappa-Nearest Neighbor (kappa- NN), Multilayer Neural Network (MLNN) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). Further, the classification models are compared and from the results it is observed that the kappa-NN classifier hits the highest classification accuracy of 90.24% using max feature set.

The emotion feature extraction based on algorithm of Common spatial pattern (CSP) after signal denoising. The emotion classification algorithm based on the support vector machine (SVM), and the finally classification accuracy can achieve 92%. Lastly, we analyze the complexity of EEG data in the by using the wavelet entropy algorithm. It found that wavelet entropy value of the negative emotion state is lower than the positive state. It shows that the brain is nervous and regularity of the brain is stronger when it is negative. In the positive mood, however, the brain is relatively relaxed and the regularity becomes weak. The study realizes the visualization of human emotion, which provides great value for the study of depression and those who can be easily influenced by emotion for heavy stress.

However, its performance depends largely on the subject-specific frequency band and time segment. Accurate selection of most responsive frequency band and time segment remains a crucial problem. A novel evolutionary algorithm, the backtracking search optimization algorithm is used to find the optimal frequency band and the optimal combination of frequency band and time segment. The former is searched by a frequency window with changing width of which starting and ending points are selected by the backtracking optimization algorithm; the latter is searched by the same frequency window and an additional time window with fixed width. The three parameters, the starting and ending points of frequency window and the starting point of time window, are jointly optimized by the backtracking search optimization algorithm. Based on the chosen frequency band and fixed or chosen time segment, the same feature extraction is conducted by CSP and subsequent classification is carried out by Fisher discriminant analysis. The classification error rate is used as the objective function of the backtracking search optimization algorithm. The two methods, named BSA-F CSP and BSA-FT CSP, were evaluated on data set of BCI competition and compared with traditional wideband (8-30 Hz) CSP. The classification results showed that backtracking search optimization algorithm can find much effective frequency band for EEG preprocessing compared to traditional broadband, substantially enhancing CSP performance in terms of classification accuracy. On the other hand, the backtracking search optimization algorithm for joint selection of frequency band and time segment can find their optimal combination, and thus can further improve classification rates.

Six spatial vibrotactile stimulus patterns are applied to entire back and limbs of a user. The aim of the current project is to validate an effectiveness of the vibrotactile stimulus patterns for BCI purposes and to establish a novel concept of tactile modality communication link, which shall help locked-in syndrome (LIS) patients, who lose their sight and hearing due to sensory disabilities. We define this approach as a full-body BCI (fbBCI) and we conduct psychophysical stimulus evaluation and realtime EEG response classification experiments with ten healthy body-able users. The grand mean averaged psychophysical stimulus pattern recognition accuracy have resulted at 9 8 : 1 8 %, whereas the realtime EEG accuracy at 5 3 : 6 7 %.

Detecting such spikes is crucial for diagnosing epilepsy. In this paper, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting spikes in EEG of epileptic patients in an automated fashion. The CNN has a convolutional architecture with filters of various sizes applied to the input layer, leaky ReLUs as activation functions, and a sigmoid output layer. Balanced mini-batches were applied to handle the imbalance in the data set. Leave-one-patient-out cross-validation was carried out to test the CNN and benchmark models on EEG data of five epilepsy patients. We achieved 0.947 AUC for the CNN, while the best performing benchmark model, Support Vector Machines with Gaussian kernel, achieved an AUC of 0.912.

Based on the established -neuroscientifically sound- concepts of brainwave frequency bands, activation asymmetry index and cross-frequency-coupling (CFC), we introduce a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system that automatically assigns a rating score to the listened song. Our research operated in two distinct stages: (i) a generic feature engineering stage, in which features from signal-analytics were ranked and selected based on their ability to associate music induced perturbations in brainwaves with listener's appraisal of music.

J	Minguillon, J; Lopez-Gordo, MA; Pelayo, F				Minguillon, Jesus; Angel Lopez-Gordo, M.; Pelayo, Francisco			Detection of attention in multi-talker scenarios: A fuzzy approach	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; EEG, attention detection model; Multi-talker attention detection; Fuzzy	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION; DESIGN; LOGIC; BCI; SYSTEMS; POTENTIALS; HUMANS	The automatic and online detection of auditory attention in multi-talker scenarios (e.g., cocktail party paradigm) is a current topic in electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Recent works have demonstrated a way to make it possible by means of a model based on an m-ary phase shift keying (m-PSK) detector. However, this attention detection model lacks of relevant information such as the non-stationary nature of EEG signals, the neuro-plasticity/habituation effects or the nonlinearities of the attention. In this paper we propose an enriched version of the attention detection model constituted by an automatic adaptive m-PSK detector implemented on fuzzy logic. In it, the relevant information mentioned before is modeled as two inputs that feed the fuzzy-based attention detection model. The output provides the detection. Our enriched model outperformed the results of previous works in terms of mean information transfer rate (ITR) (4-PSK: 5.41 bpm; 6-PSK: 6.03 bpm) and accuracy (4-PSK: 0.54; 6-PSK: 0.39) after only 4.63 (4-PSK) and 2.93 (6-PSK) seconds of processing. The proposed model for the automatic detection of auditory attention can have relevant impact on several areas such as education, public transport, jobs, industry, attention disorders, ubiquitous systems, sports and art.

ADASYN method was employed to create a balanced version of the DEAP EEG dataset. Experiments considered Support Vector Machine classifiers trained with HOC and PSD features to predict valence and arousal affective dimensions. Using signals from only four channels (Fp1, Fp2, F3 and F4) we obtained, after balancing, accuracies of 98% (valence) and 99% (arousal) for subject dependent experiments with three classes, and 85% (valence) and 87% (arousal) for two-class classification. However, accuracies for subject independent experiments were lower than the ones obtained using imbalanced datasets. We obtained accuracies of 52% (valence) and of 49% (arousal) for two classes, and accuracies of 36% (valence) and of 31% (arousal) for three classes. To explain the low accuracies in subject independent experiments, we present arguments and empirical evidence using correlations between the percentage of samples for each class and the accuracies obtained by approaches which did not use balanced. datasets.

However, emotions can trigger some small changes in blood flow with an impact on skin temperature. In the present research we use EEG and a thermal camera to determine the emotional profile of a user submitted to a set of emotional pictures. Six experiments were performed to study the thermal reactions to emotions, and in each experiment, 80 selected standard stimuli pictures of 20 various emotional profiles from IAPS (a database of emotional images) were displayed to participants every three seconds. An infrared camera and EEG were used to capture both thermal pictures of participants and their electrical brain activities. We used several area of the face to train a classifier for emotion recognition using Machine Learning models. Results indicate that some specific areas are more significant than others to show a change in temperature. These changes are also slower than with the EEG signal. Two methods were used to train the HMM, one is training classifier per the participant self data (participant-independent), another is training classifier based on all participants thermal data (participant-dependent). The result showed the later method brings more accuracy emotion recognition.

Multiresolution analysis (MRA) has useful properties for signal analysis in both temporal and spectral analysis, and has been broadly used in the BCI field. However, MRA usually increases the dimensionality of the input data. Therefore, some approaches to feature selection or feature dimensionality reduction should be considered for improving the performance of the MRA based BCI. Methods: This paper investigates feature selection in the MRA-based frameworks for BCI. Several wrapper approaches to evolutionary multiobjective feature selection are proposed with different structures of classifiers. They are evaluated by comparing with baseline methods using sparse representation of features or without feature selection. Results and conclusion: The statistical analysis, by applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff and Kruskal-Wallis tests to the means of the Kappa values evaluated by using the test patterns in each approach, has demonstrated some advantages of the proposed approaches. In comparison with the baseline MRA approach used in previous studies, the proposed evolutionary multiobjective feature selection approaches provide similar or even better classification performances, with significant reduction in the number of features that need to be computed.

More importantly, the screening of AUD patients has been challenging due to the subjectivity imparted by self-test reports. Automated methods involving neuroimaging modality such as quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) have shown promising research results. However, the QEEG methods were developed only for alcohol dependents (AD) and healthy controls. Therefore, this study sought to propose a machine learning (ML) method to classify 1) between alcohol abusers and healthy controls, and 2) among healthy controls, alcohol abusers, and alcoholics. The proposed ML method involved QEEG feature "extraction, selection of most relevant features, and classification of the study participants into their relevant groups. The study participants such as 12 alcohol abusers (mean age 56.70 +/- 15.33 years), 18 alcoholics (mean age 46.80 +/- 9.29 years), and 15 healthy controls (mean 42.67 +/- 15.90 years) were recruited to acquire EEG data. The data were recorded during 10 minutes of eyes closed (EC) and eyes open (EO) conditions. Furthermore, the EEG data were utilized to extract QEEG features such as absolute power (AP) and relative power (RP). Methods such as t-test and principal component analysis (PCA) were employed to select most relevant QEEG features. Finally, the discriminant QEEG features were used as inputs to the classification models: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer back-Propagation Network (MLP), and Logistic Model Trees (LMT), supported by 10-fold cross validation. As results, the LMT has achieved best performance rendering a classification accuracy (96%), sensitivity (97%) and specificity (93%). In addition, a further classification for each subgroup of AUD patients has achieved accuracy (> 90%). In conclusion, the results implicated significant neurophysiological differences among alcohol abusers, alcoholics, and controls. Moreover, the AUD patients exhibited significantly decreased theta as compared with the healthy controls. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These are multi-modular computer systems designed to deal with large and fast spatio/spectro temporal data using spiking neural networks (SNN) as major processing modules. ECOS and eSTDM in particular can learn incrementally from data streams, can include 'on the fly' new input variables, new output class labels or regression outputs, can continuously adapt their structure and functionality, can be visualised and interpreted for new knowledge discovery and for a better understanding of the data and the processes that generated it. eSTDM can be used for early event prediction due to the ability of the SNN to spike early, before whole input vectors (they were trained on) are presented. A framework for building eSTDM called NeuCube along with a design methodology for building eSTDM using this is presented. The implementation of this framework in MATLAB, Java, and PyNN (Python) is presented. The latter facilitates the use of neuromorphic hardware platforms to run the eSTDM. Selected examples are given of eSTDM for pattern recognition and early event prediction on EEG data, fMRI data, multisensory seismic data, ecological data, climate data, audio-visual data. Future directions are discussed, including extension of the NeuCube framework for building neurogenetic eSTDM and also new applications of eSTDM. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The meditation practice changes the attentional allocation in the human brain to visualize this; statistical features are carefully calculated from different wavelet coefficients to categorize two diverse groups (i.e. Meditators and Non-Meditators). The entire time series of EEG data divided into overlapping segments, and statistical parameters calculated for each of these segments. Instead of using all the data points, we used only a few higher order statistical measures such as variance, kurtosis, relative band energy, Shannon entropy, and Renyi entropy obtained from the data segments. A standard clustering technique, i.e. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) used to get the distinct pattern from the statistical features in EEG. In this paper, we presented a clustering paradigm that used for the pattern analysis between meditators and non-meditators. We measured the EEG signal using 64 channels, with some peripheral physiological measures. 23 participants with varying experience in meditation practice and ten non- meditators (control group) are considered to visualize underlying clusters within the statistical features.

Detecting the shift of covert visuospatial attention (CVSA) is vital for gaze-independent brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which might be the only communication approach for severely disabled patients who cannot move their eyes. Although previous studies had demonstrated that it is feasible to use CVSA-related electroencephalography (EEG) features to control a BCI system, the communication speed remains very low. This study aims to improve the speed and accuracy of CVSA detection by fusing EEG features of N2pc and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP). Approach. A new paradigm was designed to code the left and right CVSA with the N2pc and SSVEP features, which were then decoded by a classification strategy based on canonical correlation analysis. Eleven subjects were recruited to perform an offline experiment in this study. Temporal waves, amplitudes, and topographies for brain responses related to N2pc and SSVEP were analyzed. The classification accuracy derived from the hybrid EEG features (SSVEP and N2pc) was compared with those using the single EEG features (SSVEP or N2pc). Main results. The N2pc could be significantly enhanced under certain conditions of SSVEP modulations. The hybrid EEG features achieved significantly higher accuracy than the single features. It obtained an average accuracy of 72.9% by using a data length of 400 ms after the attention shift. Moreover, the average accuracy reached similar to 80% (peak values above 90%) when using 2 s long data. Significance. The results indicate that the combination of N2pc and SSVEP is effective for fast detection of CVSA. The proposed method could be a promising approach for implementing a gaze-independent BCI.

Multisession, noninvasive closed-loop neuroprosthetic control of grasping by upper limb amputees	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES: LAB EXPERIMENTS TO REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS	Progress in Brain Research		English	Review; Book Chapter						Brain-machine interfaces; Grasping; Electroencephalography; Amputee	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; MACHINE INTERFACE; PRIMARY MOTOR; PROSTHETIC DEVICES; CORTICAL CONTROL; HAND; REACH; MOVEMENT; KINEMATICS	Upper limb amputation results in a severe reduction in the quality of life of affected individuals due to their inability to easily perform activities of daily living. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) that translate grasping intent from the brain's neural activity into prosthetic control may increase the level of natural control currently available in myoelectric prostheses. Current BMI techniques demonstrate accurate arm position and single degree-of-freedom grasp control but are invasive and require daily recalibration. In this study we tested if transradial amputees (A1 and A2) could control grasp preshaping in a prosthetic device using a noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG)-based closed-loop BMI system. Participants attempted to grasp presented objects by controlling two grasping synergies, in 12 sessions performed over 5 weeks. Prior to closed-loop control, the first six sessions included a decoder calibration phase using action observation by the participants; thereafter, the decoder was fixed to examine neuroprosthetic performance in the absence of decoder recalibration. Ability of participants to control the prosthetic was measured by the success rate of grasping; ie, the percentage of trials within a session in which presented objects were successfully grasped. Participant A1 maintained a steady success rate (63 +/- 3%) across sessions (significantly above chance [41 +/- 5%] for 11 sessions). Participant A2, who was under the influence of pharmacological treatment for depression, hormone imbalance, pain management (for phantom pain as well as shoulder joint inflammation), and drug dependence, achieved a success rate of 32 +/- 2% across sessions (significantly above chance [27 +/- 5%] in only two sessions). EEG signal quality was stable across sessions, but the decoders created during the first six sessions showed variation, indicating EEG features relevant to decoding at a smaller timescale (100 ms) may not be stable. Overall, our results show that (a) an EEG-based BMI for grasping is a feasible strategy for further investigation of prosthetic control by amputees, and (b) factors that may affect brain activity such as medication need further examination to improve accuracy and stability of BMI performance.

J	Halme, HL; Parkkonen, L				Halme, Hanna-Leena; Parkkonen, Lauri			Comparing Features for Classification of MEG Responses to Motor Imagery	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EEG; BCI; MOVEMENT; SOFTWARE; NEUROFEEDBACK; EXECUTION; PATTERNS; FILTERS; SIGNAL	Background Motor imagery (MI) with real-time neurofeedback could be a viable approach, e.g., in rehabilitation of cerebral stroke. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) noninvasively measures electric brain activity at high temporal resolution and is well-suited for recording oscillatory brain signals. MI is known to modulate 10-and 20-Hz oscillations in the somatomotor system. In order to provide accurate feedback to the subject, the most relevant MI-related features should be extracted from MEG data. In this study, we evaluated several MEG signal features for discriminating between left-and right-hand MI and between MI and rest. Methods MEG was measured from nine healthy participants imagining either left-or right-hand finger tapping according to visual cues. Data preprocessing, feature extraction and classification were performed offline. The evaluated MI-related features were power spectral density (PSD), Morlet wavelets, short-time Fourier transform (STFT), common spatial patterns (CSP), filter-bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP), spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD), and combined SSD+ CSP, CSP+ PSD, CSP+ Morlet, and CSP+ STFT. We also compared four classifiers applied to single trials using 5-fold cross-validation for evaluating the classification accuracy and its possible dependence on the classification algorithm. In addition, we estimated the inter-session left-vs-right accuracy for each subject. Results The SSD+ CSP combination yielded the best accuracy in both left-vs-right (mean 73.7%) and MI-vs-rest (mean 81.3%) classification. CSP+ Morlet yielded the best mean accuracy in inter-session left-vs-right classification (mean 69.1%). There were large inter-subject differences in classification accuracy, and the level of the 20-Hz suppression correlated significantly with the subjective MI-vs-rest accuracy. Selection of the classification algorithm had only a minor effect on the results. Conclusions We obtained good accuracy in sensor-level decoding of MI from single-trial MEG data. Feature extraction methods utilizing both the spatial and spectral profile of MI-related signals provided the best classification results, suggesting good performance of these methods in an online MEG neurofeedback system.

It has been shown that Electroencephalogram (EEG) can be used as a trait for biometric systems. Previous studies have reported proper channels and features in resting states and mental tasks. However, since EEG signal is sensitive to emotion, the stability of reported features during emotional states is not well verified. Our goal is to investigate channels and features which have stable results regardless of emotional states. To this end, three experiments were designed: 'training' and 'testing' an identification system with 1) mixture of emotional states; 2) the same specific emotional states; 3) different emotional states. 1728 features were extracted which later construct the feature vector of each subject and then Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to classify the subjects. After selecting 5 best features, the Correct Classification Rate (CCR) is in the range of 88% to 99% for 3 experiments. Moreover, we found that features extracted from Gamma frequency band in Left-Posterior quarter of the brain have more stable and reliable information for human identification, regardless of emotional states, comparing to other features.

Enhancing perceptrons with contrastive biclusters	ELECTRONICS LETTERS			English	Article							EEG SIGNAL CLASSIFICATION; EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS	An enhanced perceptron model, referred to as BicNeuron (BN), which is based on the novel concept of contrastive biclusters is investigated. According to this viewpoint, a coherent bicluster (i.e. a subset of data patterns showing high similarity across a particular subset of features) belonging to one class is required to show high discrimination from the nearest patterns of the other class when projected on the same feature set. On each local subspace associated with a different pair of contrastive biclusters a perceptron is induced and the model with highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value is selected as the final classifier. Experiments involving the discrimination of epileptic and non-epileptic electroencephalogram (EEG) signals show that the BN approach can be very useful, prevailing significantly on standard and kernel perceptrons in terms of classification accuracy.

This study investigates the classification performances of the same upper limb motor movements using various kernel functions of the support vector machine (SVM). Polynomial, linear and radial basis (RBF) functions were utilized on a dataset of seven able-bodied individuals. The results obtained showed that the RBF kernel function provided superior classification performance compared with the other kernel functions for these specific tasks. The presented approach is promising for implementing mental task classification, especially for identification of the same upper limb movements.

To date, these trials have been carried out with several different types of recording interfaces. The success of these devices has varied widely, but different factors such as the level of invasiveness, timescale of recorded information, and ability to maintain stable functionality of the device over a long period of time all must be considered in addition to accuracy in decoding intent when assessing the most practical type of device moving forward. Here, we discuss various approaches to BCIs, distinguishing between devices focusing on control of operations extrinsic to the subject (e.g., prosthetic limbs, computer cursors) and those focusing on control of operations intrinsic to the brain (e.g., using stimulation or external feedback), including closed loop or adaptive devices. In this discussion, we consider the current challenges facing the translation of various types of BCI technology to eventual human application.

However, the most proper filter band can hardly be determined manually due to its subject-specific property. This study introduces a sparse support vector machine (SSVM) approach to implement simultaneous CSP feature selection and classification for MI-based brain-computer interface (BCI). In SSVM, CSP features are first extracted on multiple signals that are filtered from raw EEG data at a set of overlapping subbands. SVM with l1-norm regularization is then proposed to classify MI tasks with automatic selection of filter bands giving the significant CSP features. The effectiveness of SSVM for MI classification is demonstrated on the BCI Competition III dataset IVa, in comparison with several other competing methods. Experimental results indicate that the proposed SSVM method is promising for development of an improved MI-based BCI.

We start by describing the classic motor imagery approach, its application in tetraplegic end users, and the significant improvements achieved using coadaptive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). These strategies have the drawback of not mirroring the way one plans a movement. To achieve a more natural control-and to reduce the training time-the movements decoded by the BCI need to be closely related to the user's intention. Within this natural control, we focus on the kinematic level, where movement direction and hand position or velocity can be decoded from noninvasive recordings. First, we review movement execution decoding studies, where we describe the decoding algorithms, their performance, and associated features. Second, we describe the major findings in movement imagination decoding, where we emphasize the importance of estimating the sources of the discriminative features. Third, we introduce movement target decoding, which could allow the determination of the target without knowing the exact movement-by-movement details. Aside from the kinematic level, we also address the goal level, which contains relevant information on the upcoming action. Focusing on hand-object interaction and action context dependency, we discuss the possible impact of some recent neurophysiological findings in the future of BCI control. Ideally, the goal and the kinematic decoding would allow an appropriate matching of the BCI to the end users' needs, overcoming the limitations of the classic motor imagery approach.

However, not all of these properties are equally relevant in a given situation. In this study, we applied multivariate classification algorithms to intracranial electroencephalography data of human epilepsy patients performing an auditory Stroop task. This allowed us to identify neuronal representations of task-relevant and irrelevant pitch and semantic information of spoken words in a subset of patients. When properties were relevant, representations could be detected after about 350 ms after stimulus onset. When irrelevant, the association with gamma power differed for these properties. Patients with more reliable representations of irrelevant pitch showed increased gamma band activity (35-64 Hz), suggesting that attentional resources allow an increase in gamma power in some but not all patients. This effect was not observed for irrelevant semantics, possibly because the more automatic processing of this property allowed for less variation in free resources. Processing of different properties of the same stimulus seems therefore to be dependent on the characteristics of the property. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[van de Nieuwenhuijzen, M.

Epilepsy seizures are the consequence of the transient electrical aggravation of the cerebrum. Around 50 million individuals worldwide have epilepsy, and around two out of every three new cases are found in developing nations. Epilepsy can happen at any age. The identification is conceivable by investigating Electro-encephalogram (EEG) signals. This paper, introduces a procedure for processing EEG signals for distinguishing proof of epilepsy seizure. Proposed framework is mix of multi-wavelet change and machine learning system. Rough Time and frequency domain calculation is upgraded (called as Improved Approximate Time and frequency domain so as to calculate irregularities which exist in EEG signals. The present strategy is performed and is compared with the current methodology, in view of factors such as affectability, specificity, and exactness parameters. Precision has been observed at approximately 93%.

We can also capture epileptic seizures that are caused by a disruption in the working of brain, by the Electro Encephalogram Test. These electric signals are to be captured by small electrodes placed on human scalp using a standard 10/20 system on an Electro Encephalograph monitor. In this work, we will predict the state of eye (open or closed) by exploring 13 machine learning models on a 15 features dataset of an EEG test. The records of 14 electrodes are used for this prediction. Results are evaluated using 6 different machine learning parameters i.e. Sensitivity, Confusion matrix, Kappa value, Specificity, Accuracy and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve. K-fold validation and ensembling of models will be done on best three predictive models pertaining to our dataset.

However, most of the sensor-space approaches that study sensorimotor rhythms using EEG do not reveal the underlying neurophysiological phenomenon while executing or imagining the movement with finer control. Therefore, there is a need to examine feature extraction techniques in the cortical source space which can provide more information about the task compared to sensor-space. In this study, we extend the traditional sensor-space feature extraction method, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), to the source space, using various regularization approaches. We use Weighted Minimum Norm Estimate (wMNE) as a source localization technique. We show that for a multi-direction hand movement classification problem, the source space features can result in an increase of over 10% accuracy compared to sensor space features. Fisher's Linear Discriminant (FLD) classifier with the One-versus-rest approach is used for the classification.

In this paper, we study the extraction of features using event-related desynchronization/synchronization techniques to improve the classification accuracy for three-class motor imagery (MI) BCI. The classification approach is based on combining the features of the phase and amplitude of the brain signals using fast Fourier transform (FFT) and autoregressive (AR) modeling of the reconstructed phase space as well as the modification of the BCI parameters (trial length, trial frequency band, classification method). We report interesting results compared with those present in the literature by utilizing sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) and a multi-class linear discriminant analysis (LDA), our findings showed superior classification results, a classification accuracy of 86.06% and 93% for two BCI competition datasets, with respect to results from previous studies.

The practical electroencephalogram (EEG) measurement is always time-varying and fluctuating so that conventional statistical techniques are not adequate for analyses. This study proposes a new scheme based on fingerprinting to analyze the EEG. Fingerprinting is a technique of probabilistic pattern recognition used in electrical engineering, very like the identification of human fingerprinting in a criminal investigation. The goal of this study was to assess whether subjective preference for pictures could be manifested physiologically by EEG fingerprinting analyses. The most important advantage of the fingerprinting technique is that it does not require accurate measurement. Instead, it uses probabilistic classification. Participants' preference for pictures can be assessed using fingerprinting analyses of physiological EEG measurements.

The EEG signal, however, is often recorded from patients with epilepsy for a long period of time, and thus detection and identification of EDs have been a burden on medical doctors. This paper proposes a new method for automatic identification of two types of EDs, repeated sharp-waves (sharps), and runs of sharp-and-slow-waves (SSWs), which helps to pinpoint epileptogenic foci in secondary generalized epilepsy such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). In the experiments with iEEG data acquired from a patient with LGS, our proposed method detected EDs with an accuracy of 93.76% and classified three different signal patterns with a mean classification accuracy of 87.69%, which was significantly higher than that of a conventional wavelet-based method. Our study shows that it is possible to successfully detect and discriminate sharps and SSWs from background EEG activity using our proposed method.

Evaluating decoding performance of upper limb imagined trajectories during center-out reaching tasks	2016 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 09-12, 2016	Budapest, HUNGARY	IEEE			BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC SIGNALS; EEG; MOVEMENTS	In recent years, several studies have shown that there is a correlation between electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and hand-reaching kinematic parameters after applying linear decoders. These studies have been generally conducted using actual upper limb movements, but so far there has been little discussion about the possibility of applying these decoders to motor imagery tasks. Moreover, the use of these decoders is rather controversial and there is no general agreement about the metrics used to compare decoded and real kinematics. In this paper, we have applied this methodology to upper limb imagined movements using a center-out protocol. Our results show that, although decoding performance is poor, there are significant components, particularly in horizontal imagined movements, that could be translated into reliable output commands. For this purpose, we have proposed a discrete classification of reached targets showing significant classification rates when the number of classified targets decreases.

A Dynamic Channel Selection Algorithm for the Classification of EEG and EMG Data	2016 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	JUL 24-29, 2016	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Int Nueral Network Soc, Evolutionary Programming Soc, IET, IEEE BigData, Gulf Univ Sci & Technol			PATTERN-RECOGNITION; ACCURACY	The multichannel nature of EEG and EMG data poses a big challenge to the development of automatic EEG/EMG analysis and classification systems. Due to the "curse of dimensionality" problem, the analysis and classification of several channels may not lead to the desired performance. Accordingly, a number of algorithms have been proposed to identify small "static" subsets of channels that are capable of differentiating between samples of different classes. However, the identification of small subsets of relevant channels may not always be possible, where for certain applications the smaller the number of channels the less chance that sufficient information is provided. We propose in this paper a dynamic channel selection algorithm that identifies a channel (or a subset of channels) for each time segment of the signal that is relevant to the class of that particular time segment. To achieve this, we embraced the dynamic classifier selection methodology, and particularly the multiple classifier behaviour approach. Each EEG/EMG channel can be chosen to represent a certain unseen time segment of the signal based on the performance, or local accuracy, of its nearest neighbours in the set of training time segments. Results obtained using EEG data of a four-class alertness state classification problem reveal that the proposed approach is capable of achieving competitive performance compared to a traditional static channel selection based method. The algorithm also produced very encouraging results when used to classify EMG data collected from nine transradial amputees performing six classes of movements.

Spatial filtering such as Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and its variants are commonly used for this task. However, CSP effectiveness depends on the subject-specific frequency band. Even by optimally selecting a subject-specific frequency band, this method still fails for some subjects. On the other hand, some studies suggest that temporal features may discriminate classes more efficiently. This work proposes a hybrid method based on elastic net and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operator (LASSO) to optimally select between spatial and temporal features. This algorithm uses joint spatial and temporal features followed by an optimal combined feature selection scheme for each subject. Results show significant improvement for subjects whose spatial features failed to produce acceptable results and overall improvement over the combined data.

Recently, the emotion recognition technology using electroencephalogram (EEG) has become the foremost consideration of researchers compared with others using voice, facial image, bio-signal, and etc. However, the recognition and assumption of an emotion condition based on direct EEG face a challenge due to its characteristics, namely noise, non-stationary, and non-linear. Therefore, a further appropriate algorithm for feature extraction is more desirable to classify the emotion state from EEG data. In this paper, a multiclass-common spatial patterns (Multi-CSP) is proposed to extract the features with respect to each emotional state. Then, support vector machine (SVM) model is set up to classify these features of emotional state for the rage control. The experimental results show that the proposed feature extraction method, Multi-CSP, performs higher classification accuracy than the popular feature extraction methods.

The degree of disability of these individuals could potentially be reduced by using robotic devices that assist their movements in activities of daily living. One approach to control such robotic systems is the use of a brain-computer interface, which detects the user's intention. This study proposes a method for estimating the user's intention using electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. The proposed method is capable of discriminating rest from various imagined arm movements, including grasping and elbow flexion. The features extracted from EEG signals are autoregressive model coefficients, root-mean-square amplitude, and waveform length. Support vector machine was used as a classifier, distinguishing class labels corresponding to rest and imagined arm movements. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using cross-validation. Average accuracies of 91.8 +/- A 5.8 and 90 +/- A 4.1 % were obtained for distinguishing rest versus grasping and rest versus elbow flexion. The results show that the proposed scheme provides 18.9, 17.1, and 16.5 % higher classification accuracies for distinguishing rest versus grasping and 21.9, 17.6, and 18.1 % higher classification accuracies for distinguishing rest versus elbow flexion compared with those obtained using filter bank common spatial pattern, band power, and common spatial pattern methods, respectively, which are widely used in the literature.

In particular, to classify the state of the complete sensor network, machine learning models are needed, which are capable of fusing the information from multiple sensors. In this paper we examine the use of tensor models to describe the relationship between multiple discrete sensor outputs and attendant class labels describing the overall system state. Tensor decompositions can be considered as a form of representation learning and they have been used for a variety of tasks, e. g. knowledge graph modeling and EEG data analysis. We propose a new approach for multiclass classification using tensor decompositions. As the dimensions of the tensors used in the multi-sensor classification are much higher than in traditional tasks, not all standard decomposition approaches are applicable due to scaling problems. In our experiments on real data, we show that the PARAFAC and Tensor Train decompositions work well for discrete multi-sensor fusion tasks and outperform other stateof- the-art machine learning algorithms.

Recently, the passive and automatic extraction of additional information regarding the psychological state of users from neurophysiological signals has gained increased attention in the interdisciplinary field of affective computing. We investigated how well specific emotional reactions, induced by auditory stimuli, can be detected in EEG recordings. We introduce an auditory emotion induction paradigm based on the International Affective Digitized Sounds 2nd Edition (IADS-2) database also suitable for disabled individuals. Stimuli are grouped in three valence categories: unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant. Significant differences in time domain domain event-related potentials are found in the electroencephalogram (EEG) between unpleasant and neutral, as well as pleasant and neutral conditions over midline electrodes. Time domain data were classified in three binary classification problems using a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We discuss three classification performance measures in the context of affective computing and outline some strategies for conducting and reporting affect classification studies.

However, diagnosis of the depression is still greatly depended on the questionnaires. Hence, this project is aimed to implement the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method to outcome a software based method to determine a subject's depression condition. EEG device was used to measure the brain waves of the subjects. The raw EEG data was used on Neural Network for training through the implementation of pattern classification network where the input of the network and the outputs of the network are depressive and non-depressive categories. From the result, it is found that 10 hidden layers Scaled Conjugate Gradient algorithm (trainscg) with inputs data from electrode C3 and C4, providing the result with 95% efficiency where out of 20 tester samples, 19 were detected correctly by the algorithm.

As epileptic EEG signals contain huge fluctuating information about the functional behavior of the brain, it is hard to distinguish the fundamental dynamic, complex network of EEG signals without considering the strength among the nodes as they are connected with each other on the basis of these strengths. The prior research on natural visibility graph did not consider this issue in epileptic seizure, although it is a very important key point to have representative information from the signals. Hence, this paper aims to introduce a new idea for epilepsy detection using complex network statistical properties by measuring different strengths of the edges in natural visibility graph theory, which is considered as weight. Thus, the proposed method is named "weighted visibility graph". In this proposed method, first, the epileptic EEG signals are transformed into complex network and then two important statistical properties of a network such as modularity and average weighted degree used for extracting the imperative characteristics from a network of EEG signals. After that, the extracted features are evaluated by two modern machine-learning classifiers such as, support vector machine with a different kernel function and k-nearest neighbor. The experimental results demonstrate that the combined effect of both features is valuable for network metrics to characterize the EEG time series signals in case of weighted complex network generating up to 100% classification accuracy.

J	Sturm, I; Lapuschkin, S; Samek, W; Muller, KR				Sturm, Irene; Lapuschkin, Sebastian; Samek, Wojciech; Mueller, Klaus-Robert			Interpretable deep neural networks for single-trial EEG classification	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Brain-computer interfacing; Neural networks; Interpretability		Background: In cognitive neuroscience the potential of deep neural networks (DNNs) for solving complex classification tasks is yet to be fully exploited. The most limiting factor is that DNNs as notorious 'black boxes' do not provide insight into neurophysiological phenomena underlying a decision. Layer wise relevance propagation (LRP) has been introduced as a novel method to explain individual network decisions. New method: We propose the application of DNNs with LRP for the first time for EEG data analysis. Through LRP the single-trial DNN decisions are transformed into heatmaps indicating each data point's relevance for the outcome of the decision. Results: DNN achieves classification accuracies comparable to those of CSP-LDA. In subjects with low performance subject-to-subject transfer of trained DNNs can improve the results. The single-trial LRP heatmaps reveal neurophysiologically plausible patterns, resembling CSP-derived scalp maps. Critically, while CSP patterns represent class-wise aggregated information, LRP heatmaps pinpoint neural patterns to single time points in single trials. Comparison with existing method(s): We compare the classification performance of DNNs to that of linear CSP-LDA on two data sets related to motor-imaginary BCI. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that DNN is a powerful non-linear tool for EEG analysis. With LRP a new quality of high-resolution assessment of neural activity can be reached. LRP is a potential remedy for the lack of interpretability of DNNs that has limited their utility in neuroscientific applications. The extreme specificity of the LRP-derived heatmaps opens up new avenues for investigating neural activity underlying complex perception or decision-related processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We present CoSMoMVPA, a lightweight MVPA (MVP analysis) toolbox implemented in the intersection of the Matlab and GNU Octave languages, that treats both fMRI and M/EEG data as first-class citizens. CoSMoMVPA supports all state-of-the-art MVP analysis techniques, including searchlight analyses, classification, correlations, representational similarity analysis, and the time generalization method. These can be used to address both data-driven and hypothesis-driven questions about neural organization and representations, both within and across: space, time, frequency bands, neuroimaging modalities, individuals, and species. It uses a uniform data representation of fMRI data in the volume or on the surface, and of M/EEG data at the sensor and source level. Through various external toolboxes, it directly supports reading and writing a variety of fMRI and M/EEG neuroimaging formats, and, where applicable, can convert between them. As a result, it can be integrated readily in existing pipelines and used with existing preprocessed datasets. CoSMoMVPA overloads the traditional volumetric searchlight concept to support neighborhoods for M/EEG and surface-based fMRI data, which supports localization of multivariate effects of interest across space, time, and frequency dimensions. CoSMoMVPA also provides a generalized approach to multiple comparison correction across these dimensions using Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement with state-of-the-art clustering and permutation techniques. CoSMoMVPA is highly modular and uses abstractions to provide a uniform interface for a variety of MVP measures. Typical analyses require a few lines of code, making it accessible to beginner users. At the same time, expert programmers can easily extend its functionality. CoSMoMVPA comes with extensive documentation, including a variety of runnable demonstration scripts and analysis exercises (with example data and solutions). It uses best software engineering practices including version control, distributed development, an automated test suite, and continuous integration testing.

However, all these models may not be able to offer good performance for various applications and it is found to be problem dependent. Therefore, the objective of this study is to combine all the associated features from the existing models before selecting the best combination of features. A new optimization algorithm, namely as angle modulated simulated Kalman filter (AMSKF) will be employed as feature selector. Also, the neural network random weight method is utilized in the proposed AMSKF technique as a classifier. In the conducted experiment, 11,781 samples of peak candidate are employed in this study for the validation purpose. The samples are collected from three different peak event-related EEG signals of 30 healthy subjects; (1) single eye blink, (2) double eye blink, and (3) eye movement signals. The experimental results have shown that the proposed AMSKF feature selector is able to find the best combination of features and performs at par with the existing related studies of epileptic EEG events classification.

Daily periodicity of epileptic seizures has been known for over a century. The diurnal patterns of epileptic seizures have also been observed in studies. Aim: To investigate the sleep/wake cycle, day/night, and 24-h periodicity of various seizure subtypes and seizure onset localizations in children. Methods: We analyzed the clinical seizures of 170 consecutive epilepsy patients who underwent video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring over the last 5 years. Semiology of the seizures was classified according to the semiological seizure classification. Origin of the seizures was defined by the onset of ictal activity on EEG. Seizures were evaluated in terms of occurrence during the day (06:00-18:00 h) or night (18:00-06:00 h), in wakefulness or in sleep, and within a 3-h time interval throughout 24 h. Results: A total of 909 seizures were analyzed. Auras, dialeptic, myoclonic, hypomotor, atonic seizures, and epileptic spasms occurred more frequently in wakefulness; tonic, clonic, and hypermotor seizures occurred more frequently in sleep. Auras, dialeptic, and atonic seizures and epileptic spasms occurred more often during daytime; hypermotor seizures occurred more often at night. Generalized seizures were seen most frequently in wakefulness (between 12:00 and 18:00 h); frontal lobe seizures were seen at night and in sleep (between 24:00 and 03:00 h); temporal lobe seizures were seen in wakefulness (between 06:00 and 09:00 h and between 12:00 and 15:00 h); occipital seizures were seen during daytime and in wakefulness (between 09:00 and 12:00 h and between 15:00 and 18:00 h, respectively); parietal seizures were seen mostly during daytime. Conclusions: Seizures in children occur in specific circadian patterns and in specific sleep/wake distributions depending on seizure onset location and semiology.

The evidence has shown that visually guided motor imagery (MI) can modulate sensorimotor electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms in humans, but how to design and implement efficient visual guidance during MI in order to produce better event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns is still unclear. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of using object-oriented movements in a virtual environment as visual guidance on the modulation of sensorimotor EEG rhythms generated by hand MI. To improve the classification accuracy on MI, we further propose an algorithm to automatically extract subject-specific optimal frequency and time bands for the discrimination of ERD patterns produced by left and right hand MI. The experimental results show that the average classification accuracy of object-directed scenarios is much better than that of non-object-directed scenarios (76.87% vs. 69.66%). The result of the t-test measuring the difference between them is statistically significant (p = 0.0207). When compared to algorithms based on fixed frequency and time bands, contralateral dominant ERD patterns can be enhanced by using the subject-specific optimal frequency and the time bands obtained by our proposed algorithm. These findings have the potential to improve the efficacy and robustness of MI-based BCI applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Separable Common Spatio-Spectral Patterns for Motor Imagery BCI Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); common spatial patterns; matrix-variate Gaussian; spatio-spectral features; separability	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; COMPUTER; CLASSIFICATION; FILTERS; FEATURES; RHYTHMS	Objective: Feature extraction is one of the most important steps in any brain-computer interface (BCI) system. In particular, spatio-spectral feature extraction for motor-imagery BCIs (MI-BCI) has been the focus of several works in the past decade. This paper proposes a novel method, called separable common spatio-spectral patterns (SCSSP), for extraction of discriminant spatio-spectral EEG features in MI-BCIs. Methods: Assuming a binary classification problem, SCSSP uses a heteroscedastic matrix-variate Gaussian model for the multiband EEG rhythms, and seeks the spatio-spectral features whose variance is maximized for one brain task and minimized for the other task. Therefore, SCSSP can be considered as a spatio-spectral generalization of the conventional common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm. Results: The experimental results on two-class and multiclass motor-imagery data from publicly available BCI Competition datasets demonstrate that the proposed computationally efficient method competes closely with filter-bank CSP (FBCSP), and can even outperform the FBCSP if enough training data are available. Furthermore, SCSSP provides us with a simple measure for ranking the discriminant power of extracted spatio-spectral features, which is not possible in FBCSP. Conclusion: The matrix-variate Gaussian assumption allows the SCSSP method to jointly process the EEG data in both spatial and spectral domains. As a result, compared to the similar solutions in the literature such as FBCSP, the proposed SCSSP method requires significantly lower computations. Significance: The proposed computationally efficient spatio-spectral feature extractor is particularly suitable for applications in which the computational power is limited, such as emerging wearable mobile BCI systems.

One of the most practical approaches tackling this issue is to use ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) in which human cognitive state can he objectively estimated. However, the accurate recognition of CTL via single channel EEG with the lowest-intrusivity to task condition is particularly challenging as EEG is characterized by individual dependency and nonstationarity. In this paper, a deep learning model designed by Stacked Denoising AutoEncoder (SDAE) is employed on single EEG channel signal to estimate binary levels (low vs. high) of CTL. By adopting a simulated HM process control system, the operator EEG data for 8 healthy subjects under different task demands were collected on two experimental sessions across two consecutive days. Based on the computed full power spectral of EEG, the number of nodes in SADE is determined by greedy search according to the optimal training error of each layer. The shallow layers of the designed deep network are used to extract the subject-specific information related to CTL variation while the stable power features were reconstructed in those deep layers. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated to be effective and 74% classification rate across sessions in average of all subjects were achieved.

This new methodology is based on the novel synergy of Local Global Graph (LG graph) to characterize define the structural features of the EEG topography as a global descriptor for robust comparison of dominant topographies (microstates) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to model the topographic sequence in a unique way. In particular, the LG graph descriptor defines similarity and distance measures that can be successfully used for the difficult comparison of the extracted LG graphs in the presence of noise. In addition, hidden states represent periods of stationary distribution of topographies that constitute the equivalent of the microstates in the model. The transitions between the different microstates and the formed syntactic patterns can reveal differences in the processing of the input stimulus between different pathologies. We train the HMM model to learn the transitions between the different microstates and express the syntactic patterns that appear in the single trials in a compact and efficient way. We applied this methodology in single trials consisting of normal subjects and patients with Progressive Mild Cognitive Impairment (PMCI) to discriminate these two groups. The classification results show that this approach is capable to efficiently discriminate between control and Progressive MCI single trials. Results indicate that HMMs provide physiologically meaningful results that can be used in the syntactic analysis of Event Related Potentials.

Cross Subject Mental Work Load Classification from Electroencephalographic Signals with Automatic Artifact Rejection and Muscle Pruning	BRAIN INFORMATICS AND HEALTH	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Brain Informatics and Health (BIH)	OCT 13-16, 2016	Omaha, NE	Univ Nebraska, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Web Intelligence Consortium, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc Task Force Brain Informat				Purpose of this study was to understand the effect of automatic muscle pruning of electroencephalograph on cognitive work load prediction. Pruning was achieved using an automatic Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based component classification. Initially, raw data from EEG recording was used for prediction, this result was then compared with mental work load prediction results from muscle-pruned EEG data. This study used Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Linear Kernel for cognitive work load prediction from EEG data. Initial part of the study was to learn a classification model from the whole data, whereas the second part was to learn the model from a set of subjects and predict the mental work load for an unseen subject by the model. The experimental results show that an accuracy of nearly 100% is possible with ICA and automatic pruning based pre-processing. Cross subject prediction significantly improved from a mean accuracy of 54% to 69% for an unseen subject with the pre-processing.	[Kunjan, Sajeev; Lewis, T. W.; Grummett, T. S.; Powers, D. M.

For a seizure forecasting system to work effectively, computational algorithms must reliably identify periods with high probability of seizure occurrence. We herein report results of a classification approach based on machine learning of EEG features in the frequency domain and aimed at differentiating between pre-ictal (close to seizure onsets) and interictal (far away from seizures onset) periods in long-term intracranial EEG recordings from the brain of 5 epileptic dogs. Evaluation of performance by the area under the ROC curve ranged from 0.84 to 0.96 in four dogs, while for the fifth dog was considerably less (0.55), resulting to a global value of 0.87 across dogs. These results offer supporting evidence that seizures may be predictable with a proper analysis of the EEG.

However, the unpredictable burst interferences may significantly degrade the performance of ICA-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system. In this study, we proposed a new algorithm frame to address this issue by combining the single-trial-based ICA filter with zero-training classifier. We developed a two-round data selection method to identify automatically the badly corrupted EEG trials in the training set. The "high quality" training trials were utilized to optimize the ICA filter. In addition, we proposed an accuracy-matrix method to locate the artifact data segments within a single trial and investigated which types of artifacts can influence the performance of the ICA-based MIBCIs. Twenty-six EEG datasets of three-class motor imagery were used to validate the proposed methods, and the classification accuracies were compared with that obtained by frequently used common spatial pattern (CSP) spatial filtering algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed optimizing strategy could effectively improve the stability, practicality and classification performance of ICA-based MIBCI. The study revealed that rational use of ICA method may be crucial in building a practical ICA-based MIBCI system.

Differences between control and epileptic groups were determined for both GO and NOGO conditions. The analysis was performed on a set of 19-channel EEG cortical activity signals. We show that for the GO task, the highest brain activity in terms of the density of the CC networks is observed in alpha band for the control group while for the epileptic group the CC network seems disrupted as reflected by the small number of connections. For the NOGO task, the denser CC network was observed in theta band for the control group while widespread differences between the control and the epileptic group were located bilaterally at the left temporal-midline and parietal areas. In order to test the discriminative power of our analysis, we performed a pattern analysis approach based on fuzzy classification techniques. The performance of the classification scheme was evaluated using permutation tests. The analysis demonstrated that, on average, 87.6 % of the subjects were correctly classified in control and epileptic. Thus, our findings may provide a helpful insight on the mechanisms pertaining to the cognitive response of children with well controlled epilepsy and could potentially serve as "functional" biomarkers for early diagnosis.

This paper proposes an approach for multi-modal video-induced emotion recognition, based on facial expression and electroencephalogram (EEG) technologies. Spontaneous facial expression is utilized as an external channel. A new feature, formed by percentage of nine facial expressions, is proposed for analyzing the valence and arousal classes. Furthermore, EEG is used as an internal channel supplementing facial expressions for more reliable emotion recognition. Discriminative spectral power and spectral power difference features are exploited for EEG analysis. Finally, these two channels are fused on feature level and decision-level for multi-modal emotion recognition. Experiments are conducted on MAHNOB-HCI database, including 522 spontaneous facial expression videos and EEG signals from 27 participants. Moreover, human perception in emotion recognition compared to the proposed approach is tested with 10 volunteers. The experimental results and comparisons with the average human performance show the effectiveness of the proposed multi-modal approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is extremely crucial to have accurate automatic pattern recognition and data mining techniques to detect the onset of seizures and inform care-givers to help the patients. EEG signals are the preferred biosignals for diagnosis of epileptic patients. Most of the existing pattern recognition techniques used in EEG analysis leverage the notion of supervised machine learning algorithms. Since seizure data are heavily under-represented, such techniques are not always practical particularly when the labeled data is not sufficiently available or when disease progression is rapid and the corresponding EEG footprint pattern will not be robust. Furthermore, EEG pattern change is highly individual dependent and requires experienced specialists to annotate the seizure and non-seizure events. In this work, we present an unsupervised technique to discriminate seizures and non-seizures events. We employ power spectral density of EEG signals in different frequency bands that are informative features to accurately cluster seizure and non-seizure events. The experimental results tried so far indicate achieving more than 90% accuracy in clustering seizure and non-seizure events without having any prior knowledge on patient's history.

PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORK; EEG-SIGNALS; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; WAVELET TRANSFORM; FEATURE-SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; DIAGNOSIS; PREDICTABILITY	Pattern recognition strategies are applied for detecting epileptic abnormality from Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. So, in this work, it is applied for detecting epileptic abnormality from EEG signals of normal subjects and epileptic patients. In this paper, a novel pattern recognition is studied with statistical features derived from discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients D3-D5 and A5 to detect epileptic seizure abnormality using naive Bayes (NB) and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier for fourteen different combinations such as set A to D with set E. In this work, EEG data provided by University of Bonn, Germany, and Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), India are used. Using feature selection and feature ranking based on the estimation of mutual information, the significant features required for the classifier to get higher accuracy is obtained. It is found that NB performs better for 9 different data sets combination and k-NN performs well for 5 data sets. Further, NB achieves 100% classification accuracy (CA) in distinguishing normal eyes open and epileptic dataset and k-NN gives 100% accuracy with only top ranked 14 features in using CMCH data. This shows that proposed system has potential in developing automatic computer-aided epileptic seizure detection systems with lesser computation time to enhance the patient's care and quality of life.

Preparing Laboratory and Real-World EEG Data for Large-Scale Analysis: A Containerized Approach	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						EEG; BCI; large scale analysis; neuroinformatics	BRAIN; INFORMATICS; RESOURCE; PLATFORM; SIGNAL; MODEL	Large-scale analysis of EEG and other physiological measures promises new insights into brain processes and more accurate and robust brain computer interface models. However, the absence of standardized vocabularies for annotating events in a machine understandable manner, the welter of collection-specific data organizations, the difficulty in moving data across processing platforms, and the unavailability of agreed-upon standards for preprocessing have prevented large-scale analyses of EEG. Here we describe a "containerized" approach and freely available tools we have developed to facilitate the process of annotating, packaging, and preprocessing EEG data collections to enable data sharing, archiving, large-scale machine learning/data mining and (meta-)analysis. The EEG Study Schema (ESS) comprises three data "Levels," each with its own XML-document schema and file/folder convention, plus a standardized (PREP) pipeline to move raw (Data Level 1) data to a basic preprocessed state (Data Level 2) suitable for application of a large class of EEG analysis methods. Researchers can ship a study as a single unit and operate on its data using a standardized interface. ESS does not require a central database and provides all the metadata data necessary to execute a wide variety of EEG processing pipelines. The primary focus of ESS is automated in-depth analysis and meta-analysis EEG studies. However. ESS can also encapsulate meta-information for the other modalities such as eye tracking, that are increasingly used in both laboratory and real-world neuroimaging. ESS schema and tools are freely available at www.eegstudy.org and a central catalog of over 850 GB of existing data in ESS format is available at studycatalog.org. These tools and resources are part of a larger effort to enable data sharing at sufficient scale for researchers to engage in truly large-scale EEG analysis and data mining (BigEEG.org).

J	Ji, HF; Li, J; Lu, RR; Gu, R; Cao, L; Gong, XL				Ji, Hongfei; Li, Jie; Lu, Rongrong; Gu, Rong; Cao, Lei; Gong, Xiaoliang			EEG Classification for Hybrid Brain-Computer Interface Using a Tensor Based Multiclass Multimodal Analysis Scheme	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							BCI COMPETITION 2003; SINGLE TRIAL EEG; SSVEP; P300; SYSTEM; IIB	Electroencephalogram- (EEG-) based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems usually utilize one type of changes in the dynamics of brain oscillations for control, such as event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS), steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), and P300 evoked potentials. There is a recent trend to detect more than one of these signals in one system to create a hybrid BCI. However, in this case, EEG data were always divided into groups and analyzed by the separate processing procedures. As a result, the interactive effects were ignored when different types of BCI tasks were executed simultaneously. In this work, we propose an improved tensor based multiclass multimodal scheme especially for hybrid BCI, in which EEG signals are denoted as multiway tensors, a nonredundant rank-one tensor decomposition model is proposed to obtain nonredundant tensor components, a weighted fisher criterion is designed to select multimodal discriminative patterns without ignoring the interactive effects, and support vector machine (SVM) is extended to multiclass classification. Experiment results suggest that the proposed scheme can not only identify the different changes in the dynamics of brain oscillations induced by different types of tasks but also capture the interactive effects of simultaneous tasks properly. Therefore, it has great potential use for hybrid BCI.

J	Gao, V; Turek, F; Vitaterna, M				Gao, Vance; Turek, Fred; Vitaterna, Martha			Multiple classifier systems for automatic sleep scoring in mice	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Sleep; Sleep scoring; Autoscoring; Electroencephalogram; Mouse; Machine learning; Multiple classifier system	EEG SIGNAL CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION SYSTEM; MACHINE; RAT; ENSEMBLE; STATES	Background: Electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) recordings are often used in rodents to study sleep architecture and sleep-associated neural activity. These recordings must be scored to designate what sleep wake state the animal is in at each time point. Manual sleep-scoring is very time-consuming, so machine-learning classifier algorithms have been used to automate scoring. New method: Instead of using single classifiers, we implement a multiple classifier system. The multiple classifier is built from six base classifiers: decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, support vector machine, neural net, and linear discriminant analysis. Decision tree and k-nearest neighbors were improved into ensemble classifiers by using bagging and random subspace. Confidence scores from each classifier were combined to determine the final classification. Ambiguous epochs can be rejected and left for a human to classify. Results: Support vector machine was the most accurate base classifier, and had error rate of 0.054. The multiple classifier system reduced the error rate to 0.049, which was not significantly different from a second human scorer. When 10% of epochs were rejected, the remaining epochs' error rate dropped to 0.018. Comparison with existing method(s): Compared with the most accurate single classifier (support vector machine), the multiple classifier reduced errors by 9.4%. The multiple classifier surpassed the accuracy of a second human scorer after rejecting only 2% of epochs. Conclusions: Multiple classifier systems are an effective way to increase automated sleep scoring accuracy. Improvements in autoscoring will allow sleep researchers to increase sample sizes and recording lengths, opening new experimental possibilities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Behroozi, M; Daliri, MR; Shekarchi, B				Behroozi, Mehdi; Daliri, Mohammad Reza; Shekarchi, Babak			EEG phase patterns reflect the representation of semantic categories of objects	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Oscillations; Categorization; Delta band; Inter-trial phase coherence; Hilbert transform; Naive Bayes classifier	GAMMA-BAND RESPONSES; HUMAN BRAIN ACTIVITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; INFORMATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; RECOGNITION; POTENTIALS; DYNAMICS; MEMORY; STATES	Oscillations of electroencephalographic signals represent the cognitive processes arose from the behavioral task and sensory representations across the mental state activity. Previous studies have shown the relation between event-related EEG and sensory-cognitive representation and revealed that categorization of presented object can be successfully recognized using recorded EEG signals when subjects view objects. Here, EEG signals in conjunction with a multivariate pattern recognition technique were used for investigating the possibility to identify conceptual representation based on the presentation of 12 semantic categories of objects (5 exemplars per category). Using multivariate stimulus decoding methods, surprisingly, we demonstrate that how objects are discriminated from phase pattern of EEG signals across the time in low-frequency band (1-4 Hz), but not from power of oscillatory brain signals in the same frequency band. In contrast, discrimination accuracy from the power of EEG signals has significantly higher than the performance from phase of EEG signal in the high-frequency band (20-30 Hz). Moreover, our results indicate that how the accuracy of prediction changes between various areas of brain continuously across the time. In particular, we find that, during the object categorization task, the inter-trial phase coherence in low-frequency band is significantly higher than other frequency in various regions of interests. This measure is associated with decoding pattern across the time. These results suggest that the mechanism underlying conceptual representation can be mediated by the phase of oscillatory neural activity.

Stochastic computing systems involve low hardware complexity and are inherently fault-tolerant. Two types of architectures are presented. These include: an implementation with input and output both in bipolar format and an implementation with bipolar input and unipolar output. The computation of RBF kernel is comprised of the squared Euclidean distance and the exponential function. In the first implementation, two components are implemented in bipolar format and the exponential function is designed based on the finite state machine (FSM) method. The second implementation computes the squared Euclidean distance with bipolar input and unipolar output. The exponential function is implemented in unipolar format based on the Maclaurin expansion. The accuracies of two architectures are compared using support vectors from classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for seizure prediction. From simulation results, it is shown that the computational error of the second stochastic implementation with format conversion is 24.90% less than that of the first implementation in bipolar format.

Methods: Review of consecutive people with chronic MTLE-HS undergoing presurgical video-EEG telemetry. Exclusion criteria were additional epileptogenic lesions or seizure generators or compromised EEG traces at seizure-onset. Mixed linear or logistic regression models were used. Results: Inclusion of 63 patients with 219 seizures with a favorable outcome (no seizures or auras only) in 43 patients at last follow-up. Rhythmic activity at seizure-onset (RA) had a frequency of 4.7 +/- 1.5/s (range 1-8/s), mostly localized in the anterior temporal region. Postsurgical seizure outcome was not associated with any clinical or electrophysiological feature. RA in the delta-band was more often observed with shorter epilepsy duration (p = 0.002). Conclusions: RA on scalp EEG gets faster with increasing epilepsy duration, possibly via time-dependent alterations of epileptogenic networks. Neither the frequency of RA nor other EEG-features appeared to predict postsurgical seizure outcome. Significance: The results challenge the view that if patients with apparent MTLE display RA in the delta-band, seizure-onset in neocortical structures rather than in temporo-mesial tissue should be considered and further investigations should be prompted.

These procedures have to take advantage of the present heterogeneous architectures comprising multicore CPUs and GPUs. In this paper, we describe and analyze several OpenCL implementations for an application comprising multiobjective feature selection for clustering in an EEG classification task on high-dimensional patterns. These implementation alternatives correspond to different uses of multicore CPU and GPU platforms to process irregular data codes. Depending on the dataset used, we have reached speedups of up to 14.9 and 17.2 with up to 24 threads for the implemented OpenCL CPU kernels and of up to 7.1 and 9.1 with up to 13 SMX processors and 256 local work-items for our OpenCL GPU kernels. Nevertheless, to provide this level of performance, careful considerations about the use of the memory hierarchy of the heterogeneous architecture and different strategies to cope with the irregularity of our target application have to be taken into account.

To facilitate the detection performance and overcome the shortcoming of correlation integral, nonlinear adaptive denoising and Kalman filter have been adopted for pre-processing and post-processing. The three-stage algorithm has achieved 84.6% sensitivity and 0.087/h false detection rate, which are comparable to many machine learning based methods, but at much lower computational cost. Since this algorithm is tested with long-term scalp EEG, it has the potential to achieve higher performance with intracranial EEG. The clinical value of this algorithm includes providing a pre-judgement to assist the doctor's diagnosis procedure and acting as a reliable warning system in a wearable device for epilepsy patients.

The motivation of this study is to enhance the shooter performance for shooting the target, when their EEG patterns show that they are ready. This method can be used in brain-computer interface (BCI) system. In this study, multi-channel EEG from twenty participants are collected by the electrodes placed at different scalp locations in resting-state time. The EEG trials are used to predict two possible outcomes: successful or unsuccessful stop. Four classifiers (QDC, KNNC, PARZENDC, LDC) are used in this study to evaluation the accuracy of our system. Based on the collected time-domain EEG signals, the phase locking value (PLV) from 5-pair electrodes are calculated and then used as the feature input for the classifiers.

However, its numerous challenges and obstacles have impeded the realization of a definitive solution. This work aims to build upon our existing research and apply newer advanced machine learning and hardware techniques to this issue. The novelty proposed is two-fold. First, we utilize max-pooling convolutional neural networks (MPCNN) to perform end-to-end learning. Second, we demonstrate that transfer-learning can be used to teach MPCNNs generalized features of both normal and epileptiform patterns from a pool of subjects' raw EEG data. Using this hybrid approach, the system is able to detect all 184 seizure onsets from 24 cases with average latency of 1.47 seconds and 3.2 false-alarms/day. To demonstrate the full system, the entire design is efficiently implemented onto a highly parallel, highly granular embedded SoC (NVIDIA Jetson TK1). When utilizing the GPU, the system is able to classify 15-second segments in 308 mu s and last over 80 hours.

Day-to-Day Variability in Hybrid, Passive Brain-Computer Interfaces: Comparing Two Studies Assessing Cognitive Workload	2016 38TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 16-20, 2016	Orlando, FL	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; EEG; COMMUNICATION; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; REMOVAL	As hybrid, passive brain-computer interface systems become more advanced, it is important to grow our understanding of how to produce generalizable pattern classifiers of physiological data. One of the most difficult problems in applying machine learning algorithms to these data types is nonstationarity, which can evolve over the course of hours and days, and is more susceptible to changes resulting from complex cognitive function in comparison to simple, stimulus-based processes. This nonstationarity, referenced as day-to-day variability, results in the inability of many learning algorithms to generalize to new data. In previous work, we have shown that increasing the number of unique testing sessions used to form a learning set can improve the accuracy of classifying mental workload in a binary state paradigm. While this result was very promising, we did not address whether the additional discriminability was the result of a larger learning set or the uniqueness contributed by the testing sessions being spread over multiple days. Further, the simulation task used in this prior analysis was low-fidelity with respect to the task it attempted to model; whether these methods extend to more realistic task simulation environments has not been comparatively investigated. In this work, we compare these previous results to a second study, with a similar multi-day paradigm, that required participants to perform a more realistic simulation task. Comparative analysis of these two studies reveals that the improved generalization of the multi-day learning set is attributable, in large part, to the uniqueness of the multi-day paradigm. Further, this multi-day effect was also observed in the higher fidelity simulation study. These results help to validate the use of the multi-day learning set approach for improving overall system classification accuracy. Future studies should consider the use of multi-day designs for improving generalizability over other interesting dimensions.

However, the quantitative differences in ERD values and affected frequency bands associated with the lower limb have not been discussed. The goal of this paper was to quantitatively compare the ERD patterns during active movement, passive movement and FES-induced movement of the lower limb. 64-channel EEG signals were recorded to investigate the brain oscillatory patterns during active movement, passive movement and FES-induced movement of the lower limb in twelve healthy subjects. And passive movement and FES-induced movement were also performed in a hemiplegic stroke patient. For healthy subjects, FES-induced movement presented significantly higher characteristic frequency of central beta ERD while there was no significant difference in ERD values compared with active or passive movement. Meanwhile, beta ERD values of FES-induced movement were significantly correlated with those of active movement, and spatial distribution of beta ERD pattern for FES-induced movement was more correlated with that for active movement. In addition, the stroke patient presented central ERD patterns during FES-induced movement, while no ERD with similar frequencies could be found during passive movement. This work implies that the EEG oscillatory pattern under FES-induced movement tends more towards active movement instead of passive movement. The quantification of ERD patterns could be expected as a potential technique to evaluate the brain response during FES-induced movement.

Reports indicate that active participation by the patient, as opposed to simple stimulation, leads to improved recovery when using FES and other rehabilitation techniques. In this paper, we investigate the neurophysiological effect of an active participant's intention in the FES rehabilitation task. To observe the difference in brain signal between intentional and involuntary movement during FES, electroencephalography and near-infrared spectroscopy were simultaneously measured in the motor cortex area. The result showed that the presence of intention affects the activation of the brain significantly in both hemodynamic responses (near-infrared spectroscopy) and electrical (electroencephalography) patterns, and the accuracy of classification between passive and active mental states during FES was 85.3%. Our result implies the possibility to quantify motivation, or active participation, during rehabilitation, which has not been considered a measurable value in the rehabilitation field.

Although it has been presented long ago, yet this approach is artistic and heuristic. Poincar Section is destitute of any definite methodologies and problems including indefinite structure and model parameters that can be generally attributed to this approach; machine learning based on Poincar section is impossible. In this article, first of all, signal modeling steps using Poincar is explained, then considering the occurred events, the concept of information and relativism applying Poincar section and information approach, we will diagnose the brain pattern variations in Autistic cases. The reason we have taken Autism into consideration is because we believe its origin is information, in other words the big problem in Autism disorder is software kind, which can lead to hardware kind over time. In this research a new kind of representation, namely Extended Complementary Plot, in which the main characteristic is special attention to signal phase as embedded information in the signal and ineffectiveness of energy, is introduced. All the introduced state-of-art concepts on Electroencephalography are implemented on Autistic children. Recording the EEG signal in Autistic children has always been a challenge for the specialists. Implementations of the article have been carried out on over 120 cases including 60 Autistic children and 60 normal ones ranging from 3 to 10 years old, in three different states; asleep, open eyes and a new record based on brain dynamics which has been suggested from the authors and does not have the other records problems for Autistic kids. Prodigious results accomplished, suggests the common dynamic presence in Autism disorder which is entirely different from normal dynamics, and this is only due to the potency of the applied information tool; Poincar section, and cybernetic modeling in this research. We hope that the empirical results of this research to be a strong and effective step towards quantification of Autism disorder and conversion of diagnosis process from Clinical to Para clinical, and even early Autism diagnosis.

The nonstationary nature of EEG data arises due to the physiological/instrumental differences in intra/intersession of the data generation process. This paper proposes a robust common spatial pattern feature extraction algorithm (RoCSP) to overcome the effects of artifacts and a self-regulated interval type-2 neuro-fuzzy inference system (SRIT2NFIS) to handle this inherent nonstationarity. Combined together, this approach is referred to as RoCSP-SRIT2NFIS. The RoCSP algorithm provides better features than the CSP algorithm by excluding those trials that are affected by the artifacts. SRIT2NFIS uses the features generated by the RoCSP algorithm as input and handles the nonstationarity as an uncertainty using the interval type-2 fuzzy sets in the antecedent of fuzzy rules. A self-regulatory learning mechanism is used to evolve the structure automatically and learn the parameters of the network. A regularized projection-based learning algorithm and a modified rule addition criterion are also proposed to improve the generalization performance of SRIT2NFIS. Using benchmark datasets, performance evaluation has been carried out, and the results indicate that, compared with other existing algorithms, RoCSP-SRIT2NFIS produces higher classification accuracy of 3-5% in simple tasks like left-right classification and 6-8% in complex tasks like foot-tongue classification. In addition, a statistical analysis of the performance results indicates that RoCSP-SRIT2NFIS performs better and is more suitable for an efficient BCI.

Fuzzy Classification of Human Emotions using Fuzzy C-Mean (FCFCM)	2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY THEORY AND ITS APPLICATIONS (IFUZZY)	International Conference on Fuzzy Theory and Its Applications		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Fuzzy Theory and Its Applications (IFUZZY)	NOV 09-11, 2016	Taichung, TAIWAN				IDENTIFICATION; MODEL	Emotion classification using electroencephalogram (EEG) has been actively researched in many Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) applications such as healthcare, recreation and education. In the last decade, studies in affective Brain-Computer Interfaces (aBCI) have increased especially in the discipline of affective computing. One of the topics is fuzzy classification of human emotions. Fuzzy set theory has been applied due to its potential benefit of human comprehensibility. Furthermore, the approach exhibits shorter computation time and it is faster than other machine learning techniques if it has only a number of manageable rules. It is also suitable for online applications. However, it is important to have an efficient means for extracting appropriate rules. In this study, it is proposed to use Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) for extracting fuzzy rules to be used in the fuzzy inference system (FIS) for classification purpose. This technique uses the EEG data for learning and to produce rules. Three advantages are suggested: accuracy, flexibility and computation time. The results show that the algorithm has an improved accuracy in comparison to fuzzy classification using fixed rules and Support Vector Machine (SVM), with values of 55.77%, 49.62% and 54% respectively. In addition the proposed technique also required less execution time.	[Chatchinarat, A.; Wong, K. W.; Fung, C.

Using electroencephalography and blood oxygenation level dependent magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-MRI), several studies have begun to elucidate brain processes involved in fear-related perceptual biases, but thus far mainly found evidence for general hypervigilance in high fearful individuals. Recently, multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has become popular for decoding cognitive states from distributed patterns of neural activation. Here, we used this technique to assess whether biased fear generalization, characteristic of clinical fear, is already present during the initial perception and categorization of a stimulus, or emerges during the subsequent interpretation of a stimulus. Individuals with low spider fear (n = 20) and high spider fear (n = 18) underwent functional MRI scanning while viewing series of schematic flowers morphing to spiders. In line with previous studies, individuals with high fear of spiders were behaviorally more likely to classify ambiguous morphs as spiders than individuals with low fear of spiders. Univariate analyses of BOLD-MRI data revealed stronger activation toward spider pictures in high fearful individuals compared to low fearful individuals in numerous areas. Yet, neither average activation, nor support vector machine classification (i.e., a form of MVPA) matched the behavioral results - i.e., a biased response toward ambiguous stimuli- in any of the regions of interest. This may point to limitations of the current design, and to challenges associated with classifying emotional and neutral stimuli in groups that differ in their judgment of emotionality. Improvements for future research are suggested.	[Visser, Renee M.; Haver, Pia; Kindt, Merel] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, NL-1018 WB Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Visser, Renee M.; Scholte, H.

But recent studies showed that the migraine analysis can be done also by using EEG. These analyses are concerned with migraine diagnostic methods done by using EEG. T5-T3 channel of EEG was generally used in these proposed methods. However, the suitability of other channels in the diagnosis of migraine has not discussed. It is very important to find out which EEG channels and brain lobes are more important to learn the characteristics of migraine. The aim of this study is to analyze the each EEG channel separately for migraine patients. Analysis of this study is based on method in the literature that related to magnitude increase amount under flash stimulation. For this aim, beta band of each EEG channel's data were pre-processed by using Burg-AR method. Then these features were applied to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to observe which channel is the more definitive. As a result of this study, it is proposed that T3, F7, O1 and O2 channels are the most decisive for diagnosis of migraine, based on PSD magnitude increase under flash stimulation. Also, which brain lobes are more affected from triggering factors of migraine attack is proposed. Furthermore, asymmetry feature of migraine is approved by EEG and alternative migraine diagnosis methods is proposed for future researches according to reaction type of physiological structure of scalp to flash stimulation.

However, there are many difficulties and challenges in developing such a system as a real-life support for patients. Because of the nonstationary nature of EEG signals, normal and seizure patterns vary across different patients. Thus, finding a group of manually extracted features for the prediction task is not practical. Moreover, when using implanted electrodes for brain recording massive amounts of data are produced. This big data calls for the need for safe storage and high computational resources for real-time processing. To address these challenges, a cloud-based BCI system for the analysis of this big EEG data is presented. First, a dimensionality-reduction technique is developed to increase classification accuracy as well as to decrease the communication bandwidth and computation time. Second, following a deep-learning approach, a stacked autoencoder is trained in two steps for unsupervised feature extraction and classification. Third, a cloud-computing solution is proposed for real-time analysis of big EEG data. The results on a benchmark clinical dataset illustrate the superiority of the proposed patient specific BCI as an alternative method and its expected usefulness in real-life support of epilepsy patients.

Materials and methods: A retrospective data analysis review of patients implanted at the Cochlear Implant Center of the University of Parma, Italy, was performed, searching for implanted children with a confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic epilepsy. Clinical data, imaging findings, pre- and post-operative epilepsy pattern and EEG traces were analyzed; communicative skills were assessed using the Profile of Actual Linguistic Skills. Results: Search retrieved two patients affected by profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and symptomatic epilepsy (associated respectively with methylmalonic acidemia and cerebral palsy). After careful parental counselling both patients were offered and underwent cochlear implantation. Activation and use of cochlear implant did not determine substantial changes of pre-existing seizure pattern and EEG traces. Both patients showed substantial development of their communicative abilities. Conclusions: Cochlear implantation in children with symptomatic epilepsy did not determine variations in seizure pattern or EEG traces. Both patients experienced substantial benefit from cochlear implantation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, these systems are typically ill-suited for widespread adoption due to their size, cost, and complexity. In this paper, a small, portable, and extremely cost-efficient (< $200) BCI system has been developed using a custom electroencephalographic (EEG) amplifier array, and a commercial microcontroller and touchscreen. The system's performance was tested using a movement-related BCI task in 3 able-bodied subjects with minimal previous BCI experience. Specifically, subjects were instructed to alternate between relaxing and dorsiflexing their right foot, while their EEG was acquired and analyzed in real-time by the BCI system to decode their underlying movement state. The EEG signals acquired by the custom amplifier array were similar to those acquired by a commercial amplifier (maximum correlation coefficient rho = 0.85). During real-time BCI operation, the average correlation between instructional cues and decoded BCI states across all subjects (rho = 0.70) was comparable to that of full-size BCI systems. Small, portable, and inexpensive BCI systems such as the one reported here may promote a widespread adoption of BCI-based movement rehabilitation devices in stroke and spinal cord injury populations.

Extracting suitable and discriminant features is one of the most important stages in BCI Applications. Common spatial patterns (CSP) is a well-known feature extraction method; however, due to the non-stationary nature of EEG signals CSP should be updated through time. This paper proposes a novel recursive adaptation method inspired from extended-Kalman filter equations for CSP feature elicitation and classification. In this method, CSP filters are updated with each new EEC data. The proposed method was compared with a standard CSP method and an extended version of it, which uses incremental covariance matrices (ICM). These methods were applied to dataset 'a' of BCI competition-III containing two- and multi-task imagery movements. Results demonstrate a considerable improvement in terms of classification accuracy by the proposed method in comparison with standard CSP, also the proposed method performed better or as well as CSP method with ICM in most cases.

However, brain oscillatory patterns induced by movement imagination of motor sequences involving multiple limbs have not been reported in recent years. The goal of the present study was to verify the feasibility of application of motor sequences involving multiple limbs to brain-computer interface (BCI) systems based on motor imagery (MI). The changes of EEG patterns and the inter-influence between movements associated with the imagination of motor sequences were also investigated. Methods: The experiment, where 12 healthy subjects participated, involved one motor sequence with a single limb and three kinds of motor sequences with two or three limbs. The activity involved mental simulation, imagining playing drums with two conditions (60 and 30 beats per minute for the first and second conditions, respectively). Results: Movement imagination of different limbs in the sequence contributed to time-variant event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns within both mu and beta rhythms, which was more obvious for the second condition compared with the first condition. The ERD values of left/right hand imagery with prior hand imagery were significantly larger than those with prior foot imagery, while the phase locking values (PLVs) between central electrodes and the mesial frontocentral electrode of non-initial movement were significantly larger than those of the initial movement during imagination of motor sequences for both conditions. Classification results showed that the power spectral density (PSD) based method outperformed the multi-class common spatial patterns (multi-CSP) based method: The highest accuracies were 82.86 % and 91.43 %, and the mean values were 65 % and 74.14 % for the first and second conditions, respectively. Conclusions: This work implies that motor sequences involving multiple limbs can be utilized to build a multimodal classification paradigm in MI-based BCI systems, and that prior movement imagination can result in the changes of neural activities in motor areas during subsequent movement imagination in the process of limb switching.

In the literature, Deep learning concepts have not been applied to EEG data analysis in a systematic manner. This paper applies various existing Deep learning architectures and algorithms for the classification of EEG data applied to eye state detection. The deep learning based classifier systems presented in this work are comparable to the state of the art classifiers devised by Roesler and Suenderman (2013), and Cameron et al.(2015). The goal of this work is to construct a system producing accuracies comparable to Roesler's K* classifier, Cameron et al. 's (RRF+K*) classifiers and at the same time providing enough speed to be used in an online BCI framework. In order to meet the constraints, following architectures were designed: A Multi layered neural network with ReLU and drop-out, deep belief networks based unsupervised learning, drop-out masks on deep neural networks. Specifically, we compare our results with K*, RRF, (K*+RRF), ada(RJ48F) classifiers. Also an in-depth analysis of binary class features has been done using t-SNE based visualizations while fitting elliptical contours to the features. Prior research suggests that instance-based/lazy learners like the K* algorithm are likely to be too slow to be used in a BCI framework, with ada(RJ48F) model performing decently well. But our chosen deep neural network architectures produce higher classification accuracies and have lower convergence times making them even faster within the time specifications of real-time classification and control applications.

This phenomenon is widely exploited in many biosensors used for the measurement of bioelectromagnetism. One example of such sensors is an electroencephalograph (EEG) used for the recording and monitoring the bioelectrical activity of brain. Raw EEG scalp potentials are characterized by weak spatial resolution. Owing to the volume conduction there is an overlapping of the contribution to each electrode from neighboring bioelectrical sources. Due to described reasons, multichannel EEG recordings tend to provide an unclear image of the activity of brain. In this study the performance of algorithms based on spatial filtering in the task of eliminating source overlapping from EEG-based BCI system is examined and compared. The algorithms of choice are Common Average Reference (CAR), Surface Laplacian (SL), Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP). Additionally, a new approach to feature selection and knowledge extraction from BCI models is proposed. For that purpose criterion based on the Gini variable importance evaluation, commonly performed by the Random Forests algorithm, is used. For the better performance evaluation of proposed approaches, their effectiveness is tested during the classification of the dataset IVa provided for the "BCI Competition III" organized by the Berlin Brain-Computer Interface group.

In the past few years there has been a growing interest in studying brain functioning in natural, real-life situations. Mobile EEG allows to study the brain in real unconstrained environments but it faces the intrinsic challenge that it is impossible to disentangle observed changes in brain activity due to increase in cognitive demands by the complex natural environment or due to the physical involvement. In this work we aim to disentangle the influence of cognitive demands and distractions that arise from such outdoor unconstrained recordings. Approach. We evaluate the ERP and single trial characteristics of a three-class auditory oddball paradigm recorded in outdoor scenario's while peddling on a fixed bike or biking freely around. In addition we also carefully evaluate the trial specific motion artifacts through independent gyro measurements and control for muscle artifacts. Main results. A decrease in P300 amplitude was observed in the free biking condition as compared to the fixed bike conditions. Above chance P300 single-trial classification in highly dynamic real life environments while biking outdoors was achieved. Certain significant artifact patterns were identified in the free biking condition, but neither these nor the increase in movement (as derived from continuous gyrometer measurements) can explain the differences in classification accuracy and P300 waveform differences with full clarity. The increased cognitive load in real-life scenarios is shown to play a major role in the observed differences. Significance. Our findings suggest that auditory oddball results measured in natural real-life scenarios are influenced mainly by increased cognitive load due to being in an unconstrained environment.

Simultaneous recording of EEG and fNIRS during visuo-spatial and facial expression processing in a dual task paradigm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						emotional processing; interference; EEG; fNIRS; spatial processing; working memory	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; HUMAN BRAIN; IDENTIFICATION; INTERFERENCE; ACTIVATION; FACES; LOAD	Emotional processing is probably the most crucial tool for orienting oneself in our everyday social life and has been considered to be highly automatic for a long time. Dual task (DT) research shows that information competing for working memory resources impairs the identification of emotional facial expressions. Effects of cognitive load in DT paradigms have been confirmed in numerous neuroimaging studies. However, interference occurring during a DT comprised of decoding emotional facial expressions and a visuo-spatial working memory task has yet to be visualized. To investigate the DT interference effect on brain areas associated not only with working memory, but also emotional and visuo-spatial processing, we recorded brain activation within the prefrontal cortex and parietal-occipital sensory areas using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) simultaneously. Our study consisted of N = 36 participants (27 female) performing the following tasks: a) Corsi blocks, b) identification of emotional facial expressions or c) DT comprising of tasks a) and b). We predicted higher activation of the prefrontal cortex during DT and corresponding reduced P100 and P300 amplitudes. As expected, fNIRS measurements revealed significantly higher neuronal activation within the prefrontal cortex in the DT condition. When comparing DT to the single tasks, the P100 amplitude was reduced, but the P300 amplitude did not show the expected reduction. Our findings underline that at least some aspects of emotional processing are not entirely automatic, but depend on prefrontal control and are therefore affected by cognitive load, in particular visuo-spatial working memory resources.

Scalp Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a common test that measures and records the electrical activity of the brain, and is widely used in the detection and analysis of epileptic seizures. However, it is often difficult to identify the subtle changes in the EEG waveform by visual inspection. Then, emerge in large numbers of research for biomedical engineers to develop and implement several intelligent algorithms for the identification of such subtle changes. This paper presents a EEG signal analysis and forecasting technique based on wavelet transform and support vector machine classification method. The main procedure is a dynamic circulation. The technique first train the given datasets, obtain the value of the parameter, then automatically multi-time decompose for a new person's brain signals, predict whether the person has a characteristic wave of epilepsy, add the person's EEG data into the SVM training model if the person has epilepsy abnormal signal, combined with abnormal data before retraining and learning. The method has a very large potential uses, such as application for the initial diagnosis of patients, improving the efficiency for doctors.

Its use is motivated by the fact that the EMD gives an effective time-frequency analysis of nonstationary signals. The intrinsic mode functions (IMF) obtained as a result of EMD give the decomposition of a signal according to its frequency components. We present the usage of upto third order temporal moments, and spectral features including spectral centroid, coefficient of variation and the spectral skew of the IMFs for feature extraction from EEG signals. These features are physiologically relevant given that the normal EEG signals have different temporal and spectral centroids, dispersions and symmetries when compared with the pathological EEG signals. The calculated features are fed into the standard support vector machine (SVM) for classification purposes. The performance of the proposed method is studied on a publicly available dataset which is designed to handle various classification problems including the identification of epilepsy patients and detection of seizures. Experiments show that good classification results are obtained using the proposed methodology for the classification of EEG signals. Our proposed method also compares favorably to other state-of-the-art feature extraction methods.

Because of its ability to directly influence the performance of BCI systems, recent studies have generally investigated how to modify existing methods or develop novel techniques. One of the most successful and well-known methods in BCI applications is the common spatial pattern (CSP). In existing CSP-based methods, the spatial filters were extracted either by using the whole data trial or by dividing the trials into a number of overlapping/nonoverlapping time segments. In this paper, we developed a CSP-based moving window technique to obtain the most distinguishable CSP features and increase the classifier performance by finding the best time segment of electroencephalogram trials. The extracted features were tested by using support vector machines (SVMs). The performance of the classifier was measured in terms of classification accuracy and kappa coefficient (kappa). The proposed method was successfully applied to the two-dimensional cursor movement imagery data sets, which were acquired from three healthy human subjects in two sessions on different days. The experiments proved that instead of using the whole data length of EEG trials, extracting CSP features from the best time segment provides higher classification accuracy and kappa rates.

We in this paper develop a novel multiscale limited penetrable horizontal visibility graph (MLPHVG). We use nonlinear time series from two typical complex systems, i.e., EEG signals and two-phase flow signals, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Combining MLPHVG and support vector machine, we detect epileptic seizures from the EEG signals recorded from healthy subjects and epilepsy patients and the classification accuracy is 100%. In addition, we derive MLPHVGs from oil-water two-phase flow signals and find that the average clustering coefficient at different scales allows faithfully identifying and characterizing three typical oil-water flow patterns. These findings render our MLPHVG method particularly useful for analyzing nonlinear time series from the perspective of multiscale network analysis.

Many control signals for state-of-the-art BCIs involve imagining the movement of body parts that have little to do with the output command, revealing a cognitive disconnection between the user's intent and the action of the end effector. Therefore, there is a need to develop techniques that can identify with high spatial resolution the self-modulated neural activity reflective of the actions of a helpful output device. Methods: We extend previous EEG source imaging (ESI) work to decoding natural hand/wrist manipulations by applying a novel technique to classifying four complex motor imaginations of the right hand: flexion, extension, supination, and pronation. Results: We report an increase of up to 18.6% for individual task classification and 12.7% for overall classification using the proposed ESI approach over the traditional sensor-based method. Conclusion: ESI is able to enhance BCI performance of decoding complex right hand motor imagery tasks.

A major advance is now possible thanks to the application of pattern classifiers to time-resolved recordings of brain activity [ electro-encephalography (EEG), magneto-encephalography (MEG), or intracranial recordings]. The method determines precisely when a specific mental content becomes explicitly represented in brain activity. Most importantly, the ability of these pattern classifiers to generalize across time and experimental conditions sheds light on the temporal organization of information-processing stages. To illustrate these ideas, we show how the decoding of MEG and EEG recordings can be used to track the fate of conscious and unconscious brain processes during simple masking and auditory novelty tasks. The experimental results yield converging results, suggesting that conscious perception is associated with the late formation of a distributed and stable neural assembly that encodes the content of subjective perception.

Discussions can be found on the advantages and disadvantages of different sensor types (like EEG, ECG, pupillometry, GSR etc.). Machine learning technologies are used to find the baseline of a subject and infer the mental effort levels. In this paper we investigate and compare different types of physiological sensors and classification techniques.

In this study, we propose a classification framework based on ensemble methods to handle spectral and spatial EEG signal characteristics. A mixture of two ensemble classifiers has been used for combining multiple information sources. The performance of the proposed classifier has been evaluated on a two-class problem (right and left hand) from the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a. The used features for the training data are the selected features by Mutual information-based Best Individual Feature from the output of the Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern. The results show that proposed method can reach an accuracy of 90.27% with just 7 features, while other methods have lower accuracy and a higher number of features.

It takes its roots in study of human well-being in architecture, human factors study in engineering and manufacturing including neuroergonomics. In traditional human factors studies and/or well-being study, mental workload, stress, and emotion are obtained through questionnaires that are administered upon completion of some task and/or the whole experiment. Recent advances in BCI research allow for using Electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain state recognition algorithms to assess the interaction between brain and human performance. We propose and develop an EEG-based system CogniMeter to monitor and analyze human factors measurements of newly designed software/hardware systems and/or working places. Machine learning techniques are applied to the EEG data to recognize levels of mental workload, stress and emotions during each task. The EEG is used as a tool to monitor and record the brain states of subjects during human factors study experiments. We describe two applications of CogniMeter system: human performance assessment in maritime simulator and EEG-based human factors evaluation in Air Traffic Control (ATC) workplace. By utilizing the proposed EEG-based system, true understanding of subjects working patterns can be obtained. Based on the analyses of the objective real time EEG-based data together with the subjective feedback from the subjects, we are able to reliably evaluate current systems/hardware and/or working place design and refine new concepts and design of future systems.

For a successful reintegration into society, it is necessary to discriminate their brain responses from civilian people, as a first stage to develop treatment strategies. This paper presents a comparative analysis between a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and a Fuzzy C-Means classifier to differentiate ex-combatant subjects from civilian controls using graph-based functional connectivity networks calculated from scalp EEG recordings. EEG data were acquired while participants performed an adaptation of a Dual Valence Task, a well-known experimental task commonly used to analyze emotional processing. We obtained up to 80% of accuracy with both proposed algorithms. These results are comparable with other approaches reported in the literature. Together with conductual tasks, the computarized techniques proposed in this paper provide a decision support system to psychologists for determining the level of exposure to the conflict of the ex-combatants, and consequently a tool for their posterior treatment.

How to design an appropriate feature extraction method and how to select an efficient classifier are recognized to be crucial in the successful realization. This paper first proposes a new Mahalanobis-similarity-based feature extraction method on the basis of the Mahalanobis distance and discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). Then in order to further improve the performance, this paper designs a fusion feature (MS-SE-FF) in the feature-fusion level, where the Mahalanobis-similarity-based feature characterizing the similarity between signals and the sample-entropy-based feature characterizing the complexity of signals are combined together. Finally, an automated seizure detection method FF-ELM-SD has been built, which is integrated between the novel fusion feature MS-SE-FF and extreme learning machine (ELM). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method FF-ELM-SD does a good job in the epileptic seizure detection while preserving the efficiency and simplicity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 48 cases of newborns with HIE (aged 37 to 41 weeks) as the observation group and another 50 cases of fullterm infants with non-traumatic brain illness as the control group were chosen from March 2012 to March 2013. The aEEG were observed, and the continuity and sleep-wake cycle (SWC) between the two groups were compared. The relevance of aEEG monitoring results and HIE, as well as the long-term prognosis, were analyzed. RESULTS: 33.33% (16/48) of EEG results appeared to be continuous and 20.83% (10/48) of the SWC results were mature for observation group. These EEG and SWC results are conspicuously lower than the control group 100% (50/50) and differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The maximum voltage of observation group was 56.54 +/- 19.33 LV, notably higher than the control group (37.77 +/- 2.79 LV). The minimum voltage of the observation group was 4.26 +/- 1.25 LV, markedly lower than the control group (7.75 +/- 0.67 LV) and these differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Correlational analysis based on the Spearman approach showed that the monitoring results are positively correlated with clinical classification of HIE. After six months of follow-up, 11 of the 48 cases (22.92%) were found to be disabled (including mental retardation and cerebral palsy). CONCLUSIONS: aEEG enjoys easy operation, effective diagnosis, supports continuous monitoring and reflects the lesion degree as well as long-term prognosis of newborns with HIE and is, thus, highly recommended in clinical practices.

The Guilty Knowledge Test is used to determine if certain information is stored in the brain by detecting the P300 wave. In this paper, an improved Guilty Knowledge Test has been conducted on 14 subjects. Although a variety of feature extraction and classification algorithms for detecting the P300 have been used thus far, this paper introduces the use of deep learning techniques for the Guilty Knowledge Test. Two deep learning techniques; Deep Belief Networks and Stacked Autoencoders, have been compared. The input to these classifiers was the filtered EEG signal without any feature extraction. A mean accuracy of 86.9% was achieved for the Deep Belief Network and 86.01% for the Stacked Autoencoder on our dataset, outperforming the conventional Support Vector Machine.	[Kulasingham, J.

In the auditory system, for example, previous studies have reported a wide range of effects in terms of the perceptually relevant frequency bands and state parameters (phase/power). To dissociate influences of state on earlier sensory representations and higher-level decision processes, we collected behavioral and EEG data in human participants performing two auditory discrimination tasks relying on distinct acoustic features. Using single-trial decoding, we quantified the relation between prestimulus activity, relevant sensory evidence, and choice in different task-relevant EEG components. Within auditory networks, we found that phase had no direct influence on choice, whereas power in task-specific frequency bands affected the encoding of sensory evidence. Within later-activated frontoparietal regions, theta and alpha phase had a direct influence on choice, without involving sensory evidence. These results delineate two consistent mechanisms by which prestimulus activity shapes perception. However, the timescales of the relevant neural activity depend on the specific brain regions engaged by the respective task.

J	Cavanagh, JF; Castellanos, J				Cavanagh, James F.; Castellanos, Joel			Identification of canonical neural events during continuous gameplay of an 8-bit style video game	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Video game; EEG; Pattern classification; Transfer learning; Reward; Salience	COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; EEG; ACTIVATION; THETA; SYNCHRONIZATION; FEEDBACK; CORTEX	Cognitive neuroscience suffers from a unique and pervasive problem of generalizability. Since neural findings are often interpreted in the context of a specific manipulation during a carefully controlled task, it is hard to transfer knowledge from one task to another. In this report we address problems of generalizability with two methodological advancements. First, we aimed to transcend status quo experimental procedures with a continuous, engaging task environment. To this end, we created a novel 8-bit style continuous space shooter video game that elicits a multitude of goal-oriented events, such as crashing into a wall or blowing up an enemy with a missile. Second, we aimed to objectively define the psychological significance of these events. To achieve this aim, we used pattern classification of EEG data to derive predictive weights from carefully controlled pre-game exemplar events (oddball target detection and gambling wins and losses) and transferred those weights to EEG activities during video game events. All major goal-oriented events (crashes into the wall, crashes into an enemy, missile hit on an enemy) had a significant between-task transfer bias towards oddball target weights in the time range of the canonical P3, indicating the presence of similar salience detection processes. Missile hits on an enemy were specifically identified as gambling wins, confirming the hypothesis that this goal-oriented event was appetitive. These findings suggest that it is possible to identify the contribution of canonical neural activities during otherwise ambiguous and uncontrolled task performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Different people might be affected differently from the same music when they listening the music in different situation and mental states. However, the common emotion information the music can be agreed even from peoples with quite different background and cultures. An automatic emotion recognition system be proposed for the music by extracting different features from the music and machine learning method learning from common knowledge on emotional state of the trained data in this paper. Firstly, two-channel audio signals are processed, and typical audio features are extracted. Then some other features used for EEG signal analysis are also extracted. Finally, these features are combined and the random forest classifier is used for the classification. The proposed method has been used on a public music dataset for test and the experimental results demonstrate its efficiency when it compare with the state-of-the-art performance in the same dataset.

Twenty-one healthy subjects including twelve men and nine women participate in our driving simulation experiments. Two fusion strategies are adopted: feature level fusion (FLF) and decision level fusion (DLF). PERCLOS (the percentage of eye closure) is calculated by using the eye movement data recorded by eye tracking glasses as the indicator of drivers' fatigue level. The prediction correlation coefficient and root mean square error (RMSE) between the estimated fatigue level and the real fatigue level are both used to evaluate the performance of single modality and fusion modality. A comparative study on modality performance is conducted between GELM and support vector machine (SVM). The experimental results show that fusion modality can improve the performance of driving fatigue detection with a higher prediction correlation coefficient and a lower RMSE value in comparison with solely using EEG or forehead EOG. And FLF achieves better performance than DLF. GELM is more suitable for driving fatigue detection than SVM. Moreover, feature level fusion with GELM achieves the best performance with the prediction correlation coefficient of 0.8080 and the RMSE value of 0.0712 on average.

Brain activities may exhibit different representations while executing different cognitive tasks, which can be recognized by decoding EEG. This is crucial for constructing a brain-computer interface (BCI), which directly bridges between the human brain and external experiments or devices for communication or function restoration. This paper proposed a mask-based approach integrating time-frequency mask (TFM) and connectivity mask (CM) to improve BCI performance. The TFM method does not require the discriminative time-frequency points to be centralized together as the specific-frequency-specific-time (SFST) method does. It can also achieve good performance when discriminative features are scattered. Moreover, this paper also developed a CM method in the spatial domain to extract interchannel connectivity features. The performance of these methods was quantitatively evaluated on three datasets involving different cognitive tasks: 1) a pointing movement dataset; 2) a self-paced finger-tapping dataset in BCI competition II; and 3) a slow cortical potential dataset in BCI competition II. Empirical results of this paper showed that the TFM method outperformed the SFST method on all three datasets and achieved comparable performance to the winning methods in the two BCI competition datasets. The performance was further improved by combining TFM and CM, exceeding that of the winning methods in the BCI competition datasets.

CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Beta modulation; Volitional control; Brain-computer interface; Brain-machine interface; Brain-robot interface	COMPUTER INTERFACE BCI; MOTOR IMAGERY; MODULATION; FEEDBACK; NETWORK; LOAD; EEG	Objective: The balance between action and reward during neurofeedback may influence reinforcement learning of brain self-regulation. Methods: Eleven healthy volunteers participated in three runs of motor imagery-based brain-machine interface feedback where a robot passively opened the hand contingent to beta-band modulation. For each run, the beta-desynchronization threshold to initiate the hand robot movement increased in difficulty (low, moderate, and demanding). In this context, the incentive to learn was estimated by the change of reward per action, operationalized as the change in reward duration per movement onset. Results: Variance analysis revealed a significant interaction between threshold difficulty and the relationship between reward duration and number of movement onsets (p < 0.001), indicating a negative learning incentive for low difficulty, but a positive learning incentive for moderate and demanding runs. Exploration of different thresholds in the same data set indicated that the learning incentive peaked at higher thresholds than the threshold which resulted in maximum classification accuracy. Conclusion: Specificity is more important than sensitivity of neurofeedback for reinforcement learning of brain self-regulation. Significance: Learning efficiency requires adequate challenge by neurofeedback interventions. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Since an EEG signal has a large number of dimensions as an input sample vector, many previous classification methods have been proposed as hybrid frameworks, which are structurally complex and computationally expensive. In this paper, convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to realize feature extraction and classification simultaneously. The scheme of CNN is adopted to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Meanwhile, the accelerated proximal gradient method is used to increase the training ratio. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves ideal accuracy of epilepsy diagnosis and converges faster than CNNs based on traditional gradient back propagation.

While motor-imagery based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been studied over many years by now, most of these studies have taken place in controlled lab settings. Bringing BCI technology into everyday life is still one of the main challenges in this field of research. Approach. This paper systematically investigates BCI performance under 6 types of distractions that mimic out-of-lab environments. Main results. We report results of 16 participants and show that the performance of the standard common spatial patterns (CSP) + regularized linear discriminant analysis classification pipeline drops significantly in this 'simulated' out-of-lab setting. We then investigate three methods for improving the performance: (1) artifact removal, (2) ensemble classification, and (3) a 2-step classification approach. While artifact removal does not enhance the BCI performance significantly, both ensemble classification and the 2-step classification combined with CSP significantly improve the performance compared to the standard procedure. Significance. Systematically analyzing out-of-lab scenarios is crucial when bringing BCI into everyday life. Algorithms must be adapted to overcome nonstationary environments in order to tackle real-world challenges.

The method addresses the major challenge of extracting distinctive features from EEG signals through a detection of spatio-temporal signatures related to neurological events. By counting the number of occurrences of amplitude patterns with predefined lengths, the algorithm generates a probabilistic measure (anomalies ratio) that is used as a prediction marker. These extracted ratios are classified using state of the art machine learning algorithms into seizure and non-seizure windows. The efficacy of the prediction model is tested on patient records from the Freiburg database with more than 100 hours of recordings per patient and for a total of 145 seizures.

Complex patterns of spatially extended generators of epileptic activity: Comparison of source localization methods cMEM and 4-ExSo-MUSIC on high resolution EEG and MEG data	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						EEG/MEG source localization; Interictal epileptic discharges; Neural mass model; Maximum entropy on the mean; 4-ExSo-MUSIC; Higher order statistics	NONINVASIVE DENSE-ARRAY; INTERICTAL SPIKES; CORTICAL SOURCES; MODEL; BRAIN; ELECTRODES; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; CONDUCTIVITY; PRIORS; SCALP	Electric Source Imaging (ESI) and Magnetic Source Imaging (MSI) of EEG and MEG signals are widely used to determine the origin of interictal epileptic discharges during the pre-surgical evaluation of patients with epilepsy. Epileptic discharges are detectable on EEG/MEG scalp recordings only when associated with a spatially extended cortical generator of several square centimeters, therefore it is essential to assess the ability of source localization methods to recover such spatial extent. In this study we evaluated two source localization methods that have been developed for localizing spatially extended sources using EEG/MEG data: coherent Maximum Entropy on the Mean (cMEM) and 4th order Extended Source Multiple Signal Classification (4-ExSo-MUSIC). In order to propose a fair comparison of the performances of the two methods in MEG versus EEG, this study considered realistic simulations of simultaneous EEG/MEG acquisitions taking into account an equivalent number of channels in EEG (257 electrodes) and MEG (275 sensors), involving a biophysical computational neural mass model of neuronal discharges and realistically shaped head models. cMEM and 4-ExSo-MUSIC were evaluated for their sensitivity to localize complex patterns of epileptic discharges which includes (a) different locations and spatial extents of multiple synchronous sources, and (b) propagation patterns exhibited by epileptic discharges. Performance of the source localization methods was assessed using a detection accuracy index (Area Under receiver operating characteristic Curve, AUC) and a Spatial Dispersion (SD) metric. Finally, we also presented two examples illustrating the performance of cMEM and 4-ExSo-MUSIC on clinical data recorded using high resolution EEG and MEG. When simulating single sources at different locations, both 4-ExSo-MUSIC and cMEM exhibited excellent performance (median AUC significantly larger than 0.8 for EEG and MEG), whereas, only for EEG, 4-ExSo-MUSIC showed significantly larger AUC values than cMEM. On the other hand, cMEM showed significantly lower SD values than 4-ExSo-MUSIC for both EEG and MEG. When assessing the impact of the source spatial extent, both methods provided consistent and reliable detection accuracy for a wide range of source spatial extents (source sizes ranging from 3 to 20 cm(2) for MEG and 3 to 30 cm2 for EEG). For both EEG and MEG, 4-ExSo-MUSIC localized single source of large signal-to-noise ratio better than cMEM. In the presence of two synchronous sources, cMEM was able to distinguish well the two sources (their location and spatial extent), while 4-ExSo-MUSIC only retrieved one of them. cMEM was able to detect the spatio-temporal propagation patterns of two synchronous activities while 4-ExSo-MUSIC favored the strongest source activity. Overall, in the context of localizing sources of epileptic discharges from EEG and MEG data, 4-ExSo-MUSIC and cMEM were found accurately sensitive to the location and spatial extent of the sources, with some complementarities. Therefore, they are both eligible for application on clinical data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Chowdhury, R.

The need to detect distinctive brain features, which is relevant for biometric and brain computer interface systems, has been also emphasized in monitoring the effect of clinical treatments and in evaluating the progression of brain disorders. In this study we propose an approach which aims to investigate the existence of a distinctive functional core (sub-network) using an unbiased reconstruction of network topology. Brain signals from a public and freely available EEG dataset were analysed using a phase synchronization based measure, minimum spanning tree and k-core decomposition. The analysis was performed for each classical brain rhythm separately. Highest classification rates from k-core decomposition were obtained in the gamma (EER = 0.130, AUC = 0.943) and high beta (EER = 0.172, AUC = 0.905) frequency bands. These results confirm that EEG analysis may represent an effective tool to identify subject-specific characteristics that may be of great impact for several bioengineering applications. However, despite the widespread use of these techniques, critical aspects should be considered when dealing with results from high-frequency scalp EEG.

The main contributions of this paper are twofold. a) Investigation of the predictability of facial micro-expressions from EEG. b) Identification of the relevant features to the prediction. To reach our objectives, an experiment was conducted and we have proceeded in three steps: i) We recorded facial expressions and the corresponding EEG signals of participant while he/she is looking at pictures stimuli from the IAPS (International Affective Picture System). ii) We fed machine learning algorithms with time-domain and frequency-domain features of one second EEG signals with also the corresponding facial expression data as ground truth in the training phase. iii) Using the trained classifiers, we predict facial emotional reactions without the need to a camera. Our method leads us to very promising results since we have reached high accuracy. It also provides an additional important result by locating which electrodes can be used to characterize specific emotion. This system will be particularly useful to evaluate emotional reactions in virtual reality environments where the user is wearing VR headset that hides the face and makes the traditional webcam facial expression detectors obsolete.

In this study, we describe an algorithm for motor imagery (MI) classification of electrocorticogram (ECoG)-based BCI. The proposed approach employs multi-resolution fractal measures and local binary pattern (LBP) operators to form a combined feature for characterizing an ECoG epoch recording from the right hemisphere of the brain. A classifier is trained by using the gradient boosting in conjunction with ordinary least squares (OLS) method. The fractal intercept, lacunarity and LBP features are extracted to classify imagined movements of either the left small finger or the tongue. Experimental results on dataset I of BCI competition III demonstrate the superior performance of our method. The cross-validation accuracy and accuracy is 90.6% and 95%, respectively. Furthermore, the low computational burden of this method makes it a promising candidate for real-time BCI systems.

In this study we aimed for the classification of operator workload as it is expected in many real-life workplace environments. We explored brain-signal based workload predictors that differ with respect to the level of label information required for training, including entirely unsupervised approaches. Approach. Subjects executed a task on a touch screen that required continuous effort of visual and motor processing with alternating difficulty. We first employed classical approaches for workload state classification that operate on the sensor space of EEG and compared those to the performance of three state-of-the-art spatial filtering methods: common spatial patterns (CSPs) analysis, which requires binary label information; source power co-modulation (SPoC) analysis, which uses the subjects' error rate as a target function; and canonical SPoC (cSPoC) analysis, which solely makes use of cross-frequency power correlations induced by different states of workload and thus represents an unsupervised approach. Finally, we investigated the effects of fusing brain signals and peripheral physiological measures (PPMs) and examined the added value for improving classification performance. Main results. Mean classification accuracies of 94%, 92% and 82% were achieved with CSP, SPoC, cSPoC, respectively. These methods outperformed the approaches that did not use spatial filtering and they extracted physiologically plausible components. The performance of the unsupervised cSPoC is significantly increased by augmenting it with PPM features. Significance. Our analyses ensured that the signal sources used for classification were of cortical origin and not contaminated with artifacts. Our findings show that workload states can be successfully differentiated from brain signals, even when less and less information from the experimental paradigm is used, thus paving the way for real-world applications in which label information may be noisy or entirely unavailable.

Studying electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from their associated covariance matrices allows the construction of a representation which is invariant to extrinsic perturbations. As covariance matrices should be estimated, this paper first presents a thorough study of all estimators conducted on real EEG recording. Working in Euclidean space with covariance matrices is known to be error-prone, one might take advantage of algorithmic advances in Riemannian geometry and matrix manifold to implement methods for Symmetric Positive-Definite (SPD) matrices. Nonetheless, existing classification algorithms in Riemannian spaces are designed for offline analysis. We propose a novel algorithm for online and asynchronous processing of brain signals, borrowing principles from semi-unsupervised approaches and following a dynamic stopping scheme to provide a prediction as soon as possible. The assessment is conducted on real EEG recording: this is the first study on Steady State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) experimentations to exploit online classification based on Riemannian geometry. The proposed online algorithm is evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art SSVEP methods, which are based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). It is shown to improve both the classification accuracy and the information transfer rate in the online and asynchronous setup. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results show that SRP_DET of aMCI group has significantly higher values at 12 electrodes, which indicates an increase of EEG regularity in the temporal and occipital regions, but PRP_DET values only at one electrode C4. Correlation analysis shows that SRP_DET is strictly negative correlated to MoCA and memory functions at electrodes P4, whereas PRP_DET is not found to be correlated. Therefore, SRP_DET is suggested to be an effective index to understand the deterministic characteristics of cognitive impairment in T2DM. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

So far, various automatic music genre classification methods have been proposed based on various audio features. However, such content-centric features are not capable of capturing the personal preferences of the listener. In this study, we provide preliminary experimental evidence for the possibility of the music genre classification based on the brain recorded signals of individuals. The brain decoding paradigm is employed to classify recorded brain signals into two broad genre classes: Pop and Rock. We compare the performance of our proposed paradigm on two neuroimaging datasets that contains the electroencephalographic (EEG) and the magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data of subjects who watched 40 music video clips. Our results indicate that the genre of the music clips can be retrieved significantly over the chance-level using the brain signals. Our study provides a primary step towards user-centric music content retrieval by exploiting brain signals.

Sleep analysis is a necessary process for the majority of sleep disorders diagnosis. In this work we propose to analyze brain activity through Electroencephalogram analysis in order to identify sleep stages variation. We focus on the classification phase. Most works in sleep stages classification are based on prior experts signal scoring which is a hard task. So many available unlabeled data remain unused. To explore more these data and enrich the study of sleep classification, we propose a hybrid approach based on learning classifier systems and artificial neural networks. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was investigated using real eelectroencephalography data. Good results were reached comparing to supervised learning methods usually used. The proposed approach provides also, an explicit model that could be analyzed a posteriori by experts.

Emotion recognition, thus, plays an important role in the design of HMI. Electroencephalogram (EEG) shows the internal emotional state changes of a person very effectively as compared to other traditional methods such as face recognition, gesture recognition, speech recognition, etc. Thus, EEG has gained the attention of researchers in recent years for recording brain activity in HMI design. Emotion recognition can be regarded as a pattern recognition task, hence it includes basic steps likes preprocessing, feature extraction and feature classification. Many different techniques exist for extracting important features from the EEG signal such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Statistical features, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Frequency domain feature extraction using Fourier Transform (FT), Short time Fourier Transform (STFT), etc. The techniques implemented in this paper are Higher Order Crossings (HOC), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Hjorth features. A comparative study of these methods is undertaken.	[Patil, Anita; Panat, A.

J	Yang, BH; Li, HR; Wang, Q; Zhang, YY				Yang, Banghua; Li, Huarong; Wang, Qian; Zhang, Yunyuan			Subject-based feature extraction by using fisher WPD-CSP in brain-computer interfaces	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Wavelet packet decomposition (WPD); Common spatial patterns (CSP); Fisher distance; Brain-computer interface (BCI); Electroencephalogram (EEG); Feature extraction	WAVELET PACKET	Background and objective: Feature extraction of electroencephalogram (EEG) plays a vital role in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). In recent years, common spatial pattern (CSP) has been proven to be an effective feature extraction method. However, the traditional CSP has disadvantages of requiring a lot of input channels and the lack of frequency information. In order to remedy the defects of CSP, wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and CSP are combined to extract effective features. But WPD-CSP method considers less about extracting specific features that are fitted for the specific subject. So a subject-based feature extraction method using fisher WPD-CSP is proposed in this paper. Methods: The idea of proposed method is to adapt fisher WPD-CSP to each subject separately. It mainly includes the following six steps: (1) original EEG signals from all channels are decomposed into a series of sub-bands using WPD; (2) average power values of obtained sub-bands are computed; (3) the specified sub-bands with larger values of fisher distance according to average power are selected for that particular subject; (4) each selected sub band is reconstructed to be regarded as a new EEG channel; (5) all new EEG channels are used as input of the CSP and a six-dimensional feature vector is obtained by the CSP. The subject-based feature extraction model is so formed; (6) the probabilistic neural network (PNN) is used as the classifier and the classification accuracy is obtained. Results: Data from six subjects are processed by the subject-based fisher WPD-CSP, the non-subject-based fisher WPD-CSP and WPD-CSP, respectively. Compared with non-subject based fisher WPD-CSP and WPD-CSP, the results show that the proposed method yields better performance (sensitivity: 88.7 +/- 0.9%, and specificity: 91 +/- 1%) and the classification accuracy from subject-based fisher WPD-CSP is increased by 6-12% and 14%, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed subject-based fisher WPD-CSP method can not only remedy disadvantages of CSP by WPD but also discriminate helpless sub-bands for each subject and make remaining fewer sub-bands keep better separability by fisher distance, which leads to a higher classification accuracy than WPD-CSP method.

Improving Decoding of the Mental Activities in BCI Systems using Overlapping FBCSP	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH			English	Article						BCI; motor imagery; FBCSP; overlapped FBCSP	SINGLE TRIAL EEG; CLASSIFICATION	Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is an external channel from brain to the human organs. Therefore, BCI facilitate the disabled people to move their limbs. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of BCI recording signals which has high temporal resolution with low spatial resolution. Some researchers proposed common spatial filters to overcome the spatial resolution deficiency. However, these filters are highly sensitive to the CSP frequency band and, may decline the BCI performance. Many researchers increased the BCI performance by using filter bank CSP. They utilized a bank of band-pass filters to separate CSP in each band. However selecting of the number and the range of each frequency band becomes troubles ome.In this research work we utilized FBCSP with flexible overlapping frequency bands to enhance the decoding mental activities performance. The simulation results indicate that our proposed technique provides better classification performance (kappa=0.62 with respect to the best kappa=0.57 for the winner).

One popular method people frequently use to reduce their tension and pressure levels is listening to various types of relaxing music. However, the Quran is composed of Allah's words, which were ultimately given for the benefit of humanity. Muslims strongly believe that listening to or reading the Quran brings them comfort, pleasure and confidence that would otherwise elude them; however, scientific evidence is still required to prove that this belief has a scientific basis. Recently, researchers have used electrophysiology to explore the relationships between electrical phenomena and body processes. This research aims to study and analyse the electrical activity of people's brains and hearts when listening to Quranic recitation compared with listening to relaxing music. Two types of electrophysiology readings are used in this research: electroencephalograms (EEGs) and electrocardiograms (ECGs). An EEG measures brain electrical activity, and an ECG measures heart electrical activity. EEG and ECG data were collected from twenty-five subjects. Then, machine learning algorithms were applied to the EEG and ECG signals. The result showed that Quranic recitation demonstrated a positive transformation of the subjects' emotions: from negative precursor emotions to calmness and happiness conditions denoted by a positive valence for the EEG and ECG signals. In contrast, relaxing music showed a positive transformation with regard to the valence in the EEG analysis; however, with respect to the ECG music data analysis, the results revealed a negative transformation for most of the music tracks.

The brain is a nonlinear dynamic system, imparting randomness and nonlinearity in the EEG signals. The stochastic nature of the brain seeks the paramount importance of understanding the underlying neurophysiology. The nonlinear analysis of the dynamic structure may help to reveal the complex behavior of the brain signals. EEG signal analysis is helpful in various clinical applications to characterize the normal and diseased brain states. The EEG is used in predicting epileptic seizures, classifying the sleep stages, measuring the depth of anesthesia, and detecting the abnormal brain states. With the onset of EEG-based brain-computer interfaces, the characteristics of brain signals are used to control the devices through different mental states. Hence, the need to understand the brain state is important and crucial. In this chapter, the author introduces the theory and methods of chaos theory measurements and its applications in EEG signal analysis. A broad perspective of the techniques and implementation of the Correlation Dimension, Lyapunov Exponents, Fractal Dimension, Approximate Entropy, Sample Entropy, Hurst Exponent, Lempel-Ziv complexity, Hopf Bifurcation Theorem and Higher-order spectra is explained and their usage in EEG signal analysis is mentioned. We suggest that chaos theory provides not only potentially valuable diagnostic information but also a deeper understanding of neuropathological mechanisms underlying the brain in ways that are not possible by conventional linear analysis.

User profiling was created based on the strength of emotional patterns of the subject, which can be used for subject identification. Such system is made based on the emotional states of happiness and sadness, indicated by the electroencephalogram (EEG) data. In this paper, we examine several techniques used for subject profiling or identification purposed. Those techniques include feature extraction and classification techniques. In the experimental study, we compare three techniques for feature extraction namely, Power Spectral Density (PSD), Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). As for classification we compare three classification techniques, they are; Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayesian (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The best result achieved was 59.66%, using the MFCC and MLP-based techniques using 5-fold cross validation. The experiment results indicated that these profiles could be more accurate in identifying subject compared to NB and SVM. The comparisons demonstrated that profile-based methods for subject identification provide a viable and simple alternative to this problem.

A large number of people all over the world are suffering from this disease. Electroencephalogram (EEG) provides electrical activity of the brain signal that enables physicians to diagnose and monitor sleep apnea events. In this paper, an efficient scheme for classifying apnea and non-apnea events of an apnea patient is proposed based on temporal variation of Beta band energy in a frame of EEG data. Unlike conventional approaches, instead of extracting features from the whole frame at a time, a given test frame of EEG signal is divided into overlapping sub-frames and spectral characteristics are extracted from each pre-processed sub-frame. By investigating the spectro-temporal characteristics of all the traditional frequency bands of EEG signal, it is found that the temporal variation of spectral energy in Beta band plays the dominant role in classifying apnea and non-apnea events. Statistical features are extracted from the temporal pattern of Beta band energy and are used in K nearest neighborhood classifier. Extensive experimentation is carried out on several apnea patients with various apnea indices and a very satisfactory apnea detection performance is achieved in comparison to that obtained by some existing methods.

In this paper, we report collection and analysis of a multimodal dataset of Non-EEG physiological signals available in the public domain. We have found this signal set useful for inferring the neurological status of individuals. The data was collected using non-invasive wrist worn biosensors and consists of electrodermal activity (EDA), temperature, acceleration, heart rate (HR), and arterial oxygen level (SpO2). We applied an efficient non-linear dimension reduction technique to visualize the biosignals in a low dimension feature space.

This study presents a direct comparison of a classical EEG cap setup with a new around-the-ear electrode array (cEEGrid) to gain a better understanding of the potential of ear-centered EEG. Approach. Concurrent EEG was recorded from a classical scalp EEG cap and two cEEGrids that were placed around the left and the right ear. Twenty participants performed a spatial auditory attention task in which three sound streams were presented simultaneously. The sound streams were three seconds long and differed in the direction of origin (front, left, right) and the number of beats (3, 4, 5 respectively), as well as the timbre and pitch. The participants had to attend to either the left or the right sound stream. Main results. We found clear attention modulated ERP effects reflecting the attended sound stream for both electrode setups, which agreed in morphology and effect size. A single-trial template matching classification showed that the direction of attention could be decoded significantly above chance (50%) for at least 16 out of 20 participants for both systems. The comparably high classification results of the single trial analysis underline the quality of the signal recorded with the cEEGrids. Significance. These findings are further evidence for the feasibility of around the-ear EEG recordings and demonstrate that well described ERPs can be measured. We conclude that concealed behind-the-ear EEG recordings can be an alternative to classical cap EEG acquisition for auditory attention monitoring.

Brain-machine interfaces (BMI) can be used as a natural control method for such technologies. BMI provides a continuous association between the brain activity and peripheral stimulation, with the potential to induce plastic changes in the nervous system. Paraplegic patients, and especially the ones with incomplete injuries, constitute a potential target population to be rehabilitated with brain-controlled robotic systems, as they may improve their gait function after the reinforcement of their spared intact neural pathways. This paper proposes a closed-loop BMI system to control an ambulatory exoskeleton without any weight or balance support for gait rehabilitation of incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) patients. The integrated system was validated with three healthy subjects, and its viability in a clinical scenario was tested with four SCI patients. Using a cue-guided paradigm, the electroencephalographic signals of the subjects were used to decode their gait intention and to trigger the movements of the exoskeleton. We designed a protocol with a special emphasis on safety, as patients with poor balance were required to stand and walk. We continuously monitored their fatigue and exertion level, and conducted usability and user-satisfaction tests after the experiments. The results show that, for the three healthy subjects, 84.44 +/- 14.56% of the trials were correctly decoded. Three out of four patients performed at least one successful BMI session, with an average performance of 77.6 1 +/- 14.72%. The shared control strategy implemented (i.e., the exoskeleton could only move during specific periods of time) was effective in preventing unexpected movements during periods in which patients were asked to relax. On average, 55.22 +/- 16.69% and 40.45 +/- 16.98% of the trials (for healthy subjects and patients, respectively) would have suffered from unexpected activations (i.e., false positives) without the proposed control strategy. All the patients showed low exertion and fatigue levels during the performance of the experiments. This paper constitutes a proof-of-concept study to validate the feasibility of a BMI to control an ambulatory exoskeleton by patients with incomplete paraplegia (i.e., patients with good prognosis for gait rehabilitation).

The proposed system utilizes the fact that entropy based measures for the EEG segments during epileptic seizure are lower than in normal EEG. The new suggested model better tracks abrupt changes in the signal and assigns less complexity to segments that exhibit regularity or are subjected to noise effects. The Weighted Permutation Entropy algorithm relies on the ordinal pattern of the time series along with the amplitudes of its sample points. The proposed technique is implemented and tested on hundreds real EEG signals and the performance is compared based on sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Various experiments have been applied in different scenarios including healthy with eyes open, healthy with eyes closed, epileptic patients during no-seizure state from two different location of the brain. Other scenarios have been applied accompanied by background simulated noise resulting from physiological and environmental artifacts. Results showed outstanding performance and revealed promising results in terms of discrimination of seizure and seizure-free segments. It also manifests high robustness against noise sources.

This reduction of spatial information strongly hampers single-trial analysis of EEG data as, for example, required for brain-computer interfacing (BCI) when using features from spontaneous brain rhythms. Spatial filtering techniques are therefore greatly needed to extract meaningful information from EEG. Our goal is to show, in online operation, that common spatial pattern patches (CSPP) are valuable to counteract this problem. Approach: Even though the effect of spatial mixing can be encountered by spatial filters, there is a trade-off between performance and the requirement of calibration data. Laplacian derivations do not require calibration data at all, but their performance for single-trial classification is limited. Conversely, data-driven spatial filters, such as common spatial patterns (CSP), can lead to highly distinctive features; however they require a considerable amount of training data. Recently, we showed in an offline analysis that CSPP can establish a valuable compromise. In this paper, we confirm these results in an online BCI study. In order to demonstrate the paramount feature that CSPP requires little training data, we used them in an adaptive setting with 20 participants and focused on users who did not have success with previous BCI approaches. Main results: The results of the study show that CSPP adapts faster and thereby allows users to achieve better feedback within a shorter time than previous approaches performed with Laplacian derivations and CSP filters. The success of the experiment highlights that CSPP has the potential to further reduce BCI inefficiency. Significance: CSPP are a valuable compromise between CSP and Laplacian filters. They allow users to attain better feedback within a shorter time and thus reduce BCI inefficiency to one-fourth in comparison to previous non-adaptive paradigms.

Currently, there are many devices that allow gathering biometric measurements from human beings, such as EEG Headsets or Health Bracelets. The massive data sets generated by tracking of EEG and physiology may be used, among other things, to infer knowledge about human moods and emotions. Apart from direct biometric signal measurement, eye tracking systems are nowadays capable of determining the point of gaze of the users when interacting in ICT environments, which provides an added value research on many different areas, such as psychology or marketing. We present a process in which devices for eye tracking, biometric, and EEG signal measurements are synchronously used for studying both basic and complex emotions. We selected the least intrusive devices for different signal data collection given the study requirements and cost constraints, so users would behave in the most natural way possible. On the one hand, we have been able to determine basic emotions participants were experiencing by means of valence and arousal. On the other hand, a complex emotion such as empathy has also been detected. To validate the usefulness of this approach, a study involving forty-four people has been carried out, where they were exposed to a series of affective stimuli while their EEG activity, biometric signals, and eye position were synchronously recorded to detect self-regulation. The hypothesis of the work was that people who self-regulated would show significantly different results when analyzing their EEG data. Participants were divided into two groups depending on whether Electro Dermal Activity (EDA) data indicated they self-regulated or not. The comparison of the results obtained using different machine learning algorithms for emotion recognition shows that using EEG activity alone as a predictor for self-regulation does not allow properly determining whether a person in self-regulation its emotions while watching affective stimuli. However, adequately combining different data sources in a synchronous way to detect emotions makes it possible to overcome the limitations of single detection methods.

Reporting of results on favourable datasets and sampling error in the estimated performance measures based on single samples are thought to be the major sources of bias in such comparisons. Better performance in one or a few instances does not necessarily imply so on an average or on a population level and simulation studies may be a better alternative for objectively comparing the performances of machine learning algorithms. Methods We compare the classification performance of a number of important and widely used machine learning algorithms, namely the Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN). Using massively parallel processing on high-performance supercomputers, we compare the generalisation errors at various combinations of levels of several factors: number of features, training sample size, biological variation, experimental variation, effect size, replication and correlation between features. Results For smaller number of correlated features, number of features not exceeding approximately half the sample size, LDA was found to be the method of choice in terms of average generalisation errors as well as stability (precision) of error estimates. SVM (with RBF kernel) outperforms LDA as well as RF and kNN by a clear margin as the feature set gets larger provided the sample size is not too small (at least 20). The performance of kNN also improves as the number of features grows and outplays that of LDA and RF unless the data variability is too high and/or effect sizes are too small. RF was found to outperform only kNN in some instances where the data are more variable and have smaller effect sizes, in which cases it also provide more stable error estimates than kNN and LDA. Applications to a number of real datasets supported the findings from the simulation study.

J	Jafakesh, S; Jahromy, FZ; Daliri, MR				Jafakesh, Sara; Jahromy, Fatemeh Zareayan; Daliri, Mohammad Reza			Decoding of object categories from brain signals using cross frequency coupling methods	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						EEG; Object categorization; Cross Frequency Coupling (CFC); Phase-Phase Coupling (PPC); Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC); Amplitude-Amplitude Coupling (AAC); SVM classifier	GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; THETA-PHASE; OSCILLATIONS; CORTEX; EEG; REPRESENTATION; ORGANIZATION; RECOGNITION; ARTIFACTS; SYNCHRONY	The procedure by which information about conceptual category of visual objects is encoded in brain signals, is the topic of many studies in the field of visual system. A phenomenon that is recently mentioned as one of information encoding strategies in the brain is cross frequency coupling (CFC), means the interactions between different frequency bands in physiological signals such as EEG. This interaction can occur between various components of such signals including amplitude or power, phase and frequency. Different types of CFC have been reported in various cognitive tasks and within or between different brain regions. However the role of CFC in encoding of information about the category of visual objects is greatly unknown and here we attempted to investigate it. So in this paper, we used machine learning algorithms to find out whether CFC contains such information. To this end, we recorded EEG from 10 participants while they were observing stimuli from 12 different visual object categories. Then amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC), phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and phase-phase coupling (PPC) within each electrode were calculated for the recorded signals in order to use them as input to SVM classifier. The results show that phase-phase coupling can provide more information about the category of objects compared to other types of CFC, by classification performance of 92.33% against 70.28% and 60.52% for phase-amplitude and amplitude-amplitude coupling, respectively. In addition, this feature was more informative when occurred between alpha and gamma frequency bands. The performance of classification by means of CFC features was then compared with the result of classification by wavelet transform on the same data. We observed that PAC can improve the performance of categorical-based classification relative to wavelet coefficients (with the performance of 70.73%). So we can conclude that cross frequency coupling encompass useful information about semantic category of stimuli which is not available in time-frequency components of the signal obtained by wavelet transform.

Existing Machine Learning (ML) approaches known from the literature require the user to set and experimentally adjust parameters of a decision model to achieve the best result. When artificial neural networks (ANNs) are employed, a typical problem is setting of a proper network structure and learning parameters that are required to minimise possible over-fitting. We propose a new evolutionary strategy of learning an ANN structure of a near optimal connectivity from the given data and show that such structures are less prone to over-fitting. The proposed method starts to learn with one input variable and one neuron and then adds a new input and a new neuron to the network while its validation error decreases. The resultant ANN consists of a reasonably small number of neurons that are concisely described by a set of short-term polynomial functions of variables that make a distinct contribution to the output. The proposed technique has been tested on the ML benchmarks and the results showed that the performance is comparable with that obtained by the conventional ML methods that require ad hoc tuning.

Non-invasive measurement of human neural activity based on the scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) allows for the development of biomedical devices that interface with the nervous system for scientific, diagnostic, therapeutic, or restorative purposes. However, EEG recordings are often considered as prone to physiological and non physiological artifacts of different types and frequency characteristics. Among them, ocular artifacts and signal drifts represent major sources of EEG contamination, particularly in real-time closed -loop brain machine interface (BMI) applications, which require effective handling of these artifacts across sessions and in natural settings. Approach. We extend the usage of a robust adaptive noise cancelling (ANC) scheme (H-infinity filtering) for removal of eye blinks, eye motions, amplitude drifts and recording biases simultaneously. We also characterize the volume conduction, by estimating the signal propagation levels across all EEG scalp recording areas due to ocular artifact generators. We find that the amplitude and spatial distribution of ocular artifacts vary greatly depending on the electrode location. Therefore, fixed filtering parameters for all recording areas would naturally hinder the true overall performance of an ANC scheme for artifact removal. We treat each electrode as a separate sub-system to be filtered, and without the loss of generality, they are assumed to be uncorrelated and uncoupled. Main results. Our results show over 95-99.9% correlation between the raw and processed signals at non -ocular artifact regions, and depending on the contamination profile, 40-70% correlation when ocular artifacts are dominant. We also compare our results with the offline independent component analysis and artifact subspace reconstruction methods, and show that some local quantities are handled better by our sample -adaptive real-time framework. Decoding performance is also compared with multi -day experimental data from 2 subjects, totaling 19 sessions, with and without H filtering of the raw data. Significance. The proposed method allows real-time adaptive artifact removal for EEG-based closed-loop BMI applications and mobile EEG studies in general, thereby increasing the range of tasks that can be studied in action and context while reducing the need for discarding data due to artifacts. Significant increase in decoding performances also justify the effectiveness of the method to be used in real-time closed -loop BMI applications.

J	Dogan, B				Dogan, Berat			Optimized spatial filters as a new method for mass spectrometry-based cancer diagnosis	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Common spatial patterns; Mass spectrometry; Spectroscopy; Cancer diagnosis	DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; CLASSIFICATION; TRANSFORM; PATTERNS	In the past two decades, mass spectrometry-based identification of serum proteomic patterns has emerged as a new diagnostic tool for the early detection of various types of cancers. However, due to its high dimensionality, the analysis of mass spectrometry data poses considerable challenges. Existing methods proposed for the analysis of mass spectrometry data usually consist of a number of steps. In this study, a comparatively simple but efficient method, namely, an optimal spatial filter (OSF) method, is proposed for the classification of mass spectrometry data. The newly proposed method is based on the theory of common spatial patterns (CSPs), which are widely used to classify motor imagery EEG signals in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. The CSP method aims to find spatial filters to project the data into a new space in which optimal discrimination between classes is achieved. Although it has been shown that the CSP method performs quite well in classifying motor imagery EEG signals, it has a major drawback. In the CSP method, the between-class variance is maximized, but the minimization of within-class variance is ignored. As a result, the projected data may have large within-class variances. To overcome this problem, in this study, optimal filters are found by using the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. For the fitness function of the differential evolution algorithm, a divergence analysis is used. In the divergence analysis, both the between-class and within-class distributions of the projected data are considered. The experimental results obtained using publicly available mass spectrometry datasets showed that, when compared to existing methods, the proposed OSF method is quite simple and achieves the minimum classification error for each dataset. Furthermore, the proposed OSF method highlights the importance of certain parts of the spectra, which is highly valuable for the identification of biomarkers that lie outside the pathological pathway of the disease.

Though existing approaches for authentication are user-friendly, they have vulnerabilities such as the possibility & criminally threatening a user. We propose a novel approach which uses Electroencephalogram ( EEG) brain signals for an authentication process. Unique features of EEG data for distinguishing brain activities can potentially be used to authenticate a user. Compared to other biometric systems, this approach is very robust and more secure because response is significantly changed according to instantaneous mental condition. In the proposed approach, the system user is asked to visualize a number while corresponding EEG signals are captured. Captured signals are used to train the system, compared in the authentication process. This approach mainly focuses on the 8 to 30 Hz Alpha and Beta combined frequency band across all EEG channels, since it is the most appropriate band for EEG signals in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) values were used as main features to train the model. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used as a classification algorithm for a given set of user data. A trained set of models for each user is embedded in the system as a parameter database. Each user selects the profile attached to their trained model before the authentication session. Eventually, a trained model can authenticate a user after memorization of pre-determined four digits which the user is asked to think at the first stage of the process. The maximum accuracy recorded with the existing data was 96.97%.

Our proposal uses delta, theta, alfa and beta rhythms to BCI system. From the spectral power, an efficient combination of ERD/ERS/laterality features was used. Because electroencephalogram signals are non-stationary type and highly vary over time and frequency, a detailed time-frequency analysis is applied. Features coming from time-frequency analysis, where eight frequency bands ranging from 0 to 32 Hz were chosen. Features vectors are classified by Gaussian classifier and the final performance is evaluated in cross-validation scheme. This novel approach was tested using the BCI competition IV data set 1. The detection of the left and right hand motor imagery task was very good, with a result of 96.4% using BCI-Competition -IV. When comparing results from others competing methods reported in the literature, our approach resulted the best and useful to create a self-paced BCI-system.

Although many systems and solutions are currently available, still there is much left unsettled and some technologies are missing from many VR/AR devices, such as foveated rendering and HCI. In this paper a novel approach for coarse gaze estimation using EEG sensors with applications in items selection for HCI or foveated rendering for VR/AR devices is proposed. The suggested method requires only few electroencephalogram sensors that can be easily added to the current virtual and augmented reality headsets. A supervised machine leaning approach was suggested utilising novel features, based on quaternions allowing gaze estimation. Experiments were performed to evaluate the proposed method and a new dataset was designed and captured.

Recently, single-trial sigma-bursts were detected in human scalp EEG using 29-channel low-noise recordings in an electromagnetically shielded room. To achieve clinical applicability, this study aimed to establish a protocol using only 8 EEG channels in an unshielded environment and to quantify the variability of sigma-bursts. Methods: Median nerve SEPs were recorded in 10 healthy subjects using a custom-built low-noise EEG amplifier. A detection algorithm for single-trial sigma-bursts was trained as combination of spatiotemporal filters and a non-linear classifier. The single-trial responses were probed for the presence of significant increases of amplitude and variability. Results: Single-trial sigma-burst detection succeeded with Detection Rates and Positive Predictive Values above 80% in subjects with high SNR. A significant inter-trial variability in the amplitudes of early low-frequency SEPs and sigma-bursts could be demonstrated. Conclusions: Single-trial sigma-bursts can be detected on scalp-EEG using only 8 EEG channels in an electromagnetically disturbed environment. The combination of dedicated hardware and detection algorithms allows quantifying and describing their variability. Significance: The variability of population spikes in the human somatosensory cortex can be traced non-invasively in a clinical setting. (c) 2015 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

A novel approach to signal classification with an application to identifying the alcoholic brain	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Evolutionary computation; EEG; Signal processing; Temporal pattern detectors; Evoked response potentials	SELECTION; SUBSET	We introduce a novel approach to signal classification based on evolving temporal pattern detectors (TPDs) that can find the occurrences of embedded temporal structures in discrete time signals and illustrate its application to characterizing the alcoholic brain using visually evoked response potentials. In contrast to conventional techniques used for most signal classification tasks, this approach unifies the feature extraction and classification steps. It makes no prior assumptions regarding the spectral characteristics of the data; it merely assumes that some temporal patterns exist that distinguish two classes of signals and therefore could be applied to new signal classification tasks where a body of prior work identifying important features does not exist. Evolutionary computation (EC) discovers a classifier by simply learning from the time series samples. The alcoholic classification (AC) problem consists of 2 sub-tasks, one spatial and one temporal: choosing a subset of electroencephalogram leads used to create a composite signal (the spatial task), and detecting temporal patterns in this signal that are more prevalent in the alcoholics than the controls (the temporal task). To accomplish this, a novel representation and crossover operator were devised that enable multiple feature subset tasks to be solved concurrently. Three TPD techniques are presented that differ in the mechanism by which partial credit is assigned to temporal patterns that deviate from the specified pattern. An EC approach is used for evolving a subset of sensors and the TPD specifications. We found evidence that partial credit does help evolutionary discovery. Regions on the skull of an alcoholic subject that produced abnormal electrical activity compared to the controls were located. These regions were consistent with prior findings in the literature. The classification accuracy was measured as the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC); the ROC area for the training set varied from 90.32% to 98.83% and for the testing set it varied from 87.17% to 95.9%.

It is referred to as IT2FIS-EKF. This algorithm realizes the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang inference mechanism in a five layered architecture. It starts with no rules and evolves the structure automatically. The sequential learning algorithm regulates the learning process by selecting appropriate learning strategies to evolve the architecture and estimate the antecedent/consequent parameters. The performance of IT2FIS-EKF is evaluated on a set of benchmark classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository. Results show superior performance of IT2FIS-EKF in comparison to other fuzzy neural networks due fully adaptive nature of learning algorithm. Further, IT2FIS-EKF is applied to a practical problem of classification of motor-imagery tasks in motor-imagery based brain computer interface (BCI). Performance is evaluated using the publicly available BCI competition dataset. Results indicate superior performance of IT2FIS-EKF making it suitable for BCI.	[Das, A.

This paper investigates a method for classifying the speed of arm movements from EEG recordings of healthy subjects under the assumption that the intention level of a patient may be reflected in motor task execution velocity. Experimental data were collected from eight (four male, four female) healthy volunteers while they were performing right arm movements at two different speeds. We designed an experiment in which the subjects were asked to carry a glass cup in two different environments: nail or cotton. The task speeds for both environments were decided individually by the volunteers; however the nail environment had a maximum speed limit. Participants were warned by a crashing glass audio stimulus if they exceeded the speed limit of the nail environment. As a result, a simple daily life activity was performed at two different speeds as an experimental task. Based on experimental data from eight healthy subjects, we successfully classified two different speed levels and resting state from event related synchronization (ERS) and event related desynchronization (ERD) patterns of EEG signals by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. Results reveal that LDA can discriminate different velocity levels when six frequency bands of three EEG recording channels were used as the feature vector.

After the electroencephalogram measurements are complete, alertness, transient, and drowsy periods are classified according to alpha spectrum changes and alpha-blocking phenomena. Although the subject's eyes are open, alpha spectrum changes such as drowsiness patterns are detected. Consequently, drowsiness detection with eyes open is applied into the proposed system. The neural network based proposed method shows that LPC (linear predictive coding) coefficients are the proper feature vectors and average classification rate is about 92%.

Conventional approaches use sensor space EEG for classifying movement related tasks. Sensor-space EEG can reveal only limited information about the trivial but complex tasks that involve higher degrees of freedom of the movement. On the contrary, source space analysis is expected to provide more information about the neurophysiological mechanism relevant to the task. To this end, we propose a novel source-space feature extraction technique based on supervised locality sensitive Factor analysis which approximates the neurophysiological functioning of our experimental data in a better way than that of a solely data-driven approach. EEG recordings in the sensor space are transformed into source space using the Weighted Minimum Norm Estimate (wMNE) method. We show that for a multi-class classification problem of classifying the EEG of voluntary arm movement in 4 orthogonal directions, the source space features offer a significant improvement in the classification accuracy compared to sensor space features. One-versus-rest (OVR) approach is used for multiclass classification with Fisher's Linear Discriminant (FLD) as the primary classifier.

LDAs popularity derives from its simplicity and its competitive classification performance, which has been reported for various types of neuroimaging data. Yet the standard LDA approach proves less than optimal for binary classification problems when additional label information (i.e. subclass labels) is present. Subclass labels allow to model structure in the data, which can be used to facilitate the classification task. In this paper, we illustrate how neuroimaging data exhibit subclass labels that may contain valuable information. We also show that the standard LDA classifier is unable to exploit subclass labels. We introduce a novel method that allows subclass labels to be incorporated efficiently into the classifier. The novel method, which we call Relevance Subclass LDA (RSLDA), computes an individual classification hyperplane for each subclass. It is based on regularized estimators of the subclass mean and uses other subclasses as regularization targets. We demonstrate the applicability and performance of our method on data drawn from two different neuroimaging modalities: (I) EEG data from brain-computer interfacing with event-related potentials, and (II) fMRI data in response to different levels of visual motion. We show that RSLDA outperforms the standard LDA approach for both types of datasets. These findings illustrate the benefits of exploiting subclass structure in neuroimaging data. Finally, we show that our classifier also outputs regularization profiles, enabling researchers to interpret the subclass structure in a meaningful way. RSLDA therefore yields increased classification accuracy as well as a better interpretation of neuroimaging data. Since both results are highly favorable, we suggest to apply RSLDA for various classification problems within neuroimaging and beyond. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is a basis for the operation of many biosensors used for the measurement of bioelectromagnetical phenomena. An electroencephalograph (EEG) used for the recording and monitoring the bioelectrical activity of brain is an excellent example of such devices. Due to the volume conduction an overlapping of the contribution to each electrode channel from neighbouring bioelectrical sources is present. As a result raw EEG scalp potentials are characterized by weak spatial resolution. Owning to described reasons raw, multichannel EEG recordings tend to provide an unclear image of the brain activity. In this study the influence of applying 2D window function to the neighbourhood of each electrode before removal of common reference locally is examined. The Local Spatial Filters focus on removing the common signal of electrodes in a specific neighbourhood of the electrode of interest. The performance of algorithm is examined in the task of eliminating source overlapping from EEG-based BCI system recordings and compared with classic approaches such as Common Average Reference (CAR), Surface Laplacian (SL) and Common Spatial Pattern (CSP). For the better evaluation of performance of proposed approaches performance, their effectiveness is tested during the classification of the dataset IVa provided for the "BCI Competition III" organized by the Berlin Brain-Computer Interface group.

The platform has been tested in a single session with a stroke patient. The results show how the patient could successfully interact with the BMI and command the assistance of the hybrid system with low latencies.

Moreover, the implementation of an epilepsy monitoring device that has low power and is portable requires a reliable and successful seizure detection scheme. In this work, the problem of automated epilepsy seizure detection using singe-channel EEG signals has been addressed. Methods: At first, segments of EEG signals are decomposed using a newly proposed signal processing scheme, namely complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). Six spectral moments are extracted from the CEEMDAN mode functions and train and test matrices are formed afterward. These matrices are fed into the classifier to identify epileptic seizures from EEG signal segments. In this work, we implement an ensemble learning based machine learning algorithm, namely linear programming boosting (LPBoost) to perform classification. Results: The efficacy of spectral features in the CEEMDAN domain is validated by graphical and statistical analyses. The performance of CEEMDAN is compared to those of its predecessors to further inspect its suitability. The effectiveness and the appropriateness of LPBoost are demonstrated as opposed to the commonly used classification models. Resubstitution and 10 fold cross-validation error analyses confirm the superior algorithm performance of the proposed scheme. The algorithmic performance of our epilepsy seizure identification scheme is also evaluated against state-of-the-art works in the literature. Experimental outcomes manifest that the proposed seizure detection scheme performs better than the existing works in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen's Kappa coefficient. Conclusion: It can be anticipated that owing to its use of only one channel of EEG signal, the proposed method will be suitable for device implementation, eliminate the onus of clinicians for analyzing a large bulk of data manually, and expedite epilepsy diagnosis.

To increase the number of selectable targets, joint frequency and phase-coding is sometimes used but it has only been tested in offline settings. In this study, we report on an online, hierarchical SSVEP spelling application that relies on joint frequency-phase coded targets, and, in addition, propose a new decoding scheme based on spatiotemporal beamforming combined with time-domain EEG analysis. Experiments on 17 healthy subjects confirm that with our new decoding scheme, accurate spelling can be performed in an online setting, even when using short stimulation lengths (1 sec) and closely separated stimulation frequencies (1 Hz).

While human-autonomy fusion Of physiological data and computer vision have been shown to improve classification during visual search tasks, to date these approaches have relied on separately trained classification models for each modality. We aim to improve human-autonomy classification performance by developing a single framework that builds codependent models of human electroencephalograph (EEG) and image data to generate fused target estimates. As a first step, we developed a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and applied it to EEG recordings of subjects classifying target and non-target image presentations during a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) image triage task. The low signal-to-noise ratio (SNI) of EEG inherently limits the accuracy of single-trial classification and when combined with the high dimensionality of FIX; recordings, extremely large training sets are needed to prevent overfitting and achieve accurate classification from raw EEG data. This paper explores a new deep CNN architecture for generalized multi-class, single trial EEG classification across subjects. We compare classification performance from the generalized CNN architecture trained across all subjects to the individualized XDAWN, HDCA, and CSP neural classifiers which are trained and tested on single subjects. Preliminary results show that our CNN meets and slightly exceeds the performance of the other classifiers despite being trained across subjects.

The dream of fully functional prosthetic limbs depicts a great opportunity towards this vision. One of the main challenges is to create a control algorithm which processes physiological signals of the human body and moves the prosthetic limb according to the user's intentions. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are popular subjects of research worldwide in the view of prosthesis control. Building mostly on EEG (electroencephalogram) signals, such systems must perform a challenging task -extracting control information from a signal with extremely low signal-to-noise ratio. Various digital signal processing and machine learning algorithms have been published in the past few years, but there is still no clear candidate for the title of the best one for e.g. detecting hand movement intention. In this paper various algorithms are compared on the example of detecting hand movement from EEG signals in real-time. The first goal of this paper is to present a couple of promising methods from other researchers in the past years, along with demonstrating the performance of other algorithms on a certain grasp-and-lift task. Another goal of the paper is to outline a future direction for the research of movement intent detection algorithms.

Improved multi-stage neonatal seizure detection using a heuristic classifier and a data-driven post-processor	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Automated neonatal seizure detection; Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; Machine learning; Support vector machines	CEREBRAL FUNCTION; EEG; ALGORITHM; SYSTEM	Objective: After identifying the most seizure-relevant characteristics by a previously developed heuristic classifier, a data-driven post-processor using a novel set of features is applied to improve the performance. Methods: The main characteristics of the outputs of the heuristic algorithm are extracted by five sets of features including synchronization, evolution, retention, segment, and signal features. Then, a support vector machine and a decision making layer remove the falsely detected segments. Results: Four datasets including 71 neonates (1023 h, 3493 seizures) recorded in two different university hospitals, are used to train and test the algorithm without removing the dubious seizures. The heuristic method resulted in a false alarm rate of 3.81 per hour and good detection rate of 88% on the entire test databases. The post-processor, effectively reduces the false alarm rate by 34% while the good detection rate decreases by 2%. Conclusion: This post-processing technique improves the performance of the heuristic algorithm. The structure of this post-processor is generic, improves our understanding of the core visually determined EEG features of neonatal seizures and is applicable for other neonatal seizure detectors. Significance: The post-processor significantly decreases the false alarm rate at the expense of a small reduction of the good detection rate.

A study of the electro-haemodynamic coupling using simultaneously acquired intracranial EEG and fMRI data in humans	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Intracranial EEG; BOLD; fMRI; Electro-haemodynamic coupling; Sharp wave	LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL MRI; BOLD FMRI; EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES; FIRING PATTERNS; NEGATIVE BOLD; SHARP WAVES; SIGNAL; RESPONSES	In current fMRI studies designed to map BOLD changes related to interictal epileptiform discharges (IED), which are recorded on simultaneous EEG, the information contained in the morphology and field extent of the EEG events is exclusively used for their classification. Usually, a BOLD predictor based on IED onset times alone is constructed, effectively treating all events as identical. We used intracranial EEG (icEEG)-fMRI data simultaneously recorded in humans to investigate the effect of including any of the features: amplitude, width (duration), slope of the rising phase, energy (area under the curve), or spatial field extent (number of contacts over which the sharp wave was observed) of the fast wave of the IED (the sharp wave), into the BOLD model, to better understand the neurophysiological origin of sharp wave-related BOLD changes, in the immediate vicinity of the recording contacts. Among the features considered, the width was the only one found to explain a significant amount of additional variance, suggesting that the amplitude of the BOLD signal depends more on the duration of the underlying field potential (reflected in the sharp wave width) than on the degree of neuronal activity synchrony (reflected in the sharp wave amplitude), and, consequently, that including inter-event variations of the sharp wave width in the BOLD signal model may increase the sensitivity of forthcoming EEG-fMRI studies of epileptic activity.

We used the ECoG setup to record the electrical activity of cortical and subcortical tumours and then performed frequency and connectivity analyses in order to identify ECoG impairments and map tumours. We selected 16 patients with cortical (8) and subcortical (8) tumours undergoing awake brain surgery. For each patient, we computed the spectral content of tumoural and healthy areas in each frequency band. We computed connectivity of each electrode using connectivity markers (linear and non-linear correlations, phase-locking and coherence). We performed comparisons between healthy and tumour electrodes. The ECoG alterations were used to implement automated classification of the electrodes using clustering or neural network algorithms. ECoG alterations were used to image cortical tumours.Cortical tumours were found to profoundly alter all frequency contents (normalized and absolute power), with an increase in the delta activity and a decreases for the other bands (P < 0.05). Cortical tumour electrodes showed high level of connectivity compared to surrounding electrodes (all markers, P < 0.05). For subcortical tumours, a relative decrease in the gamma 1 band and in the alpha band in absolute amplitude (P < 0.05) were the only abnormalities. The neural network algorithm classification had a good performance: 93.6 % of the electrodes were classified adequately on a test subject. We found significant spectral and connectivity ECoG changes for cortical tumours, which allowed tumour recognition.

For the proposed MI detection technique, two channels of FC5 and FC6 according to 10-20 system over primary motor area are used to recognize 3 mental tasks of tongue, left hand and right hand movements. The amplitude features of EEG signals are extracted from power spectral analysis especially in mu rhythm (8 - 12 Hz) and low beta wave (12 - 16 Hz) bands. MI features were obtained from offline analysis, and then applied to neural network (NN) with particle swarm optimization (PSO). The classification paradigm then applied to real-time BCI for humanoid robot control applications in terms of recognized MI classes from subjects.

Two methods for the smooth prediction, namely Sobolev and Polynomial Penalized Multi-Way Partial Least Squares (PLS) regressions, are proposed. The methods are compared to the Multi-Way Partial Least Squares and Kalman Filter approaches. The comparison demonstrated that the proposed methods combined the prediction accuracy of the algorithms of the PLS family and trajectory smoothness of the Kalman Filter. In addition, the prediction delay is significantly lower for the proposed algorithms than for the Kalman Filter approach. The proposed methods could be applied in a wide range of applications beyond neuroscience.

In Experiment 1, a large sample of healthy participants rated emotional stimuli according to both broad dimensions. Hierarchical cluster analyses performed on these ratings revealed that stimuli were clustered according to their semantic content at the beginning of the agglomerative process. Example semantic themes include food, violence, nudes, death, and objects. Importantly, this pattern occurred in a parallel fashion for ratings on both dimensions. In Experiment 2, we investigated if the same semantic clusters were differentiated at the neurophysiological level. Intracerebral EEG was recorded from 18 patients with intractable epilepsy who viewed the same set of stimuli. Not only did electrocortical responses differentiate between these data-defined semantic clusters, they converged with the behavioral measurements to highlight the importance of categories associated with survival and reproduction. These findings provide strong evidence that the semantic content of affective material influences their classification along the broad dimensions of valence and arousal, and this principle of categorization exerts an effect on the evoked emotional response. Future studies should consider data-driven techniques rather than normative ratings to identify more specific, semantically related emotional images.

J	Zhang, S; Shanbhag, NR				Zhang, Sai; Shanbhag, Naresh R.			Embedded Algorithmic Noise-Tolerance for Signal Processing and Machine Learning Systems via Data Path Decomposition	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Algorithmic noise tolerance; data path decomposition; error resiliency; voltage overscaling; low power; machine learning	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CLASSIFICATION	Low overhead error-resiliency techniques such as algorithmic noise-tolerance (ANT) have been shown to be particularly effective for signal processing and machine learning kernels. However, the overhead of conventional ANT can be as large as 30% due to the use of explicit estimator block. To overcome this overhead, embedded ANT (E-ANT) is proposed [S. Zhang and N. Shanbhag, "Embedded error compensation for energy efficient DSP systems," in Proc. GlobalSIP, Dec. 2014, pp. 30-34], where the estimator is embedded in the main computation block via data path decomposition (DPD). E-ANT reduces the logic overhead to be below 8% as compared with the 20%-30% associated with conventional reduced precision replica (RPR) ANT system while maintaining the same error compensation functionality. DPD was first proposed in our original paper [Zhang and Shanbhag, 2014] where its benefits were studied in the case of a simple multiply-accumulator (MAC) kernel. This paper builds upon [Zhang and Shanbhag, 2014] by 1) providing conditions for the existence of DPD, 2) demonstrating DPD for a variety of commonly employed kernels in signal processing and machine learning applications, and 3) evaluating the robustness improvement and energy savings of DPD at the system level for an SVM-based EEG seizure classification application. Simulation results in a commercial 45 nm CMOS process show that E-ANT can compensate for error rates up to 0.38 for errors in FE only, and 0.17 for errors in FE and CE, while maintain a true positive rate p(tp) > 0.9 and a false positive rate p(fp) <= 0.01. This represents a greater than 3-orders-of-magnitude improvement in error tolerance over the conventional system. This error tolerance is employed to reduce energy via the use of voltage overscaling (VOS). E-ANT is able to achieve 51% energy savings when errors are in FE only, and up to 43% savings when errors are in both FE and CE.

However, robust and natural interaction of subjects with sophisticated prostheses over long periods of time remains a major challenge. To tackle this challenge we can get inspiration from natural motor control, where goal-directed behavior is dynamically modulated by perceptual feedback resulting from executed actions. Current brain-computer interfaces (BCI) partly emulate human motor control as they decode cortical correlates of movement parameters -from onset of a movement to directions to instantaneous velocity-in order to generate the sequence of movements for the neuroprosthesis. A closer look, though, shows that motor control results from the combined activity of the cerebral cortex, subcortical areas and spinal cord. This hierarchical organization supports the hypothesis that complex behaviours can be controlled using the low-dimensional output of a BCI in conjunction with intelligent devices in charge to perform low-level commands. A further component that will facilitate intuitive and natural control of motor neuroprosthetics is the incorporation of rich multimodal feedback and neural correlates of perceptual cognitive processes resulting from this feedback. As in natural motor control, these sources of information can dynamically modulate interaction.	[Millan, J. D.

Spatial filters yield stable features for error-related potentials across conditions	2016 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 09-12, 2016	Budapest, HUNGARY	IEEE			EEG; PERFORMANCE	Error-related potentials (ErrP) have been increasingly studied in psychophysical experiments as well as for brain-machine interfacing. In the latter case, the generalisation capabilities of ErrP decoders is a crucial element to avoid frequent recalibration processes, thus increasing their usability. Previous studies have suggested that ErrP signals are rather stable across recording sessions. Also, studies using protocols of serial stimuli presentation show that these potentials do not change significantly with the presentation rate. Here we complement these studies by analysing the decoding generalisation capabilities. Using data from monitoring experiments, we evaluate how much the performance degrades when tested in a condition different than the one the decoder was trained with. Moreover, we compare different spatial filtering techniques to see which preprocessing steps yield less-sensitive features for ErrP decoding.

Two methods, the model selection based self-training and the confidence criterion, respectively, is also proposed for searching the best parameter pair of SVM and selecting the most useful unlabeled data to expand the labeled training data set. The Dataset IVa of BCI Competition III, is presented to demonstrate the validity of our algorithm with statistical significance test. As an iterative algorithm, experimental results of the proposed algorithm show the validity of re-extracting feature and the robustness of the feature to the noise. In addition, the convergence of the proposed algorithm and the validity of the method measuring the consistency of the feature are also demonstrated in experiments.

The nine novel approaches are discussed in applications to direct brain-robot and brain-virtual-reality-agent control interfaces using tactile and auditory BCI technologies. The BCI user intentions are decoded from the brainwaves in realtime using a non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) and they are translated to a symbiotic robot or virtual reality agent thought-based only control. A communication protocol between the BCI output and the robot or the virtual environment is realized in a symbiotic communication scenario using an user datagram protocol (UDP), which constitutes an internet of things (IoT) control scenario. Results obtained from healthy users reproducing simple brain-robot and brain-virtual-agent control tasks in online experiments support the research goal of a possibility to interact with robotic devices and virtual reality agents using symbiotic thought-based BCI technologies. An offline BCI classification accuracy boosting method, using a previously proposed information geometry derived approach, is also discussed in order to further support the reviewed robotic and virtual reality thought-based control paradigms.

However, in the case of (often, half-improvised) teaching in face-to-face classrooms, such interventions would require first an understanding of what the teacher actually did, as the starting point for teacher reflection and inquiry. Currently, such teacher enactment characterization requires costly manual coding by researchers. This paper presents a case study exploring the potential of machine learning techniques to automatically extract teaching actions during classroom enactment, from five data sources collected using wearable sensors (eye-tracking, EEG, accelerometer, audio and video). Our results highlight the feasibility of this approach, with high levels of accuracy in determining the social plane of interaction (90%, kappa = 0.8). The reliable detection of concrete teaching activity (e.g., explanation vs. questioning) accurately still remains challenging (67%, kappa = 0.56), a fact that will prompt further research on multimodal features and models for teaching activity extraction, as well as the collection of a larger multimodal dataset to improve the accuracy and generalizability of these methods.

An increasing number of educators and artists have begun using electroencephalogram (EEG) to control multimedia and live artistic contents. In this paper, we introduce a new concept based on brain computer interface (BCI) technologies: the Brainarium. The Brainarium is a new pedagogical and artistic tool, which can deliver and illustrate scientific knowledge, as well as a new framework for scientific exploration. The Brainarium consists of a portable planetarium device that is being used as brain metaphor. This is done by projecting multimedia content on the planetarium dome and displaying EEG data recorded from a subject in real time using Brain Machine Interface (BMI) technologies. The system has been demonstrated through several performances involving an interaction between the subject controlling the BMI, a musician, and the audience during series of exhibitions and workshops in schools. We report here feedback from 134 participants who filled questionnaires to rate their experiences. Our results show improved subjective learning compared to conventional methods, improved entertainment value, improved absorption into the material being presented, and little discomfort.

Accurate evaluation, pre-surgery assessments, seizure prevention, and emergency alerts for medical aid all depend on the rapid detection of the onset of seizures. A new method of feature selection and classification for rapid and precise epileptic seizure detection is discussed. In this solution, informative components of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data are extracted and an automatic method is presented using Infinite Independent Component Analysis (I-ICA) to select efficiently independent features. The feature space is divided into subspaces via random selection, and multi-channel Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used to classify the subspaces; then, the result of each classifier is combined by majority voting to find the final output. To evaluate the solution, a benchmark clinical intracranial EEG (iEEG) of eight patients with temporal and extratemporal lobe epilepsy has been considered in a multi-tier cloud-computing architecture. Via the leave-one-out cross-validation, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and false positive and false negative ratios of the proposed method are 0.95, 0.96, 0.94, 0.06, and 0.04, respectively, which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

But, a complete understanding of the process of segregation and selection of a particular sound in brain is still unclear. Recent studies have successfully demonstrated reconstruction of stimuli speech envelopes through mathematical modeling. In order to determine the attentional focus of the listener in multi-speaker settings, the existing models rely on the correlation between the reconstructed speech signals and the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals acquired while listening to the actual speech. However, realization of these type of models requires substantial time to reconstruct the stimulus and classify the direction of attention. Present study, proposes a novel solution for "cocktail party problem" by using machine learning approach. In this work, classification features viz. standard deviation, mean absolute values, mean absolute deviation and root-meansquare values were extracted from EEG data. The extracted features were fed into the artificial neural network (ANN) model with randomized sub-sampling procedure. The final outcomes showed ceiling level of performance to predict the attentional focus within subjects. These findings attest the robustness of the developed model for auditory stream segregation.

Automatic detection of rapid eye movements (REMs): A machine learning approach	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						REM detection; REM density; Polysomnography; EEG; Adaptive boosting; LOC; ROC; Machine learning; Sleep scoring	DEPENDENT MEMORY; SLEEP SPINDLES; EEG SLEEP; DENSITY; QUANTIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; CLASSIFIER; INCREASES; NAP	Background: Rapid eye movements (REMs) are a defining feature of REM sleep. The number of discrete REMs over time, or REM density, has been investigated as a marker of clinical psychopathology and memory consolidation. However, human detection of REMs is a time-consuming and subjective process. Therefore, reliable, automated REM detection software is a valuable research tool. New method: We developed an automatic REM detection algorithm combining a novel set of extracted features and the 'AdaBoost' classification algorithm to detect the presence of REMs in Electrooculogram data collected from the right and left outer canthi (ROC/LOC). Algorithm performance measures of Recall (percentage of REMs detected) and Precision (percentage of REMs detected that are true REMs) were calculated and compared to the gold standard of human detection by three expert sleep scorers. REM detection by four non-experts were also investigated and compared to expert raters and the algorithm. Results: The algorithm performance (78.1% Recall, 82.6% Precision) surpassed that of the average (expert & non-expert) single human detection performance (76% Recall, 83% Precision). Agreement between non-experts (Cronbach Alpha = 0.65) is markedly lower than experts (Cronbach Alpha = 0.80). Comparison with existing method(s): By following reported methods, we implemented all previously published LOC and ROC based detection algorithms on our dataset. Our algorithm performance exceeded all others. Conclusions: The automatic detection algorithm presented is a viable and efficient method of REM detection as it reliably matches the performance of human scorers and outperforms all other known LOC- and ROC-based detection algorithms.

The challenging key is to correct detection of MI tasks. Probabilistic Common Spatial Pattern (P-CSP) is the most recent and efficient method for discriminating two classes of electroencephalogram (EEG) from Motor Imagery (MI) Task. P-CSP resolves the overfitting which is the main issue of spatial filters. The accuracy of true detection tasks is related to some initial values, like the number of sources. In this paper, we generate a feature set by extracted features of each unique filter and select discriminant features by sparse dictionary learning method. Optimal sparse regularization parameter is selected by cross-validation on training data and the maximum accuracy with the corresponding parameter is reported for each subject. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on publicly available BCI Competition IV dataset 2a to detect two pair classes. Our results have been compared with P-CSP, by sweeping the Best number of source and using automatic selection methods. The results show that sparse features selection from feature set outperforms the existing P-CSP in terms of classification accuracy, and reduces the computational time of selecting the best number of the sources by sparse selection.

The prevalence of epileptic seizures in dogs ranges between 0.5% and 5.7% and between 1% and 3% in the human population. Studies on human epilepsy provide a ready-made format for classification, diagnosis and treatment in veterinary epilepsy. Human studies highlight the value of a thorough seizure classification. Nevertheless, a matter of concern in canine epilepsy is the limited information regarding seizure description and classification because of the lack of EEG-video recording. Establishment of a consensus protocol for ambulatory home video-recording in dogs who suffer from epilepsy, mainly considering indications, duration of monitoring, the sufficient essential training for an optimal interpretation of ictal semiology and the methodology of recordings is needed. The ultimate goal is that the information gathered by these videos will be analysed to describe the epileptic seizures thoroughly, recognize patterns and move towards a better understanding and therefore classification of canine epileptic seizures.

This is, generally, a very difficult, tedious and time-consuming task. The limitations of manual sleep stage scoring have escalated the demand for developing Automatic Sleep Stage Classification (ASSC) systems. Sleep stage classification refers to identifying the various stages of sleep and is a critical step in an effort to assist physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of related sleep disorders. The aim of this paper is to survey the progress and challenges in various existing Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal-based methods used for sleep stage identification at each phase; including pre-processing, feature extraction and classification; in an attempt to find the research gaps and possibly introduce a reasonable solution. Many of the prior and current related studies use multiple EEG channels, and are based on 30 s or 20 s epoch lengths which affect the feasibility and speed of ASSC for real-time applications. Thus, in this paper, we also present a novel and efficient technique that can be implemented in an embedded hardware device to identify sleep stages using new statistical features applied to 10 s epochs of single-channel EEG signals. In this study, the PhysioNet Sleep European Data Format (EDF) Database was used. The proposed methodology achieves an average classification sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 89.06%, 98.61% and 93.13%, respectively, when the decision tree classifier is applied. Finally, our new method is compared with those in recently published studies, which reiterates the high classification accuracy performance.

This Special Issue invites us to take this claim as the starting point for a cross-cultural analysis: in which meaningful ways can recent research in the burgeoning field of functional imaging be described as, contrasted with, or simply compared to animistic practices? And what light does such a reading shed on the dynamics and effectiveness of a century of brain research into higher mental functions?Reviewing the heated debate from 2009 around recent trends in neuroimaging as a possible candidate for current instances of soul catching', the paper will then compare these forms of primarily image-based brain research with older regimes, revolving around the deciphering of the brain's electrical activity. How has the move from a decoding paradigm to a representational regime affected the conceptualisation of self, psyche, mind and soul (if there still is such an entity)? And in what ways does modern technoscience provide new tools for animating brains?

Optimal Spatio-Spectral Variable Size Subbands Filter For Motor Imagery Brain Computer Interface	PROCEEDING OF THE SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION (IHCI 2015)	Procedia Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Intelligent Human Computer Interaction (IHCI)	DEC 14-16, 2015	Indian Inst Informat Technol, Allahabad, INDIA	IEEE Signal Proc Soc, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, IEEE Comp Soc	Indian Inst Informat Technol	motor imagery; common patial patterns; brain computer interface; support vector machine; feature extraction	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; CLASSIFICATION	Common spatial pattern (CSP) is a commonly used feature extraction technique for motor imagery brain computer interface. CSP provides poor performance when features are extracted from unfiltered or irrelevant frequency band filtered data. In order to overcome this problem, Subband CSP (SBCSP) and Filter Bank CSP (FBCSP) have been proposed in literature to extract features from several fixed size subbands. However, both SBCSP and FBCSP require manually fixing the size of subbands to obtain higher performance. In this paper, we propose a method that obtains features from many variable size subbands within a given frequency band using CSP. Further, Euclidean distance measure is used to obtain the relevant features. The efficacy of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of classification error on BCI Competition III dataset IVa and BCI competition IV dataset Ia. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance in comparison to CSP, SBCSP and FBCSP. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This selection is performed specifically for each subject, by analysing a set of curves that emphasize differences of brain activity recorded from electroencephalographic signals during the execution of various motor imagery tasks. We will show that expert knowledge is very valuable to supervise the selection of a sparse set of significant time-frequency features. Features selection is performed through a graphical user interface to allow an easy access to experts with no specific programming skills. In this paper, we compare our method with three fully-automatic features selection methods, using dataset 2A of BCI competition IV. Results are better for five of the nine subjects compared to the best competing method.

However, there are a number of challenges for machines to correctly recognize human emotional states. One problem is how to generalize the emotion model across time, since the brain may show different patterns of EEG for the same emotion experience at different time. This study investigated the feasibility of adding samples from different days to the training set to improve the generalization of the emotion classifier. Eight subjects participated in this experiment, and they were asked to watch different kinds of movie clips to produce neutral, positive or negative emotional states for different trials. Five sessions in five different days were conducted for each subject. EEG signals were recorded throughout the experiment. Support vector machine was used to perform a classification of the three emotional states, in which the training samples may come from 1, 2, 3 or 4 days' sessions but have a same number. The results showed that three categories were classified with average accuracies of 64.9%, 68.7%, 70.9%, and 73.0% respectively for 1-day, 2-day, 3-day and 4-day conditions. N-day condition represented the case in which data from N days were sent to train the SVM and the remaining 5-N days were used to form the testing set. Importantly, the accuracy had an increasing trend with the number of days in the training set for all subjects. Compared with 1-day condition, the accuracy of 4-day condition has about 10% improvement with a peak of 81.2%. By analyzing the selected features in 4-day condition, we found the distributions of the selected features were relatively stable across days. The classifier did select emotion-relevant features and reject time-relevant features. These results suggested that incorporation of samples from different days to the training set could improve the generalization of an emotion classifier across time.

This investigation explores the statistical differences present in two different referential montages: Linked Ear (LE) and Averaged Reference (AR). Each of these accounts for approximately 45% of the data in the TUH EEG Corpus. In this study, we explore the impact this variability has on machine learning performance. We compare the statistical properties of features generated using these two montages, and explore the impact of performance on our standard Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based classification system. We show that a system trained on LE data significantly outperforms one trained only on AR data (77.2% vs. 61.4%). We also demonstrate that performance of a system trained on both data sets is somewhat compromised (71.4% vs. 77.2%). A statistical analysis of the data suggests that mean, variance and channel normalization should be considered. However, cepstral mean subtraction failed to produce an improvement in performance, suggesting that the impact of these statistical differences is subtler.

Three-dimensional Modeling of Physiological Tremor for Hand-held Surgical Robotic Instruments	2016 38TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 16-20, 2016	Orlando, FL	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc			MULTISTEP PREDICTION; BAND IDENTIFICATION; ADAPTIVE ESTIMATION; COMPENSATION; MACHINE; EEG	Hand-held robotic instruments are developed to compensate physiological tremor in real-time while augmenting the required precision and dexterity into normal microsurgical work-flow. The hardware (sensors and actuators) and software (causal linear filters) employed for tremor identification and filtering introduces time-varying unknown phase-delay that adversely affects the device performance. The current techniques that focus on three-dimensions (3D) tip position control involves modeling and canceling the tremor in 3-axes (x, y, and z axes) separately. Our analysis with the tremor data recorded from surgeons and novice subjects show that there exists significant correlation in tremor motion across the dimensions. Motivated by this, a new multi-dimensional modeling approach based on extreme learning machines (ELM) is proposed in this paper to correct the phase delay and to accurately model tremulous motion in three dimensions simultaneously. A study is conducted with tremor data recorded from the microsurgeons to analyze the suitability of proposed approach.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) hold promise in restoring communication for patients with completely locked-in stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, these patients cannot use existing EEG-based BCIs, arguably because such systems rely on brain processes that are impaired in the late stages of ALS. In this work, we introduce a novel BCI designed for patients in late stages of ALS based on high-level cognitive processes that are less likely to be affected by ALS. Approach. We trained two ALS patients via EEG-based neurofeedback to use self-regulation of theta or gamma oscillations in the precuneus for basic communication. Because there is a tight connection between the precuneus and consciousness, precuneus oscillations are arguably generated by high-level cognitive processes, which are less likely to be affected by ALS than processes linked to the peripheral nervous system. Main results. Both patients learned to self-regulate their precuneus oscillations and achieved stable online decoding accuracy over the course of disease progression. One patient achieved a mean online decoding accuracy in a binary decision task of 70.55% across 26 training sessions, and the other patient achieved 59.44% across 16 training sessions. We provide empirical evidence that these oscillations were cortical in nature and originated from the intersection of the precuneus, cuneus, and posterior cingulate. Significance. Our results establish that ALS patients can employ self-regulation of precuneus oscillations for communication. Such a BCI is likely to be available to ALS patients as long as their consciousness supports communication.

The main issue on the use of AA is how to trigger the AA solutions without affecting the operative task. In this regard, passive Brain-Computer Interface (pBCI) systems are a good candidate to activate automation, since they are able to gather information about the covert behavior (e.g., mental workload) of a subject by analyzing its neurophysiological signals (i.e., brain activity), and without interfering with the ongoing operational activity. We proposed a pBCI system able to trigger AA solutions integrated in a realistic Air Traffic Management (ATM) research simulator developed and hosted at MAC (Ecole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile of Toulouse, France). Twelve Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) students have been involved in the experiment and they have been asked to perform ATM scenarios with and without the support of the AA solutions. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed pBCI system, since it enabled the AA mostly during the high-demanding conditions (i.e., overload situations) inducing a reduction of the mental workload under which the ATCOs were operating. On the contrary, as desired, the AA was not activated when workload level was under the threshold, to prevent too low demanding conditions that could bring the operator's workload level toward potentially dangerous conditions of underload.

However, it is sensitive to noise and artifact. In this paper, we propose a bagging regularized common spatial pattern (Bagging RCSP) approach for BCI with hybrid motor imagery and myoelectric signal. We divide the training samples into packets and choose training packets by Bagging to extract RCSP features. Furthermore, LDA is used to project the feature vector to lower space. In the end, a classification algorithm based on NNC is adopted. The Off-line experiment on BCI competition III attests Bagging RCSP versatile. The accuracy increases by 3%-5% in average than RCSP-A results. Furthermore, we designed and realized an online BCI system based on Bagging RCSP and evaluated through experiment involving four experimenters performing the BCI system of catching the apples. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the real time BCI system.

For the first time we aim to prove the feasibility of the graph lifting transform in an online BCI system. Instead of developing a pointer device or a wheel-chair controller as test bed for human-machine interaction, we have designed and developed an engaging game which can be controlled by means of imaginary limb movements. Some modifications to the existing MRA analysis over graphs for BCI have also been proposed, such as the use of common spatial patterns for feature extraction at the different levels of decomposition, and sequential floating forward search as a best basis selection technique. In the online game experiment we obtained for three classes an average classification rate of 63.0% for fourteen naive subjects. The application of a best basis selection method helps significantly decrease the computing resources needed. The present study allows us to further understand and assess the benefits of the use of tailored wavelet analysis for processing motor imagery data and contributes to the further development of BCI for gaming purposes.

This work presents an EEG-based method capable of assessing at an individual level the integrity of the auditory cortex at the bedside of patients and can be seen as the first cortical stage of this hierarchical approach. The method is based on two features: first, the possibility of automatically detecting the presence of a N100 wave and second, in showing evidence of frequency processing in the auditory cortex with a machine learning based classification of the EEG signals associated with different frequencies and auditory stimulation modalities. In the control group of twelve healthy volunteers, cortical frequency processing was clearly demonstrated. EEG recordings from two patients with disorders of consciousness showed evidence of partially preserved cortical processing in the first patient and none in the second patient. From these results, it appears that the classification method presented here reliably detects signal differences in the encoding of frequencies and is a useful tool in the evaluation of the integrity of the auditory cortex. Even though the classification method presented in this work was designed for patients with disorders of consciousness, it can also be applied to other pathological populations.

Surgical management of medically refractory epilepsy in patients with polymicrogyria	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Polymicrogyria; Cortical malformation; Cortical dysplasia; Malformation of cortical development; Schizencephaly; Hemimegalencephaly; Hemispherectomy; Refractory epilepsy; Surgical treatment; Seizure outcome	CORTICAL DEVELOPMENT; STATUS EPILEPTICUS; MALFORMATIONS; SURGERY; CLASSIFICATION; SEIZURES; SLEEP; BRAIN	Objective: Polymicrogyria (PMG) is a malformation of cortical development characterized by formation of an excessive number of small gyri. Sixty percent to 85% of patients with PMG have epilepsy that is refractory to medication, but surgical options are usually limited. We characterize a cohort of patient with polymicrogyria who underwent epilepsy surgery and document seizure outcomes. Methods: A retrospective study of all patients with PMG who underwent epilepsy surgery (focal seizure foci resection and/or hemispherectomy) at our center was performed by review of all clinical data related to their treatment. Results: We identified 12 patients (7 males and 5 female) with mean age of 18 (ranging from 3 months to 44 years) at time of surgery. Mean age at seizure onset was 8 years, with the majority (83%) having childhood onset. Six patients had focal, five had multifocal, and one patient had diffuse PMG. Perisylvian PMG was the most common pattern seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Eight patients had other cortical malformations including hemimegalencephaly and cortical dysplasia. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) often showed diffuse epileptic discharges that poorly lateralized but were focal on intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG). Eight patients underwent seizure foci resection and four underwent hemispherectomy. Mean follow-up was 7 years (ranging from one to 19 years). Six patients (50%) were seizure-free at last follow-up. One patient had rare seizures (Engel class II). Three patients were Engel class III, having either decreased seizure frequency or severity, and two patients were Engel class IV. Gross total resection of the PMG cortex trended toward good seizure control. Significance: Our study shows that even in patients with extensive or bilateral PMG malformations, some may still be good candidates for surgery because the epileptogenic zone may involve only a portion of the malformation. Intracranial ECoG can provide additional localizing information compared to scalp EEG in guiding resection of epileptogenic foci.

AEC exhibits a perfect error compensation (PEC) property, i.e., it is able to achieve a post-compensation error rate equal to zero. AEC generates a maximum likelihood (ML) estimate of the hardware error and employs it for error cancellation. AEC is applied to a voltage overscaled 45-tap, 45nm CMOS finite impulse response (FIR) filter employed in a EEG seizure detection system. AEC is shown to perfectly compensate for errors in the main FIR block and its reduced precision replica when they make errors at a rate of up to 73% and 98%, respectively. The AEC-based FIR is compared with an uncompensated architecture, and a fast architecture. AEC's error compensation capability enables it to achieve a 31.5% (at same supply voltage) and 19.7% (at same energy) speed-up over the uncompensated architecture, and a 8.9% speed-up over a fast architecture at the same energy consumption. At f(clk) = 452.3MHz, AEC results in a 27.7% and 12.4% energy savings over the uncompensated and fast architectures, respectively.

We propose a robust learning framework to mitigate class imbalance in large CHB-MIT (982 hrs) scalp EEG dataset. The algorithm being used is RUSBoost which is a hybrid data sampling and boosting technique designed especially for skewed classes. The data that is being used in this study has severe class imbalance, with average representation of 0.38% of seizure class to that of 99.62% of non-seizure class. The proposed approach shows the power of RUSBoost in terms of robustness and generalization. We compared our method with the most successful Support Vector Machine (SVM) based approach and report competitive results of 97% seizure detection accuracy, mean detection delay of 2.7s and false detection rate of 0.08 seizure/hr. We also report fast training times of just under three minutes on average for average training data of 21 hrs.

In the offline experiment, all the subjects have to do is counting the target stimulus when they were using the visual-evoked event-related potential (ERP) based BCIs. The recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) data was used to train the classification mode. However, subjects may get distracted in counting the target stimulus when the non-target stimulus affected the subjects or subjects lost their attentions which may negatively affect the task performance. In this study, some green flashing points was added into the stimuli. The subjects have to focus on the target stimulus and count the number of the green points in target stimulus at the same time. In this way, it will make subjects concentrate more on the target to count the green points compared to the pattern without green points. The result showed that the performance of the BCI system could be improved using the method presented in this paper.

It employs the Robust Common Spatial pattern (RoCSP) feature extraction algorithm which eliminates trials affected by artifacts and discards redundant channels to improve the robustness of the CSP algorithm. Next, it handles the non-stationarity in EEG signals using the Self-Regulated Interval Type-2 Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (SRIT2NFIS). It uses the input features generated by the RoCSP algorithm and handles the non-stationarity as uncertainty using the interval type-2 fuzzy sets in the antecedent of fuzzy rules. A five layered modified Takagi-Sugeno-Kang interval type-2 fuzzy inference mechanism forms the structure and the learning algorithm uses a self-regulatory mechanism. Further, the SRIT2NFIS classifier is used to find the desired spectral filters by eliminating those frequency bands that do not affect the classification performance. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated using two publicly available BCI competition data sets and compared with other existing algorithms like FBCSP, DFBCSP and BSSFO. The results indicate improved performances of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the proposed system is employed to control the movement of a quadcopter.	[Das, A.

Categorizing visual objects using the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal of subject along with paying attention to pictures, is properly possible. The aim of this paper is to analyze the mental signal in order to show the differences in cognitive patterns during paying attention to sets of different pictures. For this purpose, EEG signals which were recorded from 45 people were used. Brain signals are recorded over the on head using 8 active electrodes and based on standard 10-20. After the pre-processing, ERP signals were extracted into two classes according to attention to the human face and fruit images. Firstly, 4 types of features has been extracted from N170, P200, N200 and P300 components: (1) time features, (2) non-linear features, (3) statistical features and (4) frequency features. Then dimension of Properties were reduced by using different algorithms. New and innovative work in this paper is using various algorithms for reducing feature dimension such as t-test, t-SNE and kernel t-SNE and comparing their results with each other. Classification of 2 classes were done in order to recognize the differences using SVM and KNN classifiers. Secondly we reexamined this process by using combined features from multiple ERP components and obtained best result in this condition by tSNE and SVM classifier with 85.5% accuracy.

To achieve this purpose, we develop a CC aided LS-SVM in this chapter. The motivation for considering the LS-SVM with the CC method as the LS-SVM is a very powerful tool in pattern recognition due to its equality constraints (rather than inequality constraints) and the reduction of the computational cost and low risk of over-fitting. In the proposed approach, the LS-SVM is introduced with a two-step grid search process for tuning hyper parameters so that the optimal parameters of this method can be selected efficiently and automatically for distinguishing the MI tasks improving the classification performance. In the previous chapters, the LS-SVM classifier was used in the epileptic EEG signals classification but the hyper parameters of this classifier were selected manually (rather than using an appropriate method) even though the hyper parameters of the LS-SVM play an important role in classification performance. In addition, this chapter investigates the effects of two different reference channels, for example ` Fp1' and ` C3', on performance. To compare the effectiveness of the proposed classifier, we replace the LS-SVM with the logistic regression and kernel logistic regression (KLR) classifier, and apply it separately, for the same features extracted from the CC technique. The methodology proposed in this chapter is tested on datasets IVa, IVb and BCI Comp III (see Chap. 3 for a description of these datasets).

As a result, Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems are becoming more and more accessible to the research community, serving various applications and needs, in contrast to earlier times, when these systems were more expensive, a lot more complex in their use, while their utilization focused particularly on health and medical applications. In this paper, information, on BCI systems, is provided and then, the overall procedure that has been followed, is described for the analysis and classification of signals acquired from an ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG). More specifically, there is a detailed description of the procedure of acquiring the data (i.e., EEG signals) from the brain as well as the steps for pre-processing and enhancing the recorded signals. Furthermore, some of the most common feature extraction techniques, along with associated classification algorithms, are combined and their performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy. The best combination is used for demonstrating the control of a flying drone both in simulated and real-world scenarios.

With the continuous and dedicated efforts by many researchers, application of BCI technology has not only proved significant for disabled but also for healthy individuals. Here we have discussed about one such well known BCI paradigm i.e. P300 speller. The conventional P300 speller is actually based on detecting P300 signal through EEG recordings, which is supposed to occur when the subject sees targeted character or task. In this paper, we have discussed about the ensemble machine learning approach to detect the P300. Our main objective is to discuss the significance of ensemble techniques to classify and predict Event Related Potential (ERP). We have used two such well known ensemble techniques; Random Forest (RF) and Ensemble Support Vector Machines (ESVM). Finally we obtained ceiling level classification accuracy with minimum number of trials. These proposed techniques attest the viability for possible BCI applications using simple ERPs.

This algorithm performs a joint approximate diagonalization of the second and higher order statistics of the observations with the aim of identifying the relevant independent components of the EEG signals and their corresponding spatial filters. In order to speed up the convergence, the algorithm is initialized from the multiclass Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) filter matrix. This helps the ICA algorithm to find the closest solution to the problem. The algorithm was tested on BCI competition IV dataset 2a and the obtained performance was compared with two existing methods. An improvement in classification performance is observed using the ThinICA-CSP algorithm.	[Thiyam, Deepa Beeta; Rajkumar, E.

Feasibility of an ultra-low power digital signal processor platform as a basis for a fully implantable brain-computer interface system	2016 38TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 16-20, 2016	Orlando, FL	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				A fully implantable brain-computer interface (BCI) can be a practical tool to restore independence to those affected by spinal cord injury. We envision that such a BCI system will invasively acquire brain signals (e.g. electrocorticogram) and translate them into control commands for external prostheses. The feasibility of such a system was tested by implementing its benchtop analogue, centered around a commercial, ultra-low power (ULP) digital signal processor (DSP, TMS320C5517, Texas Instruments). A suite of signal processing and BCI algorithms, including (de) multiplexing, Fast Fourier Transform, power spectral density, principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, Bayes rule, and finite state machine was implemented and tested in the DSP. The system's signal acquisition fidelity was tested and characterized by acquiring harmonic signals from a function generator. In addition, the BCI decoding performance was tested, first with signals from a function generator, and subsequently using human electroencephalogram (EEG) during eyes opening and closing task. On average, the system spent 322 ms to process and analyze 2 s of data. Crosstalk (< -65 dB) and harmonic distortion (similar to 1%) were minimal. Timing jitter averaged 49 mu s per 1000 ms. The online BCI decoding accuracies were 100% for both function generator and EEG data. These results show that a complex BCI algorithm can be executed on an ULP DSP without compromising performance. This suggests that the proposed hardware platform may be used as a basis for future, fully implantable BCI systems.

Studies on the processing of shape or object information have revealed recruitment of the lateral occipital cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and other regions regardless of input sensory modalities. However, it remains unknown whether such regions show similar (modality-invariant) or different (modality specific) neural oscillatory dynamics, as recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG), in response to identical shape information processing tasks delivered to different sensory modalities. Modality-invariant or modality-specific neural oscillatory dynamics indirectly suggest modality-independent or modality-dependent participation of particular brain regions, respectively. Therefore, this study investigated the modality-specificity of neural oscillatory dynamics in the form of spectral power modulation patterns in response to visual and tactile sequential shape-processing tasks that are well-matched in terms of speed and content between the sensory modalities. Task-related changes in spectral power modulation and differences in spectral power modulation between sensory modalities were investigated at source-space (voxel) level, using a multivariate pattern classification (MVPC) approach. Additionally, whole analyses were extended from the voxel level to the independent-component level to take account of signal leakage effects caused by inverse solution. The modality-specific spectral dynamics in multisensory and higher-order brain regions, such as the lateral occipital cortex, posterior parietal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, and other brain regions, showed task-related modulation in response to both sensory modalities. This suggests modality-dependency of such brain regions on the input sensory modality for sequential shape-information processing. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recent studies have reported that trace conditioning can occur in humans in reduced levels of consciousness by showing a transfer of the unconditioned autonomic response to the CS+ in healthy sleeping individuals and in vegetative state patients. However, no previous studies have investigated the neural underpinning of trace conditioning in the absence of consciousness in humans. In the present study, we recorded the EEG activity of 29 post-anoxic comatose patients while presenting a trace conditioning paradigm using neutral tones as CS+ and alerting sounds as UCS. Most patients received therapeutic hypothermia and all were deeply unconscious according to standardized clinical scales. After repeated presentation of the CS+ and UCS couple, learning was assessed by measuring the EEG activity during the period where the UCS is omitted after CS+ presentation. Specifically we assessed the 'reactivation' of the neural response to UCS omission by applying a decoding algorithm derived from the statistical model of the EEG activity in response to the UCS presentation. The same procedure was used in a group of 12 awake healthy controls. We found a reactivation of the UCS response in absence of stimulation in eight patients (five under therapeutic hypothermia) and four healthy controls. Additionally, the reactivation effect was temporally specific within trials since it manifested primarily at the specific latency of UCS presentation and significantly less before or after this period. Our results show for the first time that trace conditioning may manifest as a reactivation of the EEG activity related to the UCS and even in the absence of consciousness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Extensions to a manifold learning framework for time-series analysis on dynamic manifolds in bioelectric signals	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; RECONSTRUCTION; EIGENMAPS; SYSTEM	This paper addresses the challenge of extracting meaningful information from measured bioelectric signals generated by complex, large scale physiological systems such as the brain or the heart. We focus on a combination of the well-known Laplacian eigenmaps machine learning approach with dynamical systems ideas to analyze emergent dynamic behaviors. The method reconstructs the abstract dynamical system phase-space geometry of the embedded measurements and tracks changes in physiological conditions or activities through changes in that geometry. It is geared to extract information from the joint behavior of time traces obtained from large sensor arrays, such as those used in multiple-electrode ECG and EEG, and explore the geometrical structure of the low dimensional embedding of moving time windows of those joint snapshots. Our main contribution is a method for mapping vectors from the phase space to the data domain. We present cases to evaluate the methods, including a synthetic example using the chaotic Lorenz system, several sets of cardiac measurements from both canine and human hearts, and measurements from a human brain.

In particular, we consider the electroencephalogram signal of different mental task performed by the subject such as breathing, mental mathematics, and geometric figure rotation, visual counting and mental letter composing. Our motivation based on the fusion of feature vector of mental task using canonical correlation analysis, where feature set extraction using empirical mode decomposition and information theoretic measure and statistical measurement. In order to classify the fused vector from different mental, we have used linear vector quantization (LVQ) neural network and its extension LVQ2. The results of the experiments testing the performance have been evaluated with two profiles of the database. We have observed canonical correlation-based fusion providing the better results in comparison with simple fusion rule.

Such MMIs make use of a virtual environment and can therefore make the operator immerse him-/herself into the environment of the robot. In this paper, we present our developed MMI for multi-robot control. Our MMI can adapt to changes in task load and task engagement online. Applying our approach of embedded Brain Reading we improve user support and efficiency of interaction. The level of task engagement was inferred from the single-trial detectability of P300-related brain activity that was naturally evoked during interaction. With our approach no secondary task is needed to measure task load. It is based on research results on the single-stimulus paradigm, distribution of brain resources and its effect on the P300 event-related component. It further considers effects of the modulation caused by a delayed reaction time on the P300 component evoked by complex responses to task-relevant messages. We prove our concept using single-trial based machine learning analysis, analysis of averaged event-related potentials and behavioral analysis. As main results we show (1) a significant improvement of runtime needed to perform the interaction tasks compared to a setting in which all subjects could easily perform the tasks. We show that (2) the single-trial detectability of the event-related potential P300 can be used to measure the changes in task load and task engagement during complex interaction while also being sensitive to the level of experience of the operator and (3) can be used to adapt the MMI individually to the different needs of users without increasing total workload. Our online adaptation of the proposed MMI is based on a continuous supervision of the operator's cognitive resources by means of embedded Brain Reading. Operators with different qualifications or capabilities receive only as many tasks as they can perform to avoid mental overload as well as mental underload.

The most popular hardware solutions in BCI are based on the signals recorded by the electroencephalograph (EEG). Such signals can be used to record and monitor the bioelectrical activity of the brain. However, raw EEG scalp potentials are characterized by a weak spatial resolution. Due to that reason, multichannel EEG recordings tend to provide an unclear image of the activity of brain and the use of special signal processing and analysis methods is needed. A typical approach towards modern BCIs requires an extensive use of Machine Learning methods. It is generally accepted that the performance of such systems is highly sensitive to the feature extraction step. One of the most effective and widely used descriptors of EEG data is the power of the signal calculated in a specific frequency range. In order to improve the performance of chosen classification algorithm, the distribution of the extracted bandpower features is often normalized with the use of natural logarithm function. In this study the step of normalization of feature distribution was taken into careful consideration. Commonly used logarithm function is not always the best choice for this process. Therefore, the influence on the skewness of features, as well as, on the general classification accuracy of different settings of Box-Cox transformation will be tested in this article and compared to classical approach that employs natural logarithm function. For the better evaluation of the performance of the proposed approach, its effectiveness is tested in the task of classification of the benchmark data provided for the "BCI Competition III" (dataset "IVa") organized by the Berlin Brain-Computer Interface group.

A Multiple Kernel Learning Approach for Human Behavioral Task Classification using STN-LFP Signal	2016 38TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 16-20, 2016	Orlando, FL	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc		Deep Brain Stimulation; Local Field Potential; Multiple Kernel Learning; Time-Frequency Analysis	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; NEURAL-NETWORK; EEG; STIMULATION	Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has gained increasing attention as an effective method to mitigate Parkinson's disease (PD) disorders. Existing DBS systems are open-loop such that the system parameters are not adjusted automatically based on patient's behavior. Classification of human behavior is an important step in the design of the next generation of DBS systems that are closed-loop. This paper presents a classification approach to recognize such behavioral tasks using the subthalamic nucleus (STN) Local Field Potential (LFP) signals. In our approach, we use the timefrequency representation (spectrogram) of the raw LFP signals recorded from left and right STNs as the feature vectors. Then these features are combined together via Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) formulation. The MKL-based classification method is utilized to classify different tasks: button press, mouth movement, speech, and arm movement. Our experiments show that the lpnorm MKL significantly outperforms single kernel SVM-based classifiers in classifying behavioral tasks of five subjects even using signals acquired with a low sampling rate of 10 Hz. This leads to a lower computational cost.

Brain Network Activation Analysis Utilizing Spatiotemporal Features for Event Related Potentials Classification	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						BNA; ERP; EEG; STEP; functional connectivity; machine learning	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; TOP-DOWN; EEG; CONNECTIVITY; ALGORITHMS; COMPONENTS; STIMULI; LATENCY; FIELDS; TARGET	The purpose of this study was to introduce an improved tool for automated classification of event-related potentials (ERPs) using spatiotemporally parcellated events incorporated into a functional brain network activation (BNA) analysis. The auditory oddball ERP paradigm was selected to demonstrate and evaluate the improved tool. Methods: The ERPs of each subject were decomposed into major dynamic spatiotemporal events. Then, a set of spatiotemporal events representing the group was generated by aligning and clustering the spatiotemporal events of all individual subjects. The temporal relationship between the common group events generated a network, which is the spatiotemporal reference BNA model. Scores were derived by comparing each subject's spatiotemporal events to the reference BNA model and were then entered into a support vector machine classifier to classify subjects into relevant subgroups. The reliability of the BNA scores (test-retest repeatability using intraclass correlation) and their utility as a classification tool were examined in the context of Target-Novel classification. Results: BNA intraclass correlation values of repeatability ranged between 0.51 and 0.82 for the known ERP components N100, P200, and P300. Classification accuracy was high when the trained data were validated on the same subjects for different visits (AUCs 0.93 and 0.95). The classification accuracy remained high for a test group recorded at a different clinical center with a different recording system (AUCs 0.81, 0.85 for 2 visits). Conclusion: The improved spatiotemporal BNA analysis demonstrates high classification accuracy. The BNA analysis method holds promise as a tool for diagnosis, follow-up and drug development associated with different neurological conditions.

The lack of feedback during training is assumed to be a major cause. I.e. if one had already a reasonable model to start with, feedback training could be started immediately. One concept to address this issue is learning a general model and adapting it to new observations. In this study we applied this concept by utilizing a generative model entitled Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). We investigated its feature extraction capabilities by fitting a RBM to recordings of 9 subjects. Generalization was assessed in an online co-adaptive study, covering 12 volunteers (10 naive). An overall median accuracy of 88.9% (83.5% naive) with a standard-error of 6.5% (6.6% naive) was achieved for a classical hand versus feet motor imagery task. The online co-adaptive training itself lasted approximately 25 minutes. Feedback was already presented after a one minute setup run, whose purpose was to estimate initial statistics and to train an online artifact detection system.

ALS progressively degenerates the motor neurons in spinal cord. In this study, a new technique for the analysis of normal and ALS EMG signals is proposed. EMG signals are decomposed into narrow band intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique. The area of complex plot, two bandwidths namely amplitude modulation bandwidth (B-AM) and frequency modulation bandwidth (B-FM), normalised instantaneous frequency (IFn), spectral momentum of power spectral density (SMPSD) and mean of first derivative of instantaneous frequency (MFDIF) are extracted from analytic IMFs obtained by EMD technique. These six features are used as input in least square support vector machine classifier for the classification of ALS and normal EMG signals. Experimental results and comparative analysis show that classification performance of the proposed method is better than other existing method in the same database.

Widespread changes in network activity allow non-invasive detection of mesial temporal lobe seizures	BRAIN			English	Article						temporal lobe epilepsy; temporal lobe; intracranial EEG; Alzheimer's disease; seizure detection	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; EPILEPSY; DEMENTIA; PATTERNS; LOCALIZATION; IMPAIRMENTS; ELECTRODES; SUBTYPES; FOCI	Focal seizures within the mesial temporal lobes often lack a scalp EEG ictal correlate, and intracranial recordings are typically required for their detection. Lam et al. develop a new approach to detect these seizures non-invasively and with high specificity on scalp EEG, using network connectivity measures and machine-learning techniques.Focal seizures within the mesial temporal lobes often lack a scalp EEG ictal correlate, and intracranial recordings are typically required for their detection. Lam et al. develop a new approach to detect these seizures non-invasively and with high specificity on scalp EEG, using network connectivity measures and machine-learning techniques.Decades of experience with intracranial recordings in patients with epilepsy have demonstrated that seizures can occur in deep cortical regions such as the mesial temporal lobes without showing any obvious signs of seizure activity on scalp electroencephalogram. Predicated on the idea that these seizures are purely focal, currently, the only way to detect these 'scalp-negative seizures' is with intracranial recordings. However, intracranial recordings are only rarely performed in patients with epilepsy, and are almost never performed outside of the context of epilepsy. As such, little is known about scalp-negative seizures and their role in the natural history of epilepsy, their effect on cognitive function, and their association with other neurological diseases. Here, we developed a novel approach to non-invasively identify scalp-negative seizures arising from the mesial temporal lobe based on scalp electroencephalogram network connectivity measures. We identified 25 scalp-negative mesial temporal lobe seizures in 10 patients and obtained control records from an additional 13 patients, all of whom underwent recordings with foramen ovale electrodes and scalp electroencephalogram. Scalp data from these records were used to train a scalp-negative seizure detector, which consisted of a pair of logistic regression classifiers that used scalp electroencephalogram coherence properties as input features. On cross-validation performance, this detector correctly identified scalp-negative seizures in 40% of patients, and correctly identified the side of seizure onset for each seizure detected. In comparison, routine clinical interpretation of these scalp electroencephalograms failed to identify any of the scalp-negative seizures. Among the patients in whom the detector raised seizure alarms, 80% had scalp-negative mesial temporal lobe seizures. The detector had a false alarm rate of only 0.31 per day and a positive predictive value of 75%. Of the 13 control patients, false seizure alarms were raised in only one patient. The fact that our detector specifically recognizes focal mesial temporal lobe seizures based on scalp electroencephalogram coherence features, lends weight to the hypothesis that even focal seizures are a network phenomenon that involve widespread neural connectivity. Our scalp-negative seizure detector has clear clinical utility in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, and its potential easily translates to other neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, in which occult mesial temporal lobe seizures are suspected to play a significant role. Importantly, our work establishes a novel approach of using computational approaches to non-invasively detect deep seizure activity, without the need for invasive intracranial recordings.

Reinforcement learning of self-regulated sensorimotor beta-oscillations improves motor performance	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Operant conditioning; Beta oscillations; Brain-computer interface; Brain-machine interface; Brain-robot interface; Motor learning; Neurofeedback; Hand function; Functional restoration; Stroke	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; CORTICAL STIMULATION; CHRONIC STROKE; ROBOT INTERFACE; IMAGERY; SYSTEM; BCI; MODULATION; ACTIVATION	Self-regulation of sensorimotor oscillations is currently researched in neurorehabilitation, e.g. for priming subsequent physiotherapy in stroke patients, and may be modulated by neurofeedback or transcranial brain stimulation. It has still to be demonstrated, however, whether and under which training conditions such brain self-regulation could also result in motor gains. Thirty-two right-handed, healthy subjects participated in a three-day intervention during which they performed 462 trials of kinesthetic motor-imagery while a brain-robot interface (BRI) turned event-related beta-band desynchronization of the left sensorimotor cortex into the opening of the right hand by a robotic orthosis. Different training conditions were compared in a parallel-group design: (i) adaptive classifier thresholding and contingent feedback, (ii) adaptive classifier thresholding and non-contingent feedback, (iii) non-adaptive classifier thresholding and contingent feedback, and (iv) non-adaptive classifier thresholding and non-contingent feedback. We studied the task-related cortical physiology with electroencephalography and the behavioral performance in a subsequent isometric motor task. Contingent neurofeedback and adaptive classifier thresholding were critical for learning brain self-regulation which, in turn, led to behavioral gains after the intervention. The acquired skill for sustained sensorimotor beta-desynchronization correlated significantly with subsequent motor improvement. Operant learning of brain self-regulation with a BRI may offer a therapeutic perspective for severely affected stroke patients lacking residual hand function. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this paper is to investigate whether self-induced variations of the electroencephalogram (EEG) can be useful as control signals for an upper-limb exoskeleton developed by us. A BMI based on event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) is proposed. In the decoder-training phase, we investigate the offline classification performance of left versus right hand and left hand versus both feet by using motor execution (ME) or motor imagery (MI). The results indicate that the accuracies of ME sessions are higher than those of MI sessions, and left hand versus both feet paradigm achieves a better classification performance, which would be used in the online-control phase. In the online-control phase, the trained decoder is tested in two scenarios (wearing or without wearing the exoskeleton). The MI and ME sessions wearing the exoskeleton achieve mean classification accuracy of 84.29% +/- 2.11% and 87.37% +/- 3.06%, respectively. The present study demonstrates that the proposed BMI is effective to control the upper-limb exoskeleton, and provides a practical method by non-invasive EEG signal associated with human natural behavior for clinical applications.

In this paper, we computed the sample entropy (SampEn) and average stride interval (ASI) parameters to quantify the stride series of 50 gender-matched children participants in three age groups. We also normalized the SampEn and ASI values by leg length and body mass for each participant, respectively. Results show that the original and normalized SampEn values consistently decrease over the significance level of the Mann-Whitney U test (p < 0.01) in children of 3-14 years old, which indicates the stride irregularity has been significantly ameliorated with the body growth. The original and normalized ASI values are also significantly changing when comparing between any two groups of young (aged 3-5 years), middle (aged 6-8 years), and elder (aged 10-14 years) children. Such results suggest that healthy children may better modulate their gait cadence rhythm with the development of their musculoskeletal and neurological systems. In addition, the AdaBoost.M2 and Bagging algorithms were used to effectively distinguish the children's gait patterns. These ensemble learning algorithms both provided excellent gait classification results in terms of overall accuracy (>= 90%), recall (>= 0.8), and precision (>= 0.8077).

We retrospectively studied 18 patients (10 males and 8 females; aged 14 months to 9 years) with full trisomy 18 and epilepsy. All patients underwent comprehensive assessment including neuroimaging studies of the brain. We divided patients into two groups according to neuroimaging findings: (Group 1) 10 patients harboring structural brain malformations, and (Group 2) 8 patients with normal brain images. Group 1 had a significantly earlier age at seizure onset (2 months) compared to Group 2 (21 months). The seizure semiology was more severe in Group 1, who presented multiple seizure types, need for polytherapy (80% of patients), multifocal EEG abnormalities and poorer outcome (drug resistant epilepsy in 90% of patients) than Group 2 who presented a single seizure type, generalized or focal, and non-specific EEG pattern; these patients were successfully treated with monotherapy with good outcome. Imaging revealed a wide and complex spectrum of structural brain abnormalities including anomalies of the commissures, cerebellar malformations, cortical abnormalities, and various degrees of cortical atrophy. Epilepsy in full trisomy 18 may develop during the first months of life and can be associated with structural brain malformations. Patients with brain malformations can show multiple seizure types and can frequently be resistant to therapy with antiepileptic drugs. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, this is hard to attain due to environmental, personal and internal factors including thought processes. This poses a major challenge in realizing accurate evaluation of mental workload. This study is aimed at detection of the inactive mental states of the participant during an experimental task. Conventionally cognitive load is computed with respect to the baseline period. Here a novel approach is adopted based on the detection of most inactive mental state during the rest period. It is observed that alpha rhythms (8 - 12 Hz) are dominant than theta rhythms (4 - 7 Hz) during the rest state and this information is used in determining the most inactive mental states. Galvanic skin response (GSR) is also analyzed for the same purpose to validate the decoded mental state from the brain signals. Results indicate that the proposed approach of inactivity detection, improves the overall accuracy of detection of cognitive load by 15.57 %.

In recent years, neuroprosthetic devices have been developed, that directly infer movements commands from neuronal activities. Amongst these, hand prostheses require a more precise detection of different hand motions than other body parts. However, detection of such precise movements in EEG data is a non-trivial task due to the noisiness. To challenge this problem, the WAY consortium created a classification challenge on the Kaggle platform in the summer 2015. The winners used a recurrent convolutional neural network that scored 0.98 AUC. Since training such a network is computationally demanding, we applied an echo state network to the same dataset, to see whether this faster approach can compete with the RCNN. The dataset originates from grasp and lift trials recorded by the WAY consortium [1]. They labeled the data with six different events, occurring in the same order for each trial. Further, each of the events are labeled +/- 75 ms around the onset of the event. Lastly, the dataset is imbalanced, as most of the time no event occurs. To challenge this imbalanced, we used a weighted ridge regression to learn the weights of the output layer. We further tried subsampling the frames where no event occurred. Preliminary results suggest no significant difference between these two methods. Additionally, we used different activation functions including hyperbolic tangent and rectified hyperbolic tangent. Lastly, we set up the reservoir in three "bubbles" that were highly connected, whilst between bubbles only few connections were active. Other than that, the original approach of Jaeger was used [2]. To preprocess the data, we used common spatial patterns. We applied these to each event separately against the rest time, leading to six different preprocessed datasets. For each of these datasets, we classified the corresponding event using one ESN. Afterwards, we concatenated the predictions to form the original six events. We have not yet fully evaluated this approach. However, preliminary results (ca. 0.76 AUC) are promising, although they do not compete with the results of the competition winners.

Decoding three-dimensional reaching movements using electrocorticographic signals in humans	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						electrocorticography; ECoG; brain computer interface; BCI; neuroprosthetics	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; MOTOR CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; ARM MOVEMENTS; NEURONAL ENSEMBLE; FINGER MOVEMENTS; NEURAL-CONTROL; LINEAR-MODELS; HAND MOVEMENT; EEG	Objective. Electrocorticography (ECoG) signals have emerged as a potential control signal for brain computer interface (BCI) applications due to balancing signal quality and implant invasiveness. While there have been numerous demonstrations in which ECoG signals were used to decode motor movements and to develop BCI systems, the extent of information that can be decoded has been uncertain. Therefore, we sought to determine if ECoG signals could be used to decode kinematics (speed, velocity, and position) of arm movements in 3D space. Approach. To investigate this, we designed a 3D center -out reaching task that was performed by five epileptic patients undergoing temporary placement of ECoG arrays. We used the ECoG signals within a hierarchical partial-least squares (PLS) regression model to perform offline prediction of hand speed, velocity, and position. Main Results. The hierarchical PLS regression model enabled us to predict hand speed, velocity, and position during 3D reaching movements from held -out test sets with accuracies above chance in each patient with mean correlation coefficients between 0.31 and 0.80 for speed, 0.27 and 0.54 for velocity, and 0.22 and 0.57 for position. While beta band power changes were the most significant features within the model used to classify movement and rest, the local motor potential and high gamma band power changes, were the most important features in the prediction of kinematic parameters. Significance. We believe that this study represents the first demonstration that truly three-dimensional movements can be predicted from ECoG recordings in human patients. Furthermore, this prediction underscores the potential to develop BCI systems with multiple degrees of freedom in human patients using ECoG.

J	Wenzel, MA; Almeida, I; Blankertz, B				Wenzel, Markus A.; Almeida, Ines; Blankertz, Benjamin			Is Neural Activity Detected by ERP-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces Task Specific?	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VISUAL-SEARCH; P300; P3A; MEG	Objective Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that are based on event-related potentials (ERPs) can estimate to which stimulus a user pays particular attention. In typical BCIs, the user silently counts the selected stimulus (which is repeatedly presented among other stimuli) in order to focus the attention. The stimulus of interest is then inferred from the electroencephalogram (EEG). Detecting attention allocation implicitly could be also beneficial for human-computer interaction (HCI), because it would allow software to adapt to the user's interest. However, a counting task would be inappropriate for the envisaged implicit application in HCI. Therefore, the question was addressed if the detectable neural activity is specific for silent counting, or if it can be evoked also by other tasks that direct the attention to certain stimuli. Approach Thirteen people performed a silent counting, an arithmetic and a memory task. The tasks required the subjects to pay particular attention to target stimuli of a random color. The stimulus presentation was the same in all three tasks, which allowed a direct comparison of the experimental conditions. Results Classifiers that were trained to detect the targets in one task, according to patterns present in the EEG signal, could detect targets in all other tasks (irrespective of some task-related differences in the EEG). Significance The neural activity detected by the classifiers is not strictly task specific but can be generalized over tasks and is presumably a result of the attention allocation or of the augmented workload. The results may hold promise for the transfer of classification algorithms from BCI research to implicit relevance detection in HCI.

Decoding and Reconstructing the Focus of Spatial Attention from the Topography of Alpha-band Oscillations	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							PARIETAL; SUPPRESSION; MECHANISM; REPRESENTATIONS; COMMUNICATION; MODULATIONS; INFORMATION; MAINTENANCE; INCREASES; FRAMEWORK	Many aspects of perception and cognition are supported by activity in neural populations that are tuned to different stimulus features (e.g., orientation, spatial location, color). Goal-directed behavior, such as sustained attention, requires a mechanism for the selective prioritization of contextually appropriate representations. A candidate mechanism of sustained spatial attention is neural activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz), whose power in the human EEG covaries with the focus of covert attention. Here, we applied an inverted encoding model to assess whether spatially selective neural responses could be recovered from the topography of alpha-band oscillations during spatial attention. Participants were cued to covertly attend to one of six spatial locations arranged concentrically around fixation while EEG was recorded. A linear classifier applied to EEG data during sustained attention demonstrated successful classification of the attended location from the topography of alpha power, although not from other frequency bands. We next sought to reconstruct the focus of spatial attention over time by applying inverted encoding models to the topography of alpha power and phase. Alpha power, but not phase, allowed for robust reconstructions of the specific attended location beginning around 450 msec postcue, an onset earlier than previous reports. These results demonstrate that posterior alpha-band oscillations can be used to track activity in feature-selective neural populations with high temporal precision during the deployment of covert spatial attention.

The classical triad includes developmental delay, severe intellectual disability and seizures. Case report: We present the case of a 9-yearold female who was referred to our pediatric neurology department at the age of 1 month presenting infantile spasm, impossible to be quantified, characterized by flexion and extension of the thoracic limbs, which were phenytoinresistant developmental delay and showing an hypsarritmia pattern in the EEG. MRI making evident an isolated left hemimegalencephaly according to Flores-Sarnat (2002). She presents a change in the course of seizures with infantile spasm remission and the presence of partial (focal) seizures every month, with EEG pattern presenting spikes, continuous spike-slow wave complexes in the left hemisphere, actual treatment based on levetiracetam, topiramate, and lacosamide. Conclusions: West syndrome (WS), an age dependant epileptic encephalopathy, is one of the known causes for drug-resistant epilepsy which can evolve to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or focal and generalized seizures, the range of occurrence vary during the lactation period around the 4th and 6th month of life, nevertheless earlier presentation has been associated with severe brain structure disorders. Once the diagnosis of WS has been made, it is important to discard the structural malformations via MRI, as well as metabolic disorders. First line treatment is based on adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), vigabatrin or valproic acid. Phenytoin, carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, don't belong to the first line treatment of SW and according to the patients evolution, different antiepileptic schemes can be considered.

We devised a new paradigm that targets higher-level cognitive processes to transmit information from the user to the BCI. We instructed five ALS patients and twelve healthy subjects to either activate self-referential memories or to focus on a process without mnemonic content while recording a high-density electroencephalogram (EEG). Both tasks are designed to modulate activity in the default mode network (DMN) without involving sensorimotor pathways. We find that the two tasks can be distinguished after only one experimental session from the average of the combined bandpower modulations in the theta( 4-7 Hz) and alpha-range (8-13 Hz), with an average accuracy of 62.5% and 60.8% for healthy subjects and ALS patients, respectively. The spatial weights of the decoding algorithm show a preference for the parietal area, consistent with modulation of neural activity in primary nodes of the DMN.	[Hohmann, M.

The proposed kernel, which is based on Riemannian geometry, tries to preserve the topology of data points in the feature space. Topology preservation is the main challenge in nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR). Our main idea is to decrease the non-Euclidean characteristics of the manifold by modifying the volume elements. We apply a conformal transform over data-dependent isometric mapping to reduce the negative eigen fraction to learn a data dependent kernel over the Riemannian manifolds. Multiple experiments were carried out using the proposed kernel for a dimensionality reduction of SPD matrices that describe the EEG signals of dataset IIa from BCI competition IV. The experiments show that this kernel adapts to the input data and leads to promising results in comparison with the most popular manifold learning methods and the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) technique as a reference algorithm in BCI competitions. The proposed kernel is strong, particularly in the cases where data points have a complex and nonlinear separable distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

User Experience May be Producing Greater Heart Rate Variability than Motor Imagery Related Control Tasks during the User-System Adaptation in Brain-Computer Interfaces	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						brain-computer interface; motor imagery; event-related desynchronization; event-related synchronization; event-related heart rate; user experience	ERD/ERS PATTERNS; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; VISUALIZATION; ENVIRONMENT; ACTIVATION; MOVEMENT	Brain computer interface (BCI) is technology that is developing fast, but it remains inaccurate, unreliable and slow due to the difficulty to obtain precise information from the brain. Consequently, the involvement of other biosignals to decode the user control tasks has risen in importance. A traditional way to operate a BCI system is via motor imagery (MI) tasks. As imaginary movements activate similar cortical structures and vegetative mechanisms as a voluntary movement does, heart rate variability (HRV) has been proposed as a parameter to improve the detection of MI related control tasks. However, HR is very susceptible to body needs and environmental demands, and as BCI systems require high levels of attention, perceptual processing and mental workload, it is important to assess the practical effectiveness of HRV. The present study aimed to determine if brain and heart electrical signals (HRV) are modulated by MI activity used to control a BCI system, or if HRV is modulated by the user perceptions and responses that result from the operation of a BCI system (i.e., user experience). For this purpose, a database of 11 participants who were exposed to eight different situations was used. The sensory-cognitive load (intake and rejection tasks) was controlled in those situations. Two electrophysiological signals were utilized: electroencephalography and electrocardiography. From those biosignals, event-related (de-)synchronization maps and event-related HR changes were respectively estimated. The maps and the HR changes were cross-correlated in order to verify if both biosignals were modulated due to MI activity. The results suggest that HR varies according to the experience undergone by the user in a BCI working environment, and not because of the MI activity used to operate the system.

J	Das, N; Biesmans, W; Bertrand, A; Francart, T				Das, Neetha; Biesmans, Wouter; Bertrand, Alexander; Francart, Tom			The effect of head-related filtering and ear-specific decoding bias on auditory attention detection	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						auditory attention detection; EEG processing; neuro-steered auditory prostheses; brain-computer interface; cocktail party; speech stimuli; acoustic conditions	SPEECH; RESPONSES; TIME	Objective. We consider the problem of Auditory Attention Detection (AAD), where the goal is to detect which speaker a person is attending to, in a multi-speaker environment, based on neural activity. This work aims to analyze the influence of head-related filtering and ear-specific decoding on the performance of an AAD algorithm. Approach. We recorded high-density EEG of 16 normal-hearing subjects as they listened to two speech streams while tasked to attend to the speaker in either their left or right ear. The attended ear was switched between trials. The speech stimuli were administered either dichotically, or after filtering using Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs). A spatio-temporal decoder was trained and used to reconstruct the attended stimulus envelope, and the correlations between the reconstructed and the original stimulus envelopes were used to perform AAD, and arrive at a percentage correct score over all trials. Main results. We found that the HRTF condition resulted in significantly higher AAD performance than the dichotic condition. However, speech intelligibility, measured under the same set of conditions, was lower for the HRTF filtered stimuli. We also found that decoders trained and tested for a specific attended ear performed better, compared to decoders trained and tested for both left and right attended ear simultaneously. In the context of the decoders supporting hearing prostheses, the former approach is less realistic, and studies in which each subject always had to attend to the same ear may find over-optimistic results. Significance. This work shows the importance of using realistic binaural listening conditions and training on a balanced set of experimental conditions to obtain results that are more representative for the true AAD performance in practical applications.

Combined Single Neuron Unit Activity and Local Field Potential Oscillations in a Human Visual Recognition Memory Task	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Cognition; cognitive processing; gamma oscillations; high-frequency oscillations; hybrid electrodes; intracranial recordings; large-scale electrophysiology; neuronal assemblies; ripple oscillations	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; EEG; MANIFESTATION; RECORDINGS; SURFACE; ORIGIN; SPARSE	Goal: Activities of neuronal networks range from action potential firing of individual neurons, coordinated oscillations of local neuronal assemblies, and distributed neural populations. Here, we describe recordings using hybrid electrodes, containing both micro-and clinical macroelectrodes, to simultaneously sample both large-scale network oscillations and single neuron spiking activity in the medial temporal lobe structures of human subjects during a visual recognitionmemory task. We quantify and compare single neuron unit activity (SUA) with high-frequency macrofield oscillations (HFOs) for decoding visual images. Results: SUA and HFOs were recorded using hybrid electrodes containing both micro and macroelectrode contacts, implanted in patients with focal epilepsy. Decoding of image properties in different task trials was performed, analyzing SUA and HFO as point processes to capture the dynamics of neurons and their assemblies at different spatiotemporal scales, ranging from submillisecond discharges of single units to fast oscillations across large neuronal populations. Results highlight the limitations and potential complementary use of SUA and HFOs for decoding of general image properties. Conclusion: The dynamics of SUA and HFOs can be used to explore a wide range of neuronal assembly activities engaged in humanmemory processing. Significance: Hybrid electrodes provide a technological bridge for exploring multiscale activity, spanning individual neurons, their assemblies, and large-scale population activity reflected in local field potentials. Analysis of SUA and HFO dynamics as point processes provides a potentially useful signal processing method for exploring the neuronal correlates operating at different spatial scales.

Time-frequency coefficients at various scales were usually transformed into a 1-D array using only a single or a few signal channels. The steady improvement of biomedical recording techniques has increasingly permitted the registration of a high number of channels. However, WT-PCA is not applicable to high-dimensional recordings due to the curse of dimensionality and small sample size problem. In this study, we present a multiscale two-directional 2-D principal component analysis method for the efficient and effective extraction of essential feature information from high-dimensional signals. Multiscale matrices constructed in the first step incorporate the spatial correlation and physiological characteristics of subband signals among channels. In the second step, the two-directional 2-D PCA operates on the multiscale matrices to reduce the dimension, rather than vectors in conventional PCA. Results are presented from an experiment to classify 20 hand movements using 89-channel EMG signals recorded in stroke survivors, which illustrates the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method for a high-dimensional biomedical signal analysis.

However, the nexus between cognitive subprocesses, behavior, and electrophysiological processes remains associative in nature. We therefore investigated whether neurophysiological correlates of inhibition subprocesses merely correlate with behavioral performance or actually provide information expedient to the prediction of behavior on a single-subject level. Tackling this question, we used different data-driven classification approaches in a sample of n = 262 healthy young subjects who completed a standard Go/Nogo task while an EEG was recorded. On the basis of median-split response inhibition performance, subjects were classified as "accurate/slow" and "less accurate/fast." Even though these behavioral group differences were associated with significant amplitude variations in classical electrophysiological correlates of response inhibition (i.e., N2 and P3), they were not predictive for group membership on a single-subject level. Instead, amplitude differences in the Go-P2 originating in the precuneus (BA7) were shown to predict group membership on a single-subject level with up to 64% accuracy. These findings strongly suggest that the behavioral outcome of response inhibition greatly depends on the amount of cognitive resources allocated to early stages of stimulus-response activation during responding. This suggests that research should focus more on early processing steps during responding when trying to understand the origin of interindividual differences in response inhibition processes.

The purpose of this work was (a) to develop a brief neurometric battery capable of eliciting a broad profile of ERPs in a single, clinically practical recording session, and (b) to evaluate the sensitivity of this neurometric profile to age-related changes in brain function. Methods: Nested auditory stimuli were interleaved with visual stimuli to create a 20-min battery designed to elicit at least eight ERP components representing multiple sensory, perceptual, and cognitive processes (Frequency & Gap MMN, P50, P3, vMMN, C1, N2pc, and ERN). Data were recorded from 21 younger and 21 high-functioning older adults. Results: Significant multivariate differences were observed between ERP profiles of younger and older adults. Metrics derived from ERP profiles could be used to classify individuals into age groups with a jackknifed classification accuracy of 78.6%. Conclusions: Results support the utility of this design for neurometric profiling in clinical settings. Significance: This study demonstrates a method for measuring a broad profile of ERP-based neurometrics in a single, brief recording session. These markers may be used individually or in combination to characterize/classify patterns of sensory and/or perceptual brain function in clinical populations.

Multimodal Neural Network for Rapid Serial Visual Presentation Brain Computer Interface	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; deep learning; BCI; RSVP; single trial; neural network; computer vision	TRIAL EEG CLASSIFICATION	Brain computer interfaces allow users to preform various tasks using only the electrical activity of the brain. BCI applications often present the user a set of stimuli and record the corresponding electrical response. The BCI algorithm will then have to decode the acquired brain response and perform the desired task. In rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks, the subject is presented with a continuous stream of images containing rare target images among standard images, while the algorithm has to detect brain activity associated with target images. In this work, we suggest a multimodal neural network for RSVP tasks. The network operates on the brain response and on the initiating stimulus simultaneously, providing more information for the BCI application. We present two variants of the multimodal network, a supervised model, for the case when the targets are known in advanced, and a semi-supervised model for when the targets are unknown. We test the neural networks with a RSVP experiment on satellite imagery carried out with two subjects. The multimodal networks achieve a significant performance improvement in classification metrics. We visualize what the networks has learned and discuss the advantages of using neural network models for BCI applications.

Patients undergoing general anesthesia may awaken and become aware of the surgical procedure. Due to neuromuscular blocking agents, patients could be conscious yet unable to move. Using brain computer interface (BCI) technology, it may be possible to detect movement attempts from the EEG. However, it is unknown how an anesthetic influences the brain response to motor tasks. Approach. We tested the offline classification performance of a movement-based BCI in 12 healthy subjects at two effect-site concentrations of propofol. For each subject a second classifier was trained on the subject's data obtained before sedation, then tested on the data obtained during sedation (transfer classification'). Main results. At concentration 0.5 mu g ml(-1), despite an overall propofol EEG effect, the mean single trial classification accuracy was 85% (95% CI 81%-89%), and 83% (79%-88%) for the transfer classification. At 1.0 fig ml(-1), the accuracies were 81% (76%-86%), and 72% (66%-79%), respectively. At the highest propofol concentration for four subjects, unlike the remaining subjects, the movement related brain response had been largely diminished, and the transfer classification accuracy was not significantly above chance. These subjects showed a slower and more erratic task response, indicating an altered state of consciousness distinct from that of the other subjects. Significance. The results show the potential of using a BCI to detect intra-operative awareness and justify further development of this paradigm. At the same time, the relationship between motor responses and consciousness and its clinical relevance for intraoperative awareness requires further investigation.

However, the majority of this work has focused on specific temporal landmarks, such as N170 and N250 components, derived through univariate analyses of EEG data. Here, we take on a broader evaluation of ERP signals related to individual face recognition as we attempt to move beyond the leading theoretical and methodological framework through the application of pattern analysis to ERP data. Specifically, we investigate the spatiotemporal profile of identity recognition across variation in emotional expression. To this end, we apply pattern classification to ERP signals both in time, for any single electrode, and in space, across multiple electrodes. Our results confirm the significance of traditional ERP components in face processing. At the same time though, they support the idea that the temporal profile of face recognition is incompletely described by such components. First, we show that signals associated with different facial identities can be discriminated from each other outside the scope of these components, as early as 70 ms following stimulus presentation. Next, electrodes associated with traditional ERP components as well as, critically, those not associated with such components are shown to contribute information to stimulus discriminability. And last, the levels of ERP-based pattern discrimination are found to correlate with recognition accuracy across subjects confirming the relevance of these methods for bridging brain and behavior data. Altogether, the current results shed new light on the fine-grained time course of neural face processing and showcase the value of novel methods for pattern analysis to investigating fundamental aspects of visual recognition.

Channel selection can enhance the performance of BCI by removing task-irrelevant and redundant channels. Sequential floating forward selection (SFFS) is an intelligent search algorithm and is considered one of the best feature selection methods in the literature. However, SFFS is time consuming when the number of features is large. Method: In this study, the SFFS method was improved to select channels for the common spatial pattern (CSP) in motor imagery (MI)-based BCI. Based on the distribution of channels in the cerebral cortex, the adjacent channels would be treated as one feature for selection. Thus, in the search process, the improved SFFS could select or remove several channels in each iteration and reduce the total computation time. Results: The improved SFFS yielded significantly better performance than using all channels (p < 0.01) and support vector machine recursive feature elimination method (p < 0.05). The computation time of the proposed method was significantly reduced (p < 0.005) compared with the original SFFS method. Conclusions: This study improved the SFFS method to select channels for CSP in MI-based BCI. The improved SFFS method could significantly reduce computation time compared with the original SFFS without compromising the classification accuracy. This study provided a way to optimize electroencephalogram. channels, which combined the distribution of channels and the intelligent selection method (SFFS). Improvements were mainly in the perspective of reducing computation time, which leads to convenience in the practical application of BCI systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To critically evaluate these competing theories, we recorded electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from 15 human patients with intractable epilepsy during a word completion task and evaluated brain network dynamics across individuals. We used a novel technique of analyzing multihuman ECoG recordings to identify cortical regions most relevant to processing lexical information. The mid fusiform gyrus showed the strongest, earliest response after stimulus onset, whereas activity was maximal in frontal, dorsal lateral prefrontal, and sensorimotor regions toward articulation onset. To evaluate interregional functional connectivity, ECoG data from electrodes situated over specific cortical regions of interest were fit into linear multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) models. Spectral characteristics of the MVAR models were used to precisely reveal the timing and the magnitude of information flow between localized brain regions. This is the first application of MVAR for developing a comprehensive account of interregional interactions from a word reading ECoG dataset. Our comprehensive findings revealed both top-down and bottom-up influences between higher-level language areas and the mid fusiform gyrus. Our findings thus challenge strictly hierarchical, feedforward views of word reading and suggest that orthographic processes are modulated by prefrontal and sensorimotor regions via an interactive framework.

Detecting the Intention to Move Upper Limbs from Electroencephalographic Brain Signals	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							COMPUTER INTERFACES; FEATURE-SELECTION; MOVEMENTS; BCI; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; PEOPLE; HAND	Early decoding of motor states directly from the brain activity is essential to develop brain-machine interfaces (BMI) for natural motor control of neuroprosthetic devices. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the detection of movement information before the actual movement occurs. This information piece could be useful to provide early control signals to drive BMI-based rehabilitation and motor assisted devices, thus providing a natural and active rehabilitation therapy. In this work, electroencephalographic (EEG) brain signals from six healthy right-handed participants were recorded during self-initiated reaching movements of the upper limbs. The analysis of these EEG traces showed that significant event-related desynchronization is present before and during the execution of the movements, predominantly in the motor-related alpha and beta frequency bands and in electrodes placed above the motor cortex. This oscillatory brain activity was used to continuously detect the intention to move the limbs, that is, to identify the motor phase prior to the actual execution of the reaching movement. The results showed, first, significant classification between relax and movement intention and, second, significant detection of movement intention prior to the onset of the executed movement. On the basis of these results, detection of movement intention could be used in BMI settings to reduce the gap between mental motor processes and the actual movement performed by an assisted or rehabilitation robotic device.

The identification relies on the performance of the classifier. In this paper, identification and monitoring of electroencephalogram-based BCI for motor imagery (MI) task is proposed by an efficient adaptive neuro-fuzzy classifier (NFC). The Jaya optimization algorithm is integrated with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems to enhance classification accuracy. The linguistic hedge (LH) is used for proper elicitation and pruning of the fuzzy rules and network is trained using scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) and speeding up SCG (SSCG) techniques. In this paper, Jaya-based k-means is applied to divide the feature set into two mutually exclusive clusters and fire the fuzzy rule. The performance of the proposed classifier, Jaya-based NFC using SSCG as training algorithm and is powered by LH (JayaNFCSSCGLH), is compared with four different NFCs for classifying two class MI-based tasks. We observed a shortening of computation time per iteration by 57.78% in the case of SSCG as compared with the SCG technique of training. LH-based feature selecting capability of the proposed classifier not only reduces computation time but also improves the accuracy by discarding irrelevant features. Lesser computation time with fast convergence and high accuracy among considered NFCs make it a suitable choice for the real-time application. Supremacy of JayaNFCSSCGLH among the considered classifier is validated through Friedman test. Classification result is used to control switching of light emitting diode, turning thoughts into action.

In the present study, we investigated the neural dynamics underlying the maintenance of variably visible stimuli using magnetoencephalography. Subjects had to detect and mentally maintain the orientation of a masked grating. We show that the stimulus is fully encoded in early brain activity independently of visibility reports. However, the presence and orientation of the target are actively maintained throughout the brief retention period, even when the stimulus is reported as unseen. Source and decoding analyses revealed that perceptual maintenance recruits a hierarchical network spanning the early visual, temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices. Importantly, the representations coded in the late processing stages of this network specifically predicted visibility reports. These unexpected results challenge several theories of consciousness and suggest that invisible information can be briefly maintained within the higher processing stages of visual perception.

There are currently a number of publications that discuss the treatment, diagnosis, prognosis, and damage in schizophrenia. This study utilized joint independent component analysis to process the images of GMV and WMV and incorporated the Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST) and the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) to examine the correlation of obtained brain characteristics. We also used PANSS score to classify schizophrenic patients into acute and subacute cases, to analyze the brain structure differences. Finally, we used brain structure images and the error rate of the WCST as eigenvalues in support vector machine learning and classification. The results of this study showed that the frontal and temporal lobes of a normal brain are more apparent than those of a schizophrenia brain. The highest level of classification recognition reached 91.575%, indicating that the WCST error rate and characteristic changes in brain structure volume can be used to effectively distinguish schizophrenia and normal brains.

Each sensor generates humongous amount of data per second and needs to be processed in real-time. At the same time health monitoring systems are battery operated, thus they have rigid constraints on power and area of processing platform. Additionally, health monitoring systems should be accurate, thus we adapt machine learning techniques to improve detection accuracy. We propose a programmable Big Data Processing framework to reduce on-chip communications and computations, thus reducing energy of the processing. We integrate a low-overhead sketching framework with a low-power programmable PENC many-core platform. The sketching technique reduces the data communications and computations, additionally processing time is scaled down by parallel processing on the many-core platform. For demonstration we show seizure detection application with 22-channel of electroencephalograph (EEG), each channel generates 256 samples per second requiring total of 88 Kbps data rate. The computations are reduced by 16x while energy consumption of processing is reduced up to 68%. For compression rates of 2-16x, the seizure detection performance for sensitivity and specificity is degraded by 2.07% and 2.97%, respectively for Logistic Regression classifier.

We introduce an open-access comprehensive sleep dataset, called ISRUC-Sleep. The data were obtained from human adults, including healthy subjects, subjects with sleep disorders, and subjects under the effect of sleep medication. Each recording was randomly selected between PSG recordings that were acquired by the Sleep Medicine Centre of the Hospital of Coimbra University (CHUC). The dataset comprises three groups of data: (1) data concerning 100 subjects, with one recording session per subject; (2) data gathered from 8 subjects; two recording sessions were performed per subject, and (3) data collected from one recording session related to 10 healthy subjects. The polysomnography (PSG) recordings, associated with each subject, were visually scored by two human experts. Comparing the existing sleep-related public datasets, ISRUC-Sleep provides data of a reasonable number of subjects with different characteristics such as: data useful for studies involving changes in the PSG signals over time; and data of healthy subjects useful for studies involving comparison of healthy subjects with the patients, suffering from sleep disorders. This dataset was created aiming to complement existing datasets by providing easy-to apply data collection with some characteristics not covered yet. ISRUC-Sleep can be useful for analysis of new contributions: (i) in biomedical signal processing; (ii) in development of ASSC methods; and (iii) on sleep physiology studies. To evaluate and compare new contributions, which use this dataset as a benchmark, results of applying a subject-independent automatic sleep stage classification (ASSC) method on ISRUC-Sleep dataset are presented.

Individual finger control of a modular prosthetic limb using high-density electrocorticography in a human subject	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						BMI; brain machine interface; electrocorticography; finger; ECoG; brain computer interface; neural control	PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; BRAIN-MACHINE INTERFACE; POSTCENTRAL GYRUS; INTRACRANIAL EEG; HAND MOVEMENTS; ECOG SIGNALS; IMAGERY; ACTIVATION; GRASP; AREA	Objective. We used native sensorimotor representations of fingers in a brain machine interface (BMI) to achieve immediate online control of individual prosthetic fingers. Approach. Using high gamma responses recorded with a high-density electrocorticography (ECoG) array, we rapidly mapped the functional anatomy of cued finger movements. We used these cortical maps to select ECoG electrodes for a hierarchical linear discriminant analysis classification scheme to predict: (1) if any finger was moving, and, if so, (2) which digit was moving. To account for sensory feedback, we also mapped the spatiotemporal activation elicited by vibrotactile stimulation. Finally, we used this prediction framework to provide immediate online control over individual fingers of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory modular prosthetic limb. Main results. The balanced classification accuracy for detection of movements during the online control session was 92% (chance: 50%). At the onset of movement, finger classification was 76% (chance: 20%), and 88% (chance: 25%) if the pinky and ring finger movements were coupled. Balanced accuracy of fully flexing the cued finger was 64%, and 77% had we combined pinky and ring commands. Offline decoding yielded a peak finger decoding accuracy of 96.5% (chance: 20%) when using an optimized selection of electrodes Offline analysis demonstrated significant finger-specific activations throughout sensorimotor cortex. Activations either prior to movement onset or during sensory feedback led to discriminable finger control. Significance. Our results demonstrate the ability of ECoG-based BMIs to leverage the native functional anatomy of sensorimotor cortical populations to immediately control individual finger movements in real time.

Previous work has shown that an improvement in auditory discrimination over the first days of coma is predictive of awakening. Here, we aimed at evaluating this test on a large cohort of patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia and at investigating its added value on existing clinical measures. Methods: We recorded electroencephalographic responses to auditory stimuli in 94 comatose patients, under hypothermia and after rewarming to normal temperature. Auditory discrimination was semiautomatically quantified by decoding electroencephalographic responses to frequently repeated versus rare sounds. Outcome prediction was based on the change of decoding performance from hypothermia to normothermia. Results: An increase in auditory discrimination from hypothermia to normothermia was observed for 33 of 94 patients. Among them, 27 awoke from coma, resulting in a positive predictive value of awakening of 82% (95% confidence interval = 0.65-0.93). Most nonsurvivors showing an improvement in auditory discrimination had incident status epilepticus. By excluding them, 27 of 29 patients with improvement in auditory discrimination survived, resulting in a considerable improvement of the predictive value for awakening (93%, with 95% confidence interval = 0.77-0.99). Importantly, this test predicted the awakening of 13 of 51 patients for whom the outcome was uncertain based on current tests. Interpretation: The progression of auditory discrimination from hypothermia to normothermia has a high predictive value for awakening. This quantitative measure provides an added value to existing clinical tests and encourages the maintenance of life support.

The study shows that the most altered age group is the young individuals who contributes a lot of development activities. The survey shows that, one of five individual are prone to depression which may lead to nonperformance or attempt to destroy self from life. Dealing with the real time scenarios with life full of stress, it is hard for a depressed individual to go to a psychiatrist and take traditional treatment. We propose the formalization of the analytic system based on machine learning algorithm, which will be able to predict the level of depression for individuals and suggest respective remedy. The "Healing Hands for Depressed People System" (DHH) performs to accurately correlate the level of depression and justify the remedy given with the opinions of experts in domain. This significantly reduces the problem of primary consultancy from doctor and traditional treatment. The D-HH efficiently fits in the pockets of people in the modern era and add ease in this hectic life.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were acquired from 12 schizophrenia patients and 10 healthy controls during a visual word processing task. Two spectral power ratio (SPR) feature sets: the band power ratio (BPR) and the window power ratio (WPR) were extracted from MEG data in five frequency bands, four time windows of word processing, and at locations covering whole head. Cluster-based nonparametric permutation tests were employed to identify SPRs that show significant between-group difference. Machine learning based feature selection and classification techniques were then employed to select optimal combinations of the significant SPR features, and distinguish schizophrenia patients from healthy controls. We identified three BPR clusters and three WPR clusters that show significant oscillation power difference between groups. These include the theta/delta, alpha/delta and beta/delta BPRs during base-to-encode and encode time windows, and the beta band WPR from base to encode and from encode to post-encode windows. Based on two WPR and one BPR features combined, over 95% cross-validation classification accuracy was achieved using three different linear classifiers separately. These features may have potential as quantitative markers that discriminate schizophrenia patients and healthy controls; however, this needs further validation on larger samples.

Random forests in non-invasive sensorimotor rhythm brain-computer interfaces: a practical and convenient non-linear classifier	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING-BIOMEDIZINISCHE TECHNIK			English	Article						brain-computer interfaces; machine learning; random forests; regularized linear discriminant analysis; sensorimotor rhythms	MOTOR IMAGERY; EEG; COMMUNICATION; POTENTIALS	There is general agreement in the brain-computer interface (BCI) community that although nonlinear classifiers can provide better results in some cases, linear classifiers are preferable. Particularly, as non-linear classifiers often involve a number of parameters that must be carefully chosen. However, new non-linear classifiers were developed over the last decade. One of them is the random forest (RF) classifier. Although popular in other fields of science, RFs are not common in BCI research. In this work, we address three open questions regarding RFs in sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) BCIs: parametrization, online applicability, and performance compared to regularized linear discriminant analysis (LDA). We found that the performance of RF is constant over a large range of parameter values. We demonstrate - for the first time that RFs are applicable online in SMR-BCIs. Further, we show in an offline BCI simulation that RFs statistically significantly outperform regularized LDA by about 3%. These results confirm that RFs are practical and convenient non-linear classifiers for SMR-BCIs. Taking into account further properties of RFs, such as independence from feature distributions, maximum margin behavior, multiclass and advanced data mining capabilities, we argue that RFs should be taken into consideration for future BCIs.

We will explore whether the valence/arousal level of a subject's response to computer based stimuli is predictable using ECG and EDA, and whether or not that information can complement recordings of participants' cognitive data to form a more accurate depiction of emotional state. The experiment consists of presenting three types of stimuli, both interactive and noninteractive, to 9 subjects and recording their physiological response via ECG and EDA data as well as fNIRS device. The stimuli were selected from validated methods of inducing emotion including DEAP dataset [5], Multi Attribute Task Battery [6] and Tetris video game [7]. The participants' responses were captured using Self-Assessment Manikin [8] surveys which were used as the ground truth labels. The resulting data was analyzed using Machine Learning. The results provide new avenues of research in combining physiological data to classify emotion.

Heart rate variability is a well-known measurement parameter to predict driver vigilance state, but the measurement is susceptible to motion artifact due to body movement where the electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor device had to be worn close to the heart. Thus, this paper presents a novel approach to measure the ECG from the driver palms while holding on the steering wheel. In addition, photoplethysmograms sensor attached on a driver finger can also measure the similar heart rate pattern, known as pulse rate variability. Another significant vigilance measurement parameter, respiratory rate variability, can be derived directly from the ECG with the squaring baseline method, without the usage of respiratory sensor. Furthermore, this paper is also focusing on the integration of age and gender as vigilance measurement parameter as each individual exhibits distinct signal pattern. Autonomous rules are derived from the data set that performs the kernel fuzzy c-means with if-then rules extraction, which subsequently classify the driver vigilance level into two predefined classes, that are drowsy and awake. The vigilance monitoring application is developed in smartwatch, able to perform the features extraction, and then predict the driver vigilance class based on the Kernel Fuzzy-C-Mean trained model. A vibration warning will be triggered to the driver if the driver is estimated as drowsy in five consecutive time frames. In fact, the experimental results stated that the prediction accuracy can be achieved at 97.28% on average across variant subjects.

BCIs can be utilized to treat neurological conditions and even to augment brain functions. BCIs offer a promising treatment for mental disorders, including disorders of attention. Here we review the current state of the art and challenges of attention-based BCIs, with a focus on visual attention. Attention-based BCIs utilize electroencephalograms (EEGs) or other recording techniques to generate neurofeedback, which patients use to improve their attention, a complex cognitive function. Although progress has been made in the studies of neural mechanisms of attention, extraction of attention-related neural signals needed for BCI operations is a difficult problem. To attain good BCI performance, it is important to select the features of neural activity that represent attentional signals. BCI decoding of attention-related activity may be hindered by the presence of different neural signals. Therefore, BCI accuracy can be improved by signal processing algorithms that dissociate signals of interest from irrelevant activities. Notwithstanding recent progress, optimal processing of attentional neural signals remains a fundamental challenge for the development of efficient therapies for disorders of attention.

DROWSY BEHAVIOR DETECTION BASED ON DRIVING INFORMATION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Drowsy behavior; Acceleration; Steering angle; Random forest; Ensemble machine learning method; Vehicle safety	DRIVER DROWSINESS	Drowsy behavior is more likely to occur in sleep-deprived drivers. Individuals' drowsy behavior detection technology should be developed to prevent drowsiness related crashes. Driving information such as acceleration, steering angle and velocity, and physiological signals of drivers such as electroencephalogram (EEG), and eye tracking are adopted in present drowsy behavior detection technologies. However, it is difficult to measure physiological signal, and eye tracking requires complex experiment equipment. As a result, driving information is adopted for drowsy driving detection. In order to achieve this purpose, driving experiment is performed for obtaining driving information through driving simulator. Moreover, this paper investigates effects of using different input parameter combinations, which is consisted of lateral acceleration, longitudinal acceleration, and steering angles with different time window sizes (i.e. 4 s, 10 s, 20 s, 30 s, 60 s), on drowsy driving detection using random forest algorithm. 20 s-size datasets using parameter combination of accelerations in lateral and longitudinal directions, compared to the other combination cases of driving information such as steering angles combined with lateral and longitudinal acceleration, steering angles only, longitudinal acceleration only, and lateral acceleration only, is considered the most effective information for drivers' drowsy behavior detection. Moreover, comparing to ANN algorithm, RF algorithm performs better on processing complex input data for drowsy behavior detection. The results, which reveal high accuracy 84.8 % on drowsy driving behavior detection, can be applied on condition of operating real vehicles.	[Wang, M. S.; Jeong, N. T.; Kim, K. S.; Choi, S.

A promising tool for exploring potential biomarkers for mTBI is magnetoencephalography which has the advantage of high spatial and temporal resolution. By adopting proper analytic tools from the field of symbolic dynamics like Lempel-Ziv complexity, we can objectively characterize neural network alterations compared to healthy control by enumerating the different patterns of a symbolic sequence. This procedure oversimplifies the rich information of brain activity captured via MEG. For that reason, we adopted neural-gas algorithm which can transform a time series into more than two symbols by learning brain dynamics with a small reconstructed error. The proposed analysis was applied to recordings of 30 mTBI patients and 50 normal controls in delta frequency band. Our results demonstrated that mTBI patients could be separated from normal controls with more than 97% classification accuracy based on high complexity regions corresponding to right frontal areas. In addition, a reverse relation between complexity and transition rate was demonstrated for both groups. These findings indicate that symbolic complexity could have a significant predictive value in the development of reliable biomarkers to help with the early detection of mTBI.

Methods: We characterize SAHS in single-channel airflow (AF) signals from 317 subjects by the extraction of spectral and nonlinear features. Relevancy and redundancy analyses are conducted through the fast correlation-based filter to derive the optimum set of features among them. These are used to feed classifiers based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and classification and regression trees (CART). LDA and CART models are sequentially obtained through AB, which combines their performances to reach higher diagnostic ability than each of them separately. Results: Our AB-LDA and AB-CART approaches showed high diagnostic performance when determining SAHS and its severity. The assessment of different apnea-hypopnea index cutoffs using an independent test set derived into high accuracy: 86.5% (5 events/h), 86.5% (10 events/h), 81.0% (15 events/h), and 83.3% (30 events/h). These results widely outperformed those from logistic regression and a conventional event-detection algorithm applied to the same database. Conclusion: Our results suggest that AB applied to data from single-channel AF can be useful to determine SAHS and its severity. Significance: SAHS detection might be simplified through the only use of single-channel AF data.

MULTIVARIATE HURST EXPONENT ESTIMATION IN FMRI. APPLICATION TO BRAIN DECODING OF PERCEPTUAL LEARNING	2016 IEEE 13TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON BIOMEDICAL IMAGING (ISBI)	IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging		English	Proceedings Paper	13th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)	APR 13-16, 2016	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	IEEE, EMB, IEEE Signal Proc Soc, Amer Elements		fMRI; scale-free brain activity; Total variation regularization; multisensory learning	REST	So far considered as noise in neuroscience, irregular arrhythmic field potential activity accounts for the majority of the signal power recorded in EEG or MEG [1, 2]. This brain activity follows a power law spectrum P(f) similar to 1/f(beta) in the limit of low frequencies, which is a hallmark of scale invariance. Recently, several studies [1, 3-6] have shown that the slope beta (or equivalently Hurst exponent H) tends to be modulated by task performance or cognitive state (eg, sleep vs awake). These observations were confirmed in fMRI [7-9] although the short length of fMRI time series makes these findings less reliable. In this paper, to compensate for the slower sampling rate in fMRI, we extend univariate wavelet-based Hurst exponent estimator to a multivariate setting using spatial regularization. Next, we demonstrate the relevance of the proposed tools on resting-state fMRI data recorded in three groups of individuals once they were specifically trained to a visual discrimination task during a MEG experiment [10]. In a supervised classification framework, our multivariate approach permits to better predict the type of training the participants received as compared to their univariate counterpart.

NeuroVault.org: A repository for sharing unthresholded statistical maps, parcellations, and atlases of the human brain	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article								NeuroVault.org is dedicated to storing outputs of analyses in the form of statistical maps, parcellations and atlases, a unique strategy that contrasts with most neuroimaging repositories that store raw acquisition data or stereotaxic coordinates. Such maps are indispensable for performing meta-analyses, validating novel methodology, and deciding on precise outlines for regions of interest (ROIs). NeuroVault is open to maps derived from both healthy and clinical populations, as well as from various imaging modalities (sMRI, fMRI, EEG, MEG, PET, etc.). The repository uses modern web technologies such as interactive web-based visualization, cognitive decoding, and comparison with other maps to provide researchers with efficient, intuitive tools to improve the understanding of their results. Each dataset and map is assigned a permanent Universal Resource Locator CURL), and all of the data is accessible through a REST Application Programming Interface (API). Additionally, the repository supports the NIDM-Results standard and has the ability to parse outputs from popular FSL and SPM software packages to automatically extract relevant metadata.

Decoding the Attentional Demands of Gait through EEG Gamma Band Features	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MAXIMUM-ENTROPY METHOD; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; MOTOR IMAGERY; BHATTACHARYYA DISTANCE; NEUROLOGICAL REHABILITATION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; TASK DEMANDS	Rehabilitation techniques are evolving focused on improving their performance in terms of duration and level of recovery. Current studies encourage the patient's involvement in their rehabilitation. Brain-Computer Interfaces are capable of decoding the cognitive state of users to provide feedback to an external device. On this paper, cortical information obtained from the scalp is acquired with the goal of studying the cognitive mechanisms related to the users' attention to the gait. Data from 10 healthy users and 3 incomplete Spinal Cord Injury patients are acquired during treadmill walking. During gait, users are asked to perform 4 attentional tasks. Data obtained are treated to reduce movement artifacts. Features from delta(1 - 4Hz), theta(4 -8Hz), alpha(8 - 12Hz), beta(12 -30Hz), gamma(low)(30 -50Hz), gamma(high)(50 - 90Hz) frequency bands are extracted and analyzed to find which ones provide more information related to attention. The selected bands are tested with 5 classifiers to distinguish between tasks. Classification results are also compared with chance levels to evaluate performance. Results show success rates of similar to 67% for healthy users and similar to 59% for patients. These values are obtained using features from. band suggesting that the attention mechanisms are related to selective attention mechanisms, meaning that, while the attention on gait decreases the level of attention on the environment and external visual information increases. Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine classifiers provide the best results for all users. Results from patients are slightly lower, but significantly different, than those obtained from healthy users supporting the idea that the patients pay more attention to gait during non-attentional tasks due to the inherent difficulties they have during normal gait. This study provides evidence of the existence of classifiable cortical information related to the attention level on the gait. This fact could allow the development of a real-time system that obtains the attention level during lower limb rehabilitation. This information could be used as feedback to adapt the rehabilitation strategy.

However, the influence of attention manipulation on facial-vocal integration during emotional change perception is still elusive at this point. To address this issue, we asked participants to detect emotional changes conveyed by prosodies (vocal task) or facial expressions (facial task) while facial, vocal, and facial-vocal expressions were presented. At the same time, behavioral responses and electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. Behavioral results showed that bimodal emotional changes were detected with shorter response latencies compared to each unimodal condition, suggesting that bimodal emotional cues facilitated emotional change detection. Moreover, while the P3 amplitudes were larger for the bimodal change condition than for the sum of the two unimodal conditions regardless of attention direction, the N1 amplitudes were larger for the bimodal emotional change condition than for the sum of the two unimodal conditions under the attend-voice condition, but not under the attend-face condition. These findings suggest that selective attention modulates facial-vocal integration during emotional change perception in early sensory processing, but not in late cognitive processing stages.

High frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings are considered as promising clinical biomarkers of epileptogenic regions in the brain. The aim of this study is to improve and automatize the detection of HFOs by exploring the time frequency content of iEEG and to investigate the seizure onset zone (SOZ) detection accuracy during the sleep, awake and pre-ictal states in patients with epilepsy, for the purpose of assisting the localization of SOZ in clinical practice. Approach. Ten-minute iEEG segments were defined during different states in eight patients with refractory epilepsy. A three-stage algorithm was implemented to detect HFOs in these segments. First, an amplitude based initial detection threshold was used to generate a large pool of HFO candidates. Then distinguishing features were extracted from the time and time frequency domain of the raw iEEG and used with a Gaussian mixture model clustering to isolate HFO events from other activities. The spatial distribution of HFO clusters was correlated with the seizure onset channels identified by neurologists in seven patient with good surgical outcome. Main results. The overlapping rates of localized channels and seizure onset locations were high in all states. The best result was obtained using the iEEG data during sleep, achieving a sensitivity of 81%, and a specificity of 96%. The channels with maximum number of HFOs identified epileptogenic areas where the seizures occurred more frequently. Significance. The current study was conducted using iEEG data collected in realistic clinical conditions without channel pre-exclusion. HFOs were investigated with novel features extracted from the entire frequency band, and were correlated with SOZ in different states. The results indicate that automatic HFO detection with unsupervised clustering methods exploring the time frequency content of raw iEEG can be efficiently used to identify the epileptogenic zone with an accurate and efficient manner.

Psychiatric classifications conceptualize ADs as distinct entities, with strong support from neuroscience fields. Yet, comorbidity and pharmacological response suggest a single "serotonin dysfunction" dimension. Whether AD is one or several disorders goes beyond academic quarrels, and the distinction has therapeutic relevance. Addressing the underlying dysfunctions should improve treatment response. By its own nature, neurophysiology can be the best tool to address dysfunctional processes. Purpose: To search for neurophysiological dysfunctions and differences among panic disorder (PD), agoraphobia-social-specific phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and generalized anxiety disorder. Methods: A sample population of 192 unmedicated patients and 30 aged-matched controls partook in this study. Hypothesis-related neurophysiological variables were combined into ten independent factors: 1) dysrhythmic patterns, 2) delta, 3) theta, 4) alpha, 5) beta (whole-head absolute power z-scores), 6) event-related potential (ERP) combined latency, 7) ERP combined amplitude (z-scores), 8) magnitude, 9) site, and 10) site of hyperactive networks. Combining single variables into representative factors was necessary because, as in all real-life phenomena, the complexity of interactive processes cannot be addressed through single variables and the multiplicity of potentially implicated variables would demand an extremely large sample size for statistical analysis. Results: The nonparametric analysis correctly classified 81% of the sample. Dysrhythmic patterns, decreased delta, and increased beta differentiated AD from controls. Shorter ERP latencies were found in several individual patients, mostly from the OCD group. Hyperactivities were found at the right frontorbital-striatal network in OCD and at the panic circuit in PD. Conclusions: Our findings support diffuse cortical instability in AD in general, with individual differences in information processing deficits and regional hyperactivities in OCD and PD. Study limitations and the rationale behind the variable selection and combination strategy will be discussed before addressing the therapeutic implications of our findings.

This communication does not require any muscular movements. A novel Devanagari script (DS) input-based P300 speller system is proposed in this article. A novel 8x8 matrix consisting of Devanagari characters, digits, and special symbols has also been proposed as a DS paradigm. The character set associated with the DS paradigm is comparatively larger than the standard 6x6 English Row/Column (RC) paradigm. The problems related to crowding effect, fatigue, and task difficulty increase while using the DS paradigm for the P300 speller. This leads to either exhaustive or false detection of characters. In order to overcome these problems, a novel Weighted Ensemble of Support Vector Machines (WESVM)-based method has been proposed for classification. Further improvement in the system performance in terms of accuracy and reduced computational cost has been achieved by employing a binary Differential Evolution (DE) method for optimal channel selection. The proposed method has been tested on the EEG data collected from nine subjects using the DS paradigm. An average accuracy of 94.2% was achieved when the WESVM method was applied with the binary DE-based channel selection method.

They bridge the impaired connection in the sensorimotor loop by providing brain-state dependent proprioceptive feedback with orthotic devices attached to the hand or arm of the patients. The underlying neurophysiology of this BRI neuromodulation is still largely unknown. We investigated changes of corticospinal excitability with transcranial magnetic stimulation in thirteen right-handed healthy subjects who performed 40 min of kinesthetic motor imagery receiving proprioceptive feedback with a robotic orthosis attached to the left hand contingent to event-related desynchronization of the right sensorimotor cortex in the beta-band (16-22 Hz). Neural correlates of this BRI intervention were probed by acquiring the stimulus-response curve (SRC) of both motor evoked potential (MEP) peak-to-peak amplitudes and areas under the curve. In addition, a motor mappingwas obtained. The specificity of the effects was studied by comparing two neighboring hand muscles, one BRI-trained and one control muscle. Robust changes of MEP amplitude but not MEP area occurred following the BRI intervention, but only in the BRI-trained muscle. The steep part of the SRC showed an MEP increase, while the plateau of the SRC showed an MEP decrease. MEP mapping revealed a distributed pattern with a decrease of excitability in the hand area of the primary motor cortex, which controlled the BRI, but an increase of excitability in the surrounding somatosensory and premotor cortex. In conclusion, the BRI intervention induced a complex pattern of modulated corticospinal excitability, which may boost subsequent motor learning during physiotherapy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

CAN-BIND Investigator Team	Discovering biomarkers for antidepressant response: protocol from the Canadian biomarker integration network in depression (CAN-BIND) and clinical characteristics of the first patient cohort	BMC PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							RATING-SCALE; DOUBLE-BLIND; RELIABILITY; VALIDATION; DISORDER; QUESTIONNAIRE; MULTICENTER; INTERVIEW; VALIDITY; REWARD	Background: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is among the most prevalent and disabling medical conditions worldwide. Identification of clinical and biological markers ("biomarkers") of treatment response could personalize clinical decisions and lead to better outcomes. This paper describes the aims, design, and methods of a discovery study of biomarkers in antidepressant treatment response, conducted by the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN-BIND). The CAN-BIND research program investigates and identifies biomarkers that help to predict outcomes in patients with MDD treated with antidepressant medication. The primary objective of this initial study (known as CAN-BIND-1) is to identify individual and integrated neuroimaging, electrophysiological, molecular, and clinical predictors of response to sequential antidepressant monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in MDD. Methods: CAN-BIND-1 is a multisite initiative involving 6 academic health centres working collaboratively with other universities and research centres. In the 16-week protocol, patients with MDD are treated with a first-line antidepressant (escitalopram 10-20 mg/d) that, if clinically warranted after eight weeks, is augmented with an evidence-based, add-on medication (aripiprazole 2-10 mg/d). Comprehensive datasets are obtained using clinical rating scales; behavioural, dimensional, and functioning/quality of life measures; neurocognitive testing; genomic, genetic, and proteomic profiling from blood samples; combined structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging; and electroencephalography. De-identified data from all sites are aggregated within a secure neuroinformatics platform for data integration, management, storage, and analyses. Statistical analyses will include multivariate and machine-learning techniques to identify predictors, moderators, and mediators of treatment response. Discussion: From June 2013 to February 2015, a cohort of 134 participants (85 outpatients with MDD and 49 healthy participants) has been evaluated at baseline. The clinical characteristics of this cohort are similar to other studies of MDD. Recruitment at all sites is ongoing to a target sample of 290 participants. CAN-BIND will identify biomarkers of treatment response in MDD through extensive clinical, molecular, and imaging assessments, in order to improve treatment practice and clinical outcomes. It will also create an innovative, robust platform and database for future research.

Neural and behavioral correlates of selective stopping: Evidence for a different strategy adoption	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Selective stopping; Stimulus-selective stop-signal task; Strategy; Event-related potentials (ERPs); Source localization	INFERIOR FRONTAL-CORTEX; RESPONSE-INHIBITION; SIGNAL TASK; BRAIN; EEG; LOCALIZATION; IMPULSIVITY; PERFORMANCE; COMPONENTS; ATTENTION	The present study examined the neural and behavioral correlates of selective stopping, a form of inhibition that has scarcely been investigated. The selectivity of the inhibitory process is needed when individuals have to deal with an environment filled with multiple stimuli, some of which require inhibition and some of which do not. The stimulus-selective stop-signal task has been used to explore this issue assuming that all participants interrupt their ongoing responses selectively to stop but not to ignore signals. However, recent behavioral evidence suggests that some individuals do not carry out the task as experimenters expect, since they seemed to interrupt their response non-selectively to both signals. In the present study, we detected and controlled the cognitive strategy adopted by participants (n = 57) when they performed a stimulus-selective stop-signal task before comparing brain activation between conditions. In order to determine both the onset and the end of the response cancellation process underlying each strategy and to fully take advantage of the precise temporal resolution of event-related potentials, we used amass univariate approach. Source localization techniques were also employed to estimate the neural underpinnings of the effects observed at the scalp level. Our results from scalp and source level analysis support the behavioral-based strategy classification. Specific effects were observed depending on the strategy adopted by participants. Thus, when contrasting successful stop versus ignore conditions, increased activation was only evident for subjects who were classified as using a strategy whereby the response interruption process was selective to stop trials. This increased activity was observed during the P3 time window in several left-lateralized brain regions, including middle and inferior frontal gyri, as well as parietal and insular cortices. By contrast, in those participants who used a strategy characterized by stopping non-selectively, no activation differences between successful stop and ignore conditions were observed at the estimated time at which response interruption process occurs. Overall, results from the current study highlight the importance of controlling for the different strategies adopted by participants to perform selective stopping tasks before analyzing brain activation patterns.

It involves a mapping from continuous acoustic waveforms onto the discrete phonological units computed to store words in the mental lexicon. In this article, we review the magnetoencephalographic studies that have explored the timing and morphology of the Ni m component to investigate how vowels and consonants are computed and represented within the auditory cortex. The neurons that are involved in the Nlm act to construct a sensory memory of the stimulus due to spatially and temporally distributed activation patterns within the auditory cortex. Indeed, localization of auditory fields maps in animals and humans suggested two levels of sound coding, a tonotopy dimension for spectral properties and a tonochrony dimension for temporal properties of sounds. When the stimulus is a complex speech sound, tonotopy and tonochrony data may give important information to assess whether the speech sound parsing and decoding are generated by pure bottom-up reflection of acoustic differences or whether they are additionally affected by top-down processes related to phonological categories. Hints supporting pure bottom-up processing coexist with hints supporting top-down abstract phoneme representation. Actually. N1 m data (amplitude, latency, source generators, and hemispheric distribution) are limited and do not help to disentangle the issue. The nature of these limitations is discussed. Moreover, neurophysiological studies on animals and neuroimaging studies on humans have been taken into consideration. We compare also the N1m findings with the investigation of the magnetic mismatch negativity (MMNm) component and with the analogous electrical components, the N1 and the MMN. We conclude that N1 seems more sensitive to capture lateralization and hierarchical processes than N1 m, although the data are very preliminary. Finally, we suggest that MEG data should be integrated with EEG data in the light of the neural oscillations framework	[Manca, Anna Dora; Grimaldi, Mirko] Univ Salento, Ctr Ric Interdisciplinare Linguaggio, Dipartimento Studi Umanistici, Lecce, Italy; [Manca, Anna Dora; Grimaldi, Mirko] Lab Diffuso Ric Interdisciplinare Applicata, Lecce, Italy		Grimaldi, M (corresponding author), Univ Salento, Ctr Ric Interdisciplinare Linguaggio, Dipartimento Studi Umanistici, Lecce, Italy.; Grimaldi, M (corresponding author), Lab Diffuso Ric Interdisciplinare Applicata, Lecce, Italy.	mirko.grimaldi@unisalento.it		Grimaldi, Mirko/0000-0002-0940-3645	Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research [PRIN 20128YAFKB_006]	Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))	We thank Francesco Sigona for the technical assistance in developing some of the Figures and Bianca Sisinni for providing us the data for the Figure 2.

Auditory Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) are useful for understanding early auditory development among infants, as it allows the collection of a relatively large amount of data in a short time. So far, studies that have investigated development in auditory ERPs in infancy have mainly used single sounds as stimuli. Yet in real life, infants must decode successive rather than single acoustic events. In the present study, we tested 4-, 8-, and 12-month-old infants' auditory ERPs to musical melodies comprising three piano notes, and examined ERPs to each individual note in the melody. Methods. Infants were presented with 360 repetitions of a three-note melody while EEG was recorded from 128 channels on the scalp through a Geodesic Sensor Net. For each infant, both latency and amplitude of auditory components P1 and N2 were measured from averaged ERPs for each individual note. Results. Analysis was restricted to response collected at frontal central site. For all three notes, there was an overall reduction in latency for both P1 and N2 over age. For P1, latency reduction was significant from 4 to 8 months, but not from 8 to 12 months. N2 latency, on the other hand, decreased significantly from 4 to 8 to 12 months. With regard to amplitude, no significant change was found for either P1 or N2. Nevertheless, the waveforms of the three age groups were qualitatively different: for the 4-month-olds, the P1-N2 deflection was attenuated for the second and the third notes; for the 8-month-olds, such attenuation was observed only for the middle note; for the 12-month-olds, the P1 and N2 peaks show relatively equivalent amplitude and peak width across all three notes. Conclusion. Our findings indicate that the infant brain is able to register successive acoustic events in a stream, and ERPs become better time-locked to each composite event over age. Younger infants may have difficulties in responding to late occurring events in a stream, and the onset response to the late events may overlap with the incomplete response to preceding events.
