However, no studies explore how to decode the velocity of complex motion. In this paper, we apply extreme learning machine (ELM) to explore how to decode the velocity of complex motion from EEG signals. We design a new experimental paradigm and analyze the effects of the number of hidden neuron nodes and frequency band on the decoding performance. This work lays a foundation of building accurate motion decoders from EEG signals to develop the BCIbased prostheses and rehabilitation systems.

Multiple Kernel Based Region Importance Learning for Neural Classification of Gait States from EEG Signals	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain machine interface(BMI); neural classification; electroencephalography (EEG); machin elearning; multiple kernel learning	SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; TREADMILL WALKING; ROBOT; REHABILITATION; SELECTION; THERAPY; MACHINE; STROKE	With the development of Brain Machine Interface (BMI) systems, people with motor disabilities are able to control external devices to help them restore movement abilities. Longitudinal validation of these systems is critical not only to assess long-term performance reliability but also to investigate adaptations in electrocortical patterns due to learning to use the BMI system. In this paper, we decode the patterns of user's intended gait states (e.g., stop, walk, turn left, and turn right) from scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals and simultaneously learn the relative importance of different brain areas by using the multiple kernel learning (MKL) algorithm. The region of importance (ROI) is identified during training the MKL for classification. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated by classifying different movement intentions from two subjects-an able-bodied and a spinal cord injury (SCI) subject. The preliminary results demonstrate that frontal and fronto-central regions are the most important regions for the tested subjects performing gait movements, which is consistent with the brain regions hypothesized to be involved in the control of lower-limb movements. However, we observed some regional changes comparing the able-bodied and the SCI subject. Moreover, in the longitudinal experiments, our findings exhibit the cortical plasticity triggered by the BMI use, as the classification accuracy and the weights for important regions-in sensor space-generally increased, as the user learned to control the exoskeleton for movement over multiple sessions.

Concurrent scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which we refer to as EEG+fNIRS, promises greater accuracy than the individual modalities while remaining nearly as convenient as EEG. We sought to quantify the hybrid system's ability to decode mental states and compare it with its unimodal components. Approach. We recorded from healthy volunteers taking the category fluency test and applied machine learning techniques to the data. Main results. EEG+fNIRS's decoding accuracy was greater than that of its subsystems, partly due to the new type of neurovascular features made available by hybrid data. Significance. Availability of an accurate and practical decoding method has potential implications for medical diagnosis, brain-computer interface design, and neuroergonomics.

Improving and evaluating the way in which patterns of results are identified and classified may help uncover answers that are not always obvious. This paper attempts to discover such patterns found in brainwave signals in adults who have been diagnosed with dyslexia using classifiers. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals captured during real-word and nonsense-word reading activities from adults with dyslexia were compared with normal controls. The classification was performed using Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) and Cubic Support Vector Machine (CSVM) on different lobes of the brain. The study revealed that the nonsense-words classifiers produced higher validation accuracies compared to real-words classifiers, confirming difficulties in phonological decoding skills seen in individuals with dyslexia are reflected in the brainwave patterns.

There is increasing interest in using deep ConvNets for end-to-end EEG analysis, but a better understanding of how to design and train ConvNets for end-to-end EEG decoding and how to visualize the informative EEG features the ConvNets learn is still needed. Here, we studied deep ConvNets with a range of different architectures, designed for decoding imagined or executed tasks from raw EEG. Our results show that recent advances from the machine learning field, including batch normalization and exponential linear units, together with a cropped training strategy, boosted the deep ConvNets decoding performance, reaching at least as good performance as the widely used filter bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP) algorithm (mean decoding accuracies 82.1% FBCSP, 84.0% deep ConvNets). While FBCSP is designed to use spectral power modulations, the features used by ConvNets are not fixed a priori. Our novel methods for visualizing the learned features demonstrated that ConvNets indeed learned to use spectral power modulations in the alpha, beta, and high gamma frequencies, and proved useful for spatially mapping the learned features by revealing the topography of the causal contributions of features in different frequency bands to the decoding decision. Our study thus shows how to design and train ConvNets to decode task-related information from the raw EEG without handcrafted features and highlights the potential of deep ConvNets combined with advanced visualization techniques for EEG-based brain mapping.

Many studies reported in the literature are based on the brain activity patterns using either fMRI or EEG/MEG only. EEG and fMRI considered as two complementary neuroimaging modalities in terms of their temporal and spatial resolution to map the brain activity. For getting a high spatial and temporal resolution of the brain at the same time, simultaneous EEG-fMRI seems to be fruitful. METHODS: In this article, we propose a new method based on simultaneous EEG- fMRI data and machine learning approach to classify the visual brain activity patterns. We acquired EEG- fMRI data simultaneously on the ten healthy human participants by showing them visual stimuli. Data fusion approach is used to merge EEG and fMRI data. Machine learning classifier is used for the classification purposes. RESULTS: Results showed that superior classification performance has been achieved with simultaneous EEG- fMRI data as compared to the EEG and fMRI data standalone. This shows that multimodal approach improved the classification accuracy results as compared with other approaches reported in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed simultaneous EEG-fMRI approach for classifying the brain activity patterns can be helpful to predict or fully decode the brain activity patterns.

The proposed strategy involves two main approaches applied to a BCI case study in electroencephalography (EEG) motor imagery classification. The first is relate to apply clustering analysis by similarity in multi-class SVM and the later introduces SVM optimization procedures based on ABC algorithm. The objective of applying clustering analysis by similarity is to grouping different classes into a one, based on their proximity in the feature space. The performance enhancements achieved on classification task of EEG signals (Berlin BCI competition IV dataset) by the proposed SVM-ABC approach outperformed others SVM approaches found in literature.

Common spatial patterns (CSP) method is a frequently used machine learning algorithm for discriminative feature extraction in MI related BMIs. Although CSP is a famous and effective method in BMI applications, the intrinsic variations in the EEG signal properties would affect its performance. To address this issue, instead of using the eigenvalues for spatial filter vectors selection as instructed by the traditional CSP approach, we present a novel criterion which considers not only the differences between different classes but also the dissimilarities in the same class in a data-driven manner for robust spatial filter construction. We compared our method against CSP using a public dataset, namely dataset IVa of BCI competition M. The final results of the experiment indicate that our approach gives higher classification accuracy, by reducing the variations in the same class.

However, these EEG signals are susceptible to noise and a filtering preprocessing is necessary before the feature extraction and classification. There are very good algorithms detecting motor intensities in the upper limbs such as Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) with spectral density characteristics. However, in the present work we propose to determine the algorithms of extraction of characteristics and classification that allow to detect satisfactorily the motor intensities in lower limbs.

Different spatio-temporal electroencephalography features drive the successful decoding of binaural and monaural cues for sound localization	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						azimuth; electroencephalography; elevation; sound localization; spatial hearing	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; HUMAN BRAIN; LEVEL DIFFERENCES; COCKTAIL PARTY; MOTION; LOCATION; HUMANS; CLASSIFICATION; REPRESENTATION	The human ability to localize sound is essential for monitoring our environment and helps us to analyse complex auditory scenes. Although the acoustic cues mediating sound localization have been established, it remains unknown how these cues are represented in human cortex. In particular, it is still a point of contention whether binaural and monaural cues are processed by the same or distinct cortical networks. In this study, participants listened to a sequence of auditory stimuli from different spatial locations while we recorded their neural activity using electroencephalography (EEG). The stimuli were presented over a loudspeaker array, which allowed us to deliver realistic, free-field stimuli in both the horizontal and vertical planes. Using a multivariate classification approach, we showed that it is possible to decode sound source location from scalp-recorded EEG. Robust and consistent decoding was shown for stimuli that provide binaural cues (i.e. Left vs. Right stimuli). Decoding location when only monaural cues were available (i.e. Front vs. Rear and elevational stimuli) was successful for a subset of subjects and showed less consistency. Notably, the spatio-temporal pattern of EEG features that facilitated decoding differed based on the availability of binaural and monaural cues. In particular, we identified neural processing of binaural cues at around 120 ms post-stimulus and found that monaural cues are processed later between 150 and 200 ms. Furthermore, different spatial activation patterns emerged for binaural and monaural cue processing. These spatio-temporal dissimilarities suggest the involvement of separate cortical mechanisms in monaural and binaural acoustic cue processing.

Prior BMI efforts based on scalp electroencephalography (EEG) have revealed that fluctuations in the amplitude of slow cortical potentials in the delta band contain information that can be used to infer motor intent, and more specifically, the kinematics of walking and non-locomotive tasks such as sitting and standing. However, little is known about the extent to which EEG can be used to discern the expressive qualities that influence such functional movements. Here, we discuss how novel experimental approaches integrated with machine learning techniques can deployed to decode expressive qualities of movement. Applications to artistic brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), movement aesthetics, and gait neuroprostheses endowed with expressive qualities aloe discussed.

Whenever these models are linear, the estimated parameters can be visualized in the form of brain maps which can aid in understanding how brain activity in space and time underlies a cognitive function. However, the recovered brain maps often suffer from lack of interpretability, especially in group analysis of multi-subject data. New method: To facilitate the application of brain decoding in group-level analysis, we present an application of multi-task joint feature learning for group-level multivariate pattern recovery in single-trial magnetoencephalography (MEG) decoding. The proposed method allows for recovering sparse yet consistent patterns across different subjects, and therefore enhances the interpretability of the decoding model. Results: Our experimental results demonstrate that the mutli-task joint feature learning framework is capable of recovering more meaningful patterns of varying spatio-temporally distributed brain activity across individuals while still maintaining excellent generalization performance. Comparison with existing methods: We compare the performance of the multi-task joint feature learning in terms of generalization, reproducibility, and quality of pattern recovery against traditional single-subject and pooling approaches on both simulated and real MEG datasets. Conclusions: These results can facilitate the usage of brain decoding for the characterization of fine level distinctive patterns in group-level inference. Considering the importance of group-level analysis, the proposed approach can provide a methodological shift towards more interpretable brain decoding models. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Brain-computer-interfaces (BCIs) have been proposed not only as assistive technologies but also as rehabilitation tools for lost functions. However, due to the stochastic nature, poor spatial resolution and signal to noise ratio from electroencephalography (EEG), multidimensional decoding has been the main obstacle to implement non-invasive BCIs in real-live rehabilitation scenarios. This study explores the classification of several functional reaching movements from the same limb using EEG oscillations in order to create a more versatile BCI for rehabilitation. Approach. Nine healthy participants performed four 3D center-out reaching tasks in four different sessions while wearing a passive robotic exoskeleton at their right upper limb. Kinematics data were acquired from the robotic exoskeleton. Multiclass extensions of Filter Bank Common Spatial Patterns (FBCSP) and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier were used to classify the EEG activity into four forward reaching movements (from a starting position towards four target positions), a backward movement (from any of the targets to the starting position and rest). Recalibrating the classifier using data from previous or the same session was also investigated and compared. Main results. Average EEG decoding accuracy were significantly above chance with 67%, 62.75%, and 50.3% when decoding three, four and six tasks from the same limb, respectively. Furthermore, classification accuracy could be increased when using data from the beginning of each session as training data to recalibrate the classifier. Significance. Our results demonstrate that classification from several functional movements performed by the same limb is possible with acceptable accuracy using EEG oscillations, especially if data from the same session are used to recalibrate the classifier. Therefore, an ecologically valid decoding could be used to control assistive or rehabilitation mutli-degrees of freedom (DoF) robotic devices using EEG data. These results have important implications towards assistive and rehabilitative neuroprostheses control in paralyzed patients.

Brain-actuated gait trainer with visual and proprioceptive feedback	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-machine interface (BMI); electroencephalography (EEG); lower-limb rehabilitation; proprioceptive feedback	COMPUTER INTERFACES; MACHINE INTERFACES; EXOSKELETON; DESYNCHRONIZATION; ANKLE	Objective. Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have been proposed in closed-loop applications for neuromodulation and neurorehabilitation. This study describes the impact of different feedback modalities on the performance of an EEG-based BMI that decodes motor imagery (MI) of leg flexion and extension. Approach. We executed experiments in a lower-limb gait trainer (the legoPress) where nine able-bodied subjects participated in three consecutive sessions based on a crossover design. A random forest classifier was trained from the offline session and tested online with visual and proprioceptive feedback, respectively. Post-hoc classification was conducted to assess the impact of feedback modalities and learning effect (an improvement over time) on the simulated trial-based performance. Finally, we performed feature analysis to investigate the discriminant power and brain pattern modulations across the subjects. Main results. (i) For real-time classification, the average accuracy was 62.33 +/- 4.95% and 63.89 +/- 6.41% for the two online sessions. The results were significantly higher than chance level, demonstrating the feasibility to distinguish between MI of leg extension and flexion. (ii) For post-hoc classification, the performance with proprioceptive feedback (69.45 +/- 9.95%) was significantly better than with visual feedback (62.89 +/- 9.20%), while there was no significant learning effect. (iii) We reported individual discriminate features and brain patterns associated to each feedback modality, which exhibited differences between the two modalities although no general conclusion can be drawn. Significance. The study reported a closed-loop brain-controlled gait trainer, as a proof of concept for neurorehabilitation devices. We reported the feasibility of decoding lower-limb movement in an intuitive and natural way. As far as we know, this is the first online study discussing the role of feedback modalities in lower-limb MI decoding. Our results suggest that proprioceptive feedback has an advantage over visual feedback, which could be used to improve robotassisted strategies for motor training and functional recovery.

This paper attempts to discover such unique brainwave signal patterns found in adults with dyslexia using EEG while performing tasks that are more challenging for individuals with dyslexia. The EEG signals are collected from adults with dyslexia and normal controls during passage reading and rapid automatized naming. EEG signals provide valuable insights into the behaviour of the brain; however, identifying these patterns is not always quite straightforward due to its complexity. We identify these unique patterns and optimal brain regions for classification using machine learning. This study revealed that the greater level of difficulties seen in individuals with dyslexia while performing these tasks compared to normal controls are reflected in the brainwave signal patterns.

These methods generally require amputees to provide sufficient myoelectric signals from their residual limb muscles. Previous studies have shown that amputees with high level amputation or neuromuscular disorder usually do not have sufficient residual limb muscles to provide enough myoelectric signals for accurate identification of limb movements. Electroencephalography (EEG), another bioelectric signal associated with limb movements has also been proposed and used for decoding the limb motion intents of humans. With an attempt to improve the performance of EEG-based method in identifying multiple classes of upper limb movement intents, four spectral domain features of EEG were proposed in this study. Motor imagery patterns associated with five different classes of imagined upper limb movements were distinctively decoded based on the four features extracted from 64-channel EEG recordings in four transhumeral amputees. Experimental results show that an average accuracy of 97.81% was achieved across all the subjects and limb movement classes. By applying a sequential channel selection method, an accuracy of around 95.00% was realized with about 20-channels of EEG. Thus, the proposed method might be potential for providing accurate control input for neuroprosthesis.

Currently, there is no established method to investigate the temporal transitions between these large-scale networks that would allow, for example, to decode finger movements. Here we applied a matrix factorization method employing principal component and temporal independent component analyses to identify brain activity synchronizations. In accordance with previous studies investigating "muscle synergies", we refer to this activity as "brain activity synergy". Using electroencephalography (EEG), we first estimated cortical current sources (CSs) and then identified brain activity synergies within the estimated CS signals. A decoding analysis for finger movement in eight directions showed that such CS synergies provided more information for dissociating between movements than EEG sensor signals, EEG synergy, or CS signals, suggesting that temporal activation patterns of the synchronizing CSs may contain information related to motor control. A quantitative analysis of features selected by the decoders further revealed temporal transitions among the primary motor area, dorsal and ventral premotor areas, pre-supplementary motor area, and supplementary motor area, which may reflect transitions in motor planning and execution. These results provide a proof of concept for brain activity synergy estimation using CSs.

By decoding electroencephalography (EEG) signals in real-time, users were able to walk forward, sit down, and stand up while wearing the exoskeleton. EEG feature vectors associated with the motor imagery were extracted from the filtered EEG signals with common spatial patterns (CSP) method. And support vector machine (SVM) was employed to address an EEG-based three class motor imagery classification task. Overall, four healthy subjects participated in the experiment to evaluate performance. To achieve a better classification result, parameters of CSP and SVM were trained in the offline experiment. In the subsequent online experiment, the results exhibited accuracies of 85.33%, 84%, 72.67% and 81.33% It indicates that subjects can complete the task fluently and the control system can decode EEG signals with a high recognition rate. Further, the combination in decision table obviously reduces the probability of wrong actions.

This technique requires amputees to provide sufficient EMG signals to decode their limb movement intentions (LMIs). However, amputees with neuromuscular disorder/high level amputation often cannot provide sufficient EMG control signals, and thus the applicability of the EMG-PR technique is limited especially to this category of amputees. As an alternative approach, electroencephalograph (EEG) signals recorded non-invasively from the brain have been utilized to decode the LMIs of humans. However, most of the existing EEG based limb movement decoding methods primarily focus on identifying limited classes of upper limb movements. In addition, investigation on EEG feature extraction methods for the decoding of multiple classes of LMIs has rarely been considered. Therefore, 32 EEG feature extraction methods (including 12 spectral domain descriptors (SDDs) and 20 time domain descriptors (TDDs)) were used to decode multiple classes of motor imagery patterns associated with different upper limb movements based on 64-channel EEG recordings. From the obtained experimental results, the best individual TDD achieved an accuracy of 67.05 +/- 3.12% as against 87.03 +/- 2.26% for the best SDD. By applying a linear feature combination technique, an optimal set of combined TDDs recorded an average accuracy of 90.68% while that of the SDDs achieved an accuracy of 99.55% which were significantly higher than those of the individual TDD and SDD at p < 0.05. Our findings suggest that optimal feature set combination would yield a relatively high decoding accuracy that may improve the clinical robustness of MDoF neuroprosthesis.

J	List, A; Rosenberg, MD; Sherman, A; Esterman, M				List, Alexandra; Rosenberg, Monica D.; Sherman, Aleksandra; Esterman, Michael			Pattern classification of EEG signals reveals perceptual and attentional states	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; DECISION-MAKING; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; NEURAL MECHANISMS; WORKING-MEMORY; MODULATION; STIMULI; HUMANS; FMRI	Pattern classification techniques have been widely used to differentiate neural activity associated with different perceptual, attentional, or other cognitive states, often using fMRI, but more recently with EEG as well. Although these methods have identified EEG patterns (i.e., scalp topographies of EEG signals occurring at certain latencies) that decode perceptual and attentional states on a trial-by-trial basis, they have yet to be applied to the spatial scope of attention toward global or local features of the display. Here, we initially used pattern classification to replicate and extend the findings that perceptual states could be reliably decoded from EEG. We found that visual perceptual states, including stimulus location and object category, could be decoded with high accuracy peaking between 125-250 ms, and that the discriminative spatiotemporal patterns mirrored and extended our (and other well-established) ERP results. Next, we used pattern classification to investigate whether spatiotemporal EEG signals could reliably predict attentional states, and particularly, the scope of attention. The EEG data were reliably differentiated for local versus global attention on a trial- by- trial basis, emerging as a specific spatiotemporal activation pattern over posterior electrode sites during the 250-750 ms interval after stimulus onset. In sum, we demonstrate that multivariate pattern analysis of EEG, which reveals unique spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity distinguishing between behavioral states, is a sensitive tool for characterizing the neural correlates of perception and attention.

Upper limb movements can be decoded from the time-domain of low-frequency EEG	PLOS ONE			English	Article							POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; NEUROPROSTHESIS CONTROL; IMAGINED MOVEMENTS; UPPER EXTREMITY; MOTOR IMAGERY; CLASSIFICATION; TRAJECTORIES; INDIVIDUALS	How neural correlates of movements are represented in the human brain is of ongoing interest and has been researched with invasive and non-invasive methods. In this study, we analyzed the encoding of single upper limb movements in the time-domain of low-frequency electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Fifteen healthy subjects executed and imagined six different sustained upper limb movements. We classified these six movements and a rest class and obtained significant average classification accuracies of 55% (movement vs movement) and 87% (movement vs rest) for executed movements, and 27% and 73%, respectively, for imagined movements. Furthermore, we analyzed the classifier patterns in the source space and located the brain areas conveying discriminative movement information. The classifier patterns indicate that mainly premotor areas, primary motor cortex, somatosensory cortex and posterior parietal cortex convey discriminative movement information. The decoding of single upper limb movements is specially interesting in the context of a more natural non-invasive control of e.g., a motor neuroprosthesis or a robotic arm in highly motor disabled persons.

Here we propose a novel method based on scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals and a robust spectral-spatial EEG feature extractor called kernel eigen-filter-bank common spatial pattern (KEFB-CSP). The KEFB-CSP first filters the multi-channel raw EEG signals into a set of frequency sub-bands covering the range from theta to gamma bands, then spatially transforms the EEG signals of each sub-band from the original sensor space to a new space where the new signals (i.e., CSPs) are optimal for the classification between MDD and healthy controls, and finally applies the kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA) to transform the vector containing the CSPs from all frequency sub-bands to a lower-dimensional feature vector called KEFB-CSP. Twelve patients with MDD and twelve healthy controls participated in this study, and from each participant we collected 54 resting-state EEGs of 6 s length (5 min and 24 s in total). Our results show that the proposed KEFB-CSP outperforms other EEG features including the powers of EEG frequency bands, and fractal dimension, which had been widely applied in previous EEG-based depression detection studies. The results also reveal that the 8 electrodes from the temporal areas gave higher accuracies than other scalp areas. The KEFB-CSP was able to achieve an average EEG classification accuracy of 81.23% in single-trial analysis when only the 8-electrode EEGs of the temporal area and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier were used. We also designed a voting-based leave-one-participant-out procedure to test the participant-independent individual classification accuracy. The voting-based results show that the mean classification accuracy of about 80% can be achieved by the KEFP-CSP feature and the SVM classifier with only several trials, and this level of accuracy seems to become stable as more trials (i.e., <7 trials) are used. These findings therefore suggest that the proposed method has a great potential for developing an efficient (required only a few 6-s EEG signals from the 8 electrodes over the temporal) and effective (similar to 80% classification accuracy) EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system which may, in the future, help psychiatrists provide individualized and effective treatments for MDD patients.

To detect such onsets (in real time), the hardware must learn each patient's ictal pattern from the EEG/iEEG traces. This paper describes feature extraction and usage of Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based classifiers to achieve a patient-specific seizure detection System-on-Chip (SoC). Linear SVM (LSVM), Non-Linear SVM (NLSVM), and the Dual Detector Architecture (D(2)A)-SVM are described and compared. We show that when there are a limited number of training sets, the D(2)A-SVM classifier performs well while minimizing the hardware cost. The SoC is implemented and verified.

The ERP responses are elicited a few milliseconds after attending to an oddball stimulus; target and non-target stimulus are repeatedly flashed while the electroencephalography (EEG) is recording. ERP responses in the EEG signal have a poor signal-to-ratio in single-trial analysis; therefore, the epochs of the target and non-target trials are averaged over time in order to improve their decoding accuracy. Furthermore, these exogenous potentials can be naturally evoked by just looking at a target symbol. Therefore, the BCI system could generate unintended commands without considering the user's intention. In this study, we approach this dilemma by assuming that a greater effort for the mental task would evoke a stronger positive/negative ERP deflection. Three mental states are defined: passive gazing, active counting, and pitch-imagery. The experiments results showed significantly enhanced ERP patterns and averaged decoding accuracies of 80%, 95.4%, and 95.6%, respectively. The decoding accuracies between both active tasks and the passive task showed an averaged accuracy of 57.5% (gazing vs. counting) and 72.5% (gazing vs. pitch-imagery). Following this result, we proposed a hierarchy classification strategy where the passive or active mental state is decoded in the first stage, and the target stimuli are estimated in the second stage. Our work is the first to propose a system that classifies an intended or unintended brain state by considering the measurable differences of mental effort in the EEG signal so that unintended commands to the system are minimized.

As MI based BCI provides high degree of freedom, it helps motor disabled people to communicate with the device by performing sequence of MI tasks. But inter-subject variability, extracting user-specific features and increasing accuracy of the classifier is still a challenging task in MI based BCIs. In this work, we propose an approach to overcome the above mentioned issues. The proposed approach follows the pipeline such as channel selection, band-pass filter based CSP (common spatial pattern), feature extraction, feature selection using two different techniques and modeling using Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) classifier. Since the optimal features are selected by feature selection techniques, it helps to overcome inter-subject variability and improves performance of GNB classifier. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed methodology has not been used for MI-based BCI applications. The proposed approach is validated using BCI competition III dataset IVa. The result of our proposed approach is compared with two conventional classifiers such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM). The results prove that the proposed method provides an improved accuracy than LDA and SVM classifiers. The proposed method can be further developed to design a reliable and real-time MI-based BCI application.	[Sreeja, S. R.; Rabha, Joytirmoy; Nagarjuna, K.

In this paper, we efficiently recognize emotional states by analyzing the features of electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which are generated from EEG sensors that noninvasively measure the electrical activity of neurons inside the human brain, and select the optimal combination of these features for recognition. In this paper, the scalp EEG data of 21 healthy subjects (12-14 years old) were recorded using a 14-channel EEG machine while the subjects watched images with four types of emotional stimuli (happy, calm, sad, or scared). After preprocessing, the Hjorth parameters (activity, mobility, and complexity) were used to measure the signal activity of the time series data. We selected the optimal EEG features using a balanced one-way ANOVA after calculating the Hjorth parameters for different frequency ranges. Features selected by this statistical method outperformed univariate and multivariate features. The optimal features were further processed for emotion classification using support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes, random forest, deep learning, and four ensembles methods (bagging, boosting, stacking, and voting). The results show that the proposed method substantially improves the emotion recognition rate with respect to the commonly used spectral power band method.

Vision compressive sensing, brain-machine reference commands, and adaptive fuzzy controllers in joint-space have been effectively integrated to enable the robot performing manipulation tasks guided by human operator's mind. First, a visual-feedback link is implemented by a video captured by a camera, allowing him/her to visualize the manipulator's workspace and movements being executed. Then, the compressed images are used as feedback errors in a nonvector space for producing steady-state visual evoked potentials electroencephalography (EEG) signals, and it requires no prior information on features in contrast to the traditional visual servoing. The proposed EEG decoding algorithm generates control signals for the exoskeleton robot using features extracted from neural activity. Considering coupled dynamics and actuator input constraints during the robot manipulation, a local adaptive fuzzy controller has been designed to drive the exoskeleton tracking the intended trajectories in human operator's mind and to provide a convenient way of dynamics compensation with minimal knowledge of the dynamics parameters of the exoskeleton robot. Extensive experiment studies employing three subjects have been performed to verify the validity of the proposed method.

We aim to develop an objective biologically-based computational tool which aids diagnosis and relies on accessible imaging technologies such as electroencephalography (EEG). To achieve this, we used machine learning techniques and a combination of paradigms designed to elicit prediction errors or Mismatch Negativity (MMN) responses. MMN, an EEG component elicited by unpredictable changes in sequences of auditory stimuli, has previously been shown to be reduced in people with schizophrenia and this is arguably one of the most reproducible neurophysiological markers of schizophrenia. EEG data were acquired from 21 patients with schizophrenia and 22 healthy controls whilst they listened to three auditory oddball paradigms comprising sequences of tones which deviated in 10% of trials from regularly occurring standard tones. Deviant tones shared the same properties as standard tones, except for one physical aspect: 1) duration - the deviant stimulus was twice the duration of the standard; 2) monaural gap - deviants had a silent interval omitted from the standard, or 3) inter-aural timing difference, which caused the deviant location to be perceived as 90 degrees away from the standards. We used multivariate pattern analysis, a machine learning technique implemented in the Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo) to classify images generated through statistical parametric mapping (SPM) of spatiotemporal EEG data, i. e. event-related potentials measured on the two-dimensional surface of the scalp over time. Using support vector machine (SVM) and Gaussian processes classifiers (GPC), we were able classify individual patients and controls with balanced accuracies of up to 80.48% (p-values = 0.0326, FDR corrected) and an ROC analysis yielding an AUC of 0.87. Crucially, a GP regression revealed that MMN predicted global assessment of functioning (GAF) scores (correlation = 0.73, R2 = 0.53, p= 0.0006).	[Taylor, J. A.; Garrido, M.

An example of stored data is the electroencephalogram (EEG), which is of high importance to the various diseases that affect the brain. These data are stored to keep the patient's clinical history and to help medical experts in performing future procedures, such as pattern discovery from specific diseases. However, the increase in medical data storage makes unfeasible their manual analysis. Also, the EEG can contain patterns difficult to be observed by naked eye. In this work, a cross-correlation technique was applied for feature extraction of a set of 200 EEG segments. Afterwards, predictive models were built using machine learning algorithms such as J48, 1NN, and BP-MLP (backpropagation based on multilayer perceptron), that implement decision tree, nearest neighbor, and artificial neural network, respectively. The models were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation and contingency table methods. The evaluation results showed that the model built with the J48 performed better and was more likely to correctly classify EEG segments in this study than 1NN and BP-MLP, corresponding to 98.50% accuracy.

In electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems for motor control tasks the conventional practice is to decode motor intentions by using scalp EEG. However, scalp EEG only reveals certain limited information about the complex tasks of movement with a higher degree of freedom. Therefore, our objective is to investigate the effectiveness of source-space EEG in extracting relevant features that discriminate arm movement in multiple directions. Approach. We have proposed a novel feature extraction algorithm based on supervised factor analysis that models the data from source-space EEG. To this end, we computed the features from the source dipoles confined to Brodmann areas of interest (BA4a, BA4p and BA6). Further, we embedded class-wise labels of multi-direction (multi-class) source-space EEG to an unsupervised factor analysis to make it into a supervised learning method. Main Results. Our approach provided an average decoding accuracy of 71% for the classification of hand movement in four orthogonal directions, that is significantly higher (> 10%) than the classification accuracy obtained using state-of-the-art spatial pattern features in sensor space. Also, the group analysis on the spectral characteristics of source-space EEG indicates that the slow cortical potentials from a set of cortical source dipoles reveal discriminative information regarding the movement parameter, direction. Significance. This study presents evidence that low-frequency components in the source space play an important role in movement kinematics, and thus it may lead to new strategies for BCI-based neurorehabilitation.

Features from a small spatial region are approximated by a sparse linear combination of few atoms from a multi-class dictionary constructed from the features of the electroencephalography (EEG) training signals for each class. It is used to classify the signals based on the pattern of their sparse representation using a support vector classifier. The results show that the sparse representation classification algorithm is very effective for the pattern classification precision of the multi-channel EEG.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) records the neurological activity in the brain and it is used to identify epilepsy. Visual inspection of EEG signals is a time-consuming process and it may lead to human error. Feature extraction and classification are two main steps that are required to build an automated epilepsy detection framework. Feature extraction reduces the dimensions of the input signal by retaining informative features and the classifier assigns a proper class label to the extracted feature vector. Our aim is to present effective feature extraction techniques for automated epileptic EEG signal classification. Methods: In this study, two effective feature extraction techniques (Local. Neighbor Descriptive Pattern [LNDP] and One-dimensional Local Gradient Pattern [1D-LGP]) have been introduced to classify epileptic EEG signals. The classification between epileptic seizure and non -seizure signals is performed using different machine learning classifiers. The benchmark epilepsy EEG dataset provided by the University of Bonn is used in this research. The classification performance is evaluated using 10 -fold cross validation. The classifiers used are the Nearest Neighbor (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The experiments have been repeated for 50 times. Results: LNDP and 1D-LGP feature extraction techniques with ANN classifier achieved the average classification accuracy of 99.82% and 99.80%, respectively, for the classification between normal and epileptic EEG signals. Eight different experimental cases were tested. The classification results were better than those of some existing methods. Conclusions: This study suggests that LNDP and 1D-LGP could be effective feature extraction techniques for the classification of epileptic EEG signals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Various versions of filter-bank based common spatial pattern have been proposed and used in MI BCIs. Filter-bank based common spatial pattern has more number of features compared with original common spatial pattern. As the number of features increases, the MI BCIs using filter-bank based common spatial pattern can face overfitting problems. In this study, we used eigenvector centrality feature selection method, wavelet packet decomposition common spatial pattern, and kernel extreme learning machine to improve the performance of MI BCIs and avoid overfitting problems. Furthermore, the computational speed was improved by using kernel extreme learning machine.

In this paper, a hierarchical support vector machine (HSVM) algorithm is proposed to address an EEG-based four-class motor imagery classification task. Wavelet packet transform is employed to decompose raw EEG signals. Thereafter, EEG signals with effective frequency sub-bands are grouped and reconstructed. EEG feature vectors are extracted from the reconstructed EEG signals with one versus the rest common spatial patterns (OVR-CSP) and one versus one common spatial patterns (OVO-CSP). Then, a two-layer HSVM algorithm is designed for the classification of these EEG feature vectors, where "OVO" classifiers are used in the first layer and "OVR" in the second layer. A public dataset (BCI Competition IV-II-a)is employed to validate the proposed method. Fivefold cross-validation results demonstrate that the average accuracy of classification in the first layer and the second layer is 67.5 +/- 17.7% and 60.3 +/- 14.7%, respectively. The average accuracy of the classification is 64.4 +/- 16.7% overall. These results show that the proposed method is effective for four-class motor imagery classification.

The authors propose a "pattern recognition" approach that discriminates EEG signals recorded during different cognitive conditions. Wavelet based feature extraction such as, multi-resolution decompositions into detailed and approximate coefficients as well as relative wavelet energy were computed. Extracted relative wavelet energy features were normalized to zero mean and unit variance and then optimized using Fisher's discriminant ratio (FDR) and principal component analysis (PCA). A high density EEG dataset validated the proposed method (128-channels) by identifying two classifications: (1) EEG signals recorded during complex cognitive tasks using Raven's Advance Progressive Metric (RAPM) test; (2) EEG signals recorded during a baseline task (eyes open). Classifiers such as, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), and Naive Bayes (NB) were then employed. Outcomes yielded 99.11% accuracy via SVM classifier for coefficient approximations (A5) of low frequencies ranging from 0 to 3.90 Hz. Accuracy rates for detailed coefficients were 98.57 and 98.39% for SVM and KNN, respectively; and for detailed coefficients (D5) deriving from the sub-band range (3.90-7.81 Hz). Accuracy rates for MLP and NB classifiers were comparable at 97.11-89.63% and 91.60-81.07% for A5 and D5 coefficients, respectively. In addition, the proposed approach was also applied on public dataset for classification of two cognitive tasks and achieved comparable classification results, i.e., 93.33% accuracy with KNN. The proposed scheme yielded significantly higher classification performances using machine learning classifiers compared to extant quantitative feature extraction. These results suggest the proposed feature extraction method reliably classifies EEG signals recorded during cognitive tasks with a higher degree of accuracy.

Wavelet transform methods are applied to extract the features embedded in the high-dimensional epileptic EEG signal. It is found that results of wavelet transform play significant roles in dimensional reduction process. Then, machine learning pipeline is built based on support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. It is found that epileptic seizure state in the test data set could be predicted with high precision (98.1%) based only on mini-segments of EEG signal (0.6 second). Predictions based on 0.1 second mini-segments of EEG signal are also investigated. This research may be significant to the clinical treatment of epileptic seizure, because efficient methods could be applied to interrupt the process of epileptic seizure very fast (in less than one second).

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method to record electrical activity of the brain. To make Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) more natural, human emotion recognition is important. Over the past decade, various signal processing methods are used for analysing EEG-based emotion recognition (ER). This paper proposes a novel technique for ER using Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)-based features. The features are validated on benchmark DEAP database upto four emotions and classified using K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) classifier.

Canonical Correlation Analysis of EEG for Classification of Motor Imagery	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 05-08, 2017	Banff, CANADA	IEEE		Electroencephalography; Brain Computer Interface; Canonical Correlation Analysis	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MU-RHYTHM; COMMUNICATION; TASKS	The performance of classification of various mental states using Electroencephalography (EEG) is often limited by the lack of information regarding the most discriminative channels and frequency bands. The paper proposes a Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) of EEG recorded during bilateral imagined hand movement. CCA determines linear transformation of EEG that is maximally correlated with a transformed version of neural response to imagined movement. In the proposed method, the linear weights are identified for the spatial and spectral components of EEG signal. The study investigates how the CCA-based transformation of the signal improves discrimination between two movement classes. Further, two parallel CCA blocks, determine two transformations of EEG, one that maximizes correlation with the corresponding class, and other that minimizes the correlation with the mismatched class. Features derived using this approach are used for single-trial classification of bilateral imagined hand movement. Time-frequency patterns of EEG derived from the proposed approach illustrate their discriminative ability in mu and beta bands. An average classification accuracy of 61.12% (109 subjects) and 73.34% (Best 40 subjects) are obtained. The results indicate the scope of CCA to obtain time-frequency representations of EEG and for single-trial classification of motor imagery (MI).	[Robinson, Neethu; Thomas, K. P.; Vinod, A.

To identify stroke patients and normal controls during mental rotation task, common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is employed to extract features from binary-class EEG which will be further to form the dictionary for sparse representation. In the classification process, sparse representation-based classification (SRC) method is used; specifically, each test trial is sparsely represented over the formed dictionary and the sparse coefficient is obtained by solving a l1-norm regularized least squares minimization objective. A series of experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of features extracted by CSP of both classes and the SRC could obtain excellent results in classification. These result suggest that stroke patients have distinct EEG feature from normal controls. These EEG features may be potential biomarkers to monitor the rehabilitation process of stroke patients.

Monitoring brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) has become an important tool for the diagnosis of epilepsy. In this paper, we propose a method for EEG seizure detection by decomposing EEG signals for up to six wavelet scales without downsampling. Then, we perform the fast Fourier transform with wavelet scales 3, 4, 5, and 6, and take the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients as features for seizure detection. We use a nearest neighbour classifier to classify the input EEG signal into the seizure or no seizure class. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is comparable and sometimes better than our previous dual-tree complex wavelet-Fourier method for the University of Bonn EEG database. Furthermore, the proposed method is very competitive with a number of existing EEG seizure detection methods. We found that various types of wavelet filter all achieved perfect classification rates (100%) for EEG seizure detection.

However, EEG is an important technique, especially for brain computer interface applications. In this study, a novel algorithm is proposed to decode brain activity associated with different types of images. In this hybrid algorithm, convolutional neural network is modified for the extraction of features, a t-test is used for the selection of significant features and likelihood ratio-based score fusion is used for the prediction of brain activity. The proposed algorithm takes input data from multichannel EEG time series, which is also known as multivariate pattern analysis. Comprehensive analysis was conducted using data from 30 participants. The results from the proposed method are compared with current recognized feature extraction and classification/prediction techniques. The wavelet transform-support vector machine method is the most popular currently used feature extraction and prediction method. This method showed an accuracy of 65.7%. However, the proposed method predicts the novel data with improved accuracy of 79.9%. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm outperformed the current feature extraction and prediction method.

In order to validate the feasibility of using EEG to decode the MI of a single index finger and constructing a BCI-enhanced finger rehabilitation system, we collected EEG data during right hand index finger MI and rest state for five healthy subjects and proposed a pattern recognition approach for classifying these two mental states. First, Fisher's linear discriminant criteria and power spectral density analysis were used to analyze the event-related desynchronization patterns. Second, both band power and approximate entropy were extracted as features. Third, aiming to eliminate the abnormal samples in the dictionary and improve the classification performance of the conventional sparse representation-based classification (SRC) method, we proposed a novel dictionary cleaned sparse representation-based classification (DCSRC) method for final classification. The experimental results show that the proposed DCSRC method gives better classification accuracies than SRC and an average classification accuracy of 81.32% is obtained for five subjects. Thus, it is demonstrated that single right hand index finger MI can be decoded from the sensorimotor rhythms, and the feature patterns of index finger MI and rest state can be well recognized for robotic exoskeleton initiation.

Motor imagery (MI) of flexion and extension of both legs was distinguished from the EEG correlates. We executed experiments with 5 able-bodied individuals under a realistic rehabilitation scenario. The Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the signals was extracted with sliding windows to train a linear discriminate analysis (LDA) classifier. An average classification accuracy of 0.67 +/- 0.07 and AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.06 were obtained in online recordings, which confirmed the feasibility of decoding these signals to control the gait trainer. In addition, discriminative feature analysis was conducted to show the modulations during the mental tasks. This study can be further implemented with different feedback modalities to enhance the user performance.

This study provides a novel feature extraction and pattern recognition technique for classifying epilepsy using phase-phase, phase amplitude and amplitude-amplitude coupling based on Variational Mode Decomposition(VMD). The EEG signal was decomposed to band limited intrinsic mode functions (BLIMFs) in the first place. Second, a coupling of BLIMFs was extracted as a feature and after determining an optimal feature two classifiers, strictly speaking, Random Forest and Extreme Learning Machine have classified the inputs. In order to evaluate and compare the performance of the new presented method Bonn University dataset of epilepsy have been used. Results indicate a more desirable performance than any other applied method suggested previously.

This is one of the major issues in commercial and out of the lab usage of such systems. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithms are widely used for feature extraction in BCI systems for motor imagery. As the EEG signals have noise and overfitting issues, various regularized CSP algorithms are introduced to overcome these factors. In this work, a method is introduced to find the variant of CSP that achieves maximum classification accuracy with least number of EEG channels. The approach is based on firstly identify the spatial filter weights using complete set of channels. In the next step, the channels are selected based on the maximal filter weights. Channels with highest values are included to find the accuracy in next run and ultimately the optimum combination of number of channels, CSP variant and classification accuracy are reported. Multichannel data comprised of 60 electrodes from BCI Competition III dataset IIIa from three subjects who performed left hand, right hand, foot and tongue MI is considered for this purpose. For the data analyzed in this study, it is found that instead of using data from 60 electrodes only six can be used without significantly compromising the classification accuracy.

It is difficult to separate mental arithmetic from EEG signals since these signals are nonstatic and nonlinear. In this study, we extracted features based entropy, skewness and entropy + skewness from the EEG signal. Then, extracted features were classified by support vector machines. The average 85.69% classification accuracy (CA) was calculated from the entropy based features that best determine the mental arithmetic of the EEG signals. This value is 9.79% higher than the average 75.90% CA calculated in the literature. This result indicates that proposed method is effective for this data set.

This detector should be reliable in real-world settings using easily accessible, non-invasive data sources. We present a simple yet robust paradigm for decoding pain using neural and physiological data including electroencephalography (EEG), pulse, and skin conductance (GSR) measurements. The present study uses multivariate classification to distinguish painful events from non-painful multimodal sensory stimuli. To classify the pain response and detect relevant data attributes, we employed a sparse logistic regression (SLR) machine learning protocol with automatic feature selection. EEG input consisted of time-frequency changes under trial conditions, and physiological data included fluctuations and spikes in pulse and skin conductance. Classification averaged 70% accuracy and selected between 5 and 15 features. In our experiment, pain was induced by cold stimulation which became noxious with prolonged exposure. Due to the long, ramp-and-hold nature of the stimulus, along with individual variability in sensitivity to pain, we did not observe specific rapid evoked responses or time-locked events common across participants. However, this format more closely resembles the experience of pain conditions requiring intervention which could be facilitated by a decoding system. The results illustrate the feasibility of developing a wireless pain detection system and give insight to important temporal, spectral, and spatial EEG events and physiological indicators of pain states. Success of the classifier protocol using these parameters could lead to the creation of a closed-loop system for decoding and intervention which can be applied in engineering and medical contexts.

Decoding Dynamic Brain Patterns from Evoked Responses: A Tutorial on Multivariate Pattern Analysis Applied to Time Series Neuroimaging Data	JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							FREE CLUSTER-ENHANCEMENT; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; OBJECT RECOGNITION; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; CIRCULAR ANALYSIS; EEG-ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; REPRESENTATIONS; INFORMATION	Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) or brain decoding methods have become standard practice in analyzing fMRI data. Although decoding methods have been extensively applied in brain-computer interfaces, these methods have only recently been applied to time series neuroimaging data such as MEG and EEG to address experimental questions in cognitive neuroscience. In a tutorial style review, we describe a broad set of options to inform future time series decoding studies from a cognitive neuroscience perspective. Using example MEG data, we illustrate the effects that different options in the decoding analysis pipeline can have on experimental results where the aim is to "decode" different perceptual stimuli or cognitive states over time from dynamic brain activation patterns. We show that decisionsmade at both preprocessing (e.g., dimensionality reduction, subsampling, trial averaging) and decoding (e.g., classifier selection, cross-validation design) stages of the analysis can significantly affect the results. In addition to standard decoding, we describe extensions to MVPA for time-varying neuroimaging data including representational similarity analysis, temporal generalization, and the interpretation of classifier weight maps. Finally, we outline important caveats in the design and interpretation of time series decoding experiments.

EEG evoked potentials in oddball task and fluid intelligence score are correlated because both reflect the cognitive processing and attention. A system for prediction of an individual's fluid intelligence level using single trial Electroencephalography (EEG) signals has been proposed. For this purpose, we employed 2D and 3D contents and 34 subjects each for 2D and 3D, which were divided into low-ability (LA) and high-ability (HA) groups using Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM) test. Using visual oddball cognitive task, neural activity of each group was measured and analyzed over three midline electrodes (Fz, Cz, and Pz). To predict whether an individual belongs to LA or HA group, features were extracted using wavelet decomposition of EEG signals recorded in visual oddball task and support vector machine (SVM) was used as a classifier. Two different types of Haar wavelet transform based features have been extracted from the band (0.3 to 30 Hz) of EEG signals. Statistical wavelet features and wavelet coefficient features from the frequency bands 0.0-1.875 Hz (delta low) and 1.875-3.75 Hz (delta high), resulted in the 100 and 98% prediction accuracies, respectively, both for 2D and 3D contents. The analysis of these frequency bands showed clear difference between LA and HA groups. Further, discriminative values of the features have been validated using statistical significance tests and inter-class and intra-class variation analysis. Also, statistical test showed that there was no effect of 2D and 3D content on the assessment of fluid intelligence level. Comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques showed the superiority of the proposed system.

J	Kumar, S; Mamun, K; Sharma, A				Kumar, Shiu; Mamun, Kabir; Sharma, Alok			CSP-TSM: Optimizing the performance of Riemannian tangent space mapping using common spatial pattern for MI-BCI	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Brain computer interface (BCI); Common spatial pattern (CSP); Electroencephalography (EEG); Motor imagery (MI); Riemannian distance; Tangent space mapping (TSM)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; MOTOR-IMAGERY; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; SPECTRAL PATTERNS; EEG; STROKE; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION	Background Classification of electroencephalography (EEG) signals for motor imagery based brain computer interface (MI-BCI) is an exigent task and common spatial pattern (CSP) has been extensively explored for this purpose. In this work, we focused on developing a new framework for classification of EEG signals for MI-BCI. Method We propose a single band CSP framework for MI-BCI that utilizes the concept of tangent space mapping (TSM) in the manifold of covariance matrices. The proposed method is named CSP-TSM. Spatial filtering is performed on the bandpass filtered MI EEG signal. Riemannian tangent space is utilized for extracting features from the spatial filtered signal. The TSM features are then fused with the CSP variance based features and feature selection is performed using Lasso. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is then applied to the selected features and finally classification is done using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Results: The proposed framework gives improved performance for MI EEG signal classification in comparison with several competing methods. Experiments conducted shows that the proposed framework reduces the overall classification error rate for MI-BCI by 3.16%, 5.10% and 1.70% (for BO Competition III dataset Na, BCI Competition IV Dataset I and BCI Competition IV Dataset Lib, respectively) compared to the conventional CSP method under the same experimental settings. Conclusion: The proposed CSP-TSM method produces promising results when compared with several competing methods in this paper. In addition, the computational complexity is less compared to that of TSM method. Our proposed CSP-TSM framework can be potentially used for developing improved MI-BCI systems.

J	Zhang, JH; Yin, Z; Wang, RB				Zhang, Jianhua; Yin, Zhong; Wang, Rubin			Pattern Classification of Instantaneous Cognitive Task-load Through GMM Clustering, Laplacian Eigenmap, and Ensemble SVMs	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Cognitive task-load; psychophysiological signals; manifold learning; ensemble learning; support vector machine	OPERATOR FUNCTIONAL-STATE; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ADAPTIVE AUTOMATION; MENTAL WORKLOAD; SYSTEM; BRAIN; EEG; IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION; VARIABILITY	The identification of the temporal variations in human operator cognitive task-load (CTL) is crucial for preventing possible accidents in human-machine collaborative systems. Recent literature has shown that the change of discrete CTL level during human-machine system operations can be objectively recognized using neurophysiological data and supervised learning technique. The objective of this work is to design subject-specific multi-class CTL classifier to reveal the complex unknown relationship between the operator's task performance and neurophysiological features by combining target class labeling, physiological feature reduction and selection, and ensemble classification techniques. The psychophysiological data acquisition experiments were performed under multiple human-machine process control tasks. Four or five target classes of CTL were determined by using a Gaussian mixture model and three human performance variables. By using Laplacian eigenmap, a few salient EEG features were extracted, and heart rates were used as the input features of the CTL classifier. Then, multiple support vector machines were aggregated via majority voting to create an ensemble classifier for recognizing the CTL classes. Finally, the obtained CTL classification results were compared with those of several existing methods. The results showed that the proposed methods are capable of deriving a reasonable number of target classes and low-dimensional optimal EEG features for individual human operator subjects.

The research community related to education and computer science has developed various approches for describing and monitoring learning cognitive states. Assessing cognitive states in digital environment makes it possible to supply adaptive instruction and personalized learning for student. This assessment has the same function as the instructor in a real-world classroom observing and adjusting the speed and contents of the lecture in line with students' cognitive states. The goal is to refocus students' interest and engagement, making the instruction efficiently. In recent years, increased researches have focused on various measures of cognitive states, among which physiological measures are able to monitor in a real-time, especially electroencephalography (EEG) based brain activity measures. The cognitive workload that students experience while learning instructional materials determines success in learning. In this work, we design and propose a real-time passive Brain-Computer Interaction (BCI) system to monitor the cognitive workload using EEG-based headset Emotiv Epoc+, which is feasible for working in the online digital environment like Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). We choose two electrodes to pick up original EEG signals, which are highly relevant to the workload. The current prototype is able to record EEG signals and classify levels of cognitive load when students watching online course videos. This prototype is based on two layers, using machine learning approaches for classification.

However, the residual muscles are usually limited, especially after above-elbow amputations, which would not provide enough sEMG for the control of prostheses with multiple degrees of freedom. Signal fusion is a possible approach to solve the problem of insufficient control commands, where some non-EMG signals are combined with sEMG signals to provide sufficient information for motion intension decoding. In this study, a motion-classification method that combines sEMG and electroencephalography (EEG) signals were proposed and investigated, in order to improve the control performance of upper-limb prostheses. Methods: Four transhumeral amputees without any form of neurological disease were recruited in the experiments. Five motion classes including hand-open, hand-close, wrist-pronation, wrist-supination, and no-movement were specified. During the motion performances, sEMG and EEG signals were simultaneously acquired from the skin surface and scalp of the amputees, respectively. The two types of signals were independently preprocessed and then combined as a parallel control input. Four time-domain features were extracted and fed into a classifier trained by the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithm for motion recognition. In addition, channel selections were performed by using the Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) algorithm to optimize the performance of the proposed method. Results: The classification performance achieved by the fusion of sEMG and EEG signals was significantly better than that obtained by single signal source of either sEMG or EEG. An increment of more than 14% in classification accuracy was achieved when using a combination of 32-channel sEMG and 64-channel EEG. Furthermore, based on the SFS algorithm, two optimized electrode arrangements (10-channel sEMG + 10-channel EEG, 10-channel sEMG + 20-channel EEG) were obtained with classification accuracies of 84.2 and 87.0%, respectively, which were about 7.2 and 10% higher than the accuracy by using only 32-channel sEMG input. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of fusing sEMG and EEG signals towards improving motion classification accuracy for above-elbow amputees, which might enhance the control performances of multifunctional myoelectric prostheses in clinical application.

Epileptic seizures are the result of temporary electrical disturbances in the brain. This disorder can be diagnosed by electroencephalograms (EEG). Accordingly, data mining supported by machine learning (ML) methods can be used to find patterns in EEG and to build classifiers. However, the presence of physiological abnormalities is considered rare in medical data. Also, rhythmic activities in an EEG of a healthy person varies in different situations, such as with closed or opened eyes. Other issue is that normal and interictal epileptic EEG can contain similar patterns. In this work, we developed classifiers in order to differentiate EEG of healthy volunteers, with opened and closed eyes, from epileptic EEG. This approach was applied in an EEG set with 500 segments, in which cross-correlation and power spectrum methods were performed for feature extraction. Subsequently, predictive models based on one-class classification were built using the one-class support vector machine (OSVM) technique in addition to traditional ML methods, such as nearest-neighbor, artificial neural network, and two-class support vector machine (TSVM). The polynomial and radial basis function (RBF) kernels were applied in OSVM and TSVM. To enable the use of traditional ML methods, the OCC was converted to two-class classification problem through assignment of negative (abnormal) class to each EEG segment that does not belong to normal (positive) class. In the evaluation, it was found that the OSVM classifier with RBF kernel reached the best values for all confusion matrix parameters, such as accuracy, positive predictive value, sensitivity, and false positive rate.

In addition to self-report, an objective pain assessment system can provide a more complete picture of the neurophysiological basis for pain. In this study, a robust and accurate machine learning approach is developed to quantify tonic thermal pain across healthy subjects into a maximum of ten distinct classes. Methods: A random forest model was trained to predict pain scores using time-frequency wavelet representations of independent components obtained from electroencephalography ( EEG) data, and the relative importance of each frequency band to pain quantification is assessed. Results: The mean classification accuracy for predicting pain on an independent test subject for a range of 1-10 is 89.45%, highest among existing state of the art quantification algorithms for EEG. The gamma band is the most important to both intersubject and intrasubject classification accuracy. Conclusion: The robustness and generalizability of the classifier are demonstrated. Significance: Our results demonstrate the potential of this tool to be used clinically to help us to improve chronic pain treatment and establish spectral biomarkers for future pain-related studies using EEG.

Individual identification based on electroencephalography (EEG) measurements is one of the safe identification techniques to prevent spoofing. In this study, we propose to employ common dictionary learning, which was formerly presented by Morioka et al. [1] aiming at performing subject-transfer decoding, for extracting features for EEG-based individual identification. Using the proposed method, though a classifier was trained based on the EEG signals during the selective spatial attention task, we found each test subject was almost perfectly identified out of 40 based on its resting-state EEG signals.

J	Yin, Z; Zhang, JH				Yin, Zhong; Zhang, Jianhua			Cross-session classification of mental workload levels using EEG and an adaptive deep learning model	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Human-machine system; Mental workload; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Deep learning; Operator functional states	OPERATOR FUNCTIONAL-STATE; IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION; AUTOMATION	Evaluation of operator Mental Workload (MW) levels via ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) is quite promising in Human-Machine (HM) collaborative task environment to alarm the temporal operator performance degradation. However, accurate recognition of MW states via a static pattern classifier with training and testing EEG signals recoded on separate days is particularly challenging as EEG features are differently distributed across different sessions. Motivated by the superiority of the deep learning approaches for stable feature abstractions in higher levels, an adaptive Stacked Denoising AutoEncoder (SDAE) is developed to tackling such cross-session MW classification task in which the weights of the shallow hidden neurons could be adaptively updated during the testing procedure. The generalization capability of the adaptive SDAE is first evaluated under within/cross-session conditions. Then, we compare it with the state of the art MW classifiers under different feature selection and the noise corruption paradigms. The results indicate a higher performance of the adaptive SDAE in dealing with the cross-session EEG features. By analyzing the optimal step length, the data augmentation scheme and the computational cost for iterative tuning, the adaptive SDAE is also demonstrated to be acceptable for online implementation.

A total of eight commands are decoded by fNIRS, as positioned on the prefrontal cortex, and by EEG, around the frontal, parietal, and visual cortices. Mental arithmetic, mental counting, mental rotation, and word formation tasks are decoded with fNIRS, in which the selected features for classification and command generation are the peak, minimum, and mean Delta HbO values within a 2-s moving window. In the case of EEG, two eyeblinks, three eyeblinks, and eye movement in the up/down and left/right directions are used for four-command generation. The features in this case are the number of peaks and the mean of the EEG signal during 1 s window. We tested the generated commands on a quadcopter in an open space. An average accuracy of 75.6% was achieved with fNIRS for four-command decoding and 86% with EEG for another four-command decoding. The testing results show the possibility of controlling a quadcopter online and in real-time using eight commands from the prefrontal and frontal cortices via the proposed hybrid EEG-fNIRS interface.

Motor movements e.g., lifting hands also affect the EEG signals, where different brainwave patterns are detected for different motor movements. In this context, our research objective is to compare between Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Energy Spectral Density (ESD) features extracted from the EEG signals in classifying the different patterns to distinguish different motor movement; i.e., lifting left and right hand. The classification will be done by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Based on the analysis performed, the result shows that the classification done based on PSD has led to higher accuracy measure (82.7%) when compared to classification based on ESD data as input (78.8%).

However, the usability aspects of the proposed biometric systems in the literatures have not received significant attention. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey to examine the development and current status of various aspects of electroencephalography (EEG)-based biometric recognition. We first compare the characteristics of different stimuli that have been used for evoking biometric information bearing EEG signals. This is followed by a survey of the reported features and classifiers employed for EEG biometric recognition. To highlight the usability challenges of using EEG for biometric recognition in real-life scenarios, we propose a novel usability assessment framework which combines a number of user-related factors to evaluate the reported systems. The evaluation scores indicate a pattern of increasing usability, particularly in recent years, of EEG-based biometric systems as efforts have been made to improve the performance of such systems in realistic application scenarios. We also propose howthis frameworkmay be extended to take into account Aging effects asmore performance data becomes available.

Most abnormal EEG patterns in epilepsy are interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), which consist of spike and sharp waves. These two types of waves can be detected in detail by using the Walsh transformation. In this technique, training data consisting of the original data from EEGs and the results of the first- and second order Walsh transformation are collected to construct IED profiles. In this paper we propose two Bayesian classification models based on the dependence of the IED profiles. Bayesian classification is applied to classify spike and sharp waves resulting from the Walsh transformation. In our case study, the classification model with dependent features assumption gave better results than the model with independent features assumption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Most previous studies have adopted amplitude features of the low-frequency EEG signals to decode hand movement parameters. In this study, we have investigated the instantaneous phase of the low-frequency EEG signals attained by Hilbert transform for such a task for the first time, and compared its decoding accuracy with that of the amplitude features. An experiment was carried out that 5 subjects executed a center-out reaching task in two sessions. Then the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model is used to decode hand movement parameters based on the amplitude feature and the phase feature, respectively. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by calculating the correlation coefficients between the recorded parameters and the reconstructed parameters. The experiments results show that compared to the decoder with the amplitude feature, the correlation coefficients obtained by the decoder with the phase feature have increased 27.8% (X-position), 24.1% (Yposition), 27.9% (X-velocity), 20.9% (Y-velocity).

Methods: Compared with the long non-seizure periods, the durations of the seizure events are much shorter in the continuous EEG recordings. So the seizure detection task can be regarded as an imbalanced classification problem. In this paper, a novel method based on the weighted extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed for seizure detection with imbalanced EEG data distribution. Firstly, the wavelet packet transform is employed to analyze the EEG data and obtain the time and frequency domain features, and the pattern match regularity statistic (PMRS) is used as the nonlinear feature to quantify the complexity of the EEG time series. After that, the EEG feature vectors are discriminated by the weighted ELM. It can assign different weights for the EEG feature samples according to the class distribution, so that to effectively moderate the bias in performance caused by imbalanced class distribution. Results: The metric G-mean which takes into account of both the sensitivity and specificity is used to evaluate the performance of this method. The G-mean of 93.96%, event-based sensitivity of 97.73% and false alarm rate of 0.37/h are yielded on the publicly available EEG dataset. Conclusion: The comparison with other detection methods shows the superior performance of this method, which indicates its potential for detecting seizure events in clinical practice. Additionally, much larger amounts of true continuous EEG data will be used to test the proposed method further in the future work. (C) 2017 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, concurrently recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) were combined at the decision fusion stage for the classification of three mental workload levels induced by an n-back working-memory task. An average three-class classification accuracy of 42, 43, and 49% has been achieved across 13 participants for the fNIR-alone, EEG-alone, and EEG-fNIRS combined approach, respectively. The current study demonstrated a multimodality-based approach to decode human mental workload levels that may potentially be used for adaptive HCI applications.

The CMAs were measured by acquiring Electromyographic (EMG) signal, and Electroencephalographic (EEG) signal. We focused on CMAs related to sustained muscular contractions (SMC), and investigated on the classification performance of four types of CMAs with different combinations of three types of features. The four types of CMAs were relaxing, conducting precise hand operation without distractive mental task, conducting precise hand operation with distractive mental task, and conducting rough hand operation. The three types of features were combined root mean square (RMS) and wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) feature of EMG signals, common pattern spatial (CSP) filtered WPD feature of EEG signals, and cortical-muscular coherence (CMC) feature of EMG-EEG signals, which were noted as EMG features, EEG features, and CMC features respectively. In total of 5 subjects participated in the experiments. According to experimenttal results, we concluded that the classification performance of myoelectric controller can be significantly improved (p<0.05, ANOVA) by the combination of EEG and EMG features and the combination of CMC and EMG features, compared with sole EMG features. The improvements were 9.83% and 6.06% respectively.

Existing literature has shown that a good classification accuracy is achievable in decoding for single subjects, but multi-subject classification has proven difficult due to the inter-subject variability. In this paper, multi-modal neuroimaging was used to improve two-class multi-subject classification accuracy in a cognitive task of differentiating between a face and a scrambled face. In this transfer learning problem, a feature space based on special-form covariance matrices manipulated with riemannian geometry are used. A supervised two-layer hierarchical model was trained iteratively for estimating classification accuracies. Results are reported on a publically available multi-subject, multi-modal human neuroimaging dataset from MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge. The dataset contains simultaneous recordings of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Our model attained, using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, a classification accuracy of 70.82% for single modal EEG, 81.55% for single modal MEG and 84.98% for multi-modal M/EEG.

Here, we apply complementary biomarker algorithms to electroencephalography (EEG) recordings to capture the brain's multi-faceted signature of disease or pharmacological intervention and use machine learning to improve classification performance. Using data from healthy subjects receiving scopolamine we developed an index of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist (mAChR) consisting of 14 EEG biomarkers. This mAChR index yielded higher classification performance than any single EEG biomarker with cross-validated accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision ranging from 88-92%. The mAChR index also discriminated healthy elderly from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, an index optimized for AD pathophysiology provided a better classification. We conclude that integrating multiple EEG biomarkers can enhance the accuracy of identifying disease or drug interventions, which is essential for clinical trials.

The combination of SVMs allows to handle the problem of EEG data variability between the different sessions of the acquisition process. This variability is caused by temporal non-stationarity of brain EEG signals. Hence, each SVM classifier is applied to a training set from the same session BMI data acquisition. A temporal extraction of P3 Event Related Potentials features is firstly conducted, then an offline classification of the extracted P3-speller responses is performed using the mixed SVMs. Simulation results show good performances classification, the ratio reach 84% after 15 test sequences.

The detection of combination EEG with eye movement provides a new means of communication for patients whose muscular damage are unable to communicate. And this method can translate some brain responses into actions. In this paper, based on the motor imagery, event related synchronization/desychronization (ERS/ERD) were tested by using time-frequency spectrum and brain topographic mapping. A features extraction algorithm is proposed based on common spatial pattern (CSP), then the support vector machine (SVM) were carried out to classificate data. An EEG recording device integrated with an eye tracker can be complementary to attain improved performance and a better efficiency. The eye movement signals (via eye tracker of Tobbi) and EEG signals of ERS/ERD are as the input of hybrid BCI system simultaneously while subjects follow movement of the arrows in each direction. The recognition accuracy of the entire system reaches to 86.1%. The results showed that the proposed method was efficient in the classification accuracy.

As for MI EEG signal processing, the high dimensions of features represent a research challenge. It is necessary to eliminate redundant features, which not only create an additional overhead of managing the space complexity, but also might include outliers, thereby reducing classification accuracy. The firefly algorithm (FA) can adaptively select the best subset of features, and improve classification accuracy. However, the FA is easily entrapped in a local optimum. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a method of combining the firefly algorithm and learning automata (LA) to optimize feature selection for motor imagery EEG. We employed a method of combining common spatial pattern (CSP) and local characteristic-scale decomposition (LCD) algorithms to obtain a high dimensional feature set, and classified it by using the spectral regression discriminant analysis (SRDA) classifier. Both the fourth brain-computer interface competition data and real-time data acquired in our designed experiments were used to verify the validation of the proposed method. Compared with genetic and adaptive weight particle swarm optimization algorithms, the experimental results show that our proposed method effectively eliminates redundant features, and improves the classification accuracy of MI EEG signals. In addition, a real-time brain-computer interface system was implemented to verify the feasibility of our proposed methods being applied in practical brain-computer interface systems.

Biological and non-biological artifacts cause severe problems when dealing with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a widely used method for eliminating various artifacts from recordings. However, evaluating and classifying the calculated independent components (IC) as artifact or EEG is not fully automated at present. Approach. In this study, we propose a new approach for automated artifact elimination, which applies machine learning algorithms to ICA-based features. Main results. We compared the performance of our classifiers with the visual classification results given by experts. The best result with an accuracy rate of 95% was achieved using features obtained by range filtering of the topoplots and IC power spectra combined with an artificial neural network. Significance. Compared with the existing automated solutions, our proposed method is not limited to specific types of artifacts, electrode configurations, or number of EEG channels. The main advantages of the proposed method is that it provides an automatic, reliable, real-time capable, and practical tool, which avoids the need for the time-consuming manual selection of ICs during artifact removal.

For this, we conducted two BCI experiments (left versus right hand motor imagery; mental arithmetic versus resting state). The dataset was validated using baseline signal analysis methods, with which classification performance was evaluated for each modality and a combination of both modalities. As already shown in previous literature, the capability of discriminating different mental states can be enhanced by using a hybrid approach, when comparing to single modality analyses. This makes the provided data highly suitable for hybrid BCI investigations. Since our open access dataset also comprises motion artifacts and physiological data, we expect that it can be used in a wide range of future validation approaches in multimodal BCI research.

However, classified MI states are limited, and their classification accuracy rates are low because of the characteristics of nonlinearity and nonstationarity. This study proposes a novel MI pattern recognition system that is based on complex algorithms for classifying MI EEG signals. In electrooculogram (EOG) artifact preprocessing, band-pass filtering is performed to obtain the frequency band of MI-related signals, and then, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) combined with wavelet threshold denoising (WTD) is used for EOG artifact preprocessing. We propose a regularized common spatial pattern (R-CSP) algorithm for EEG feature extraction by incorporating the principle of generic learning. A new classifier combining the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) approaches is used to classify four anisomerous states, namely, imaginary movements with the left hand, right foot, and right shoulder and the resting state. The highest classification accuracy rate is 92.5%, and the average classification accuracy rate is 87%. The proposed complex algorithm identification method can significantly improve the identification rate of the minority samples and the overall classification performance.

Predicting tDCS treatment outcomes of patients with major depressive disorder using automated EEG classification	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Major depressive disorder; Machine learning; Neuromodulation; Resting-state EEG; Brain rhythms	DIRECT-CURRENT STIMULATION; WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA ASYMMETRY; ANTIDEPRESSANT; BRAIN; MACHINE; METAANALYSIS; DIAGNOSIS; NETWORK; TRIAL	Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Standard tDCS treatment involves numerous sessions running over a few weeks. However, not all participants respond to this type of treatment. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of identifying MDD patients that respond to tDCS treatment based on resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) recorded prior to treatment commencing. Methods: We used machine learning to predict improvement in mood and cognition during tDCS treatment from baseline EEG power spectra. Ten participants with a current diagnosis of MDD were included. Power spectral density was assessed in five frequency bands: delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (30-100 Hz). Improvements in mood and cognition were assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Symbol Digit Modalities Test, respectively. We trained the classifiers using three algorithms (support vector machine, extreme learning machine and linear discriminant analysis) and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. Results: Mood labels were accurately predicted in 8 out of 10 participants using EEG channels FC4-AF8 (accuracy=76%, p=0.034). Cognition labels were accurately predicted in 10 out of 10 participants using channels pair CPz-CP2 (accuracy=92%, p=0.004). Limitations: Due to the limited number of participants (n=10), the presented results mainly aim to serve as a proof of concept. Conclusions: These finding demonstrate the feasibility of using machine learning to identify patients that will respond to tDCS treatment. These promising results warrant a larger study to determine the clinical utility of this approach.

In this paper, we present ES1D, a deep learning approach to identify subjects from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals captured by using a low cost device. The system consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is fed with the power spectral density of different EEG recordings belonging to different individuals. The network is trained for a period of one million iterations, in order to learn features related to local patterns in the spectral domain of the original signal. The performance of the system is evaluated against other traditional classification-based methods that use prior-knowledge-defined features. Results show that the system significantly outperforms other examined approaches, with 94% accuracy at discerning an individual in between a group of 23 different individuals.

Prediction of postoperative opioid analgesia using clinical-experimental parameters and electroencephalography	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							ACUTE PAIN REGISTRY; QUALITY IMPROVEMENT; IMMPACT RECOMMENDATIONS; PERSONALIZED MEDICINE; CHRONIC-PANCREATITIS; POSTSURGICAL PAIN; EEG; MANAGEMENT; INTENSITY; RESPONSES	BackgroundOpioids are often used for pain treatment, but the response is often insufficient and dependent on e.g. the pain condition, genetic factors and drug class. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers to enable selection of the appropriate drug for the individual patient, a concept known as personalized medicine. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) and clinical parameters can provide some guidance for response, but better and more objective biomarkers are urgently warranted. Electroencephalography (EEG) may be suitable since it assesses the central nervous system where opioids mediate their effects. MethodsClinical parameters, QST and EEG (during rest and tonic pain) was recorded from patients the day prior to total hip replacement surgery. Postoperative pain treatment was performed using oxycodone and piritramide as patient-controlled analgesia. Patients were stratified into responders and non-responders based on pain ratings 24h post-surgery. Parameters were analysed using conventional group-wise statistical methods. Furthermore, EEG was analysed by machine learning to predict individual response. ResultsEighty-one patients were included, of which 51 responded to postoperative opioid treatment (30 non-responders). Conventional statistics showed that more severe pre-existing chronic pain was prevalent among non-responders to opioid treatment (p=0.04). Preoperative EEG analysis was able to predict responders with an accuracy of 65% (p=0.009), but only during tonic pain. ConclusionsChronic pain grade before surgery is associated with the outcome of postoperative pain treatment. Furthermore, EEG shows potential as an objective biomarker and might be used to predict postoperative opioid analgesia. SignificanceThe current clinical study demonstrates the viability of EEG as a biomarker and with results consistent with previous experimental results. The combined method of machine learning and electroencephalography offers promising results for future developments of personalized pain treatment.	[Gram, M.; Olesen, S. S.; Drewes, A.

However, MEG and EEG have systematic differences in sampling neural activity. This poses the question to which degree such measurement differences consistently bias the results of multivariate analysis applied to MEG and EEG activation patterns. To investigate, we conducted a concurrent MEG/EEG study while participants viewed images of everyday objects. We applied multivariate classification analyses to MEG and EEG data, and compared the resulting time courses to each other, and to fMRI data for an independent evaluation in space. We found that both MEG and EEG revealed the millisecond spatiotemporal dynamics of visual processing with largely equivalent results. Beyond yielding convergent results, we found that MEG and EEG also captured partly unique aspects of visual representations. Those unique components emerged earlier in time for MEG than for EEG. Identifying the sources of those unique components with fMRI, we found the locus for both MEG and EEG in high-level visual cortex, and in addition for MEG in low-level visual cortex. Together, our results show that multivariate analyses of MEG and EEG data offer a convergent and complimentary view on neural processing, and motivate the wider adoption of these methods in both MEG and EEG research.

As a non-invasive interface, the scalp electroencephalography (EEG) has a significant potential to be a major input signal for future BCI systems. Traditional methods only focus on a particular feature in the EEG signal, which limits the practical applications of EEG-based BCI. In this paper, we propose a algorithm for EEG classification with the ability to fuse multiple features. First, use the common spatial pattern (CSP) as the spatial feature and use wavelet coefficient as the spectral feature. Second, fuse these features with a fusion algorithm in orchestrate way to improve the accuracy of classification. Our algorithms are applied to the dataset IVa from BCI complete III. By analyzing the experimental results, it is possible to conclude that we can speculate that our algorithm perform better than traditional methods.

J	Lu, N; Li, TF; Ren, XD; Miao, HY				Lu, Na; Li, Tengfei; Ren, Xiaodong; Miao, Hongyu			A Deep Learning Scheme for Motor Imagery Classification based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); deep learning; motor imagery; restricted Boltzman machine (RBM)	EEG; ERP	Motor imagery classification is an important topic in brain-computer interface (BCI) research that enables the recognition of a subject's intension to, e.g., implement prosthesis control. The brain dynamics of motor imagery are usually measured by electroencephalography (EEG) as nonstationary time series of low signal-to-noise ratio. Although a variety of methods have been previously developed to learn EEG signal features, the deep learning idea has rarely been explored to generate new representation of EEG features and achieve further performance improvement for motor imagery classification. In this study, a novel deep learning scheme based on restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is proposed. Specifically, frequency domain representations of EEG signals obtained via fast Fourier transform(FFT) and wavelet package decomposition (WPD) are obtained to train three RBMs. These RBMs are then stacked up with an extra output layer to form a four-layer neural network, which is named the frequential deep belief network (FDBN). The output layer employs the softmax regression to accomplish the classification task. Also, the conjugate gradient method and backpropagation are used to fine tune the FDBN. Extensive and systematic experiments have been performed on public benchmark datasets, and the results show that the performance improvement of FDBN over other selected state-of-the-art methods is statistically significant. Also, several findings that may be of significant interest to the BCI community are presented in this article.

Because using fMRI in patients with DOC is difficult, studies increasingly employ EEG. However, there has been no verification that these modalities provide converging information at the individual subject level. The present study examined simultaneous EEG and fMRI in healthy volunteers during six mental imagery tasks to determine whether one mental imagery task generates more robust activation across subjects; whether activation can be predicted from familiarity with the imagined activity; and whether EEG and fMRI converge upon the same conclusions about individual imagery performance. Mental arithmetic generated the most robust activation in the majority of subjects for both EEG and fMRI, and level of activation could not be predicted from familiarity, with either modality. We conclude that overall, EEG and fMRI agree regarding individual mental imagery performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The proposed approach comprises two stages including feature extraction using the common spatial pattern (CSP) and classification using fuzzy logic systems (FLS). CSP is used to extract significant features that are then fed into FLS as inputs for classification. The metaheuristic population-based particle swarm optimization method is used to train parameters of the FLS. The multiclass motor imagery dataset IIa from the BCI competition IV is used for experiments to highlight the superiority of the proposed approach against competing methods, which include linear discriminant analysis, naive bayes, k-nearest neighbour, ensemble learning AdaBoost and support vector machine. Results from experiments show the great accuracy of the combination of CSP and FLS. Therefore, the proposed approach can be implemented effectively in the practical BCI systems, which would be helpful for people with impairments and rehabilitation.

We have used electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) as imaging modalities with 17 healthy subjects performing the letter n-back task, a standard experimental paradigm related to working memory (WM). The level of MWL was parametrically changed by variation of n from 0 to 3. Nineteen EEG channels were covering the whole-head and 19 fNIRS channels were located on the forehead to cover the most dominant brain region involved in WM. Grand block averaging of recorded signals revealed specific behaviors of oxygenated-hemoglobin level during changes in the level of MWL. A machine learning approach has been utilized for detection of the level of MWL. We extracted different features from EEG, fNIRS, and EEG+fNIRS signals as the biomarkers of MWL and fed them to a linear support vector machine (SVM) as train and test sets. These features were selected based on their sensitivity to the changes in the level of MWL according to the literature. We introduced a new category of features within fNIRS and EEG+fNIRS systems. In addition, the performance level of each feature category was systematically assessed. We also assessed the effect of number of features and window size in classification performance. SVM classifier used in order to discriminate between different combinations of cognitive states from binary- and multi-class states. In addition to the cross-validated performance level of the classifier other metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated for a comprehensive assessment of the classification system. The Hybrid (EEG+fNIRS) system had an accuracy that was significantly higher than that of either EEG or fNIRS. Our results suggest that EEG+fNIRS features combined with a classifier are capable of robustly discriminating among various levels of MWL. Results suggest that EEG+fNIRS should be preferred to only EEG or fNIRS, in developing passive BCIs and other applications which need to monitor users' MWL.

Automatic epileptic seizure identification in EEG is a challenging task and useful for helping neurophysiologists. This study compares some algorithms in machine learning algorithm that combine features extraction and classification algorithm for epilepsy seizure identification based on EEG data. The classification algorithms compared in this study are Generalized Relevance Learning Vector Quantization (GRLVQ), Backpropagation, SVM, and Random Forest, combined with Wavelet and PCA feature extraction. The EEG signals used in this study were obtained from EEG dataset which was developed by University of Bonn. EEG epilepsy seizure dataset has five classes. Class A and B are from five healthy subjects in open and closed eyes. Class C, D, and E from five elliptic subjects, where C and D are no-seizure signals, and E contains only seizure signal. The tasks that are used to compare the performance of feature extraction and classification algorithm is classifying 5 classes of EEG epilepsy seizure on EEG dataset. The measurements for evaluating methods are: accuracy, recall, precision training and testing times. The best feature extraction method at our experiment is PCA. The best performance in recognizing the five classes in EEG epileptic seizure dataset is GRLVQ, with the accuracy, precision and recall is 0.9866 and testing time is less than 0.1 seconds.

The purpose of our work is to detect the artifacts by identifying the most relevant features, both in the temporal and frequency domains, and train various supervised learning algorithms: Decision Trees, SVM and KNN, in order to distinguish between clean and contaminated signals.

But some important problems have not yet been benefitted from DWT, including epileptic focus localization, a key task in epilepsy diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, the parameters and settings for DWT are chosen empirically or arbitrarily in previous work. In this work, we propose a framework to use DWT and support vector machine (SVM) for epileptic focus localization problem based on EEG. To provide a guideline in selecting the best settings for DWT, we decompose the EEG segments in seven commonly used wavelet families to their maximum theoretical levels. The wavelet and its level of decomposition providing the highest accuracy in each wavelet family are then used in a grid search for obtaining the optimal frequency bands and wavelet coefficient features. Our approach achieves promising performance on two widely-recognized intrancranial EEG datasets that are also seizure-free, with an accuracy of 83.07% on the Bern-Barcelona dataset and an accuracy of 88.00% on the UBonn dataset. Compared with existing DWT-based approaches in epileptic EEG analysis, the proposed approach leads to more accurate and robust results. A guideline for DWT parameter setting is provided at the end of the paper.

Although the research results have motivated the use of CAD techniques to help assist psychiatrists in clinics yet their clinical translation has been less clear and remains a research topic. In this paper, a proposed machine learning (ML) scheme was tested and validated with resting-state EEG data involving 33 MDD patients and 30 healthy controls. The EEG-derived measures such as power of different EEG frequency bands and EEG alpha interhemispheric asymmetry were investigated as input features to the proposed ML scheme to discriminate the MDD patients and healthy controls, and to prove their feasibility for diagnosing depression. The acquired EEG data were subjected to noise removal and feature extraction. As a result, a data matrix was constructed by the columns-wise concatenation of the extracted features. Furthermore, the z-score standardization was performed to standardize each column of the data matrix according to its mean and variance. The data matrix may have redundant and irrelevant features; therefore, to determine the most significant features, a weight was assigned to each feature based on its ability to separate the target classes according to the criterion, i.e., receiver operating characteristics (roc). Hence, only the most significant features were used for testing and training the classifier models: Logistic regression (LR), Support vector machine (SVM), and Naive Bayesian (NB). Finally, the classifier models were validated with 10-fold cross-validation that has provided the performance metrics such as test accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. As a result of the investigations, most significant features such as EEG signal power and EEG alpha interhemispheric asymmetry from the brain areas such as frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital were found significant. In addition, the proposed ML framework proved automatic identification of aberrant EEG patterns specific to disease conditions and provide high classification results i.e., LR classifier (accuracy = 97.6%, sensitivity = 96.66%, specificity = 98.5%), NB classification (accuracy = 96.8%, sensitivity = 96.6%, specificity = 97.02%), and SVM (accuracy = 98.4%, sensitivity = 96.66%, specificity = 100%). In conclusion, the proposed ML scheme along with the EEG signal power and EEG alpha interhemispheric asymmetry are proved suitable as clinical diagnostic tools for MDD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In such interaction scenarios, it is often evident what a robot should do, yet unclear how the actions should be performed. Humans in the scene nevertheless have subjective preferences over the range of possible robot policies. Hence, robot policy optimization should incorporate the human's preferences. One option to gather online information is the decoding of the human's brain signals. We present ongoing work on decoding the perceived hazardousness of situations based on brain signals from electroencephalography (EEG). Based on experiments with participants watching potentially hazardous traffic situations, we show that such decoding is feasible and propose to extend the approach towards more complex environments such as robotic assistants. Ultimately, we aim to provide a closed-loop system for human-compliant adaptation of robot policies based on the decoding of EEG signals.

J	Kumar, S; Sharma, A; Tsunoda, T				Kumar, Shiu; Sharma, Alok; Tsunoda, Tatsuhiko			An improved discriminative filter bank selection approach for motor imagery EEG signal classification using mutual information	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Bioinformatics (InCoB) - Bioinformatics	SEP 20-22, 2017	Shenzhen, PEOPLES R CHINA			Brain computer interface; Common spatial pattern; Electroencephalography; Frequency band; Motor imagery; Mutual information	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; COMMUNICATION; OPTIMIZATION; STROKE; BCI	Background: Common spatial pattern (CSP) has been an effective technique for feature extraction in electroencephalography (EEG) based brain computer interfaces (BCIs). However, motor imagery EEG signal feature extraction using CSP generally depends on the selection of the frequency bands to a great extent. Methods: In this study, we propose a mutual information based frequency band selection approach. The idea of the proposed method is to utilize the information from all the available channels for effectively selecting the most discriminative filter banks. CSP features are extracted from multiple overlapping sub-bands. An additional sub-band has been introduced that cover the wide frequency band (7-30 Hz) and two different types of features are extracted using CSP and common spatio-spectral pattern techniques, respectively. Mutual information is then computed from the extracted features of each of these bands and the top filter banks are selected for further processing. Linear discriminant analysis is applied to the features extracted from each of the filter banks. The scores are fused together, and classification is done using support vector machine. Results: The proposed method is evaluated using BCI Competition III dataset IVa, BCI Competition IV dataset I and BCI Competition IV dataset IIb, and it outperformed all other competing methods achieving the lowest misclassification rate and the highest kappa coefficient on all three datasets. Conclusions: Introducing a wide sub-band and using mutual information for selecting the most discriminative sub-bands, the proposed method shows improvement in motor imagery EEG signal classification.

The Riemannian framework is sharp from a mathematical perspective, yet in practice it is simple, both algorithmically and computationally. This allows the conception of online decoding machines suiting real-world operation in adverse conditions. We provide here a review on the use of Riemannian geometry for BCI and a primer on the classification frameworks based on it. While the theoretical research on Riemannian geometry is technical, our aim here is to show the appeal of the framework on an intuitive geometrical ground. In particular, we provide a rationale for its robustness and transfer learning capabilities and we elucidate the link between a simple Riemannian classifier and a state-of-the-art spatial filtering approach. We conclude by reporting details on the construction of data points to be manipulated in the Riemannian framework in the context of BCI and by providing links to available open-source Matlab and Python code libraries for designing BCI decoders.

Classification of upper limb center-out reaching tasks by means of EEG-based continuous decoding techniques	JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Electroencephalography; Linear decoding; Upper limb movements; Center-out reaching tasks	HAND; STROKE; GRASP; REHABILITATION; INTERFACE; MOVEMENTS; RECOVERY; SIGNALS	Background: One of the current challenges in brain-machine interfacing is to characterize and decode upper limb kinematics from brain signals, e.g. to control a prosthetic device. Recent research work states that it is possible to do so based on low frequency EEG components. However, the validity of these results is still a matter of discussion. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of decoding upper limb kinematics from EEG signals in center-out reaching tasks during passive and active movements. Methods: The decoding of arm movement was performed using a multidimensional linear regression. Passive movements were analyzed using the same methodology to study the influence of proprioceptive sensory feedback in the decoding. Finally, we evaluated the possible advantages of classifying reaching targets, instead of continuous trajectories. Results: The results showed that arm movement decoding was significantly above chance levels. The results also indicated that EEG slow cortical potentials carry significant information to decode active center-out movements. The classification of reached targets allowed obtaining the same conclusions with a very high accuracy. Additionally, the low decoding performance obtained from passive movements suggests that discriminant modulations of low-frequency neural activity are mainly related to the execution of movement while proprioceptive feedback is not sufficient to decode upper limb kinematics. Conclusions: This paper contributes to the assessment of feasibility of using linear regression methods to decode upper limb kinematics from EEG signals. From our findings, it can be concluded that low frequency bands concentrate most of the information extracted from upper limb kinematics decoding and that decoding performance of active movements is above chance levels and mainly related to the activation of cortical motor areas. We also show that the classification of reached targets from decoding approaches may be a more suitable real-time methodology than a direct decoding of hand position.

Watermarking has been proved as a right-protection mechanism that can provide detectable evidence for the legal ownership of a shared dataset, without compromising its usability. However, the main disadvantage of these conventional techniques is unintelligent, rule-based and they do not directly deal with the data synchronization. Therefore, decoding performance reduces significantly when the watermarked data is transmitted through a real communication channel. This paper proposes an intelligent learning-based watermark scheme for outsourced biomedical time series data. The scheme carries out embedding of watermark data based on modifying mean modulation relationship of approximation coefficients in wavelet domain. In addition, the correlation between modified frequency coefficients and the watermark sequence in wavelet domain is intelligently learnt by a machine learning algorithm. The watermark can be effectively retrieved using this learning algorithm. Experimental results on electroencephalography (EEG) data with support vector data description (SVDD) learning show that the proposed scheme provides good imperceptibility and more robust against various signal processing techniques and common attacks such as random cropping, noise addition, low-pass filtering, and resampling.

The goal is to identify the pattern of the brain activity using a robust method for pre-processing, processing, and classification of the EEG signals. To this end, a new graph-based framework is proposed to reduce the dimensionality of the data by taking into account not only the geometrical structure of the channels/electrodes, but also the correlation between the EEG signals. The most significant feature vectors required for EEG signals classification are adaptively selected through spectral decomposition of the data using the graph Laplacian matrix. The tangent space mapping method is then applied to bring the captured data into Euclidean space. In order to classify the dimensionally-reduced EEG signals, the linear support vector machine algorithm is employed. Experiments are conducted on five different subjects consisting of right hand and right foot motor imagery actions. The results show that the proposed method can provide higher classification accuracy as compared to the other existing methods that we tested.

As commercial applications and out-of-the-lab solutions are proposed, there is an increased pressure to provide online algorithms and real-time implementations. Electroencephalography (EEG) systems offer lightweight and wearable solutions, at the expense of signal quality. Approaches based on covariance matrices have demonstrated good robustness to noise and provide a suitable representation for classification tasks, relying on advances in Riemannian geometry. We propose to equip the minimum distance to mean (MDM) classifier with a new family of means, based on the inductive mean, for block-online classification tasks and to embed the inductive mean in an incremental learning algorithm for online classification of EEG.

"Electroencephalography" has been widely used for BCI system as it is a non-invasive approach. Recently, various classifiers have been used for the analysis of EEG signals measured under the planning and relaxed state. The major work addressed in the paper is the classification of EEG signals (motor imagery) measured under planning and relaxed state using advanced learning classifiers. The dataset of planning and relaxed state is a benchmark data and it is taken from UCI (University of California, Irvine) repository. Semi supervised ELM (SS-ELM) and unsupervised ELM (US-ELM) are recently developed networks and used for the EEG signal classification task. Both of these algorithms can be fit in to a unified framework and handle multi-class classification or multi-cluster clustering. SS-ELM algorithm performs better than US-ELM and other real valued algorithms in classifying planning and relaxed states. The improvement is due to the use of spectral techniques in embedding and clustering.

In this paper, we propose a method to reduce false detection rates of decoding through a rejection option based on the difference in the posterior probability computed by the Naive Bayesian classifier. We applied the proposed approach on the BCI Competition IV Dataset IIa, and the results showed a decrease in the false detection rates from 34.6 % to 6.9%, while average decoded trials decreased from 93.2% to 34.2% using a rejection threshold between 0.1 and 0.9. We subsequently formulated a method to optimize the rejection threshold based on the maximum F-0.5 score. The optimal rejection threshold yielded an average decrease in false detection rate to 19.1% with an average of 67.5% of trials decoded. The results showed the feasibility of decreasing false detection rates at a cost of rejection. Nevertheless, the results suggest that the use of reject option (RO) may be used as a training feedback system to train subjects' overt and covert EEG control strategies for better (dexterity and safety) continuous control of external device.

These signals are highly nonlinear and nonstationary, and some specific patterns exist for certain disease types that are hard to develop an automatic epileptic seizure detection system. This paper discussed statistical mechanics of complex networks, which inherit the characteristic properties of electroencephalography signals, for feature extraction via a horizontal visibility algorithm in order to reduce processing time and complexity. The algorithm transforms a time series signal into a complex network, which some features are abbreviated. The statistical mechanics are calculated to capture distinctions pertaining to certain diseases to form a feature vector. The feature vector is classified by multiclass classification via a k-nearest neighbor classifier, a multilayer perceptron neural network, and a support vector machine with a 10-fold cross-validation criterion. In performance evaluation of proposed method with healthy, seizure-free interval, and seizure signals, firstly, input data length is regarded among some practical signal samples by optimizing between accuracy-processing time, and the proposed method yields outstanding performance on the average classification accuracy for 3-class problems mainly for detection of seizure-free interval and seizure signals and acceptable results for 2-class and 5-class problems comparing with conventional methods. The proposed method is another tool that can be used for classifying signal patterns, as an alternative to time/frequency analyses.

The salient electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram features were selected as inputs to the NARX model, whose continuous output was discretized in terms of five MWL classes at each time instant. The orders of the NARX model were determined using an objective function to achieve a good tradeoff between model accuracy and complexity via a least-squares support vector machine. The physiological features from different measurement channels (electrodes) and frequency bands were compared in terms of multiclass MWL classification performance. The classification results showed that the locality projection preservation technique can maintain sufficiently high MWL classification accuracy (with the highest five-class correct classification rate of 88%) with a significantly reduced computational complexity. The comparative results of classification performance also demonstrated the superiority of the proposed dynamic model to a widely-used static model.

To control a device through BCI, neural signals of a user must be translated to meaningful control commands using various machine learning components, e.g. feature extraction, dimensionality reduction and classification, that should also be carefully designed for practical use. However, the noise and variability in the neural data pose one of the greatest challenges that in practice previously functioning BCI fails in the subsequent operation requiring re-tuning/optimization. This paper presents an idea of defining multiple feature spaces and optimal decision boundaries therein to account for noise and variability in data and improve a generalization of a learning machine. The spaces are defined in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces induced by a Radial Basis Gaussian function. Then the learning is done via L1-regularized Support Vector Machines. The central idea behind our approach is that a classifier predicts an unseen test examples by learning more rich feature spaces with a suite of optimal hyperparameters. Empirical evaluation have shown an improved generalization performance (range 79-90%) on two class motor imagery Electroencephalography (EEG) data, when compared with other conventional machine learning methods.

Extracting these patterns from a set of EEG records provides a dataset to be used in machine learning in order to implement an intelligent classification system that predict prognosis of the baby. In a previous work we proved that Inter-burst intervals (IBI) found in the EEG records predicts abnormal outcomes of the premature. A bibliographic study on the amplitude of an EEG signal, with the annotations of the neuropediatricians, showed that low amplitudes in EEG signal are strongly correlated with an abnormal prognosis of the premature, similar to that of IBI. According to these hypotheses, we present in this paper, a segmentation methodology on the amplitude of bursts intervals of EEG signal into 3 segments: low, medium and high, in addition to the inter-burst intervals. We create a new algorithm that detects 6 important parameters in each interval of these 4 segments. After applying this new methodology, we obtain a new classified dataset that contains 24 parameters extracted from these 4 segments to obtain with gestational age of the preterm and the day of recording 26 input attributes and one output which is the class (normal, sick or risky).

However, the effectiveness of spatial filtering is undermined due to the significant nonstationarity of EEG. Based on regularization, most of the conventional stationary spatial filter design methods address the nonstationarity at the cost of the interclass discrimination. Moreover, spatial filter optimization is inconsistent with feature extraction when EEG covariance matrices could not be jointly diagonalized due to the regularization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for a spatial filter design. With Fisher's ratio in feature space directly used as the objective function, the spatial filter optimization is unified with feature extraction. Given its ratio form, the selection of the regularization parameter could be avoided. We evaluate the proposed method on a binary motor imagery data set of 16 subjects, who performed the calibration and test sessions on different days. The experimental results show that the proposed method yields improvement in classification performance for both single broadband and filter bank settings compared with conventional nonunified methods. We also provide a systematic attempt to compare different objective functions in modeling data nonstationarity with simulation studies.

A new method that combines ELM with probabilistic model method is proposed in this paper to classify the electroencephalography (EEG) signals in synchronous brain-computer interface (BCI) system. In the proposed method, the softmax function is used to convert the ELM output to classification probability. The Chernoff error bound, deduced from the Bayesian probabilistic model in the training process, is adopted as the weight to take the discriminant process. Since the proposed method makes use of the knowledge from all preceding training datasets, its discriminating performance improves accumulatively. In the test experiments based on the datasets from BCI competitions, the proposed method is compared with other classification methods, including the linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, ELM and weighted probabilistic model methods. For comparison, the mutual information, classification accuracy and information transfer rate are considered as the evaluation indicators for these classifiers. The results demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance against other methods.

The current study investigated whether information regarding the general desirability (`Wanting') of visually presented 'everyday' objects was rapidly and automatically processed. Participants completed a foreground task while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded, and task-irrelevant images were presented in the background. Following this, participants rated the images with regards to Wanting and the potentially related attributes of Relevance, Familiarity, Aesthetic Pleasantness and Time Reference. Multivariate pattern classification was used to predict the ratings from patterns of EEG data. Prediction of Wanting and Relevance was possible between 100 and 150 ms following stimulus presentation. The other dimensions could not be predicted. Wanting and Relevance ratings were highly correlated and displayed similar feature weight maps. The current results suggest that the general desirability and subjective relevance of everyday objects is rapidly and automatically processed for a wide range of visual stimuli.

First, we present three strategies of using BCI to detect MI from EEG: operant conditioning that employed a fixed model, machine learning that employed a subject-specific model computed from calibration, and adaptive strategy that continuously compute the subject-specific model. Second, we review prevailing works that employed the operant conditioning and machine learning strategies. Third, we present our past work on six stroke patients who underwent a BCI rehabilitation clinical trial with averaged accuracies of 79.8% during calibration and 69.5% across 18 online feedback sessions. Finally, we perform an offline study in this paper on our work employing the adaptive strategy. The results yielded significant improvements of 12% (p < 0.001) and 9% (p < 0.001) using all the data and using limited preceding data respectively in the feedback accuracies. The results showed an increase in the amount of training data yielded improvements. Nevertheless, results of using limited preceding data showed a larger part of the improvement was due to the adaptive strategy and changing subject-specific models did not deteriorate the accuracies. Hence the adaptive strategy is effective in addressing the non-stationarity between calibration and feedback sessions.

J	Dhindsa, K				Dhindsa, Kiret			Filter-Bank Artifact Rejection: High performance real-time single-channel artifact detection for EEG	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Artifact detection; Machine learning; Brain signal processing	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; REMOVAL; EMG	Recent developments in electroencephalography (EEG) have led to a variety of consumer-grade EEG devices for brain-computer interfacing (BCI) and neurofeedback (NF) equipped with only one or a few EEG sensors. With minimal electrode coverage, most methods of detecting artifacts in the signal which arise from non-brain sources are not applicable. Furthermore, methods which can be used on single channel EEG are typically not sufficiently accurate or fast for BCI and NF applications. In this paper a new highly accurate artifact rejection method is introduced, called Filter-Bank Artifact Rejection (FBAR), which is designed for real-time EEG applications using just a few or even a single EEG channel. FBAR is compared to a current state-of-the-art method, Fully Automated Statistical Thresholding for EEG artifact Rejection (FASTER). FBAR outperformed FASTER on all test data, due mainly to its ability to detect small artifacts in the presence of high amplitude EEG. This makes FBAR particularly useful for BCI and NF applications, which are especially dependent on achieving the highest possible signal-to-noise ratio in a real-time setting. A MATLAB toolbox allowing for use and experimentation with FBAR including several customizable options is available as a Git repository at https://bitbucket.org/kiretd/FBAR. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The current method of screening depression is subjective, labor-consuming and costly. Study on Electroencephalogram (EEG) has become a new direction to explore an objective, low-cost and accurate method to detect depression. In this paper, three-electrode EEG data of 158 subjects (90 depressed and 68 normal control) in resting state, and under audio stimulation (positive and negative) were collected and processed. After feature selection using Sequential Floating Forward Selection (SFFS), four popular classification methods were applied and classification accuracies were verified using 10-fold cross validation. Results have shown the accuracy of classification will be improved when male and female are classified separately. The highest accuracy of male and female classification are 91.98%, 79.76%, respectively, compare to 77.43% when the classification is processed as gender-free. The effective depressive features of male and female are also different, which may be caused by the differences of brain structure. This research suggests a possible pervasive method of depression classification for future clinical application.

A novel feature extraction method is proposed based on the sparse rational decomposition and the Local Gabor Binary Patterns (LGBP). Namely, we decompose the channels of the EEG record into 8 sparse rational components using a group of optimal coefficients. Then, a modified 1D LGBP operator is applied, which is followed by downsampling of the data. The width of the largest LGBPs is finally computed for all the 8 rational components and the 23 channels of the EEG record. Hence, we characterize seizure patterns of one-second-long EEG epochs by 23 x 8 features. The effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method is assessed using different classifiers which are trained with 25% of early EEG records of each patient. We performed an extensive comparative study over 163 h of EEG recordings from the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database. The experiments show that the proposed technique outperforms other dedicated techniques by achieving the overall sensitivity of 70.4% and the overall specificity of 99.1%, in the patient-specific detection of epileptic EEG epochs. Moreover, it detects onset of seizures with the overall sensitivity of 91.13% and false alarms per hour rate of 0.35, on average. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Next to the clinical neurologic examination,electroencephalography (EEG) is the most commonly used method to assess prognosis. However, the reliability of EEG has been limited by varying classification systems, interrater variability, and the influence of sedation. Another important purpose of EEG is to evaluate clinical and subclinical seizures. The American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) recently proposed a standardized EEG terminology for critically ill patients suitable for use after CA. Standardization is essential for reproducibility, meta-analyses, and clinical application of study results. Electrophysiological recovery or failure of recovery can be monitored with EEG during the first few days after CA. Electroencephalographic patterns highly predictive of poor outcome, such as generalized suppression and burst suppression, will be discussed in relation to the ACNS terminology and the time point after CA. The author focuses on the prognostic value of EEG after CA, using both continuous EEG monitoring and routine EEG. The evidence for predicting poor as well as good prognosis will be reviewed and practical suggestions are provided.

Mental Task Evaluation for Hybrid NIRS-EEG Brain-Computer Interfaces	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							SINGLE-TRIAL CLASSIFICATION; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; IMAGERY; SYNCHRONIZATION; PERFORMANCE; SIGNALS; SYSTEM; FMRI	Based on recent electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) studies that showed that tasks such as motor imagery and mental arithmetic induce specific neural response patterns, we propose a hybrid brain-computer interface (hBCI) paradigm in which EEG and NIRS data are fused to improve binary classification performance. We recorded simultaneous NIRS-EEG data from nine participants performing seven mental tasks (word generation, mental rotation, subtraction, singing and navigation, and motor and face imagery). Classifiers were trained for each possible pair of tasks using (1) EEG features alone, (2) NIRS features alone, and (3) EEG and NIRS features combined, to identify the best task pairs and assess the usefulness of a multimodal approach. The NIRS-EEG approach led to an average increase in peak kappa of 0.03 when using features extracted from one-second windows (equivalent to an increase of 1.5% in classification accuracy for balanced classes). The increase was much stronger (0.20, corresponding to an 10% accuracy increase) when focusing on time windows of high NIRS performance. The EEG and NIRS analyses further unveiled relevant brain regions and important feature types. This work provides a basis for future NIRS-EEG hBCI studies aiming to improve classification performance toward more efficient and flexible BCIs.

The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical and electroencephalography (EEG) characteristics, and outcome of 57 child-onset patients with EPC according to different etiologies, and further explore the electro-clinical-etiological associations. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 57 children diagnosed with EPC in our department over last ten years. Etiology, clinical and EEG data, and outcome were categorized and analyzed. Results: For the 57 child -onset patients, EPC was caused by different etiologies, including immune-related disease (43.9%), focal lesions (17.5%), inborn errors of metabolism (24.6%), and unknown (14.0%). EEG background abnormalities showed generalized slowing in 45 patients (78.9%) and focal slowing in two patients (3.5%). Nineteen patients (33.3%) presented clear correlation of ictal EEG/EMG and the remaining 38 patients (66.7%) showed no clear correlation of ictal EEG/EMG. Both EEG background activity and ictal EEG/EMG correspondence among different etiologies had statistical significance (P < 0.05). The ictal patterns without clear EEG/EMG correspondence in immune -related disease and the ictal patterns with clear EEG/EMG correspondence in focal lesions were more prominent (P < 0.05). Conclusion: This is the first study of child -onset EPC with a large series in a pediatric epilepsy center in China. The most common cause for EPC was immune -related disease. The EEG background activity and the EEG/EMG correspondence might be influenced by the etiologies of EPC to some degree. These findings might guide the direction of EPC diagnosis in conjunction with other examinations. (C) 2017 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we utilized a publically available BCI Competition-IV 2008 dataset IIa. This study address to the binary classification problem of the motor imagery EEG data by using a sigmoid activation function-based extreme learning machines (ELM). We proposed a novel method of extracting the features from the EEG signals by first applying the independent component analysis (ICA) on the time series data and transforming the ICA time series data into Fourier domain and then extract the phase information from the Fourier spectrum. This phase information was further used to calculate the maximized cross-correlation connectivity matrix. The upper diagonal of this matrix was then vectorized and it serves as the basic feature for the ELM classification framework. By using the phase-only features we achieved 97.80% (p < 0.0022) nested cross-validated classification accuracy. In addition, this process is relatively computationally inexpensive. Thus, it can be an excellent candidate for the motor imagery BCI applications.

Identifying sleep spindles with multichannel EEG and classification optimization	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Thresholding; Machine learning; Optimization; Sleep spindle; Memory consolidation	K-COMPLEXES; MEMORY; THRESHOLD	Researchers classify critical neural events during sleep called spindles that are related to memory consolidation using the method of scalp electroencephalography. (EEG). Manual classification is time consuming and is susceptible to low inter-rater agreement. This could be improved using an automated approach. This study presents an optimized filter based and thresholding (FBT) model to set up a baseline for comparison to evaluate machine learning models using naive features, such as raw signals, peak frequency, and dominant power. The FBT model allows us to formally define sleep spindles using signal processing but may miss examples most human scorers would agree are spindles. Machine learning methods in theory should be able to approach performance of human raters but they require a large quantity of scored data, proper feature representation, intensive feature engineering, and model selection. We evaluate both the FBT model and machine learning models with naive features. We show that the machine learning models derived from the FBT model improve classification performance. An automated approach designed for the current data was applied to the DREAMS dataset [1]. With one of the expert's annotation as a gold standard, our pipeline yields an excellent sensitivity that is close to a second expert's scores and with the advantage that it can classify spindles based on multiple channels if more channels are available. More importantly, our pipeline could be modified as a guide to aid manual annotation of sleep spindles based on multiple channels quickly (6-10 s for processing a 40-min EEG recording), making spindle detection faster and more objective.

Time-frequency analysis of EEG for improved classification of emotion	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						emotion recognition; brain-computer interface; EEG; SVM; HHT	RECOGNITION; INTELLIGENCE; FEATURES	Emotion detection has crucial role in many domains especially in health and e-learning sector. This study aims to improve the accuracy in detecting emotions using brain activity. It addresses two primary problems associated with current emotion recognition systems. Firstly, these existing systems can classify only small classes of emotion. Secondly, analysis of the EEG is complex due to its non-stationary and non-linear characteristics. We conducted experiments to record EEG of subjects using 14 electrodes attached directly to the scalp based on International 10-20 system. To remove artefacts, raw signals are pre-processed. Emotional patterns associated with EEG are detected on time-frequency domain using Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). Multiclass Support Vector Machine classifier (MC-SVM) is used to distinguish emotions from recorded data based on the instantaneous frequency obtained through HHT. The results revealed the effectiveness of the suggested time-frequency-based analysis method to detect wide range of emotions using EEG signals.

J	Yuan-Pin, L; Jao, PK; Yang, YH				Lin, Yuan-Pin; Jao, Ping-Keng; Yang, Yi-Hsuan			Improving Cross-Day EEG-Based Emotion Classification Using Robust Principal Component Analysis	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						inter-day EEG variability; emotion classification; affective brain-computer interface; EEG oscillation; robust principal component analysis	RECOGNITION; FUSION; STATE; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS	Constructing a robust emotion-aware analytical framework using non-invasively recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has gained intensive attentions nowadays. However, as deploying a laboratory-oriented proof-of-concept study toward real-world applications, researchers are now facing an ecological challenge that the EEG patterns recorded in real life substantially change across days (i.e., day-to-day variability), arguably making the pre-defined predictive model vulnerable to the given EEG signals of a separate day. The present work addressed how to mitigate the inter-day EEG variability of emotional responses with an attempt to facilitate cross-day emotion classification, which was less concerned in the literature. This study proposed a robust principal component analysis (RPCA)-based signal filtering strategy and validated its neurophysiological validity and machine-learning practicability on a binary emotion classification task (happiness vs. sadness) using a five-day EEG dataset of 12 subjects when participated in a music-listening task. The empirical results showed that the RPCA-decomposed sparse signals (RPCA-S) enabled filtering off the background EEG activity that contributed more to the inter-day variability, and predominately captured the EEG oscillations of emotional responses that behaved relatively consistent along days. Through applying a realistic add-day-in classification validation scheme, the RPCA-S progressively exploited more informative features (from 12.67 +/- 5.99 to 20.83 +/- 7.18) and improved the cross-day binary emotion-classification accuracy (from 58.31 +/- 12.33% to 64.03 +/- 8.40%) as trained the EEG signals from one to four recording days and tested against one unseen subsequent day. The original EEG features (prior to RPCA processing) neither achieved the cross-day classification (the accuracy was around chance level) nor replicated the encouraging improvement due to the inter -day EEG variability. This result demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method and may shed some light on developing a realistic emotion classification analytical framework alleviating day-to-day variability.

Along with the advent of EEG-based brain imaging technique, objective assessment of scent preference is of high interest in a variety of application domains. In this work we explore the EEG-based scent preference identification method. We first designed an effective and accurate data collection procedure. We proposed a machine learning algorithm, Spatial Temporal Subspace Optimization (STSO), for the discriminative subspace learning and classification modeling. A filter hank contains multiple hand-pass filters is used to obtain EEG components from specific frequency ranges. Spatial subspace is constructed by exploring discriminative spatial components to enhance the spatial resolution of the EEG. Through the experiment, we confirm that brain signal can he identified in association with responses to pleasant and unpleasant odors. and there is a temporal pattern of such response because the temporal subspace optimization does improve the prediction result. However, event-related potentials were not present in our EEG data, and we have a discussion on the possible causes and implications. Our preliminary result shows that scent can be identified with moderate accuracy.

In this paper, we intend to classify motor imagery EEG signals by exploiting the fact that the space of SPD matrices endowed with Riemannian distance is a high-dimensional Riemannian manifold. To alleviate the overfitting and heavy computation problems associated with conventional classification methods on high-dimensional manifold, we propose a framework for intrinsic sub-manifold learning from a high-dimensional Riemannian manifold. Considering a special case of SPD space, a simple yet efficient bilinear sub-manifold learning (BSML) algorithm is derived to learn the intrinsic sub-manifold by identifying a bilinear mapping that maximizes the preservation of the local geometry and global structure of the original manifold. Two BSML-based classification algorithms are further proposed to classify the data on a learned intrinsic sub-manifold. Experimental evaluation of the classification of EEG revealed that the BSML method extracts the intrinsic sub-manifold approximately 5x faster and with higher classification accuracy compared with competing algorithms. The BSML also exhibited strong robustness against a small training dataset, which often occurs in BCI studies.

Behavioral state classification in epileptic brain using intracranial electrophysiology	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						intracranial EEG; behavioral states; sleep staging; machine learning; classification	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; LONG-TERM; SLEEP; EEG; STIMULATION; RECORDINGS; PREDICTION; SPINDLES; INSIGHTS; CORTEX	Objective. Automated behavioral state classification can benefit next generation implantable epilepsy devices. In this study we explored the feasibility of automated awake (AW) and slow wave sleep (SWS) classification using wide bandwidth intracranial EEG (iEEG) in patients undergoing evaluation for epilepsy surgery. Approach. Data from seven patients (age $34\pm 12$ , 4 women) who underwent intracranial depth electrode implantation for iEEG monitoring were included. Spectral power features (0.1600 Hz) spanning several frequency bands from a single electrode were used to train and test a support vector machine classifier. Main results. Classification accuracy of 97.8 +/- 0.3% (normal tissue) and 89.4 +/- 0.8% (epileptic tissue) across seven subjects using multiple spectral power features from a single electrode was achieved. Spectral power features from electrodes placed in normal temporal neocortex were found to be more useful (accuracy 90.8 +/- 0.8%) for sleep-wake state classification than electrodes located in normal hippocampus (87.1 +/- 1.6%). Spectral power in high frequency band features (Ripple (80250 Hz), Fast Ripple (250600 Hz)) showed comparable performance for AW and SWS classification as the best performing Berger bands (Alpha, Beta, low Gamma) with accuracy ?90% using a single electrode contact and single spectral feature. Significance. Automated classification of wake and SWS should prove useful for future implantable epilepsy devices with limited computational power, memory, and number of electrodes. Applications include quantifying patient sleep patterns and behavioral state dependent detection, prediction, and electrical stimulation therapies.

Considering that emotion changes over time, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is adopted with its capacity of capturing time dependency. Our experimental results indicate that the neural patterns of different emotions have specific key brain areas for males and females, with females showing right lateralization and males being more left lateralized. Accordingly, two non-overlapping brain regions are selected for two genders. The classification accuracy for females (79.14%) using the right lateralized region is significantly higher than that for males (67.61%), and the left lateralized area educes a significantly higher classification accuracy for males (82.54%) than females (73.51%), especially for happy and sad emotions.

Hence, robust and objective methods are needed to automate the screening of AUD patients. In this paper, a machine learning method is proposed that utilized resting-state electroencephalography (EEG)-derived features as input data to classify the AUD patients and healthy controls and to perform automatic screening of AUD patients. In this context, the EEG data were recorded during 5 min of eyes closed and 5 min of eyes open conditions. For this purpose, 30 AUD patients and 15 aged-matched healthy controls were recruited. After preprocessing the EEG data, EEG features such as inter-hemispheric coherences and spectral power for EEG delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands were computed involving 19 scalp locations. The selection of most discriminant features was performed with a rank-based feature selection method assigning a weight value to each feature according to a criterion, i.e., receiver operating characteristics curve. For example, a feature with large weight was considered more relevant to the target labels than a feature with less weight. Therefore, a reduced set of most discriminant features was identified and further be utilized during classification of AUD patients and healthy controls. As results, the inter-hemispheric coherences between the brain regions were found significantly different between the study groups and provided high classification efficiency (Accuracy = 80.8, sensitivity = 82.5, and specificity = 80, F-Measure = 0.78). In addition, the power computed in different EEG bands were found significant and provided an overall classification efficiency as (Accuracy = 86.6, sensitivity = 95, specificity = 82.5, and F-Measure = 0.88). Further, the integration of these EEG feature resulted into even higher results (Accuracy = 89.3 %, sensitivity = 88.5 %, specificity = 91 %, and F-Measure = 0.90). Based on the results, it is concluded that the EEG data (integration of the theta, beta, and gamma power and inter-hemispheric coherence) could be utilized as objective markers to screen the AUD patients and healthy controls.

A New Generation of Brain-Computer Interfaces Driven by Discovery of Latent EEG-fMRI Linkages Using Tensor Decomposition	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-computer interface; EEG; functional MRI; simultaneous EEG/fMRI; tensor decomposition	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; REAL-TIME FMRI; EVENT-RELATED FMRI; FUNCTIONAL MRI; COMBINING FMRI; BOLD SIGNAL; RESPONSES; STATE; COMMUNICATION; TASK	A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a setup permitting the control of external devices by decoding brain activity. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been extensively used for decoding brain activity since it is non-invasive, cheap, portable, and has high temporal resolution to allow real-time operation. Due to its poor spatial specificity, BCIs based on EEG can require extensive training and multiple trials to decode brain activity (consequently slowing down the operation of the BCI). On the other hand, BCIs based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are more accurate owing to its superior spatial resolution and sensitivity to underlying neuronal processes which are functionally localized. However, due to its relatively low temporal resolution, high cost, and lack of portability, fMRI is unlikely to be used for routine BCI. We propose a new approach for transferring the capabilities of fMRI to EEG, which includes simultaneous EEG/fMRI sessions for finding a mapping from EEG to fMRI, followed by a BCI run from only EEG data, but driven by fMRI-like features obtained from the mapping identified previously. Our novel data-driven method is likely to discover latent linkages between electrical and hemodynamic signatures of neural activity hitherto unexplored using model-driven methods, and is likely to serve as a template for a novel multi-modal strategy wherein cross-modal EEG-fMRI interactions are exploited for the operation of a unimodal EEG system, leading to a new generation of EEG-based BCIs.

Composite kernel support vector machine based performance enhancement of brain computer interface in conjunction with spatial filter	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Brain computer interface; Composite kernels; Common spatial patterns; Recursive feature elimination; Support vector machine; Motor imagery	MOTOR IMAGERY; EEG CLASSIFICATION; CHANNEL SELECTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; BCI; EVOLUTIONARY; PATTERN	For Motor imagery Brain Computer interface, a large number of electrodes are placed on the scalp to acquire EEG signals. However, the available number of samples from a subject's EEG is very less. In such a situation, learning models which use spatial features obtained using common spatial pattern (CSP) method suffer from overfitting and leads to degradation in performance. In this paper, we propose a novel three phase method CKSCSP which automatically determines a minimal set of relevant electrodes along with their spatial location to achieve enhanced performance to distinguish motor imagery tasks for a given subject. In the first phase, electrodes placed on brain scalp are divided among five major regions (lobes) viz, frontal, central, temporal, parietal and occipital based on anatomy of brain. In the second phase, stationary-CSP is used to extract features from each region separately. Stationary-CSP will handle the non-stationarity of EEG. In the third phase, recursive feature elimination in conjunction with composite kernel support vector machine is used to rank brain regions according to their relevance to distinguish two motor-imagery tasks. Experimental results on publically available datasets demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method in comparison to CSP and stationary CSP. Also, Friedman statistical test demonstrates that the proposed method CKSCSP (mu not equal 0) outperforms existing methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Support vector machines to detect physiological patterns for EEG and EMG-based human-computer interaction: a review	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						support vector machines; human-computer interaction; EEG; EMG; brain-computer interface	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; USER-CENTERED DESIGN; MOTOR-IMAGERY; SURFACE EMG; REAL-TIME; FEATURE-SELECTION; SIGNAL CLASSIFICATION; GESTURE RECOGNITION; INTERFACE SYSTEMS	Support vector machines (SVMs) are widely used classifiers for detecting physiological patterns in human-computer interaction (HCI). Their success is due to their versatility, robustness and large availability of free dedicated toolboxes. Frequently in the literature, insufficient details about the SVM implementation and/or parameters selection are reported, making it impossible to reproduce study analysis and results. In order to perform an optimized classification and report a proper description of the results, it is necessary to have a comprehensive critical overview of the applications of SVM. The aim of this paper is to provide a review of the usage of SVM in the determination of brain and muscle patterns for HCI, by focusing on electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) techniques. In particular, an overview of the basic principles of SVM theory is outlined, together with a description of several relevant literature implementations. Furthermore, details concerning reviewed papers are listed in tables and statistics of SVM use in the literature are presented. Suitability of SVM for HCI is discussed and critical comparisons with other classifiers are reported.	[Quitadamo, L.

Methods: Adult comatose cardiac arrest survivors, who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for post-resuscitation care including TTM, were enrolled. Within 72 h post-return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), conventional EEG was conducted for 30 min. The SEDline system data were recorded with a video camera simultaneously with conventional EEG. Data retrieved from conventional EEG were interpreted by a neurologist and data from the SEDline system were interpreted by three emergency physicians blinded to the conventional EEG data. Then, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of the SEDline system to detect epileptiform discharges were calculated. Results: Thirty-nine patients were enrolled in this study. Epileptiform discharges were confirmed in 6 patients (15.4%) who had the same patterns of generalized periodic epileptiform discharges in both conventional EEG and the concurrent SEDline system. The SEDline system showed 100.0% (95% confidence interval (CI), 54.1-100.0%) of sensitivity, 100.0% (95% CI, 89.4-100.0%) of specificity, 100.0% (95% CI, 54.1-100.0%) of PPV, and 100.0% (95% CI, 89.4-100.0%) of NPV. The overall classification accuracy of the SEDline system to detect epileptiform discharges was 100.0%. Conclusion: The SEDline system detected epileptiform discharges accurately in comatose cardiac arrest survivors during post-resuscitation care. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this study, we attempt to classify emotional arousal using physiological signals collected across three stimulus types - music, videos, and games. Subjects were exposed to relaxing and exciting music and videos and then asked to play Tetris and Minesweeper. Data from GSR, ECG, EOG, EEG, and PPG signals were analyzed using machine learning algorithms. We were able to successfully detect emotion arousal over a set of contiguous multimedia activities. Furthermore, we found that the patterns of physiological response to each multimedia stimuli are varying enough, that we can guess the stimulus type just by looking at the biosignals.

Three entropies (approximate entropy, sample entropy, permutation entropy) are extracted as features to prepare for classifying. Then extreme learning machine is utilized to realize feature classification.

Both factors are in principle addressable with large data sets that enable robust calibration. However, the impact of sample size remains uncertain. The objectives are to investigate the extent to which machine learning methods can approximate the performance of human scorers when supplied with sufficient training cases and to investigate how staging performance depends on the number of training patients, contextual information, model complexity, and imbalance between sleep stage proportions. Methods: A total of 102 features were extracted from six electroencephalography (EEG) channels in routine polysomnography. Two thousand nights were partitioned into equal (n = 1000) training and testing sets for validation. We used epoch-by-epoch Cohen's kappa statistics to measure the agreement between classifier output and human scorer according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine scoring criteria. Results: Epoch-by-epoch Cohen's kappa improved with increasing training EEG recordings until saturation occurred (n = similar to 300). The kappa value was further improved by accounting for contextual (temporal) information, increasing model complexity, and adjusting the model training procedure to account for the imbalance of stage proportions. The final kappa on the testing set was 0.68. Testing on more EEG recordings leads to kappa estimates with lower variance. Conclusion: Training with a large data set enables automated sleep staging that compares favorably with human scorers. Because testing was performed on a large and heterogeneous data set, the performance estimate has low variance and is likely to generalize broadly.

Methods: We train, test, analyze, and compare various machine learning classification approaches optimized in terms of the correct classification rate (CCR), the degenerated Youden's index (DYI) and the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). CAD system comprises five stages: electroencephalography (EEG) preprocessing, feature extraction, seven electrode groupings, discriminant feature selection, and binary classification. Results: With two optimal combinations of electrode grouping, filtering, feature selection algorithm, and classification machine, we get either a mean CCR= 93.42%, specificity = 0.9673, sensitivity = 0.8727, DYI= 0.9188, and AUC = 0.9567 (total-15 Hz-J5- MLP), or a mean CCR = 92.23%, specificity = 0.9499, sensitivity = 0.8838, DYI = 0.9162, and AUC = 0.9807 (right hemisphere-35 Hz-J5-SVM), which to our knowledge are higher than those available to date. Conclusions: We have verified that a more restrictive low-pass filtering achieves higher CCR as compared to others at higher frequencies in the P3b wave. In addition, results validate previous hypothesis about the importance of the parietal-temporal region, associated with memory processing, allowing us to identify powerful {feature, electrode} pairs in the diagnosis of schizophrenia, achieving higher CCR and AUC in classification of both right and left Hemispheres, and parietal-temporal EEG signals, like, for instance, the {PSE, P4} pair (J5 and mutual information feature selection). Significance: Diagnosis of schizophrenia is made thoroughly by psychiatrists but as any human-based decision that has a subjective component. This CAD system provides the human expert with an objective complimentary measure to help him in diagnosing schizophrenia.

Prediction of EMG envelopes of multiple terrains over-ground walking from EEG signals using an Unscented Kalman Filter	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 05-08, 2017	Banff, CANADA	IEEE		Over ground walking, Electromyography (EMG); Electroencephalography (EEG); Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)	TREADMILL WALKING; LIMB; RECOGNITION	Advanced powered lower-limb prosthetic devices require an intuitive and flexible user control interface to work in a dynamic environment. This study investigated the feasibility of inferring muscle activation patterns (electromyography, EMG, envelope) from non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Six healthy individuals participated in this study; the subjects were instructed to walk at a comfortable speed across various terrains (e.g. level-ground, up/down slope, up/down stair walking). An unscented kalman filter (UKF) was used to predict the EMG envelope from fluctuations in the amplitude of slow cortical potentials of EEG in the delta band (0.1 - 3 Hz). The highest decoding accuracy obtained was an r-value (Pearson's correlation r-value) of 0.57 in the medial gastrocnemius of a single subject. In the same subject, the mean r-value across all the muscle groups exceeded 0.4. The mean accuracy across all subjects and muscle group corresponded to an r-value of 0.236. As for the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), 79.3% of the obtained results were more than 0 dB with mean performance SNR of 0.8 (max: 2.8 to min: -1.7). The highest accuracy was obtained using a lag of 50ms with a window length (tap) of 500ms. In conclusion, this is the first study to show offline continuous decoding of the EMG envelope during over-ground walking on multiple terrains. The results show the feasibility of such neural decoding. This method could be coupled with EMG-based terrain prediction techniques to further improve the neural control interface with powered lower-limb prostheses.

The discrimination is based on the extraction of suitable features from the time-frequency representation of the EEG signals through continuous wavelet transform (CWT). An average measure of complexity of the EEG signal obtained by permutation entropy (PE) is also included. The dimensionality of the feature space is reduced through a multilayer processing system based on the recently emerged deep learning (DL) concept. The DL processor includes a stacked auto-encoder, trained by unsupervised learning techniques, and a classifier whose parameters are determined in a supervised way by associating the known category labels to the reduced vector of high-level features generated by the previous processing blocks. The supervised learning step is carried out by using either support vector machines (SVM) or multilayer neural networks (MLP-NN). A subset of EEG from patients suffering from Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and healthy controls (HC) is considered for differentiating CJD patients. When fine-tuning the parameters of the global processing system by a supervised learning procedure, the proposed system is able to achieve an average accuracy of 89%, an average sensitivity of 92%, and an average specificity of 89% in differentiating CJD from RPD. Similar results are obtained for CJD versus AD and CJD versus HC.

Learning good spatio-temporal features from large patient data is a challenging task, especially when there are missing observations. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal autoencoder (STAE), an unsupervised deep learning scheme, to learn features from large-scale and high-dimensional patient data with missing observations. Through both spatial and temporal encoding, STAE is able to automatically identify patterns and dependencies in the patient data, even with missing values, and learn a compact representation of each patient for better classification. Publicly available electroencephalogram (EEG) data are extracted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to test and support our findings. Through simulations, we compare STAE with several baseline feature selection methods and demonstrate its effectiveness in the presence of missing data.

The effectiveness of the brain computer interface is based on the classification accuracy of single trial brain signals. The common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is believed to be an effective algorithm for the classification of single trial brain signals. As the amplitude feature for spatial projection applied by this algorithm is based on a broad frequency bandpass filter (mainly 5-30 Hz) in which the frequency band is often selected by experience, the CSP is sensitive to noise and the influence of other irrelevant information in the selected broad frequency band. In this paper, to improve the CSP, a novel relevant feature integration and extraction algorithm is proposed. Before projecting, we integrated the motor relevant information to suppress the interference of noise and irrelevant information, as well as to improve the spatial difference for projection. The algorithm was evaluated with public datasets. It showed significantly better classification performance with single trial electroencephalography (EEG) data, increasing by 6.8% compared with the CSP.

In a reach-and-touch task, we explored the differences in the movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) between goal-directed and non-goal-directed movements. We evaluated if the detection of movement intention was influenced by the goal-directedness of the movement. In a single-trial classification procedure we found that classification accuracies are enhanced if there is a goal-directed movement in mind. Furthermore, by using the classifier patterns and estimating the corresponding brain sources, we show the importance of motor areas and the additional involvement of the posterior parietal lobule in the discrimination between goal-directed movements and non-goal-directed movements. We discuss next the potential contribution of our results on goal-directed movements to a more reliable brain-computer interface (BCI) control that facilitates recovery in spinal-cord injured or stroke end-users.

Furthermore, network approaches have emerged as a promising direction for studying the complex organization of the brain, enabling easier interpretation of various mental states. In this paper, using two mental tasks (N-back and mental arithmetic), we present a framework for cross-as well as within-task workload discrimination by utilizing multi-band electroencephalography (EEG) cortical brain connectivity. In detail, we constructed functional networks in EEG source space in different frequency bands and considering the individual functional connections as classification features, we identified salient feature subsets based on a sequential feature selection algorithm. These connectivity subsets were able to provide accuracy of 87% for cross-task, 88% for N-back task, and 86% for mental arithmetic task. In conclusion, our method achieved to detect a small number of discriminative interactions among brain areas, leading to high accuracy in both within-task and cross-task classifications. In addition, the identified functional connectivity features, the majority of which were detected in frontal areas in theta and beta frequency bands, helped delineate the shared as well as the distinct neural mechanisms of the two mental tasks.

CSP is an algorithm that maximize the variance of one class and minimize the variance of other class simultaneously to discriminate two classes of multichannel EEG signals for classification purpose. However, CSP assumes that the signals on all EEG channels are functionally interconnected even though only spurious relationship due to artefact or noise. This study will conduct several investigations on the classification performance by imposing channels selection based on calculated energy on brain excitation calculation. The improvement strategy calculates the energy in each channel and the selection will be based on the energy level. In order to validate the performance of the proposed technique, three motor imagery data sets are employed including RIKEN, BCI Competition III Data set IV a, and BCI Competition IV Data set I. In general, all these datasets are tested on the existing CSP and its variants with and without the proposed channel selection strategy. The existing techniques such as CSP, R-CSP (regularized CSP), and A-CSP (analytic CSP) are included in this study. The results show that the selected channels with higher energy can improve the CSP, R-CSP and A-CSP classification performance. Also, smaller size of selected channels in the area of motor cortex offers better performance with almost 75% channel reduction and 8% increase in accuracy.

Forecasting epileptic seizures remains a challenging problem, but machine learning methods using intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) measures have shown promise. A machine-learning-based pipeline was developed to process iEEG recordings and generate seizure warnings. Results support the ability to forecast seizures at rates greater than a Poisson random predictor for all feature sets and machine learning algorithms tested. In addition, subject-specific neurophysiological changes in multiple features are reported preceding lead seizures, providing evidence supporting the existence of a distinct and identifiable preictal state.

The focus of current study is to explore EEG time-domain features that represent neural correlates of hand movement execution speed. In this paper, we propose autocorrelation analysis of EEG and features derived from it that utilizes difference in execution time of fast v/s slow tasks. The variation in decay constant of autocorrelation of EEG over execution time is studied, and its application as a potential feature to discriminate movement speed is explored. The proposed analysis method has been validated on EEG data recorded from 7 subjects performing right hand movement at two different speeds. An average classification accuracy of 75.71% and 85.16% is obtained, using features derived from significant time segments in the data.	[Robinson, Neethu; Vinod, A.

It is suggested that phase-locked responses to acoustic features show consistent patterns across subjects. Previous magnetoencephalographic (MEG) experiment showed that subject-dependent template matching classification by theta phase patterns could discriminate three English spoken sentences. In this paper, we adopt electroencephalography (EEG) to the spoken sentence discrimination on Japanese language. and we investigate the performances in various different settings by using: (1) template matching and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers; (2) subject dependent and independent models; (3) multiple frequency bands including theta, alpha, beta, low gamma. and the combination of all frequency bands. The performances in almost settings were higher than the chance level. While performances of SVM and template matching did not differ, the performance with combination of multiple frequency bands outperformed the one that trained only on single frequency bands. Best accuracies in subject dependent and independent models achieved 55.2% by SVM on the combination of all frequency bands and 44.0% by template matching on the combination of all frequency bands, respectively.

Emotions in neurofinance study have been measured by sentiments analysis but not measured by biosignal. Behavioural finance affects investors' performance which is also influenced by their emotional or cognitive errors in taking the investment decisions. This paper focused on the EEG-based emotion recognition recorded while making decisions that can also be helpful in investment's returns. The features were extracted by using Mel Frequency Cepstal Coefficient (MFCC) and the classification used the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier. The EEG-based emotion recognition was tested by using the dimensional models of emotions, 12-PAC and rSASM, and also the Radboud Faces Database (RaFD). Results show that investment decisions can be driven by the emotions of the investor and some measurement should be taken before they lose their money.

Cortical activity predicts good variation in human motor output	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						EEG; Motor cortex; Goal-equivalent variability; Finger	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MUSCLE SYNERGIES; FORCE PRODUCTION; SPATIAL FILTERS; VARIABILITY; CONNECTIVITY; NOISE; TASK; CLASSIFICATION; COORDINATION	Human movement patterns have been shown to be particularly variable if many combinations of activity in different muscles all achieve the same task goal (i.e., are goal-equivalent). The nervous system appears to automatically vary its output among goal-equivalent combinations of muscle activity to minimize muscle fatigue or distribute tissue loading, but the neural mechanism of this "good" variation is unknown. Here we use a bimanual finger task, electroencephalography (EEG), and machine learning to determine if cortical signals can predict goal-equivalent variation in finger force output. 18 healthy participants applied left and right index finger forces to repeatedly perform a task that involved matching a total (sum of right and left) finger force. As in previous studies, we observed significantly more variability in goal-equivalent muscle activity across task repetitions compared to variability in muscle activity that would not achieve the goal: participants achieved the task in some repetitions with more right finger force and less left finger force (right > left) and in other repetitions with less right finger force and more left finger force (left > right). We found that EEG signals from the 500 milliseconds (ms) prior to each task repetition could make a significant prediction of which repetitions would have right > left and which would have left > right. We also found that cortical maps of sites contributing to the prediction contain both motor and pre-motor representation in the appropriate hemisphere. Thus, goal-equivalent variation in motor output may be implemented at a cortical level.

We propose to count the number of zero-crossing (ZC) points on Poincare surface as a feature when the time series of interest is embedded into the reconstructed state space. The experiments show that Poincare surface can act as a platform to observe the chaotic patterns of EEG signals and the ZC feature on Poincare surface is a promising pattern descriptor to discriminate different categories of EEG signals. When used alone for EEG classification, the ZC feature achieves 100%, 99.27%, and 94.68% accuracy in 2-class, 3-class, and 5-class classification on a widely used benchmark.

Early detection is the solitary measure to control seizure. Electroencephalography (EEG)is the only confirmatory test for seizure. However, epileptic research still depends on studies based on animal models. In this research, our main objective is to study the significance of low frequency brainwaves (which is dominant during sleep) in the prognosis of seizure from WAG/Rij rat data. Wavelet based decomposition coefficients and power spectral density (PSD) are selected as features to take care of non-stationary nature of brain waves. A comparative study of classifiers' performance is formulated between low frequency wave range (0.5-13 Hz) and the total frequency range (0.5-40 Hz) where RBF-SVM provides the maximum classification accuracy. The average classification accuracy of RBF-SVM for low frequency wave range is found to be 92.50%, which lies within a range of <2%, compared to the total frequency wave range as 94.03% QDA has the second highest classification accuracy. Both RBF-SVM and QDA perform better for total frequency wave range compared to low frequency wave range. However, LSVM and LDA produce a different pattern - higher classification accuracies for low frequency wave range EEG data. The novelty of this paper lies to the fact that selection of low frequency brain wave is more significant in the prognosis of frontal lobe epilepsy that is not only useful detecting spikes during sleep but also removes environmental and physiological artifacts with higher frequencies.

These responses, referred to as frequency-following responses (FFRs), have been widely utilized to index typical and atypical representation of speech signals in the auditory system. One of the major limitations in FFR is the low signal-to-noise ratio at the level of single trials. For this reason, the analysis relies on averaging across thousands of trials. The ability to examine the quality of single-trial FFRs will allow investigation of trial-by-trial dynamics of the FFR, which has been impossible due to the averaging approach. Methods: In a novel, data-driven approach, we used machine learning principles to decode information related to the speech signal from single trial FFRs. FFRs were collected from participants while they listened to two vowels produced by two speakers. Scalp-recorded electrophysiological responses were projected onto a low-dimensional spectral feature space independently derived from the same two vowels produced by 40 speakers, which were not presented to the participants. A novel supervised machine learning classifier was trained to discriminate vowel tokens on a subset of FFRs from each participant, and tested on the remaining subset. Results: We demonstrate reliable decoding of speech signals at the level of single-trials by decomposing the raw FFR based on information-bearing spectral features in the speech signal that were independently derived. Conclusions: Taken together, the ability to extract interpretable features at the level of single-trials in a data-driven manner offers unchartered possibilities in the noninvasive assessment of human auditory function.

The main EEG feature of GGE is bilateral, synchronous, symmetric, and generalized spike wave complex. Other classic EEG abnormalities are polyspikes, epileptiform K-complexes and sleep spindles, polyspike-wave discharges, occipital intermittent rhythmic delta activity, eye-closure sensitivity, fixation-off sensitivity, and photoparoxysmal response. However, admixed with typical changes, atypical epileptiform discharges are also commonly seen in GGE. There are circadian variations of generalized epileptiform discharges. Sleep, sleep deprivation, hyperventilation, intermittent photic stimulation, eye closure, and fixation-off are often used as activation techniques to increase the diagnostic yield of EEG recordings. Reflex seizure related EEG abnormalities can be elicited by the use of triggers such as cognitive tasks and pattern stimulation during the EEG recording in selected patients. Distinct electrographic abnormalities to help classification can be identified among different electroclinical syndromes.

Four basic emotions are considered, namely happy, sad, fearful and neutral. The Bimodal Deep AutoEncoder (BDAE) and the fuzzy-integral-based method are applied to fuse EEG and eye movement data. Our experimental results indicate that gender differences do exist in neural patterns for emotion recognition; eye movement data is not as good as EEG data for examining gender differences in emotion recognition; the activation of the brains for females is generally lower than that for males in most bands and brain areas especially for fearful emotions. According to the confusion matrix, we observe that the fearful emotion is more diverse among women compared with men, and men behave more diversely on the sad emotion compared with women. Additionally, individual differences in fear are more pronounced than other three emotions for females.

It is very difficult to understand these non-linear and non-stationary electrical flows through naked eye in the time domain. In specific, epilepsy seizures occur irregularly and un-predictively while recording EEG signal. Therefore, it demands a semi-automatic tool in the framework of machine learning to understand these signals in general and to predict epilepsy seizure in specific. With this motivation, for wide and in-depth understanding of the EEG signal to detect epileptic seizure, this paper focus on the study of EEG signal through machine learning approaches. Neural networks and support vector machines (SVM) basically two fundamental components of machine learning techniques are the primary focus of this paper for classification of EEG signals to label epilepsy patients. The neural networks like multi-layer perceptron, probabilistic neural network, radial basis function neural networks, and recurrent neural networks are taken into consideration for empirical analysis on EEG signal to detect epilepsy seizure. Furthermore, for multi-layer neural networks different propagation training algorithms have been studied such as back-propagation, resilient-propagation, and quick-propagation. For SVM, several kernel methods were studied such as linear, polynomial, and RBF during empirical analysis. Finally, the study confirms with the present setting that, in all cases recurrent neural network performs poorly for the prepared epilepsy data. However, SVM and probabilistic neural networks are quite effective and competitive. Hence to strengthen the poorly performing classifier, this work makes an extension over individual learners by ensembling classifier models based on weighted majority voting.

Since, BCIs using motor imagery (MI) rhythms provides high degree of freedom, it is been used for many real-time applications, especially for locked-in people. The available BCIs using MI-based EEG signals usually makes use of spatial filtering and powerful classification methods to attain better accuracy and performance. Inter-subject variability and speed of the classifier is still a issue in MI-based BCIs. To address the aforementioned issues, in this work, we propose a new classification method, spatial filtering based sparsity (SFS) approach for MI-based BCIs. The proposed method makes use of common spatial pattern (CSP) to spatially filter the MI signals. Then frequency bandpower and wavelet features from the spatially filtered signals are used to bulid two different over-complete dictionary matrix. This dictionary matrix helps to overcome the issue of inter-subject variability. Later, sparse representation based classification is carried out to classify the two-class MI signals. We analysed the performance of the proposed approach using publicly available MI dataset IVa from BCI competition III. The proposed SFS method provides better classification accuracy and runtime than the well-known support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) classification methods. This SFS method can be further used to develop a real-time application for people with special needs.	[Sreeja, S.

Our method involves detection of key points at multiple scales in EEG signals using a pyramid of difference of Gaussian filtered signals. Local binary patterns (LBPs) are computed at these key points and the histogram of these patterns are considered as the feature set, which is fed to the support vector machine (SVM) for the classification of EEG signals. The proposed methodology has been investigated for the four well-known classification problems namely, 1) normal and epileptic seizure, 2) epileptic seizure and seizure free, 3) normal, epileptic seizure, and seizure free, and 4) epileptic seizure and nonseizure EEG signals using publically available university of Bonn EEG database. Our experimental results in terms of classification accuracies have been compared with existing methods for the classification of the aforementioned problems. Further, performance evaluation on another EEG dataset shows that our approach is effective for classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals. The proposed methodology based on the LBP computed at key points is simple and easy to implement for real-time epileptic seizure detection.

Finding and extracting discriminative biological markers, which are correlated to healthy brain pattern and alcoholic brain pattern, helps us to utilize automatic methods for detecting and classifying alcoholism. Many brain disorders could be detected by analysing the Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. In this paper, for extracting the required markers we analyse the EEG signals for two groups of alcoholic and control subjects. Then by applying wavelet transform, band-limited EEG signals are decomposed into five frequency sub-bands. Also, the principle component analysis (PCA) is employed to choose the most information carrying channels. By examining various features from different frequency sub-bands, six discriminative features for classification are selected. From functional brain network perspective, the lower synchronization in Beta frequency sub-band and loss of lateralization in Alpha frequency sub-band in alcoholic subjects are observed. Also from signal processing perspective we found that alcoholic subjects have lower values of fractal dimension, energy and entropy compared to control ones. Five different classifiers are used to classify these groups of alcoholic and control subjects that show very high accuracies (more than 90%). However, by comparing the performance of different classifiers, SVM, random forest and gradient boosting show the best performances with accuracies near 100%. Our study shows that fractal dimension, entropy and energy of channel C1 in Alpha frequency sub-band are the more important features for classification.

As evidence of these virtues, numerous candidate biomarkers of different psychiatric and neurological diseases have been advanced. Presumably, we would only need to apply powerful machine-learning methods to validate these ideas and provide novel clinical tools. Yet, the reality of this advancement is more complex: the scale of data required for robust and reliable identification of a clinical biomarker transcends the ability of any single laboratory. To surmount this logistical hurdle, collective action and transparent methods are required. Here we introduce the Patient Repository of EEG Data + Computational Tools (PRED + CT: predictsite.com). The ultimate goal of this project is to host a multitude of available tasks, patient datasets, and analytic tools, facilitating large-scale data mining. We hope that successful completion of this aim will lead to the development of novel EEG biomarkers for differentiating populations of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

J	Cichy, RM; Teng, S				Cichy, Radoslaw Martin; Teng, Santani			Resolving the neural dynamics of visual and auditory scene processing in the human brain: a methodological approach	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						scene perception; multivariate pattern classification; deep neural networks; representational similarity analysis	EEG-FMRI INTEGRATION; OBJECT RECOGNITION; REPRESENTATIONS; PATTERNS; MODELS; CORTEX; NETWORKS; FUSION; SPACE	In natural environments, visual and auditory stimulation elicit responses across a large set of brain regions in a fraction of a second, yielding representations of the multimodal scene and its properties. The rapid and complex neural dynamics underlying visual and auditory information processing pose major challenges to human cognitive neuroscience. Brain signals measured non-invasively are inherently noisy, the format of neural representations is unknown, and transformations between representations are complex and often nonlinear. Further, no single non-invasive brain measurement technique provides a spatio-temporally integrated view. In this opinion piece, we argue that progress can be made by a concerted effort based on three pillars of recent methodological development: (i) sensitive analysis techniques such as decoding and cross-classification, (ii) complex computational modelling using models such as deep neural networks, and (iii) integration across imaging methods (magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging) andmodels, e.g. using representational similarity analysis. We showcase two recent efforts that have been undertaken in this spirit and provide novel results about visual and auditory scene analysis. Finally, we discuss the limits of this perspective and sketch a concrete roadmap for future research. This article is part of the themed issue 'Auditory and visual scene analysis'.

The paradigm relies on recordings of the listener's brain activity, e.g., from electroencephalography (EEG). To perform AAD, decoded EEG signals are typically correlated with the temporal envelopes of the speech signals of the separate speakers. In this paper, we study how the inclusion of various degrees of auditory modelling in this speech envelope extraction process affects the AAD performance, where the best performance is found for an auditory-inspired linear filter bank followed by power law compression. These two modelling stages are computationally cheap, which is important for implementation in wearable devices, such as future neuro-steered auditory prostheses. We also introduce a more natural way to combine recordings (over trials and subjects) to train the decoder, which reduces the dependence of the algorithm on regularization parameters. Finally, we investigate the simultaneous design of the EEG decoder and the audio subband envelope recombination weights vector using either a norm-constrained least squares or a canonical correlation analysis, but conclude that this increases computational complexity without improving AAD performance.

Mental arithmetic, mental counting, word formation, and mental rotation are used as brain task to generate the commands. The brain signals are decoded simultaneously in a single window using hybrid EEG-fNIRS. We extracted the neuronal and hemodynamic features in 0 similar to 2 sec, 0 similar to 2.25 sec, and 0 similar to 2.5 sec windows. An overlapping window of 0.25 sec is used for online/real-time analysis. Signal peak, signal mean, and signal power are computed as features for EEG. Signal mean, signal slope, signal peak, and minimum negative value are computed as features for fNIRS. We used linear discriminant analysis to classify the features in online scenario. The generated commands are transferred to a quadcopter using Wi-Fi. The quadcopter movements are controlled by the transmitted brain commands. Our results showed that overall system accuracy for fNIRS was increased from 69% to 84 % by combining features with EEG. This enabled more stable control for the quadcopter. Therefore the result seems significant for brain-computer interface applications.	[Khan, M.

Multiclass Motor Imagery Classification Based on the Correlation of Pattern Images Generated by Spatial Filters	2017 14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, COMPUTING SCIENCE AND AUTOMATIC CONTROL (CCE)			English	Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)	OCT 20-22, 2017	Mexico City, MEXICO	Cinvestav, IEEE, Electron Devices Soc, CINVESTAV IPN, Dept Automat Control, CINVESTAV IPN, Dept Elect Engn		Brain-Computer Interface (BCI); spatial filter; pattern image; motor imagery; multiclass classification		This paper proposes a new motor imagery classification method. This method applies the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) technique that projects Electroencephalography (EEG) filtered signals into a different time-space, where an optimal variance for discrimination of different motor imagery tasks is obtained. By using the training data set, RGB pattern images of each mental task are created through the features obtained by the CSP technique. Then the normalized cross-correlation coefficients of the RGB pattern images with the images representing the mental state of the user in a segment of two seconds are computed. The mean and variance values of the correlation coefficients and the obtained CSP features are used to train six binary Support Vector Machine classifiers, which discriminate between imagined left hand, right hand and foot movements and an idle state (a state without any imagery movement). The results show an average accuracy of 83.18% with the training data set and an 81.58% with the testing data set. These results demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive compared with existing methods and may represents a successful alternative for a multi-motor imagery classification.

The main aim of the current work is to introduce an innovative algorithm for acquiring reliable discriminating features from EEG signals to improve classification performances and to reduce the time complexity. Methods: This study develops a robust feature extraction method combining the principal component analysis (PCA) and the cross-covariance technique (CCOV) for the extraction of discriminatory information from the mental states based on EEG signals in BCI applications. We apply the correlation based variable selection method with the best first search on the extracted features to identify the best feature set for characterizing the distribution of mental state signals. To verify the robustness of the proposed feature extraction method, three machine learning techniques: multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLP), least square support vector machine (LS-SVM), and logistic regression (LR) are employed on the obtained features. The proposed methods are evaluated on two publicly available datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of the proposed methods by comparing it with some recently reported algorithms. Results: The experimental results show that all three classifiers achieve high performance (above 99% overall classification accuracy) for the proposed feature set. Among these classifiers, the MLP and LSSVM methods yield the best performance for the obtained feature. The average sensitivity, specificity and classification accuracy for these two classifiers are same, which are 99.32%, 100%, and 99.66%, respectively for the BCI competition dataset IVa and 100%, 100%, and 100%, for the BCI competition dataset IVb. The results also indicate the proposed methods outperform the most recently reported methods by at least 0.25% average accuracy improvement in dataset IVa. The execution time results show that the proposed method has less time complexity after feature selection. Conclusions: The proposed feature extraction method is very effective for getting representatives information from mental states EEG signals in BCI applications and reducing the computational complexity of classifiers by reducing the number of extracted features.

Due to the severe disturbances happening in the electrical activity of the brain, the seizures occur. An epileptic seizure is simply a transient occurrence of symptoms because of excessive and abnormal neuronal firing of neurons in the brain. Due to the hypersynchronous and abnormal activity of neurons in the brain, epilepsy manifests itself in the form of seizures. The most disabling aspect and the characteristic feature of this disease are witnessed by the occurrence of seizures. It is quite difficult to identify the presence of epileptic activities in order to characterize and understand the spatio-temporal patterns. The automatic classification and detection procedure of seizures from Electroencephalography (EEG) signals is quite crucial for the localization and epileptic seizure activity classification. The seizures are typically non stationary and highly dynamic in nature so that the rhythmic activities cannot be easily interpreted. In this paper, a two level classification procedure is employed, firstly the risk of epilepsy is classified with Softmax Discriminant Classifier (SDC) and secondly it is further optimized and classified with Logistic Regression Gaussian Mixture Model (LRGMM) Classifier. Results show that a classification accuracy of about 93.38% is obtained when classified with SDC and a classification accuracy of about 97.91% is obtained with classified with LRGMM.

Specifically, one level of the detector evaluates the amount of neural synchrony present within the electroencephalography (EEG) channels by calculating the condition number (CN) of the EEG matrix. On a parallel level, the detector first enhances the EEG via CSP and then evaluates the energy contained in four EEG frequency subbands. The information is then fed into two independent and parallel classification units based on support vector machines to determine the electrographic onset of a seizure event. The decisions from the two classifiers are then coupled according to two fusion techniques to determine a global decision. Experimental results demonstrate a sensitivity of 100%, detection latency of 1:75 seconds, and a false alarm rate of 3:14 per hour for the detector based on the AND fusion technique. The OR fusion technique achieves a sensitivity of 100%, and significantly improves delay latency (0:61 seconds), yet it achieves 14:26 false alarms per hour.

Sensorimotor rhythm (SMRs) based BCIs can successfully perform control tasks; however, the traditional SMR paradigms intuitively disconnect the control and real task, making them non-ideal for complex control scenarios. In this study we design a new, intuitively connected motor imagery (MI) paradigm using hierarchical common spatial patterns (HCSP) and context information to effectively predict intended hand grasps from electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Experiments with 5 participants yielded an aggregate classification accuracy-intended grasp prediction probability-of 64.5% for 8 different hand gestures, more than 5 times the chance level.

Task-induced amplitude modulation of neural oscillations is routinely used in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for decoding subjects' intents, and underlies some of the most robust and common methods in the field, such as common spatial patterns and Riemannian geometry. While there has been some interest in phase-related features for classification, both techniques usually presuppose that the frequencies of neural oscillations remain stable across various tasks. We investigate here whether features based on task-induced modulation of the frequency of neural oscillations enable decoding of subjects' intents with an accuracy comparable to task-induced amplitude modulation. Approach. We compare cross-validated classification accuracies using the amplitude and frequency modulated features, as well as a joint feature space, across subjects in various paradigms and pre-processing conditions. We show results with a motor imagery task, a cognitive task, and also preliminary results in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as well as using common spatial patterns and Laplacian filtering. Main results. The frequency features alone do not significantly out-perform traditional amplitude modulation features, and in some cases perform significantly worse. However, across both tasks and pre-processing in healthy subjects the joint space significantly out-performs either the frequency or amplitude features alone. This result only does not hold for ALS patients, for whom the dataset is of insufficient size to draw any statistically significant conclusions. Significance. Task-induced frequency modulation is robust and straight forward to compute, and increases performance when added to standard amplitude modulation features across paradigms. This allows more information to be extracted from the EEG signal cheaply and can be used throughout the field of BCIs.

On detection of a possible change, multivariate empirical mode decomposed the last 2s of the signal into narrow-band intrinsic mode functions. Common spatial pattern is then utilised to create discriminating features for classification purpose. Logistic regression, artificial neural network, and support vector machine classifiers all could detect the eye state change with 83.4% accuracy in <2s. This algorithm provides a valuable improvement in comparison with a recent procedure that took about 20min to classify new instances with 97.3% accuracy. Application of the introduced algorithm in the real-time eye state classification is promising. Increasing the training examples could even improve the accuracy of the classification analytics.

However, there are scarce algorithms and procedures for real time classification of emotions. In this work we introduce a new approach to select the appropriate parameters in order to build up a real-time emotion recognition system. We recorded the EEG-neural activity of 5 participants while they were looking and listening to an audiovisual database composed by positive and negative emotional video clips. We tested 11 different temporal window sizes, 6 ranges of frequency bands and 5 areas of interest located mainly on prefrontal and frontal brain regions. The most accurate time window segment was selected for each participant, giving us probable positive and negative emotional characteristic patterns, in terms of the most informative frequency-location pairs. Our preliminary results provide a reliable way to establish the more appropriate parameters to develop an accurate EEG-based emotion classifier in real-time.	[Sorinas, Jennifer; Grima Murcia, M.

This adheres to the fact that neural signals vary significantly across subjects, rendering a subject calibration process necessary for the pattern recognition mechanisms of a BCI to achieve a notable performance. In the present work, we explore this phenomenon on two open datasets from mental monitoring experiments which utilized a commercial BCI device (Neurosky). This passive BCI setting with economical hardware is one of the must promising in terms of commercial appeal and hence it has more potential to be employed by multiple subjects-users. We visualize the inter subject variability problem and apply machine learning methods commonly used in the BCI literature. Subsequently we employ multi-task learning algorithms, setting each subject specific classification as a separate task. The experiments reveal that multi-task approaches achieve better accuracy with increasing number of subjects in contrast to subject-invariant approaches, while providing insights that are consistent among subjects and agree with the relevant literature.

How to extract appropriate features in EEGs, which can be applied to differentiate non-seizure EEG from seizure EEG, is considered to be crucial in the successful realization. In this work, we proposed a novel kernel-radius-based feature extraction method from the perspective of nonlinear dynamics analysis. The given EEG signal is first decomposed into different numbers of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) adaptively by using empirical mode decomposition. Then the three-dimensional phase space representation (3D-PSR) is reconstructed for each IMF according to the time delay method. At last, the kernel radius of the corresponding 3D-PSR is defined, which aims to characterize the concentration degree of all the points in 3D-PSR. With the extracted feature KRF, we employ extreme learning machine and support vector machine as the classifiers to achieve the task of the automate epileptic seizure detection. Performances of the proposed method are finally verified on the Bonn EEG database.

For complex object classification, multiple single classifiers are often used and they are concatenated into a multistage classification system. Thus, it is necessary to obtain the overal ROC curve, because the ROC curves of the individual classifiers are not useful for the overall system since it has multi-level decision thresholds. In this paper, a systematic approach was introduced for measuring the performance of multistage systems via estimating the overall ROC curve. Two new ROC models sharing the same properties of classical ROC curves were proposed, inspired by the Gaussian and logistic distributions. The models were then experimented on a recently introduced multistage system for epileptic spike classification from electroencephalogram data. Experimental results indicated that the proposed ROC models can be used for multistage classification systems.

EEG can be of great help in ADHD studies. Considering the brain as the most complicated information processing system, information theories can be applied on EEG analysis. In this study, a total of 50 children (9 girls, mean age: 10.44 +/- 0.75) with ADHD and 58 age, gender and handedness matched normal children were recruited. This study aimed to (a) characterize the critical differences between ADHD children and a control group in connectivity patterns by applying mutual information (MI) analysis and (b) examine the classification accuracy that can be achieved with EEG MI measures. Statistical and classification results revealed that that in most regions MIs of ADHD children were higher than control group asymmetrically but connections with lower MIs in right frontal and left occipital were also of great importance. Those findings may be related to underlying neuropsychological deviation of ADHD in both coupling and isolation between different brain modules. With 28 selected MI features, the classifier achieved accuracy of 85.7%. Combining with appropriate feature selection algorithm, MI might be an adequate hiomarker candidate for assisting diagnoses of children with ADHD.

The detection system relies on features extracted from multi-channel EEG data collected from pediatric patients undergoing video-EEG monitoring. Two types of EEG features are extracted from each patient's EEG data; frequency-specific energy levels in the EEG data and the amount of neural synchrony displayed between the EEG channels. Prior to energy extraction, the EEG data undergoes a signal enhancement step designed to improve the differentiation between seizure and non-seizure EEG and enhance performance of the detector. Synchronization levels are calculated by evaluating the condition number (CN) of EEG data. The features are then fused to form a single feature vector for classification by two separate machine learning algorithm, support vector machine (SVM) and a feed-forward neural network. The proposed method achieves a sensitivity of 100%, detection latency of 2.74 seconds, and a false positive rate of 2.69 per hours for SVM based detection. Neural network based detection decreases the false positive rate by 47.9% from SVM based detection. The novality of this work lies in exploiting the benefits of combining both features prior to classification and training the detector using two machine learning algorithms. It is shown that the proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art detectors in terms of sensitivity and detection latency.

During the study, 100 EEG signals from patients were used during the opened eyes and healthy epileptic seizures. Each EEG signal consisting of 4096 samples was divided into 256 samples and a total of 3200 signals were obtained. The designed pattern recognition system has been developed in 3 basic parts. In the first part, the power spectral density (PSD) estimation is performed with the periodogram and Welch methods and the frequency domain information of the EEG signals is obtained. In the second part, the feature vectors are found from the frequency domain information obtained in the periodogram and Welch PSD estimation. In the third part, healthy EEG signals from the eigenvectors obtained by using K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (K-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are distinguished from pathological EEG signals. 5-fold cross-validation method was used in evaluating the accuracy performance of the designed system. The total classification accuracy of the system was found to be 99.66% with K-NN, 99.72% with SVM for periodogram PSD estimation and 99.72% with K-NN, 99.75% with SVM for Welch PSD estimation. The results of the pattern recognition system designed in the study are promising because they are close to the work done with different approaches in the literature. The pattern recognition system designed here is not a diagnostic tool. It is foreseen that physicians may be useful in evaluating preliminary diagnosis.

State of the art decoding is based on processing of the multivariate sensor space signal, however evidence is mounting that EEG source reconstruction can assist decoding. EEG source imaging leads to high-dimensional representations and rather strong a priori information must be invoked. Recent work by Edelman et al. (2016) has demonstrated that introduction of a spatially focal source space representation can improve decoding of motor imagery. In this work we explore the generality of Edelman et al. hypothesis by considering decoding of face recognition. This task concerns the differentiation of brain responses to images of faces and scrambled faces and poses a rather difficult decoding problem at the single trial level. We implement the pipeline using spatially focused features and show that this approach is challenged and source imaging does not lead to an improved decoding. We design a distributed pipeline in which the classifier has access to brain wide features which in turn does lead to a 15% reduction in the error rate using source space features. Hence, our work presents supporting evidence for the hypothesis that source imaging improves decoding.

In terms of brain activity, we used the Frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) to assess the player approach/withdrawal behavior within a game scene. Using game scene's design goal (defined by OCC variables) and player personality traits (using Big Five questionnaire), the resulting machine learning model predicts players' motivational goal orientations in order to adapt the game. In this study, we address player's motivation in game scenes by analyzing player's profile, his situation in scene and affective physiological data.

J	Stefano, CA; Attux, R; Castellano, G				Stefano Filho, Carlos A.; Attux, Romis; Castellano, Gabriela			EEG sensorimotor rhythms' variation and functional connectivity measures during motor imagery: linear relations and classification approaches	PEERJ			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; Electroencephalography; BCI; EEG; Motor imagery; MI; Graph theory; Functional brain networks	REHABILITATION; BCI	Hands motor imagery (MI) has been reported to alter synchronization patterns amongst neurons, yielding variations in the mu and beta bands' power spectral density (PSD) of the electroencephalography (EEG) signal. These alterations have been used in the field of brain-computer interfaces (BCI); in an attempt to assign distinct MI tasks to commands of such a system. Recent studies have highlighted that inforniation may be missing if knowledge about brain functional connectivity is not considered. In this work, we modeled the brain as a graph in which each EEG electrode represents a node. Our goal was to understand if there exists any I near correlation between variations in the synchronization patterns that is, variations in the PSD of mu and beta bands induced by MI and alterations in the corresponding functional networks. Moreover, we (I) explored the feasibility of using functional connectivity parameters as features fora classifier in the context of an MI-BCI; (2) investigated three different types of feature selection (FS) techniques; and (3) compared our approach to a more traditional method using the signal PSD as classifier inputs. Ten healthy subjects participated in this study. We observed significant correlations (p < 0.05) with values ranging from 0.4 to 0.9 between PSD variations and functional network alterations for some electrodes, prominently in the beta band. The PSD method performed better for data classification, with mean accuracies of (90 +/- 8)% and (87 +/- 7)% for the mu and beta band, respectively, versus (83 +/- 8)% and (83 +/- 7)% for the same bands for the graph method. Moreover, the number of features for the graph method was considerably larger. However, results for both methods were relatively close, and even overlapped when the uncertainties of the accuracy rates were considered.

Therefore Brain Computer Interface Systems need to manage specific time variations of the EEG since the extracted feature are non-stationary. This paper presents a study to test Extreme Learning Machine as a suitable classification method for Motor Imagery Brain Computer Interface. In order to take in to account the time course of the signals new descriptors from three widely known Feature Extraction methods (Power Spectral Density, Hjorth parameters and Adaptive AutoregRessive coefficients) have been obtained by three different techniques: central window, averaging features and linking features. Results shows that these new descriptors have improved the performance of the Extreme Learning Machine with respect classical techniques.

Motor imagery (MI), in which motor actions are mentally rehearsed without engaging in actual physical execution, has been widely used as a major BCI approach. One robust algorithm that can successfully cope with the individual differences in MI-related rhythmic patterns is to create diverse ensemble classifiers using the subband common spatial pattern (SBCSP) method. To aggregate outputs of ensemble members, this study uses fuzzy integral with particle swarm optimization (PSO), which can regulate subject-specific parameters for the assignment of optimal confidence levels for classifiers. The proposed system combining SBCSP, fuzzy integral, and PSO exhibits robust performance for offline single-trial classification of MI and real-time control of a robotic arm using MI. This paper represents the first attempt to utilize fuzzy fusion technique to attack the individual differences problem of MI applications in real-world noisy environments. The results of this study demonstrate the practical feasibility of implementing the proposed method for real-world applications.

However, a cerebro-vascular accident can affect the brain in many different manners, and lesions in diverse areas, even from significantly different volumes, can lead to similar or equal motor deficits. The location of the insult influences the way the brain activates when moving or attempting to move a paralyzed limb. Since the essence of a rehabilitative BMI is to precisely decode motor commands from the brain, it is crucial to characterize how lesion location affects the measured signals and if and how it influences BMI performance. This paper compares the performances of an electroencephalography (EEG)-based movement intention decoder in two groups of severely paralyzed chronic stroke patients: 14 with subcortical lesions and 14 with mixed (i.e., cortical and subcortical) lesions. We show that the lesion location influences the performance of the BMI when decoding the movement attempts of the paretic arm.

Subband optimization has been suggested to enhance classification accuracy of MI. Accordingly, this study introduces a new method that implements sparse Bayesian learning of frequency bands (named SBLFB) from EEG for MI classification. CSP features are extracted on a set of signals that are generated by a filter bank with multiple overlapping subbands from raw EEG data. Sparse Bayesian learning is then exploited to implement selection of significant features with a linear discriminant criterion for classification. The effectiveness of SBLFB is demonstrated on the BCI Competition IV IIb dataset, in comparison with several other competing methods. Experimental results indicate that the SBLFB method is promising for development of an effective classifier to improve MI classification.

Methods: Electroencephalography (EEG) based pBCI has become an important tool for real-time analysis of brain activity since it could potentially provide covertly-without distracting the user from the main task-and objectively-not affected by the subjective judgment of an observer or the user itself-information about the operator cognitive state. Results: Different examples of pBCI applications in operational environments and new adaptive interface solutions have been presented and described. In addition, a general overview regarding the correct use of machine learning techniques (e.g., which algorithm to use, common pitfalls to avoid, etc.) in the pBCI field has been provided. Conclusion: Despite recent innovations on algorithms and neurotechnology, pBCI systems are not completely ready to enter the market yet, mainly due to limitations of the EEG electrodes technology, and algorithms reliability and capability in real settings. Significance: High complexity and safety critical systems (e.g., airplanes, ATM interfaces) should adapt their behaviors and functionality accordingly to the user' actual mental state. Thus, technologies (i.e., pBCIs) able to measure in real time the user's mental states would result very useful in such "high risk" environments to enhance human machine interaction, and so increase the overall safety.

EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface to a Virtual Walking Avatar Engages Cortical Adaptation	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 05-08, 2017	Banff, CANADA	IEEE		Electroencephalography (EEG); Brain-computer interface; BCI-VR system; human walking	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; TREADMILL WALKING; REALITY; STROKE	Recent advances in brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies have shown the feasibility of neural decoding for both users' gait intent and continuous kinematics. However, the cortical adaptation and the dynamics of cortical involvement in human upright walking with a closed-loop BCI in virtual environment (VE) have yet to be demonstrated. To address explore this possibility, we designed a closed-loop BCI to allow users to control a virtual avatar to walk using their encephalography (EEG). Delta band EEG (0.1 - 3 Hz) was used as the main feature in prediction. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using a closed-loop BCI to learn to control a walking avatar. The average decoding accuracies (Pearson's r values) across all subjects increased from (Hip: 0.18 +/- 0.31; Knee: 0.23 +/- 0.33; Ankle: 0.14 +/- 0.22) on Day 1 to (Hip: 0.40 +/- 0.24; Knee: 0.55 +/- 0.20; Ankle: 0.29 +/- 0.22) on Day 8. Source localization revealed significant differences in cortical network activity between walking with and without closed-loop BCI control of the virtual avatar. This current study demonstrates the feasibility of using a closed-loop EEG-based BCI-VR to trigger cortical adaptation, promoting cortical involvement, and monitoring cortical activity from non-invasive EEG. Our system may be relevant for neurological gait rehabilitation as a clinical tool for post-stroke physical training and clinical assessment.

Although these algorithms achieve high accuracy, mere detection of an IED holds little clinical significance. In this paper, we consider deep learning for epileptic subjects to accommodate automatic feature generation from intracranial EEG data, while also providing clinical insight. Convolutional neural networks are trained in a subject independent fashion to demonstrate how meaningful features are automatically learned in a hierarchical process. We illustrate how the convolved filters in the deepest layers provide insight toward the different types of IEDs within the group, as confirmed by our expert clinicians. The morphology of the IEDs found in filters can help evaluate the treatment of a patient. To improve the learning of the deep model, moderately different score classes are utilized as opposed to binary IED and non-IED labels. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art classification performance and is also invariant to time differences between the IEDs. This paper suggests that deep learning is suitable for automatic feature generation from intracranial EEG data, while also providing insight into the data.

Having EEG signal as an aid, there are innumerable diseases that can be detected. Epilepsy is one such disease that can be easily encountered with the abnormalities in the EEG signal. Epilepsy is a condition that affects many people, rendering it the most common neurological disorder after stroke. However it is still difficult to detect some subtle but critical changes in an EEG signal. In this paper we are designing an automated system (classifier) that classifies the recorded EEG signal into Normal, Interictal and Ictal cases. The automation is achieved by extracting various features that include statistical data in the transformed domain using Wavelet and Hilbert techniques. Also the approximate entropy of the sub-bands are included. Now having known the range of the values, each of the features is given a rank. These features are used to enhance the differences between the three cases. Classifier performance is evaluated in terms of its accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. This automated classifier can classify the EEG signal into the desirable cases and has found out its way in biomedical applications by simply repudiating the conventional methods.

BCI is used as a direct communication between the brain and the external device. It is mainly used for supporting, augmenting, or repairing human cognitive or sensory motor function. The proposed work is the classification of EEG signals measured under eye opening and closing state using advanced learning classifiers. Eye Opening and closing (motor imagery) dataset is a benchmark data obtained from UCI (University of California Irvine). The advance learning classifiers considered are ELM (Extreme Learning Machine), PE-CELM (Phase Encoded Extreme Learning Machine and FC-FLC (Fully Complex Valued fast learning classifiers). ELM is a fast learning real valued classifier which selects input weights randomly and computes weight of the output layer analytically. PE-CELM and FC-FLC are recently developed complex valued neural classifiers and they are used in the EEG signal classification task. Generally real valued networks have less computational ability when compared to complex valued neural networks. Hence, PE-CELM and FCFLC performs better than ELM classifier due to the orthogonal decision boundary, natural property of complex valued signal.

In particular, movement initiation and execution are mediated by patterns of synchronization and desynchronization that occur concurrently across distinct frequency bands and across multiple motor cortical areas. To date, motor-related local oscillatory modulations have been predominantly examined by quantifying increases or suppressions in spectral power. However, beyond signal power, spectral properties such as phase and phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) have also been shown to carry information with regards to the oscillatory dynamics underlying motor processes. Yet, the distinct functional roles of phase, amplitude and PAC across the planning and execution of goal-directed motor behavior remain largely elusive. Here, we address this question with unprecedented resolution thanks to multi-site intracerebral EEG recordings in human subjects while they performed a delayed motor task. To compare the roles of phase, amplitude and PAC, we monitored intracranial brain signals from 748 sites across six medically intractable epilepsy patients at movement execution, and during the delay period where motor intention is present but execution is withheld. In particular, we used a machine-learning framework to identify the key contributions of various neuronal responses. We found a high degree of overlap between brain network patterns observed during planning and those present during execution. Prominent amplitude increases in the delta (2-4 Hz) and high gamma (60-200 Hz) bands were observed during both planning and execution. In contrast, motor alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) power were suppressed during execution, but enhanced during the delay period. Interestingly, single-trial classification revealed that low-frequency phase information, rather than spectral power change, was the most discriminant feature in dissociating action from intention. Additionally, despite providing weaker decoding, PAC features led to statistically significant classification of motor states, particularly in anterior cingulate cortex and premotor brain areas. These results advance our understanding of the distinct and partly overlapping involvement of phase, amplitude and the coupling between them, in the neuronal mechanisms underlying motor intentions and executions.

Several distinct EEG patterns have been analyzed in identifying physiological and psychological states. Work presented here focuses on classification of EEG patterns for alcoholic and controlled states. Third level sub-band energy features are generated for either classes using multi-resolution wavelet packet transformation. A well-known support vector classifier is employed to segregate these features in two well defined classes. Experimental results show significant improvement over wavelet tree feature extraction. Cross-validation tests confirm the greater classification accuracy for proposed technique.

The work for detection of epileptic Seizure from EEG signals is carried out in three stages. In first stage, DWT is used for EEG signal decomposition into its corresponding sub bands. In second stage, extraction of the statistical features from each subband and finally classification of the EEG signals into epileptic seizure and normal has been done using SVM. The result from experimental analysis shows that, the proposed method is better for detection of the epileptic seizure from EEG Signals.

Specifically, non-invasively acquired electroencephalography (EEG) signals have been demonstrated to carry some evidence regarding, which of multiple synchronous speech waveforms the subject attends to. In this paper, we demonstrate that: 1) using data-and model-driven cross-correlation features yield competitive binary auditory attention classification results with at most 20 s of EEG from 16 channels or even a single well-positioned channel; 2) a model calibrated using equal-energy speech waveforms competing for attention could perform well on estimating attention in closed-loop unbalanced-energy speech waveform situations, where the speech amplitudes are modulated by the estimated attention posterior probability distribution; 3) such a model would perform even better if it is corrected (linearly, in this instance) based on EEG evidence dependence on speech weights in the mixture; and 4) calibrating a model based on population EEG could result in acceptable performance for new individuals/users; therefore, EEG-based auditory attention classifiers may generalize across individuals, leading to reduced or eliminated calibration time and effort.

In this study with this motivation, it is aimed to obtain the attributes by using the Local Bilinear Pattern (LBP) method of EEG records for various mental activities and to classify these features by k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) method. The binary classification performance of these EEG records containing 5 mental tasks was evaluated. In addition, in order to evaluate classification performance, confusion matrix was used as model performance criterion. In the study, the average of the classification performance of all participants was found as 87.38%. As a model performance criterion from the participants' classification of mental activity, accuracy was 85.03%, precision was 85.40% and sensitivity was 85.47%. So, as a result the obtained results support the literature and the applicability of the LBP method for EEG markings has been confirmed.

The aim was to compare two amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) classifications (Hellstrom-Westas (HW), Burdjalov) for outcome prediction. We recruited 65 infants a32 weeks gestational age with aEEG recordings within the first 72 h of life and Bayley testing at 24 months corrected age or death. Statistical analyses were performed for each 24 h section to determine whether very immature/depressed or mature/developed patterns predict survival/neurological outcome and to find predictors for mental development index (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) at 24 months corrected age. On day 2, deceased infants showed no cycling in 80% (HW, p = 0.0140) and 100% (Burdjalov, p = 0.0041). The Burdjalov total score significantly differed between groups on day 2 (p = 0.0284) and the adapted Burdjalov total score on day 2 (p = 0.0183) and day 3 (p = 0.0472). Cycling on day 3 (HW; p = 0.0059) and background on day 3 (HW; p = 0.0212) are independent predictors for MDI (p = 0.0016) whereas no independent predictor for PDI was found (multiple regression analyses). Conclusion: Cycling in both classifications is a valuable tool to assess chance of survival. The classification by HW is also associated with long-term mental outcome.

The reliable estimation of parameters such as mean or covariance matrix from noisy and high-dimensional observations is a prerequisite for successful application of signal processing and machine learning algorithms in brain-computer interfacing (BCI). This challenging task becomes significantly more difficult if the data set contains outliers, e.g. due to subject movements, eye blinks or loose electrodes, as they may heavily bias the estimation and the subsequent statistical analysis. Although various robust estimators have been developed to tackle the outlier problem, they ignore important structural information in the data and thus may not be optimal. Typical structural elements in BCI data are the trials consisting of a few hundred EEG samples and indicating the start and end of a task. Approach. This work discusses the parameter estimation problem in BCI and introduces a novel hierarchical view on robustness which naturally comprises different types of outlierness occurring in structured data. Furthermore, the class of minimum divergence estimators is reviewed and a robust mean and covariance estimator for structured data is derived and evaluated with simulations and on a benchmark data set. Main results. The results show that state-of-the-art BCI algorithms benefit from robustly estimated parameters. Significance. Since parameter estimation is an integral part of various machine learning algorithms, the presented techniques are applicable to many problems beyond BCI.

Research on Brain Computer Interface (BCI) begins in 1970s at university of California, Los Angeles. BMI allows us to manipulate computer and other machinery with our thoughts. Motor Imagery (MI) basically involves imaginations of any body part that leads to the activation of sensorimotor cortex which modulates the oscillation in EEG. BCI can be done by both Invasive and Non-invasive methods. In invasive, BCI are implanted into the gray matter of individual's brain by neurosurgery. Invasive method produce highest quality signals as they are directly lie in the gray matter. But gradually its signal strength weakens as scare-tissue build ups and as body always react to the foreign object in the brain [1]. Non-invasive BCI is preferred as it is easy to wear and do not require surgery. EEG is most studied non-invasive BCI because of its high temporal resolution and ease to use and low coast set up. Individual difference is the major issue in MI based BCI. Algorithms that can successfully overcome individual differences is to create diverse ensemble classifiers which uses sub-band common spatial pattern method (SBCSP). To aggregate the output of this ensemble, we use fuzzy integral with particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques. The combination of fuzzy with PSO produces robust performance for offline classification of EEG signal.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings have played an extremely important role in the diagnosis and efficacy evaluation of epilepsy. An automatic classification system for epileptic EEG based on multiscale entropy and extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed in this paper. Multiscale entropy describes the complexity of time series from multiple scales, and it is adopted for the feature extraction from normal and epileptic EEG signals. The area under curve (AUC) of receive operating characteristics (ROC) is used to evaluate the classification performance of the features. Experimental results indicate that the multiscale entropy features can reveal the difference between normal and epileptic EEG. The feature selection procedure is completed by F-score method. The selected feature set is fed to ELM classifiers. ELM classifiers based on different kinds of kernel functions are trained and tested via leave-one-out cross validation method. The ELM classifiers with sig and sin kernel functions both achieve 100% classification accuracy. The high accuracy shows that the proposed method in this paper has great potential in the application of automatic classification for epileptic EEG.

Frequency-tagging is an increasingly popular experimental paradigm that efficiently tests brain function by measuring EEG responses to periodic stimulation. Recently, frequency-tagging paradigms have proven successful with low stimulation frequencies (0.5-6 Hz), but the EEG signal is intrinsically noisy in this frequency range, requiring heavy signal processing and significant human intervention for response estimation. This limits the possibility to process the EEG on resource-constrained systems and to design smart EEG based devices for automated diagnostic. We propose an algorithm for artifact removal and automated detection of frequency tagging responses in a wide range of stimulation frequencies, which we test on a visual stimulation protocol.

Designing spatio-temporal filter using adaptive sliding window for single trial EEG based BCI	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ADVANCES IN ROBOTICS (AIR'17)			English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Advances in Robotics (AIR)	JUN 28-JUL 02, 2017	New Delhi, INDIA			Common Spatial Pattern; Spatio-temporal filter; Adaptive sliding window; Davies Bouldin Index	SPATIAL FILTERS; CLASSIFICATION	The paper presents a method that automatically segment EEG data and design an optimal spatio-temporal filter to improve the performance of EEG based BCIs. An adaptive sliding window method is proposed for automatic trial segmentation. Common Spatial Pattern is used for extracting features while Davies Bouldin Index is used as a cost function to select the optimal temporal segment. Experiment with this approach has been conducted on BCI Competition II Dataset IV. Naive Bayes Classifier has been employed for classification. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method yields minimum classification error when compared to the two traditional methods: a. EEG trial with no segmentation and b. segmenting EEG trial with classic sliding window. Minimum classification error is achieved with the proposed framework when compared to the best submission for the BCI Competition.

The epilepsy mainly divided into two types Partial and Generalized. Electroencephalograms (EEG) recordings can capture the brain's electrical signals, but diagnosis of epilepsy and identifying its correct class is time consuming and can be expensive due to the need for trained specialists to perform the interpretation, because of the nature of EEG signal, which normally get contaminated by noises and artifacts (signals other than brain activity), which affects the visual analysis of EEG and impairs the results of EEG signal processing. We present de-noising of EEG signal using Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and classification based on machine learning Technique using MATLAB.

EEG based BCIs are indeed very promising for people suffering from neuromuscular disorder, but still lack adoption as access modalities outside laboratories. Two major factors responsible for this are (a) User variability: huge performance variations among and within user; (b) Signal Variability: High signal variations within or in between BCI sessions. To some extent advanced signal processing and classification methods can adapt with these variability. This makes machines to adapt with users; however these techniques do not focus on cause of these user and signal variability. Co-adaptive BCI systems are newly introduced concept which identify cause of variability and incorporate appropriate action for it. This enables both user and machine adapt with each other. This review paper describes a framework for co-adaptive BCI system as an initial point for any adaptive BCI solution.

One of popular applications of the data analysis is inattention detection of operators in human-machine interaction systems using electroencephalography (EEG) signal. Most of the previous studies on the inattention detection employed supervised learning approaches, but their results have potential bias since they rely on imperfect assumptions for the acquisition of mental state labels, attention and inattention, due to the absence of the standardized measure for the mental states. Instead, we consider unsupervised learning approach, where no labeled data is required. In order to address the low performance of unsupervised learning approaches, attention duration for which an operator sustains his/her attention from the beginning of performing a task and relevance levels between four attributes of EEG signal and mental states are exploited. In this regard, we propose a semi-supervised inattention detection method (SID), in which attention duration and attributes-weights of EEG signal are respectively utilized as a small portion of labeled data for semi-supervised learning and weights for similarity calculation. Specifically, cumulative sum algorithm is used for the determination of the attention duration, and constrained attributes-weighting clustering algorithm is used for the estimation of attributes-weights. From experiments using real-world dataset, SID outperformed the compared methods, and it is expected that the adoption of SID will contribute to the enhancement of the operators' safety.

Detecting confusion in a human's mind in real time is a challenging and important task that can be applied to online education, driver fatigue detection and so on. In this paper, we apply Bidirectional LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks to classify students' confusion in watching online course videos from EEG data. The results show that Bidirectional LSTM model achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with other machine learning approaches, and shows strong robustness as evaluated by cross-validation. We can predict whether or not a student is confused in the accuracy of 73.3%. Furthermore, we find the most important feature to detecting the brain confusion is the gamma 1 wave of EEG signal. Our results suggest that machine learning is a potentially powerful tool to model and understand brain activity.

Compared with manual labeling of EEG signals by doctors, machine learning approaches can be faster and more consistent. However, the classification accuracy is usually not satisfactory for two main reasons: the distributions of the data used for training and testing may be different, and the amount of training data may not be enough. In addition, most machine learning approaches generate black-box models that are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we integrate transductive transfer learning, semi-supervised learning and TSK fuzzy system to tackle these three problems. More specifically, we use transfer learning to reduce the discrepancy in data distribution between the training and testing data, employ semi-supervised learning to use the unlabeled testing data to remedy the shortage of training data, and adopt TSK fuzzy system to increase model interpretability. Two learning algorithms are proposed to train the system. Our experimental results show that the proposed approaches can achieve better performance than many state-of-the-art seizure classification algorithms.

Generally, BCI systems are based on the cognitive neuroscience paradigm termed as Motor Imagery (brain activity patterns of the imagination of a motor action, e.g., the imagination of hand movements). Nevertheless, the designing an MI-based BCI system requires an appropriate EEG data analysis to reach the needed performance for real-world BCI applications. Particularly, the selection of the active segment or the segment with the informative signals related to a determinate MI task is determinant for the possible performance. Hence, to select the window signal stimulus-related, detecting temporal changes in data are necessary to understand how a cognitive process unfolds in response to a stimulus. For this purpose, a non-stationary degree estimation based on the first Statistical moments (mean and covariance) is assessed. The results show that the changes in the non-stationary measure are directly related to executed stimulus during the EEG MI recording. The findings could be used to select the active analysis window and consequently, improving the MI classification tasks.	[Velasquez-Martinez, L.

An endogenous ERP component, P300, has been widely inspected in detecting deception. Detecting P300 from EEG signals is hard to find because P300 is overloaded with noise and other EEG signals. We typically use the features of the amplitude and latency of P300 to recognize P300. In this paper we are presenting several methods for the efficient detection of P300 detection algorithms such as; reconstruction algorithm for small P300 wave using Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) method using BackPropagation network, Multi-domain EEG signal processing.

It has recently been proposed that passive brain-computer interfaces may provide a way to complement and stabilize these traditional systems. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of a passive brain-computer interface that uses electroen-cephalography to monitor changes in mental state on a single-trial basis. We recorded cortical activity from 15 locations while 11 able-bodied adults completed a series of challenging mental tasks. Using a feature clustering algorithm to account for redundancy in EEG signal features, we classified self-reported changes in fatigue, frustration, and attention levels with 74.8 +/- 9.1%, 71.6 +/- 5.6%, and 84.8 +/- 7.4% accuracy, respectively. Based on the most frequently-selected features across all participants, we note the importance of the frontal and central electrodes for fatigue detection, posterior alpha band and frontal beta band activity for frustration detection, and posterior alpha band activity for attention detection. Future work will focus on integrating these results with an active brain-computer interface.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibilities of using electroencephalography (EEG) signal to classify imaginary lower limb stepping movements and to design a robust motor imagery classifier based on support vector machine (SVM). A cue-based experimental paradigm is designed to record nine-channel EEG associated with imaginary left leg stepping (L-stepping) and right leg stepping (R-stepping) movements from eight healthy subjects. Features including band powers (BPs), common spatial pattern (CSP), and a filter-bank CSP (FB-CSP) were extracted from the recorded EEG. Fuzzy SVM (FSVM) is introduced to this study to classify L-stepping and R-stepping imageries. We propose a novel kernel-induced membership function to address the issue of data relative importance assignment. The FSVM with the membership function suggested in the original work of FSVM (Type-I FSVM) and the FSVM with the one we proposed (Type-II FSVM) is compared. Results indicated that the classification accuracies based on BP features are near the chance level (similar to 50 %). Both alpha-band CSP (71.25 %) and FB-CSP (75.63 %) gave acceptable results as a simple k-NN classifier is performed. Results show that both types of FSVM performed better than the conventional SVM. Also, Type-II FSVM outperforms Type-I FSVM, especially when the alpha-CSP feature is employed, where the improvement in error reduction rate is over 15 %. The highest average L-stepping versus R-stepping classification accuracy over the eight subjects is achieved (86.25 % in single-trial analysis) by FB-CSP and FSVM-II. The high classification result suggests the feasibility of using lower limb stepping imagery to develop a BCI that can control devices or might be able to serve as a neurofeedback tool for users who need lower limb stepping imagery training for gait function improvement.

Windowed electroencephalographic signal classifier based on continuous neural networks with delays in the input	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Time-delay neural networks; Electroencephalographic signals; Pattern classification; Lyapunov stability theory; Epileptic seizures	EXPONENTIAL STABILITY; EEG; STABILIZATION; SYSTEM	This study reports the design and implementation of a pattern recognition algorithm aimed to classify electroencephalographic (EEG) signals based on a class of dynamic neural networks (NN) described by time delay differential equations (TDNN). This kind of NN introduces the signal windowing process used in different pattern classification methods. The development of the classifier included a new set of learning laws that considered the impact of delayed information on the classifier structure. Both, the training and the validation processes were completely designed and evaluated in this study. The training method for this kind of NN was obtained by applying the Lyapunov theory stability analysis. The accuracy of training process was characterized in terms of the number of delays. A parallel structure (similar to an associative memory) with fixed (obtained after training) weights was used to execute the validation stage. Two methods were considered to validate the pattern classification method: a generalization-regularization and the k-fold cross validation processes (k = 5). Two different classes were considered: normal EEG and patients with previous confirmed neurological diagnosis. The first one contains the EEG signals from 100 healthy patients while the second contains information of epileptic seizures from the same number of patients. The pattern classification algorithm achieved a correct classification percentage of 92.12% using the information of the entire database. In comparison with similar pattern classification methods that considered the same database, the proposed CNN proved to achieve the same or even better correct classification results without pre-treating the EEG raw signal. This new type of classifier working in continuous time but using the delayed information of the input seems to be a reliable option to develop an accurate classification of windowed EEG signals.

New types of robotic assistive technologies that enable children with disabilities to interact with their environment, which prove to be beneficial for their cognitive and perceptual skills development, have emerged in recent years. In this study, a human-robot interface that uses Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) brain response during movement was developed. A haptic robot generates force feedback to constrain the user's hand motion into a defined region using a Forbidden Region Virtual Fixture (FRVF). Two channels of electroencephalography (EEG) brain signals were acquired and used to design classifiers to discriminate the pattern of brain signals between "movement" and "rest" during the operation of the robot. The highest ERD classification accuracy achieved was 69.4%. With the classifier, ERD-based FRVFs were tested in a simple robot operation task with two non-disabled adults. The virtual wall triggered by ERD successfully blocked the motion of the two participants on average 7 and 6.4 out of 10 times, respectively. Although further improvement of the system is still needed, the experimental results demonstrate the potential of the ERD-based FRVFs in robot control for a clinical population.

In some cases, EEG data are used to determine the intentionality of the subject when performing motor and imaginary motor tasks. However, EEG signals are very susceptible to noise due to the lower voltage levels that are acquired. We used a data set of 64 EEG recordings of 25 healthy subjects while they were doing motor and imaginary motor movements of hands and feet. Data were preprocessing, including the design of a filter for noise reduction outside the expected frequency spectral that operate the EEG signals. Then, we used features extraction based on spectral density. Finally, the application of five clustering algorithms to detect motor and imaginary motor tasks. Results showed that the k-means, k-medoids and Hierarchical clustering algorithms were better detecting motor activity, and hierarchical clustering for imaginary tasks of hands.

Different methods and classifiers are used to measure and classify the brain activities with higher accuracy and reliability. In this paper, instead of using mostly used classifier (support vector machine), prediction of the brain activity is done by estimating the match score densities. This method is based on likelihood ratio test which helps in finding the optimal combination of match scores. The distributions of match scores are modeled for different classes based on density score fusion in which the densities of different classes are estimated from the training data set and match scores are found by fusing the estimated densities with the testing data. The fusion is done with the data extracted from distributed activation patterns using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) against a visual task. MVPA is an intense strategy which helps in better understanding of the human brain. The match score-based technique is used in different biometric systems but never been used for the prediction of brain activity. In order to test the performance of proposed method, prediction accuracy is compared with the support vector machine using two data sets of different modalities, one is electroencephalography (EEG) and the other is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results show that the proposed method predicts the novel data with improved accuracy of 66.1% and 69.3% compared with support vector machine which have 64.15% and 65.7% for fMRI and EEG data sets, respectively.

As this is a time-consuming task, automatic processes are required. A method using signal processing and machine learning models is presented. Using signal processing techniques, after a first step of signal conditioning, abrupt frequency changes in two EEG derivations and amplitude events in one submental electromyogram are identified. These events are grouped if they occur at the same time, using the epoch segmentation for that purpose. A set of features (that includes Hjorth's Parameters and the Sleep Stage), is extracted from each group and used as input for several machine learning models. With a first dataset of 20 PSG recordings, six models are configured and compared: Fisher's Linear Discriminant, Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks, Classification Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes. The best models, in terms of the classification error and the capabilities to detect EEG arousals, were used to build two different combined approaches. The first approach follows the Shortliffe and Buchanan's certainty factors model and the second follows a linear combination. Conducting experiments on 26 PSG recordings, a sensitivity of 0.78 and a specificity of 0.89 with an error of 0.12 was achieved using the first approach, and a sensitivity of 0.81 and a specificity of 0.88 with an error of 0.13 was achieved using the second approach. Both approaches improved the performance over the individual models. These results were also compared to two well-known ensemble methods: Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbor Ensemble. Again, the combined approaches showed the best performance. (C), 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is an effective method to read user's intention with high temporal resolution. Our proposed system is mainly contributed to detecting driver's braking intention prior to stepping on the brake pedal in the emergency situation. We investigated early event-related potential (ERP) curves evoked by visual sensory process in emergency situation by using recurrent convolutional neural networks (RCNN) model. RCNN model has advantages to capture contextual and spatial patterns of brain signal. RCNN model is composed of a convolutional layer, two recurrent convolutional layers (RCLs), and a softmax layer. Fourteen participants drove for 120 minutes with two types of emergency situations and a normal driving situation in a virtual driving environment. In this article, early ERP showed a potential to be used for classifying the driver's braking intention. The classification performances based on RCNN and regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) at 200 ms post-stimulus time were 0.86 AUC score and 0.61 AUC score respectively.

Three major parts to an effective BMI are determined and handled in this paper: classifying a thought, doing a useful activity, and providing an efficient user interface (UI). This paper proposes an effective way of classifying thoughts and an approach for providing useful activities given a sequence of signals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of an extreme learning machine (ELM) for classifying a number of different thoughts when given a relatively small amount of training samples from a 5-channel EEG headset. We transform the electroencephalograph (EEG) data to a set of features for the input of the ELM model by estimating the logarithmic power (LP) of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients, which corresponds to five different frequency bands. The ELM provides up to a 90% to 100% classification accuracy depending on training samples and number of hidden nodes, compared to 52% to 60% for a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). We also present a UI based on a state machine design that allows a person to accomplish certain activities via thought with a robotic arm.

The MWL can be measured by psychophysiological signals. In this work, we propose a novel restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) architecture for MWL classification. In relation to this architecture, we examine two main issues: the optimal structure of RBM and selection of the most important EEG channels (electrodes) for MWL classification. The trial-and-error and entropy-based pruning methods are compared for the RBM structure identification. The degree of importance of EEG channels is calculated from the weights in a well-trained network in order to select the most relevant channels for classification task. Extensive comparative results showed that the selected EEG channels lead to accurate MWL classification across subjects.

Referred to as the ECO-CSP framework, the ECOC approach is applied to EEG motor imagery classification problem. A BCI system designed to operate in real world conditions, must be able to discriminate multiple tasks and activities. This fact, expresses the urge to develop/implement classifiers intrinsically designed for multi-class problems. One of such techniques which is well regarded in other fields but has not yet been applied to EEG-based classification is the ECOC. The paper addresses this gap. The BCI Competition IV-2a dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed ECO-CSP framework. Our results show that ECO-CSP achieve similar performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms but is extensively simpler with significantly less computational overhead making it a practical alternative for real-time EEG motor imagery classification tasks.

Lately, the combination of multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and Gaussian process classification (GPC) has gained interest in the neuroscientific community. Here, we demonstrate how a MVPA-GPC approach can be applied to electrophysiological data. Furthermore, in order to account for the temporal information of ERPs, we develop a novel method that integrates interregional synchrony of ERP time signatures. By using real-life ERP recordings of a prospective AD cohort study (PRODEM), we empirically investigate the usefulness of the proposed framework to build neurophysiological markers for single subject classification tasks. GPC outperforms the probabilistic reference method in both tasks, with the highest AUC overall (0.802) being achieved using the new spatiotemporal method in the prediction of rapid cognitive decline.

For this purpose, some of the classification techniques which include Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) are frequently used in the existing works. But, it has some drawbacks such as, the above mentioned techniques are represents the structure values of input EEG signal based on extracted feature of eye blinking estimation dataset. To overcome this problem, this work proposed a new system Integrated Pattern Mining (IPM) - Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the EEG signal classification. This work taking part of Primitively focusing towards, the input EEG signal is preprocessed by using Multi-Band Spectral Filtering, from the preprocessed input signal, the features of the filtered signal are extracted. After that, the normal or abnormal brain states are classified from the given signal using SVM classification technique. From the extracted output, the performance of proposed IPM-SVM technique is evaluated and compared in terms of False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR), Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR), precision, recall, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The main advantage of this proposed system is, it accurately classifies the abnormal category of cognitive impairment by improved the classification performance of the signal classification system.

Nevertheless, the so-called visual discomfort (VD) problem inevitably degrades the quality of experience in stereoscopic 3D (S3D) displays. Meanwhile, electroencephalography (EEG) has been regarded as one of the most promising brain imaging modalities in the field of cognitive neuroscience. In an effort to facilitate comfort with S3D displays, we propose a new wellness platform using EEG. We first reveal features in EEG signals that are applicable to practical S3D video systems as an index for VD perception. We then develop a framework that can automatically determine severe perception of VD based on the EEG features during S3D video viewing by capitalizing on machine-learning-based braincomputer interface technology. The proposed platform can cooperate with advanced S3D video systems whose stereo baseline is adjustable. Thus, the optimal S3D content can be reconstructed according to a viewer's sensation of VD. Applications of the proposed platform to various S3D industries are suggested, and further technical challenges are discussed for follow-up research. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

When equipped with well-designed feature extraction and classification approaches, information can be accurately acquired from the brain using such systems. The Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (HELM) has been developed as an effective and accurate classification approach due to its deep structure and extreme learning mechanism. A classification system for motor imagery EEG signals is proposed based on the HELM combined with a kernel, herein called the Kernel Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (KHELM). Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is introduced to push the features away from different classes. To demonstrate the performance, the proposed system is applied to the BCI competition 2003 Dataset Ia, and the results are compared with those from state-of-the-art methods; we find that the accuracy is up to 94.54%.

Usually, excessive sources produce outliers and potentially affect the actual event related sources. Besides, EEG manifests inherent inter-subject variability of the brain dynamics, at the resting state and/ or under the performance of task(s), caused probably due to the instantaneous fluctuation of psychophysiological states. A wavelet coherence (WC) analysis for optimally selecting associative inter-subject channels is proposed here and is being used to boost performances of motor imagery (MI)-based inter-subject brain computer interface (BCI). The underlying hypothesis is that optimally associative inter-subject channels can reduce the effects of outliers and, thus, eliminate dissimilar cortical patterns. The proposed approach has been tested on the dataset IVa from BCI competition III, including EEG data acquired from five healthy subjects who were given visual cues to perform 280 trials of MI for the right hand and right foot. Experimental results have shown increased classification accuracy (81.79%) using the WC-based selected 16 channels compared to the one (56.79%) achieved using all the available 118 channels. The associative channels lie mostly around the sensorimotor regions of the brain, reinforced by the previous literature, describing spatial brain dynamics during sensorimotor oscillations. Apparently, the proposed approach paves the way for optimised EEG channel selection that could boost further the efficiency and real-time performance of BCI systems.

The ERD is known as the intensity change of the specific frequency bands such as mu, beta, theta, and gamma. However, these bands can not be strictly defined because they are slightly different from each user. In this study, we use a l(1) - constrained least squares learning to obtain the coefficients of the discriminator which specialize frequency-bands and electrode-positions in each user.

However, these models are not applicable in general situations. Moreover, they output only binary classification. The current study suggests that the combination of electroencephalogram (EEG) variables and non-linear regression modeling can be a good indicator of MW intensity. We recorded EEGs of 50 subjects during the performance of a Sustained Attention to Response Task, including a thought sampling probe that inquired the focus of attention. We calculated the power and coherence value and prepared 35 patterns of variable combinations and applied Support Vector machine Regression (SVR) to them. Finally, we chose four SVR models: two of them non-linear models and the others linear models; two of the four models are composed of a limited number of electrodes to satisfy model usefulness. Examination using the held-out data indicated that all models had robust predictive precision and provided significantly better estimations than a linear regression model using single electrode EEG variables. Furthermore, in limited electrode condition, non-linear SVR model showed significantly better precision than linear SVR model. The method proposed in this study helps investigations into MW in various little-examined situations. Further, by measuring MW with a high temporal resolution EEG, unclear aspects of MW, such as time series variation, are expected to be revealed. Furthermore, our suggestion that a few electrodes can also predict MW contributes to the development of neuro-feedback studies.

Automatic Sleep Monitoring Using Ear-EEG	IEEE JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL ENGINEERING IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Wearable EEG; in-ear sensing; ear-EEG; automatic sleep classification; structural complexity analysis		The monitoring of sleep patterns without patient's inconvenience or involvement of a medical specialist is a clinical question of significant importance. To this end, we propose an automatic sleep stage monitoring system based on an affordable, unobtrusive, discreet, and long-term wearable in-ear sensor for recording the electroencephalogram (ear-EEG). The selected features for sleep pattern classification from a single ear-EEG channel include the spectral edge frequency and multi-scale fuzzy entropy, a structural complexity feature. In this preliminary study, the manually scored hypnograms from simultaneous scalp EEG and ear-EEG recordings of four subjects are used as labels for two analysis scenarios: 1) classification of ear-EEG hypnogram labels from ear-EEG recordings; and 2) prediction of scalp-EEG hypnogram labels from ear-EEG recordings. We consider both 2-class and 4-class sleep scoring, with the achieved accuracies ranging from 78.5% to 95.2% for ear-EEG labels predicted from ear-EEG, and 76.8% to 91.8% for scalp-EEG labels predicted from ear-EEG. The corresponding Kappa coefficients range from 0.64 to 0.83 for Scenario 1, and indicate substantial to almost perfect agreement, while for Scenario 2 the range of 0.65-0.80 indicates substantial agreement, thus further supporting the feasibility of in-ear sensing for sleep monitoring in the community.

During epilepsy, the electrical activities become more intense because of the temporary disruptions happening to normal activities and functions of brain. Epilepsy is widely characterized by recurrent seizures and is one of the most common brain disorders. To evaluate the epileptic patients, a non-invasive tool called Electroencephalography (EEG) is used. To examine the patterns of the brain and to assist in the diagnosis of epilepsy, EEG is very helpful. As the recordings of the EEG are too large to process, certain kind of dimensionality reduction technique is required to reduce the dimensions of the EEG data. The dimensionality reduction technique used here is Fuzzy Mutual Information (FMI). The dimensionally reduced data is then transmitted through the Space Time Block Coded Multiple Input Multiple Output Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (STBC MIMO-OFDM) System. Since the STBC MIMO-OFDM System suffers a high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR), K-means modified Partial Transmit Sequence (K-PTS) is used to reduce the PAPR. At the receiver side, the Linear Support Vector Machine (L-SVM) algorithm is used to classify the epilepsy from EEG signals. The performance metrics includes specificity, sensitivity, time delay, quality values, accuracy and performance index, Bit Error Rate (BER) and PAPR.

Analyzing text recognition from tactually evoked EEG	COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS			English	Article						Text recognition; Tactile perception; Electroencephalography; Brain-computer interface; Rehabilitation	OBJECT RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION; SIGNALS; BRAILLE; POWER	Tactual exploration of objects produce specific patterns in the human brain and hence objects can be recognized by analyzing brain signals during tactile exploration. The present work aims at analyzing EEG signals online for recognition of embossed texts by tactual exploration. EEG signals are acquired from the parietal region over the somatosensory cortex of blindfolded healthy subjects while they tactually explored embossed texts, including symbols, numbers, and alphabets. Classifiers based on the principle of supervised learning are trained on the extracted EEG feature space, comprising three features, namely, adaptive autoregressive parameters, Hurst exponents, and power spectral density, to recognize the respective texts. The pre-trained classifiers are used to classify the EEG data to identify the texts online and the recognized text is displayed on the computer screen for communication. Online classifications of two, four, and six classes of embossed texts are achieved with overall average recognition rates of 76.62, 72.31, and 67.62% respectively and the computational time is less than 2 s in each case. The maximum information transfer rate and utility of the system performance over all experiments are 0.7187 and 2.0529 bits/s respectively. This work presents a study that shows the possibility to classify 3D letters using tactually evoked EEG. In future, it will help the BCI community to design stimuli for better tactile augmentation n also opens new directions of research to facilitate 3D letters for visually impaired persons. Further, 3D maps can be generated for aiding tactual BCI in teleoperation.

We aimed to increase the diagnostic power by combining quantitative markers from SPECT and EEG for differential diagnosis of disorders with amnestic symptoms. We hypothesize that the combination of SPECT with measures of interaction (connectivity) in the EEG yields higher diagnostic accuracy than the single modalities. We examined 39 patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD), 69 patients with depressive cognitive impairment (DCI), 71 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 41 patients with amnestic subjective cognitive complaints (aSCC). We calculated 14 measures of interaction from a standard clinical EEG-recording and derived graph-theoretic network measures. From regional brain perfusion measured by 99mTc-hexamethyl-propylene-aminoxime (HMPAO)-SPECT in 46 regions, we calculated relative cerebral perfusion in these patients. Patient groups were classified pairwise with a linear support vector machine. Classification was conducted separately for each biomarker, and then again for each EEG-biomarker combined with SPECT. Combination of SPECT with EEG-biomarkers outperformed single use of SPECT or EEG when classifying aSCC vs. AD (90%), aMCI vs. AD (70%), and AD vs. DCI (100%), while a selection of EEG measures performed best when classifying aSCC vs. aMCI (82%) and aMCI vs. DCI (90%). Only the contrast between aSCC and DCI did not result in above-chance classification accuracy (60%). In general, accuracies were higher when measures of interaction (i.e., connectivity measures) were applied directly than when graph-theoretical measures were derived. We suggest that quantitative analysis of EEG and machine-learning techniques can support differentiating AD, aMCI, aSCC, and DCC, especially when being combined with imaging methods such as SPECT. Quantitative analysis of EEG connectivity could become an integral part for early differential diagnosis of cognitive impairment.

Last but not least, Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) is used to classify the left and right, at the meantime, subject's threshold value of average band power is calculated to classify the accelerate and brake. In the test, there is about 84% accuracy rate of accelerate and brake and 89.92% for left and right classification. The second work is that we design and construct a real model FWID electric vehicle with environmental perception subsystem, including ultrasonic wave radars and cameras, which can avoid the risk when BCI command is wrong. We also construct driving motor imagery sample data collector to get subjects' motor imagery data for classifier to improve the accuracy of BCI system.

Extracting ERPs from a limited number of trials remains challenging due to their low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low spatial resolution caused by volume conduction. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model for trial-by-trial concatenated EEG, in which the concatenated ERPs are expressed as a linear combination of a set of discrete sine and cosine bases. The bases are simply determined by the data length of a single trial. A sparse prior on the rank of the spatio-spectral pattern matrix is introduced into the model to allow the number of components to be automatically determined. A maximum posterior estimation algorithm based on cyclic descent is then developed to estimate the spatiospectral patterns. A spatial filter can then be obtained by maximizing the SNR of the ERP components. Experiments on both synthetic data and real N170 ERP from 13 subjects were conducted to test the efficacy and efficiency of the algorithm. The results showed that the proposed algorithm can estimate the ERPs more accurately than the several state-of-the-art algorithms.

The motivation of this work comes from the need for a BCI system, intended to operate in real world scenarios, to discriminate multiple tasks and activities simultaneously. In this regard, the paper proposes a novel multi-class EEG-based BCI system via utilization of error correcting output coding (ECOC) classifiers. To best of our knowledge, the ECOC classifiers have not ever been applied to the EEG classification problems. In the ECOC method, the classification problem is modeled as communication over a noisy channel where the miss-classification error is corrected by error correcting techniques borrowed from information theory. In this work, we propose to utilize a modified version of the ECOC classifiers adopted to EEG classification problems which deploys ternary class codewords. Therefore, we analyze more combinations of the classes and greater number of classifiers vote for the final result. The proposed classifier is coupled with a Bayesian framework to compute the optimized spatio-spectral filters to extract the most discriminative feature sets of different classes. The proposed framework is applied to a motor imagery classification problem and evaluated over BCI Competition IV-2a dataset where the results indicate a noticeable enhancement over other methods developed for multi-class EEG classification.

A variety of factors could potentially affect the performance of BCI such as the health status of subjects or the environment. In this paper, we investigated the effects of soft drinks and regular coffee on EEG signals under resting state and on the performance of MI-based BCI. Twenty-six healthy human subjects participated in three or four BCI sessions with a resting period in each session. During each session, the subjects drank an unlabeled soft drink with either sugar (Caffeine Free Coca-Cola), caffeine (Diet Coke), neither ingredient (Caffeine Free Diet Coke), or a regular coffee if there was a fourth session. The resting state spectral power in each condition was compared; the analysis showed that power in alpha and beta band after caffeine consumption were decreased substantially compared with control and sugar condition. Although the attenuation of powers in the frequency range used for the online BCI control signal was shown, group averaged BCI online performance after consuming caffeine was similar to those of other conditions. This paper, for the first time, shows the effect of caffeine, sugar intake on the online BCI performance, and resting state brain signal.

Therefore an effective, light weight approach is a must. There are several technologies used in deception detection. EEG based deception detection is one such approach. P300 wave is most commonly used in EEG based deception detection which depends on a stimuli. The study provides an alternative approach to deception detection instead of using P300. Twelve subjects were participated to the study and EEG signals were recorded while they were telling truths and lies. The preprocessed EEG data then fed in to feature extraction and machine learning algorithm alone with Common Spatial Patterns ( CSP) paradigm to create a model. Logistic regression classifier was used as the machine learning algorithm to classify the eeg signal. The test data were used on the trained model with cross validation. There were significant difference between truth telling and lying signals. The average rate of correctly predicted the class was 76%.	[Dhanapala, W. W. G. D. S.; Bakmeedeniya, A. H. M. T.

They are proper tools to translate the movement intentions of human into control's signals for out devices. We use Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) which leads to extracting discriminative spatial patterns of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In the FBCSP algorithm, the EEG signals are decomposed into multiple frequency bands using a filter bank. In order to exploit the time-varying feature of EEG signals and extract the unknown features, we partitioned the EEG signals into a number of time windows. Then, CSP features are extracted from all time windows of all frequency bands. Finally, feature selection and classification has been done using Mutual Information (MI) algorithm and Naive Bayesian classifier, respectively. We used EEG dataset BCI Competition IV dataset 2a to evaluate the proposed method. This dataset is a four-class two-session motor imagery dataset. The experimental results show that the mean kappa value has improved to 0.60.

Since EEG signal is weak, noisy and mixed with a large number of artifacts, which causes interference to the processing and identification of the EEG signal. Using EEG related pretreatment can effectively remove artifact, noise, and improve EEG signal-noise ratio and efficient, which provides more accurate data for feature extraction and classification. In this paper, we introduce several methods including PCA, ICA and CSP. Based on these methods, the complete process of EEG signal de-noising, feature extraction and classification are established, which can complete the classification and recognition of the motor imagery signals. We use a combination of a lot of pretreatment methods to analysis and process motor imagery of EEG and propose an improved algorithm named CS-CSP. The experimental results show that the Chebyshev type II filter is superior to the conventional pre-treatment methods and the recognition accuracy of CS-CSP is higher than CSP.

An empirical investigation with a brain-computer interface headset has been conducted: by extracting numerical data features, machine learning techniques classify the different activities of the gaming sessions (task and events) to verify if their design differentiation coincides with the affective one. The observed results, also supported by subjective questionnaires data, confirm the goodness of the proposed guidelines, suggesting that this evaluation methodology could be extended to other evaluation tasks.

In this paper, we proposed a bimodal BCI system that uses only a few channels of electroencephalograph (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals to obtain relatively high accuracy. We developed new approaches for signal acquisition and signal processing to improve the performance of this few-channel BCI system. At the signal acquisition stage, source analysis was applied for both EEG and fNIRS signals to select the optimal channels for bimodal signal collection. At the feature extraction stage, phase-space reconstruction was applied to the selected three-channel EEG signals to expand them into multichannel signals, thus allowing the use of the traditional effective common spatial pattern to extract EEG features. For the fNIRS signal, the Hurst exponents for the selected ten channels were calculated and composed of the fNIRS data feature. At the classification stage, EEG and fNIRS features were joined and classified with the support vector machine. The averaged classification accuracy of 12 participants was 81.2% for the bimodal EEG-fNIRS signals, which was significantly higher than that for either single modality.

Standard deviation and Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) between target electrodes and its correspondent neighbor electrodes are analyzed on sliding windows to select those neighbors that are highly correlated. Afterwards, a model based on CCC is applied to provide higher values of weight to those correlated electrodes with lower similarity to the target electrode. The approach was applied to brain computer-interfaces (BCIs) based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to recognize 40 targets of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), providing an accuracy (ACC) of 86.44 +/- 2.81%. In addition, also using this approach, features of low frequency were selected in the pre-processing stage of another BCI to recognize gait planning. In this case, the recognition was significantly (p < 0.01) improved for most of the subjects (ACC +/- 74.79%), when compared with other BCIs based on Common Spatial Pattern, Filter Bank - Common Spatial Pattern, and Riemannian Geometry.

Cumulative evidence has revealed that individuals with schizotypy, as well as schizophrenia patients, have emotional processing deficits. In the present study, we investigated multimodal emotion perception in schizotypy and implemented the machine learning technique to find out whether a schizotypy group (ST) is distinguishable from a control group (NC), using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Forty-five subjects (30 ST and 15 NC) were divided into two groups based on their scores on a Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. All participants performed an audiovisual emotion perception test while EEG was recorded. After the preprocessing stage, the discriminatory features were extracted using a mean subsampling technique. For an accurate estimation of covariance matrices, the shrinkage linear discriminant algorithm was used. The classification attained over 98% accuracy and zero rate of false-positive results. This method may have important clinical implications in discriminating those among the general population who have a subtle risk for schizotypy, requiring intervention in advance.

Precise classification of the acquired brain signals with the least misclassification error is an arduous task. Existing techniques for classification of multi-class motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) have low accuracy and are computationally inefficient. This paper introduces a classification algorithm, which uses two frequency ranges, mu and beta rythms, for feature extraction using common spatial pattern (CSP) along with support vector machine (SVM) for classification. The technique uses only four frequency bands with no feature reduction and consequently less computational cost. The implementation of this algorithm on BCI competition III dataset IIIa, resulted in the highest classification accuracy in comparison to existing algorithms. A mean accuracy of 85.5 for offline classification has been achieved using this technique.

In this sense, electroencephalographic (EEG) methods offer promising alternatives due to their low cost, portability, and growing robustness. Here, we relied on EEG signals and a novel information-sharing method to study resting-state connectivity in patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and controls. To evaluate the specificity of our results, we also tested Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The classification power of the ensuing connectivity patterns was evaluated through a supervised classification algorithm (support vector machine). In addition, we compared the classification power yielded by (i) functional connectivity, (ii) relevant neuropsychological tests, and (iii) a combination of both. BvFTD patients exhibited a specific pattern of hypoconnectivity in mid-range frontotemporal links, which showed no alterations in AD patients. These functional connectivity alterations in bvFTD were replicated with a low-density EEG setting (20 electrodes). Moreover, while neuropsychological tests yielded acceptable discrimination between bvFTD and controls, the addition of connectivity results improved classification power. Finally, classification between bvFTD and AD patients was better when based on connectivity than on neuropsychological measures. Taken together, such findings underscore the relevance of EEG measures as potential biomarker signatures for clinical settings.

In general, the construction of intelligent epileptic EEG recognition system involves two steps. First, an appropriate feature extraction method is applied to obtain representative features from the original raw EEG signals. Second, an effective intelligent model is trained based on the extracted features. However, there exist two major challenges in the process: 1) it is nontrivial to determine the appropriate feature extraction method to be used; 2) although many classical machine learning methods have been used for epileptic EEG recognition, most of them are "black box" approaches and more interpretable methods are desirable. To address these two challenges, a new epileptic EEG recognition method based on a multiview learning framework and fuzzy system modeling is proposed. First, multiview EEG data are generated by employing different feature extraction methods to obtain the features from different views of the signals. Second, the classical Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS) is introduced as an easy-to-interpret recognition model to develop a multiview TSK-FS method, called MV-TSK-FS, to identify epileptic EEG signals. For the proposed MV-TSK-FS, the importance of each view, i.e., the importance of each feature extraction method, can be evaluated according to the weighting of each view, and consequently the final decision can be made based on the weighted outputs of different views. Experimental results indicate that the MV-TSK-FS is a promising method when compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

Neural-network-based analysis of EEG data using the neuromorphic TrueNorth chip for brain-machine interfaces	IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article								Electroencephalography (EEG) is a noninvasive way to record brain activity by means of measuring electrical fields arising from neural activation. Being relatively inexpensive, safe, and readily available, EEG-based techniques have been studied as potential methods for controlling brain-machine interfaces. Previous attempts to analyze EEG signals have focused on well-characterized sensorimotor data features. However, the brain-machine interface field seems to have stagnated in improving motor decoding using this method. One way to overcome this hurdle is to use neural-network-based classification methods to analyze brain-activity data. In this paper, we describe the novel neural networks we created for analyzing existing EEG data. Although these neural networks were programmed, trained, and tested in a conventional central processing unit or graphics processing unit environment, their novelty lies in their full compatibility with IBM's recently introduced ultralow power, neuromorphic TrueNorth chip infrastructure, thus, constituting the analytical units in the next generation of neurobionic mobile devices. We report on the development of a new EEG signal classifier built on a spiking neural network that runs on the TrueNorth platform. Using a modified back-propagation training method that employs trinary weights, we demonstrate state-of-the-art classification accuracy.	[Mashford, B.

Using EEG signal to analysis human emotional states is a common research. Brain network analysis is a way to study brain emotional activity, it bases on the graph theory and finds the brain connectivity patterns. This way should calculate the matrices of functional connectivity of EEG and extract the characteristics from the matrices. This paper describes a straightforward way to use the matrices of functional connectivity and extract feature by using Convolution Neural Network (CNN). CNN was employed to accomplish several task: 1) 2-classification task, 2) 3-classification task and 3) 4-classification task, and the average accuracy of 2-classification task is about 85%, 3-classification task is about 78% and 4-classification is about 75%.

Deep Learning Human Mind for Automated Visual Classification	30TH IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION (CVPR 2017)	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition		English	Proceedings Paper	30th IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)	JUL 21-26, 2017	Honolulu, HI	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, CVF			OBJECT; EEG; ICA	What if we could effectively read the mind and transfer human visual capabilities to computer vision methods? In this paper, we aim at addressing this question by developing the first visual object classifier driven by human brain signals. In particular, we employ EEG data evoked by visual object stimuli combined with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to learn a discriminative brain activity manifold of visual categories in a reading the mind effort. Afterward, we transfer the learned capabilities to machines by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based regressor to project images onto the learned manifold, thus allowing machines to employ human brain-based features for automated visual classification. We use a 128-channel EEG with active electrodes to record brain activity of several subjects while looking at images of 40 ImageNet object classes. The proposed RNN-based approach for discriminating object classes using brain signals reaches an average accuracy of about 83%, which greatly outperforms existing methods attempting to learn EEG visual object representations. As for automated object categorization, our human brain-driven approach obtains competitive performance, comparable to those achieved by powerful CNN models and it is also able to generalize over different visual datasets.

Eight healthy participants were asked to complete a finger-tapping task of different complexity. In signal processing, CSP features were extracted from the band-passed EEG signals. Then, these features were used to define a score using the step-wise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA) method. The classification accuracy was evaluated by a five-fold cross-validation strategy. The experimental results showed that the average accuracy between different complexity is 79.20%, and the highest is up to 80.84%, indicating the separability of EEG-based MI tasks with different complexity. The EEG-based complexity distinction achieved in this paper would encourage further study of the realization of multiclass MI-based BCI paradigm.

Seizure pattern-specific epileptic epoch detection in patients with intellectual disability	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						EEG; Seizure detection; Seizure patterns; Classifiers; Feature importance; Intellectual disability	DETECTION ALGORITHM; MENTAL-RETARDATION; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM; SYNCHRONIZATION; DEFINITIONS; COMPLEXITY; PREDICTION; CHILDREN	Electroencephalogram (EEG) features are crucial for the seizure detection performance. Traditional algorithms are designed for a population with normal brain development. However, for patients with an intellectual disability the seizure detection performance is still largely unknown. In addition, distinct EEG activities/patterns occur during the evolution of seizure events. However, few studies distinguished what EEG activities contribute to accurate seizure detections. To evaluate the effect of different seizure patterns on the seizure detection, we start from the four predefined seizure patterns: wave, fast spike, spike-wave complex, and seizure-related EMG artifacts. A wide range of promising EEG features in the time, frequency, time frequency, and spatio-temporal domains, as well as synchronization-based features were extracted to characterize these patterns. The performance of seizure detection was evaluated in an epoch-based way. EEG recordings of 615 h from 29 epilepsy patients with intellectual disability were used in this study for validation. Results show that the seizure patterns of wave, and seizure-related EMG were easier to detect than the fast spike, spike-wave patterns, with sensitivities of 0.76, 0.74, 0.42, and 0.51, respectively (when specificity approximately equal to 1). We achieved the overall epoch-based detection performance with sensitivity of 68%, positive predictive value (PPV) 81%, and average duration of false detection 0.76 s per hour. Feature importance analysis indicated that the classification performance of traditional EEG features can be improved when combined with our newly-proposed features from the spatio-temporal domain and the synchronization-based methods.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; mental rotation; motor imagery; sensorimotor cortex activation; BCI	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MENTAL ROTATION; DYNAMICS; HANDS; BCI	Explicit motor imagery (eMI) is a widely used brain-computer interface(BCI) paradigm, but not everybody can accomplish this task. Here, we propose a BCI based on implicit motor imagery (iMI). We compared classification accuracy between eMI and iMI of hands. Fifteen able-bodied people were asked to judge the laterality of hand images presented on a computer screen in a lateral or medial orientation. This judgment task is known to require mental rotation of a person's own hands, which in turn is thought to involve iMI. The subjects were also asked to perform eMI of the hands. Their electroencephalography was recorded. Linear classifiers were designed based on common spatial patterns. For discrimination between left hand and right hand, the classifier achieved maximum of 81 +/- 8% accuracy for eMI and 83 +/- 3% for iMI. These results show that iMI can be used to achieve similar classification accuracy as eMI. Additional classification was performed between iMI in medial and lateral orientations of a single hand; the classifier achieved 81 +/- 7% for the left hand and 78 +/- 7% for the right hand, which indicate distinctive spatial patterns of cortical activity for iMI of a single hand in different directions. These results suggest that a special BCI based on iMI may be constructed, for people who cannot perform explicit imagination, for rehabilitation of movement, or for treatment of bodily spatial neglect.

The AAD method requires the clean speech signals of both the attended and the unattended speaker as reference signals for decoding. However, in practice only the binaural signals, containing several undesired acoustic components (reverberation, background noise and interference), and influenced by anechoic head-related transfer functions (HRTFs), are available. To generate appropriate reference signals for decoding from the binaural signals, it is important to understand the impact of these acoustic components on the AAD performance. In this paper, we investigate this impact for decoding several acoustic conditions (anechoic, reverberant, noisy, and reverberant-noisy) by using simulated speech signals in which different acoustic components have been reduced. The experimental results show that for obtaining a good decoding performance the joint suppression of reverberation, background noise and interference as undesired acoustic components is of great importance.

In this study we aim to evaluate the significance of generalized periodic discharges (GPD) as a prognostic marker. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the medical histories of patients, who underwent an EEG after cardiac arrest during the time period from 2005 to 2013 at the University Hospital Zurich. All EEGs were reinterpreted using the 2012 American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) classification for intensive care unit (ICU) EEGs. Results: Out of 131 patients, in which an EEG was recorded after cardiopulmonary resuscitation, 119 were included in our study. The average interval between cardiac arrest and EEG-recording was 3.8 +/- 3.0 days (range: 0-14 days). Persistent GPDs (i.e. GPDs more than 24 h after the event) were found in thirty-two (26.9%) of the patients initial EEGs. The appearance of persistent GPDs preceded fatal outcome in 100% of all cases (vs. 69.0% in the non-GPD-group, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Among other encephalopathic markers in EEG persistent GPDs are a highly specific prognostic marker of fatal outcome in patients with hypoxic encephalopathy. Significance: Using standardized EEG interpretation, this study identified persistent GPDs as a specific prognostic marker in post cardiac arrest syndrome.

Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) are communication systems, which allow humans to mentally interact with external devices and machines. They detect, record and analyze electroencephalography (EEG) waves, which reflect certain brain functions or commands. In this paper, EEG data readings are collected and classified, using a cost-efficient BCI headset and Neural Network (NN) classifier. The objective is to classify and identify the users route decisions, while being on-board of an automated vehicle. The system takes advantage of the capacity of the automated vehicle for autonomous maneuvering, and the brainwave sensor allows the user to take route decision. Several training experiments were carried-out, moreover, numerous testing experiments were performed. Obtained results show successful classification of the subjects decisions, enhancing the mobility capacity of people with physical disabilities.

However, existing EEG-based user-recognition methods present only a limited range of individual distinctions. In this paper, we propose a novel system of decoding cognitive EEG signals for individual identification with high accuracy. Specifically, we investigate the feasibility of our system, which can recognize an individual based on the discriminative patterns of source-level causal connectivity among brain regions, estimated from scalp-level EEG signals. The EEG signals were produced by a steady-state visual evoked potential-inducing grid-shaped top-down paradigm. This system can, in principle, use top-down cognitive features analyzed by individuals' differently characterized neurodynamic causal connectivities. In this paper, we achieved a maximal accuracy of 98.60% on average in 20 subjects, for whom we estimated causal connectivity in 16 brain regions using 5-s intervals of EEG signals. Our system shows promising initial results toward building a practical identification technology able to recognize individuals by means of brain neurodynamics.

In addition, chronic stress could implicate several psychophysiological disorders. For example, stress increases the likelihood of depression, stroke, heart attack, and cardiac arrest. The latest neuroscience reveals that the human brain is the primary target of mental stress, because the perception of the human brain determines a situation that is threatening and stressful. In this context, an objective measure for identifying the levels of stress while considering the human brain could considerably improve the associated harmful effects. Therefore, in this paper, a machine learning (ML) framework involving electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis of stressed participants is proposed. In the experimental setting, stress was induced by adopting a well-known experimental paradigm based on the montreal imaging stress task. The induction of stress was validated by the task performance and subjective feedback. The proposed ML framework involved EEG feature extraction, feature selection (receiver operating characteristic curve, t-test and the Bhattacharya distance), classification (logistic regression, support vector machine and naive Bayes classifiers) and tenfold cross validation. The results showed that the proposed framework produced 94.6% accuracy for two-level identification of stress and 83.4% accuracy for multiple level identification. In conclusion, the proposed EEG-based ML framework has the potential to quantify stress objectively into multiple levels. The proposed method could help in developing a computer-aided diagnostic tool for stress detection.

BLINKER: Automated Extraction of Ocular Indices from EEG Enabling Large-Scale Analysis	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						eye blinks; blink duration; EEG; artifact; EEGLAB; machine learning; big data; human behavior	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SPONTANEOUS EYEBLINK ACTIVITY; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EYE-BLINKS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; DRIVING PERFORMANCE; SLEEPINESS; DROWSINESS; DYNAMICS; TASK	Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a platform for studying the relationships between behavioral measures, such as blink rate and duration, with neural correlates of fatigue and attention, such as theta and alpha band power. Further, the existence of EEG studies covering a variety of subjects and tasks provides opportunities for the community to better characterize variability of these measures across tasks and subjects. We have implemented an automated pipeline (BLINKER) for extracting ocular indices such as blink rate, blink duration, and blink velocity-amplitude ratios from EEG channels, FOG channels, and/or independent components (ICs). To illustrate the use of our approach, we have applied the pipeline to a large corpus of EEG data (comprising more than 2000 datasets acquired at eight different laboratories) in order to characterize variability of certain ocular indicators across subjects. We also investigate dependence of ocular indices on task in a shooter study. We have implemented our algorithms in a freely available MATLAB toolbox called BLINKER. The toolbox, which is easy to use and can be applied to collections of data without user intervention, can automatically discover which channels or ICs capture blinks. The tools extract blinks, calculate common ocular indices, generate a report for each dataset, dump labeled images of the individual blinks, and provide summary statistics across collections. Users can run BLINKER as a script or as a plugin for EEGLAB. The toolbox is available at https://github.comNisLab/EEG-Blinks.

Gaussian Process Regression for Predictive But Interpretable Machine Learning Models: An Example of Predicting Mental Workload across Tasks	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; BCI; Gaussian Process Regression; machine learning; neuroergonomics	EFFECT SIZE; EEG; STATISTICS; FEATURES	There is increasing interest in real-time brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for the passive monitoring of human cognitive state, including cognitive workload. Too often, however, effective BCIs based on machine learning techniques may function as black boxes that are difficult to analyze or interpret. In an effort toward more interpretable BCIs, we studied a family of N-back working memory tasks using a machine learning model, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), which was both powerful and amenable to analysis. Participants performed the N-back task with three stimulus variants, auditory-verbal, visual-spatial, and visual-numeric, each at three working memory loads. GPR models were trained and tested on EEG data from all three task variants combined, in an effort to identify a model that could be predictive of mental workload demand regardless of stimulus modality. To provide a comparison for GPR performance, a model was additionally trained using multiple linear regression (MLR). The GPR model was effective when trained on individual participant EEG data, resulting in an average standardized mean squared error (sMSE) between true and predicted N-back levels of 0.44. In comparison, the MLR model using the same data resulted in an average sMSE of 0.55. We additionally demonstrate how GPR can be used to identify which EEG features are relevant for prediction of cognitive workload in an individual participant. A fraction of EEG features accounted for the majority of the models predictive power; using only the top 25% of features performed nearly as well as using 100% of features. Subsets of features identified by linear models (ANOVA) were not as efficient as subsets identified by GPR. This raises the possibility of BCIs that require fewer model features while capturing all of the information needed to achieve high predictive accuracy.

The most crucial part of EEG data analysis is to discover hidden knowledge from a large volume of data through pattern mining for efficient analysis. This study focuses on discovering representative patterns from each channel data to recover useful information reducing the size of data. In this paper, a novel algorithm based on principal component analysis (PCA) technique is developed to accurately and efficiently extract a pattern from the vast amount of EEG signal data. This study considers PCA to explore the sequential pattern of each EEG channel data as PCA is a dominant tool for finding patterns in it. In order to represent the distribution of the pattern, the most significant satanical features (e.g. mean, standard deviation) are computed from the extracted pattern. Then aggregating all of the features extracted from each of the patterns in a subject, a feature vector set is created that is fed into random forest (RF) and random tree (RT) classification model, individually for classifying different categories of the signals. The proposed methodology is tested on two benchmark EEG datasets of BCI Competition III: dataset V and dataset IVa. In order to further evaluate performance, the proposed scheme is compared with some recently reported algorithms, where the same datasets were used. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology with RF achieves higher performance compared to the RT and also the recently reported methods. The present study suggests the merits and feasibility of applying proposed method in the medical data mining for efficient analysis of any biomedical signal data.

This paper presents two combination strategies of feature extraction on EEG signals. In the first strategy, Autoregressive coefficients and approximate entropy are calculated respectively, and the features are obtained by assembling them. In the second strategy, the EEG signals are first decomposed into sub-bands by wavelet packet decomposition. Wavelet packet coefficients are then sent to the autoregressive model to calculate autoregressive coefficients, which are used as features extracted from the original EEG signals. These features are fed to support vector machine for classifying the EEG signals. The classification accuracy has been used for evaluating the classification performance. Experimental results in five mental tasks show that the combination strategies can effectively improve the classification performance when the order of autoregressive model is greater than 5, and the second strategy is superior to the first one in terms of the classification accuracy.

Using electroencephalography recordings in patients treated with targeted temperature management at 33 degrees C (TTM 33), we have previously shown that improvement in auditory discrimination over the first days of coma predicted awakening. Given the increased application of a 36 degrees C temperature target (TTM 36), here we aimed at validating the predictive value of auditory discrimination in the TTM 36 setting. Methods: In this prospective multicenter study, we analyzed the EEG responses to auditory stimuli from 60 consecutive patients from the first and second coma day. A semiautomatic decoding analysis was applied to single patient data to quantify discrimination performance between frequently repeated and deviant sounds. The decoding change from the first to second day was used for predicting patient outcome. Results: We observed an increase in auditory discrimination in 25 out of 60 patients. Among them, 17 awoke from coma (68% positive predictive value; 95% confidence interval: 0.46-0.85). By excluding patients with electroencephalographic epileptiform features, 15 of 18 exhibited improvement in auditory discrimination (83% positive predictive value; 95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.96). Specificity of good outcome prediction increased after adding auditory discrimination to EEG reactivity. Conclusion: These results suggest that tracking of auditory discrimination over time is informative of good recovery independent of the temperature target.

The seizures produced due to epilepsy manifests itself in various forms of symptoms ranging from a short lapse of attention to severe muscle jerks. To diagnose whether a patient is epileptic or non epileptic and to determine the required treatment is the most important stage when dealing with the patient. In the present scenario, diagnosing such disorders is executed manually by neurologists whose availability is limited. With the advent of computer based diagnosis dependent on EEG, the diagnosis could be made quite faster. For the computer based diagnosis, various signal processing algorithms and machine learning techniques play a vital role. An immense amount of information about the brain can be understood with the help of Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. An EEG signal is non-stationary and highly time varying in nature and so it can be analyzed by non-linear techniques. In this paper, the concept of code converters is implemented and as the classification results through it are not satisfactory it is further optimized with the help of Adaboost Classifier. Results show that when Adaboost Classifier is utilized as a post classifier, an average perfect classification rate of about 94.58%, an average classification accuracy of about 97.29%, an average performance index of about 94.51 % and an average quality value of 21.82 is obtained.

The method is a time consuming and error prone as it involves errors due to fatigue in continuous monitoring of nonlinear and nonstationary EEG signals. Out of approximate 1% of the world's epilepsy patients more than 25% cannot be treated correctly due to erroneous diagnosis. The automated seizure detection system can prove efficient by making the process reliable and faster. This paper reviews multi-domain feature extraction and machine learning classification techniques used in automated seizure detection systems. To analyse subtle variations in EEG, signal decomposition algorithms have been used in time, frequency, joint time-frequency, and nonlinear domain. The statistical and entropy parameters are the key features to discern normal from the seizure EEG signals. Machine learning plays a critical role in extracting meaningful information out of the extracted features. The paper also evaluates the performance of Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, naive Bayes, Least Square Support Vector Machine, k nearest neighbour, and random forest classifiers using sensitivity, specificity and accuracy metrics. A seizure detection technique is developed by decomposing the EEG signals by means of Tunable-Q Wavelet Transform (TQWT). To quantify the complexity of the individual multivariate sub-bands of the biomedical signals TQWT proves effective with varied values of Q factor suitable for analyzing signals with oscillatory and non-oscillatory nature. The highest accuracy of 97.3% is obtained using random forest classifier for the combination of spectral, Shannon and Kraskov entropy features. The paper compares the performance of feature extraction and classification techniques for the implemented system. The comparison explores possibility of hardware implementation of real time seizure detection scheme.

In this study, we propose a strategy with a cross-sectional analysis to evaluate the meditation experience with 2 artificial intelligence techniques: artificial neural network and support vector machine. Within this analysis system, 3 features of the electroencephalography alpha spectrum and variant normalizing scaling are manipulated as the evaluating variables for the detection of accuracy. Thereafter, by modulating the sliding window (the period of the analyzed data) and shifting interval of the window (the time interval to shift the analyzed data), the effect of immediate analysis for the 2 methods is compared. This analysis system is performed on 3 meditation groups, categorizing their meditation experiences in 10-year intervals from novice to junior and to senior. After an exhausted calculation and cross-validation across all variables, the high accuracy rate >98% is achievable under the criterion of 0.5-minute sliding window and 2 seconds shifting interval for both methods. In a word, the minimum analyzable data length is 0.5 minute and the minimum recognizable temporal resolution is 2seconds in the decision of meditative classification. Our proposed classifier of the meditation experience promotes a rapid evaluation system to distinguish meditation experience and a beneficial utilization of artificial techniques for the big-data analysis.

This readings help in forecasting the status of the brain Activity. It is studied that oscillations in the brain activity have been known since long time, but many fundamental aspects of such brain frequencies, particularly their functional importance were unclear. Detecting the alpha, beta, gamma, delta, theta patterns in brain activity that are related to person's intention to initiate control can be so for known as Electroencephalography. Basing on this phenomenon, the work is carried out to detect the brain wave as delta representing deeply sleep and not dreaming, theta representing drowsy and drifting down into sleep and dreams, alpha represents very relaxed and deepening into meditation, beta waves represents attention and gamma represents hyper brain activity or concentration. To implement this system brain sensor (TGAM EEG sensor), Arduino Uno board, Arduino Sketch IDE, processing IDE software is used to produce the Alpha, Beta, Delta, Theta, Gamma waves of brain graphically. This work can be initiative step for applications for the cognitive impaired people, especially in the cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder (BD).

EEG during motor imagery (MI) provides a non-muscular communication way to control external devices and has advantage of non-invasiveness and high time resolution. However the application is still limited by time-consuming training and poor classification rate with multiple categories etc. We recorded 64-channel scalp EEG from eight healthy subjects during imagery tasks of left, right hand movements and stop. EEG was analyzed in time-frequency distribution and spatial topographies were explored too. A one versus one common spatial pattern was applied to construct feature vector and then linear discriminant analysis was used for the classification. For the purpose of real time control in the future, small training size was used and we got discrimination among three types of motor imagery at the accuracy rate about 90%.

Many BCI studies have sought to investigate, detect, and recognize participants' emotional affective states. The applied domains for these studies are varied, and include such fields as communication, education, entertainment, and medicine. To understand trends in electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition system research and to provide practitioners and researchers with insights into and future directions for emotion recognition systems, this study set out to review published articles on emotion detection, recognition, and classification. The study also reviews current and future trends and discusses how these trends may impact researchers and practitioners alike. We reviewed 285 articles, of which 160 were refereed journal articles that were published since the inception of affective computing research. The articles were classified based on a scheme consisting of two categories: research orientation and domains/applications. Our results show considerable growth of EEG-based emotion detection journal publications. This growth reflects an increased research interest in EEG-based emotion detection as a salient and legitimate research area. Such factors as the proliferation of wireless EEG devices, advances in computational intelligence techniques, and machine learning spurred this growth.

The use of optimal spatial filtering by the method of common spatial pattern for the classification of EEG signals according to the type of brain activity	VISNYK NTUU KPI SERIIA-RADIOTEKHNIKA RADIOAPARATOBUDUVANNIA			Russian	Article						EEG; classification; CSP; BCI	COMPUTER INTERFACES	During EEG due to the volume conduction the signal from each individual source appears simultaneously in a number of channels registered from different leads. Therefore, the recorded EEG signal gives a blurred picture of human brain activity, which makes the task of classifying such signals rather complicated. One of the effective methods to obtain an informative signal from the EEG record is to use the optimal spatial filtering (some kind of deblurring), when the maximum content of the signal from the particular region of the brain (which corresponds to a certain type of brain activity) is achived in the output signal. An algorithm for classifying EEG signals using optimal spatial filtering by the method of common spatial pattern is proposed to identify two classes of brain activity - imaginary left and right hand movements. To evaluate the quality of the algorithm, an EEG record, known as BCI Competition IV dataset 2b, was used. To determine the efficacy of the algorithm, the result of its operation was compared with the result of the algorithm without using optimal spatial filtering. The use of optimal spatial filtering improved the accuracy of classification from 0.74 to 0.79, which has shown its efficacy.	[Kytsun, P. H.] Samsun Elect Ukraine Co Ltd, Kiev, Ukraine; [Kytsun, P.

Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and other spatio-spectral feature extraction methods become the most effective and principle successful solutions for MI-BCI pattern recognition in the recent few years. This paper applies Linear dynamical systems (LDS) referring to control field for EEG signals feature extraction and classification. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, this model has lots of obvious advantages, such as simultaneous generation spatial and temporal feature matrix, without complex preprocessing or post-processing, ease of use, and low cost. A study is shown to program by computer and assess the performance of feature selection and classification algorithms for use with the LDS.

However, it is often difficult to distinguish subtle but critical changes in the EEG waveform by human eye inspection (visual inspection), thus open a new research field for biomedical engineers to develop and implement several intelligent techniques for the identification of such subtle changes. The EEG signals categorized as non-linear and non-stationary in nature, which achieve to further complexities according to their manual interpretation and detection of normal and abnormal activities. Several classifiers have been proposed to improve accurate and computationally efficient techniques for EEG signal. Swarm optimization algorithms and machine learning classification techniques are usually used to obtain such analysis. This paper introduces a review for some of the preprocessing, feature extraction and classification methodologies used in EEG signals.

However, the classification performance of CSP typically deteriorates when a few training samples are collected from a new BCI user. In this paper, we propose an approach that maintains or improves the recognition accuracy of the system with only a small size of training data set. The proposed approach is formulated by regularizing the classical CSP technique with the strategy of transfer learning. Specifically, we incorporate into the CSP analysis inter-subject information involving the same task, by minimizing the difference between the inter-subject features. Experimental results on two data sets from BCI competitions show that the proposed approach greatly improves the classification performance over that of the conventional CSP method; the transformed variant proved to be successful in almost every case, based on a small number of available training samples.

We use two basic, shallow and deep ConvNet architectures recently shown to decode task-related information from EEG at least as well as established algorithms designed for this purpose. In decoding EEG pathology, both ConvNets reached substantially better accuracies (about 6% better, approximate to 85%) than the only published result for this dataset, and were still better when using only 1 minute of each recording for training and only six seconds of each recording for testing. We used automated methods to optimize architectural hyperparameters and found intriguingly different ConvNet architectures, e.g., with max pooling as the only nonlinearity. Visualizations of the ConvNet decoding behavior showed that they used spectral power changes in the delta (0-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) frequency range, possibly alongside other features, consistent with expectations derived from spectral analysis of the EEG data and from the textual medical reports. Analysis of the textual medical reports also highlighted the potential fur accuracy increases by integrating contextual information, such as the age of subjects. In summary, the ConvNets and visualization techniques used in this study constitute a next step towards clinically useful automated EEG diagnosis and establish a new baseline for future work on this topic.

This poses a severe problem for existing approaches to the classification task within brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Recently emerged type-2 fuzzy logic (T2FL) methodology has shown a remarkable potential in dealing with uncertain information given limited insight into the nature of the data-generating mechanism. The objective of this work is, thus, to examine the applicability of the T2FL approach to the problem of EEG pattern recognition. In particular, the focus is two-fold: 1) the design methodology for the interval T2FL system (IT2FLS) that can robustly deal with inter-session as well as within-session manifestations of nonstationary spectral EEG correlates of motor imagery, and 2) the comprehensive examination of the proposed fuzzy classifier in both off-line and on-line EEG classification case studies. The on-line evaluation of the IT2FLS-controlled real-time neurofeedback over multiple recording sessions holds special importance for EEG-based BCI technology. In addition, a retrospective comparative analysis accounting for other popular BCI classifiers such as linear discriminant analysis, kernel Fisher discriminant, and support vector machines as well as a conventional type-1 FLS, simulated off-line on the recorded EEGs, has demonstrated the enhanced potential of the proposed IT2FLS approach to robustly handle uncertainty effects in BCI classification.

For this purpose, approximately 24 hour-long EEG data, obtained during daily routine activities including sleep, was used. First, cepstrum coefficients of EEG signals were obtained in the frequency domain to construct the features SET. Second, a machine learning step was performed using these features with Support Vector Machines (SVM). Finally, gender identification was performed on the test data for which features were obtained in the same manner. Based on the initially obtained experimental results, epoc based gender classification success rate of the proposed method is 77.84% for the awake phase of the day while success rate is 89.66% for the sleep phase. Based on these results, it was determined that the biometric discriminative capability of the EEG signal varies at different times of the day.	[Oral, E. Argun; Ozbek, I.

In this thesis, automatic speech recognition of spoken words from brain waves based on digital signal processing and machine learning methods is proposed. For this system, EEG database for training and testing consist of 20 volunteers was built. Recognition accuracy of 50 phrases (Robot commands) achieved accuracy up to 5%.

However, less is understood with regard to how brain transition states influence a model and how it can be represented for a system. Herein we arc interested in the hidden information of brain state-drift occurring in both simulated and real-world human-system interaction. This research introduced the Riemann metric to categorize EEG data, and visualized the clustering result so that the distribution of the data can be observable. Moreover, to defeat subjective uncertainty of electroencephalography (EEG) signals, fuzzy theory was employed. In this study, we built a fuzzy rule-based brain-state drift detector to observe the brain state and imported data from different subjects to testify the performance. The result of the detection is acceptable and shown in this paper. In the future, we expect that brain-state drifting can be connected with human behaviors via the proposed fuzzy rule-based classification.

Motor Imagery and Error Related Potential Induced Position Control of a Robotic Arm	IEEE-CAA JOURNAL OF AUTOMATICA SINICA			English	Article						Brain-computer interfacing (BCI); error related potential (Errp); motor imagery decoding; position control of a robot arm	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; WAVELET TRANSFORM; EEG; COMMUNICATION; ARTIFACT; NEURONS; DESIGN; SYSTEM; P300	The paper introduces an electroencephalography (EEG) driven online position control scheme for a robot arm by utilizing motor imagery to activate and error related potential (ErrP) to stop the movement of the individual links, following a fixed (pre-defined) order of link selection. The right (left) hand motor imagery is used to turn a link clockwise (counterclockwise) and foot imagery is used to move a link forward. The occurrence of ErrP here indicates that the link under motion crosses the visually fixed target position, which usually is a plane/line/point depending on the desired transition of the link across 3D planes/around 2D lines/along 2D lines respectively. The imagined task about individual link's movement is decoded by a classifier into three possible class labels: clockwise, counterclockwise and no movement in case of rotational movements and forward, backward and no movement in case of translational movements. One additional classifier is required to detect the occurrence of the ErrP signal, elicited due to visually inspired positional link error with reference to a geometrically selected target position. Wavelet coefficients and adaptive autoregressive parameters are extracted as features for motor imagery and ErrP signals respectively. Support vector machine classifiers are used to decode motor imagination and ErrP with high classification accuracy above 80 %. The average time taken by the proposed scheme to decode and execute control intentions for the complete movement of three links of a robot is approximately 33 seconds. The steady-state error and peak overshoot of the proposed controller are experimentally obtained as 1.1 % and 4.6 % respectively.

However, a key impediment faced by wide deployment of these assistive smart devices, is the increasing privacy and security issue, such as how to protect access to sensitive patient data in the health record. Focusing on this challenge, biometrics are attracting intense attention in terms of effective user identification to enable confidential health applications. In this paper, we take special interest in two bio-potential-based biometric modalities, electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG), considering that they are both unique to individuals, and more reliable than token (identity card) and knowledge-based (username/password) methods. After extracting effective features in multiple domains from ECG/EEG signals, several advanced machine learning algorithms are introduced to perform the user identification task, including Neural Network, K-nearest Neighbor, Bagging, Random Forest and AdaBoost. Experimental results on two public ECG and EEG datasets show that ECG is a more robust biometric modality compared to EEG, leveraging a higher signal to noise ratio and also more distinguishable morphological patterns. Among different machine learning classifiers, the random forest greatly outperforms the others and owns an identification rate as high as 98%. This study is expected to demonstrate that properly selected biometric empowered by an effective machine learner owns a great potential, to enable confidential biomedicine applications in the era of smart digital health.

We used MindWave Mobile Headset devices to monitor electrical activity of the brain, to collect data generated by these devices (concentration and meditation levels, and brainwave patterns), and to assemble a dataset gathered from this capture. These data were pre-processed and analyzed, and we were able to make predictions based on the EEG data results. Using time series, the graphs presented indicated the levels of concentration and meditation over a period of time. We also carried out statistical analysis regarding the mean, median and moving average of attention and meditation. In addition, we performed experiments using Machine Learning techniques to identify: (i) the user of the Mindwave device, based on the electrical activity of the brain; (ii) the shift (day or night) at which monitoring was being performed, and (iii) the activity performed by the individual at the time of the encephalography.

Two approaches are considered and compared. The paper describes the significance of the standard TF approach for non-stationary signals; TF signal (TFS) features are defined by extending t-domain or (domain features to a joint (t, f) domain resulting in e.g. TF flatness and TF flux. The performance of the extended TFS features is comparatively assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis Area Under the Curve (AUC) measure. Experimental results confirm that the extended TFS features generally yield improved performance (up to 19%) when compared to the corresponding t-domain and f-domain features. The study also explores a second approach based on novel TF image (TFI) features that further improves TF-based classification of non-stationary signals. New TFI features are defined and extracted from the (t, f) domain; they include TF Hu invariant moments, TF Haralick features, and TF Local Binary Patterns (LBP). Using a state-of-the-art classifier, different metrics based on confusion matrix performance are compared for all extended TFS features and TFI features. Experimental results show the improved performance of TFI features over both TFS features and t-domain only or f-domain only features, for all TF representations and for all the considered performance metrics. The experiment is validated by comparing this new proposed methodology with a recent study, utilizing the same large and complex data set of EEG signals, and the same experimental setup. The resulting classification results confirm the superior performance of the proposed TFI features with accuracy improvement up to 5.52%. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the temporal domain, this process has been described in terms of temporal windows (TWs) of integration/segregation, in which the phase of ongoing neural oscillations determines whether two stimuli are integrated into a single percept or segregated into separate events. However, TWs can vary substantially, raising the question of whether different TWs map onto unique oscillations or, rather, reflect a single, general fluctuation in cortical excitability (e.g., in the alpha band). We used multivariate decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) data to investigate perception of stimuli that either repeated in the same location (two-flash fusion) or moved in space (apparent motion). By manipulating the interstimulus interval (ISI), we created bistable stimuli that caused subjects to perceive either integration (fusion/apparent motion) or segregation (two unrelated flashes). Training a classifier searchlight on the whole channels/frequencies/times space, we found that the perceptual outcome (integration vs. segregation) could be reliably decoded from the phase of prestimulus oscillations in right parieto-occipital channels. The highest decoding accuracy for the two-flash fusion task (ISI = 40 ms) was evident in the phase of alpha oscillations (8-10 Hz), while the highest decoding accuracy for the apparent motion task (ISI = 120 ms) was evident in the phase of theta oscillations (6-7 Hz). These results reveal a precise relationship between specific TW durations and specific oscillations. Such oscillations at different frequencies may provide a hierarchical framework for the temporal organization of perception.

Electroencephalograms (EEGs) record neural activity and can detect epilepsy. Visual inspection of an EEG signal for epileptic seizure detection is a time-consuming process and may lead to human error; therefore, recently, a number of automated seizure detection frameworks were proposed to replace these traditional methods. Feature extraction and classification are two important steps in these procedures. Feature extraction focuses on finding the informative features that could be used for classification and correct decision-making. Therefore, proposing effective feature extraction techniques for seizure detection is of great significance. METHODS: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used in different fields of pattern recognition including EEG signal classification. Global modular PCA (GModPCA) is a variation of PCA. In this paper, an effective framework with GModPCA and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is presented for epileptic seizure detection in EEG signals. The feature extraction is performed with GModPCA, whereas SVM trained with radial basis function kernel performed the classification between seizure and nonseizure EEG signals. Seven different experimental cases were conducted on the benchmark epilepsy EEG dataset. The system performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. In addition, we prove analytically that GModPCA has less time and space complexities as compared to PCA. RESULTS: The experimental results show that EEG signals have strong inter-sub-pattern correlations. GModPCA and SVM have been able to achieve 100% accuracy for the classification between normal and epileptic signals. Along with this, seven different experimental cases were tested. The classification results of the proposed approach were better than were compared the results of some of the existing methods proposed in literature. It is also found that the time and space complexities of GModPCA are less as compared to PCA. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that GModPCA and SVM could be used for automated epileptic seizure detection in EEG signal.

Both Chinese and German subjects, wearing electrode caps, watched video stimuli that triggered positive, neutral, and negative emotions. Two emotion classifiers are trained on Chinese EEG data and German EEG data, respectively. The experiment results indicate that: a) German neural patterns are basically in accordance with Chinese ones; b) the main difference lies in the upper temporal region in Delta band which activates more when a German is in positive mood; and c) the Chinese positive emotion achieves the best accuracy while German emotions share the approximate accuracy. Moreover, Gamma band serves as the critical band for both German and Chinese emotion recognition.

One of the current limitations of the standard training assessment procedures is the lack of information about the amount of cognitive resources requested by the user for the correct execution of the proposed task. In fact, even if the task is accomplished achieving the maximum performance, by the standard training assessment methods, it would not be possible to gather and evaluate information about cognitive resources available for dealing with unexpected events or emergency conditions. Therefore, a metric based on the brain activity (neurometric) able to provide the Instructor such a kind of information should be very important. As a first step in this direction, the Electroencephalogram (EEG) and the performance of 10 participants were collected along a training period of 3 weeks, while learning the execution of a new task. Specific indexes have been estimated from the behavioral and EEG signal to objectively assess the users' training progress. Furthermore, we proposed a neurometric based on a machine learning algorithm to quantify the user's training level within each session by considering the level of task execution, and both the behavioral and cognitive stabilities between consecutive sessions. The results demonstrated that the proposed methodology and neurometric could quantify and track the users' progresses, and provide the Instructor information for a more objective evaluation and better tailoring of training programs.

One of the key concept in B CI based on an analysis of the electrical activity of the human cerebral cortex is the use of visual evoked potentials-brain response to sensory stimuli. In this study, we investigated the applicability of various classifiers and machine learning algorithms for reliable classification of target and non-target VEPs in single-trial paradigm.

In this paper, we investigate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on the motor-imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) performance of stroke patients. To this end, we processed the EEG data collected from a randomized control trial (RCT) study of 19 stroke patients grouped into tDCS and sham. An ensemble method for feature extraction is proposed in this study that combines shrinkage regularized Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) features from the sensor-space and the cortical source-space Electroencephalography (EEG) across ten rehabilitation sessions. The classification results of MI vs. Idle state in stroke patients show that the concatenated features from both the sensor-and source space EEG provided an average cross-validation accuracy of 64.5% which is statistically significant (p < 0.001) compared to either using source or sensor-space features. Further, our findings suggest that the effect of tDCS on the stroke recovery is pronounced in subjects whose delta and alpha band power during the post-tDCS intervention is significantly higher as compared to before intervention. The group-averaged sLORETA activation results showed a significantly higher number of dipoles activated in the tDCS group as compared to sham. In summary, our study paves a new way to analyze the neural correlates of the MI-BCI performance for stroke rehabilitation.

Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is seen as state-of-the-art for SSVEP BCI systems. However, this assumes that the user has full control over their covert attention, which may not be the case. This introduces high calibration requirements when using other machine learning techniques. These may be circumvented by using transfer learning to utilize data from other participants. This paper proposes a combination of ensemble learning via Learn++ for Nonstationary Environments (Learn++.NSE) and similarity measures such as mutual information to identify ensembles of pre-existing data that result in higher classification. Results show that this approach performed worse than CCA in participants with typical SSVEP responses, but outperformed CCA in participants whose SSVEP responses violated CCA assumptions. This indicates that similarity measures and Learn++.NSE can introduce a transfer learning mechanism to bring SSVEP system accessibility to users unable to control their covert attention.

Compared to the traditional CSP, which maximizes the variance of signals in one class and minimizes the variance of signals in the other class, the classification accuracy is guaranteed by a constraint that the ratio of variances of signals in two different classes is lower bounded. Then, a sparse spatial filter is achieved by minimizing the l(1)-norm of filter coefficients and channels of EEG signals can be further optimized. The original nonconvex optimization problem is relaxed to a semidefinite program (SDP), which can be efficiently solved by well-developed numerical solvers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can identity and discard about 50% channels with only 1% decrease of classification accuracy.

EEG Analysis for Cognitive Failure Detection in Driving Using Type-2 Fuzzy Classifiers	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TOPICS IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						EEG; motor-execution and type-2 fuzzy classifiers; motor-planning; visual alertness	LOGIC SYSTEMS; INFERENCE SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; SETS; BAND	This paper aims at detecting online cognitive failures in driving by decoding the electroencephalography (EEG) signals acquired during visual alertness, motor planning and motor-execution phases of the driver. Visual alertness of the driver is detected by classifying the preprocessed EEG signals obtained from his prefrontal and frontal lobes into two classes: alert and nonalert. Motor planning performed by the driver using the preprocessed parietal signals is classified into four classes: braking, acceleration, steering control, and no operation. Cognitive failures in motor planning are determined by comparing the classified motor-planning class of the driver with the ground truth class obtained from the copilot through a hand-held rotary switch. Lastly, failure in motor execution is detected, when the time delay between the onset of motor imagination and the electromyogram response exceeds a predefined duration. The most important aspect of the present research lies in cognitive failure classification during the planning phase. The complexity in subjective plan classification arises due to possible overlap of signal features involved in braking, acceleration, and steering control. A specialized interval/general type-2 fuzzy set induced neural classifier is employed to eliminate the uncertainty in classification of motor planning. Experiments undertaken reveal that the proposed neuro-fuzzy classifier outperforms traditional techniques in presence of external disturbances to the driver. Decoding of visual alertness and motor execution are performed with kernelized support vector machine classifiers. An analysis reveals that at a driving speed of 64 km/h, the lead time is more than 600 ms, which offer a safe distance of 10.66 m.

Multivariate pattern analysis methods, such as decoding, have begun to reveal how the brain processes complex visual information. Recently, temporal decoding methods for EEG and MEG have offered the potential to evaluate the temporal dynamics of object recognition. Here we review the contribution of M/EEG time-series decoding methods to understanding visual object recognition in the human brain. Consistent with the current understanding of the visual processing hierarchy, low-level visual features dominate decodable object representations early in the time-course, with more abstract representations related to object category emerging later. A key finding is that the time-course of object processing is highly dynamic and rapidly evolving, with limited temporal generalisation of decodable information. Several studies have examined the emergence of object category structure, and we consider to what degree category decoding can be explained by sensitivity to low-level visual features. Finally, we evaluate recent work attempting to link human behaviour to the neural time-course of object processing.

BCI can be especially helpful for users with limb disabilities or limitations as it does not require any muscle movement and instead relies on user's brain activity. These brain activities are recorded using electroencephalogram (EEG). Classification of the EEG data will help to map the relevant data to certain stimuli effect. The work in this paper is aiming to find a feature extraction technique that can lead to improve the classification accuracy of EEG based BCI systems that are specifically designed for incapacitated subjects. Through the experiments, the implementation of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) extracted features from P300 based BCI EEG data and it was found that ICA and CSP produce more discriminative feature sets as compared to raw EEG signals.

One of the major stages of motor imagery systems is reducing the dimensions of the input data and enhancing the features prior to applying a classification stage to recognize the intended movement. In this paper, we utilize autoencoders as a powerful tool to enhance the input features of the band power filtered electroencephalography (EEG) data. We compare the performance of the auto encoder-based approach to using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our results demonstrate that using auto encoders with non-linear activation function achieves better performance compared to using PCA. We demonstrate the effects of varying the number of hidden nodes of the autoencoder as well as the activation function on the performance. We finally examine the characteristics of the trained autoencoders to identify the features that are most relevant for the motor imagery classification task.

J	Chen, CM; Wang, JY; Yu, CM				Chen, Chih-Ming; Wang, Jung-Ying; Yu, Chih-Ming			Assessing the attention levels of students by using a novel attention aware system based on brainwave signals	BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							DIFFERENT MULTIMEDIA MATERIALS; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; COMPUTER INTERFACE; GAMMA-ACTIVITY; VISUAL FOCUS; HEAD POSE; EEG; PERFORMANCE; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Rapid progress in information and communication technologies (ICTs) has fueled the popularity of e-learning. However, an e-learning environment is limited in that online instructors cannot monitor immediately whether students remain focus during online autonomous learning. Therefore, this study tries to develop a novel attention aware system (AAS) capable of recognizing students' attention levels accurately based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals, thus having high potential to be applied in providing timely alert for conveying low-attention level feedback to online instructors in an e-learning environment. To construct AAS, attention responses of students and their corresponding EEG signals are gathered based on a continuous performance test (CPT), ie, an attention assessment test. Next, the AAS is constructed by using training and testing data by the NeuroSky brainwave detector and the support vector machine (SVM), a well-known machine learning model. Additionally, based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the collected EEG signals are decomposed into five primary bands (ie, alpha, beta, gamma, theta, and delta). Each primary band contains five statistical parameters (including approximate entropy, total variation, energy, skewness, and standard deviation), thus generating 25 potential brainwave features associated with students' attention level for constructing the AAS. An attempt based on genetic algorithm (GA) is also made to enhance the prediction performance of the proposed AAS in terms of identifying students' attention levels. According to GA, the seven most influential features are selected from 25 considered features; parameters of the proposed AAS are also optimized. Analytical results indicate that the proposed AAS can accurately recognize individual student's attention state as either a high or low level, and the average accuracy rate reaches as high as 89.52%. Moreover, the proposed AAS is integrated with a video lecture tagging system to examine whether the proposed AAS can accurately detect students' low-attention periods while learning about electrical safety in the workplace via a video lecture. Four experiments are designed to assess the prediction performance of the proposed AAS in terms of identifying the periods of video lecture with high- or low-attention levels during learning processes. Analytical results indicate that the proposed AAS can accurately identify the low-attention periods of video lecture generated by students when engaging in a learning activity with video lecture. Meanwhile, the proposed AAS can also accurately identify the low-attention periods of video lecture generated by students to some degree even when students engage in a learning activity by a video lecture with random disturbances. Furthermore, strong negative correlations are found between the students' learning performance (ie, posttest score and progressive score) and the low-attention periods of video lecture identified by the proposed AAS. Results of this study demonstrate that the proposed AAS is effective, capable of assisting online instructors in evaluating students' attention levels to enhance their online learning performance.

In this paper, an improved relevance vector machine (RVM) is proposed to classify four-class motor imagery EEG signals. The original EEG signals are processed by 3-24Hz band-pass filter. Thereafter, EEG feature vectors are extracted from the band-pass filtered EEG signals with one versus one common spatial patterns (OVO-CSP). Then, the improved RVM algorithm with kernel function, which combines Gaussian kernel function and Cauchy kernel function, is applied to classify the EEG signals. A public dataset (BCI Competition IV-II-a) is employed to verify the proposed improved kernel function method. Five-fold cross-validation was used to ensure that the classification of the experiment is more credible. The classification results of the combined kernel function are compared with results of the Gaussian kernel function and the Cauchy kernel function. The experimental results show that the highest classification accuracy of the proposed kernel function and the single kernel function in the first data set are 64.40% and 60.60%, respectively, and in the second data sets are 67.58% and 63.33%. The average classification accuracy of the proposed kernel function is 4%-4.19% higher than that of the single kernel function. These results show that the proposed method is advantageous in the classification of four-class motor imagery.

Various methods in machine learning have been applied for EEG emotion classification and among these techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) has demonstrated that it can provide good classification results. Therefore, SVM has been used widely in Affective Brain-Computer Interfaces (aBCI). However, EEG signals are non-stationary and they normally associate with outliers and uncertainties, and these issues could affect the performance of SVM. This study proposes the use of Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (FSVM) to deal with these issues. A benchmark dataset, Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals (DEAP), was used for subject-dependence classification. The experimental results showed that FSVM could deal with uncertainties and outliers, and enhanced the accuracies of arousal, valence and dominance classifications when compared to the SVM. Moreover, it was found that when gamma band was used as a feature from the two channels gave the best performance in comparison to other bands.

In our research, we used Deep Neural Network (DNN) to address EEG-based emotion recognition. This was motivated by the recent advances in accuracy and efficiency from applying deep learning techniques in pattern recognition and classification applications. We adapted DNN to identify human emotions of a given EEG signal (DEAP dataset) from power spectral density (PSD) and frontal asymmetry features. The proposed approach is compared to state-of-the-art emotion detection systems on the same dataset. Results show how EEG based emotion recognition can greatly benefit from using DNNs, especially when a large amount of training data is available.

In this paper, we apply deep learning on a set of 57 EEG features extracted from a maximum of two EEG channels to accurately differentiate between patients with insomnia or controls with no sleep complaints. We investigated two different approaches to achieve this. The first approach used EEG data from the whole sleep recording irrespective of the sleep stage (stage-independent classification), while the second used only EEG data from insomnia-impacted specific sleep stages (stage-dependent classification). We trained and tested our system using both healthy and disordered sleep collected from 41 controls and 42 primary insomnia patients. When compared with manual assessments, an NREM + REM based classifier had an overall discrimination accuracy of 92% and 86% between two groups using both two and one EEG channels, respectively. These results demonstrate that deep learning can be used to assist in the diagnosis of sleep disorders such as insomnia.

The objective of this framework is to present a multi-view feature fusion strategy using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) that can effectively classify various classes of Electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns. Method: To make the best use of inherent class information, we first created multi-view vectors (MVVs) registering templates (i.e., signals) associated with study specific class groups through a given strategy, followed by projection to extract compact views, which are then fused via parallel fusion and then, applied to classification. Results: On EEG data, the learned patterns effectively represent underlying information they were trained, with significant performance in terms of markers. Further, its comparison with state-of-the arts manifests the efficacy of adopted model. Conclusion: The methodology effectively classify various EEG patterns. Significance: The significant reduction of complexity and dimensionality with enhanced information space envisages the possible extension of this work to alleviate the onus of clinician of large volume data and also expedite the large scale research.

Neural signatures involved in gesture recognition	2017 12TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATIC FACE AND GESTURE RECOGNITION (FG 2017)	IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition and Workshops		English	Proceedings Paper	12th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG)	MAY 30-JUN 03, 2017	Washington, DC	IEEE, Baidu, Mitsubishi Elect Res Labs Inc, 3dMD, DI4D, Syst & Technol Res, ObjectVideo Labs, MUKH Technologies, IEEE Comp Soc			LANGUAGE	Previous work in the area of gesture production, has made the assumption that machines can replicate human-like gestures by connecting a bounded set of salient points in the motion trajectory. Those inflection points were hypothesized to also display cognitive saliency. The purpose of this paper is to validate that claim using electroencephalography (EEG). That is, this paper attempts to find neural signatures of gestures (also referred as placeholders) in human cognition, which facilitate the understanding, learning and repetition of gestures. Further, it is discussed whether there is a direct mapping between the placeholders and kinematic salient points in the gesture trajectories. These are expressed as relationships between inflection points in the gestures trajectories with oscillatory mu rhythms (8-12 Hz) in the EEG. This is achieved by correlating fluctuations in mu power during gesture observation with salient motion points found for each gesture. Peaks in the EEG signal at central electrodes (motor cortex; C3/Cz/C4) and occipital electrodes (visual cortex; O3/Oz/O4) were used to isolate the salient events within each gesture. We found that a linear model predicting mu peaks from motion inflections fits the data well. Increases in EEG power were detected 380 and 500ms after inflection points at occipital and central electrodes, respectively. These results suggest that coordinated activity in visual and motor cortices is sensitive to motion trajectories during gesture observation, and it is consistent with the proposal that inflection points operate as placeholders in gesture recognition.

To generate surrogate data, the statically transformed autoregressive process (STAP) algorithm is deployed, and, the correlation dimension (CD) and asymmetry due to time reversal (REV) are applied as discriminating statistics. The results of the surrogate data test demonstrate the nonlinearity characteristic of real neonatal EEG signals during both burst and suppression phases at the 0.05 significance level. The evidence of nonlinearity is found in 90% and 87% of bursts and suppressions respectively. Furthermore, the ability of nonlinear tools in detecting B/S patterns in multichannel neonatal EEG signals is investigated using receiver operating characteristic analysis. The experimental results show that the CD outperforms existing methods based on the nonlinear energy operator. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, due to the ambiguity of human emotions and the complexity of EEG signals, the EEG-ER system which can recognize emotions with high accuracy is not easy to achieve. In this paper, by combining discrete wavelet transform, correlation analysis, and neural network methods, we propose an Emotional Recognition model based on rhythm synchronization patterns to distinguish the emotional stimulus responses to different emotional audio and video. In this model, the entire scalp conductance signal is analyzed from a joint time-frequency-space correlation, which is beneficial to the depth learning and expression of affective pattern, and then improve the accuracy of recognition. The accuracy of the proposed multi-layer EEG-ER system is compared with various feature extraction methods. For analysis results, average and maximum classification rates of 64% and 67.0% were obtained for arousal and 66.6% and 76.0% for valence.

Reducing training requirements through evolutionary based dimension reduction and subject transfer	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Particle Swarm Optimization; Dimension reduction; Brain computer interface; Subject transfer	EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; EEG-BASED COMMUNICATION; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; PATTERN	Training Brain Computer Interface (BCI) systems to understand the intention of a subject through Electroencephalogram (EEG) data currently requires multiple training sessions with a subject in order to develop the necessary expertise to distinguish signals for different tasks. Conventionally the task of training the subject is done by introducing a training and calibration stage during which some feedback is presented to the subject. This training session can take several hours which is not appropriate for on-line EEG-based BCI systems. An alternative approach is to use previous recording sessions of the same person or some other subjects that performed the same tasks (subject transfer) for training the classifiers. The main aim of this study is to generate a methodology that allows the use of data from other subjects while reducing the dimensions of the data. The study investigates several possibilities for reducing the necessary training and calibration period in subjects and the classifiers and addresses the impact of i) evolutionary subject transfer and adapting previously trained methods (retraining) using other subjects data. Our results suggest reduction to 40% of target subject data is suffidient for training the classifier. Our results also indicate the superiority of the approaches that incorporated evolutionary subject transfer and highlights the feasibility of adapting a system trained on other subjects.

In particular, those learning principles can effectively model emotion classifiers via heterogeneous features. By exploring the exciting literature, the subject-specific emotion estimator has a significant disadvantage, i.e., it induces additional burdens to a single user because of the preparation of long-time, multiple-session EEG data as reliable training sets. In this paper, we propose a new subject generic EEG feature selection method called transfer recursive feature elimination (T-RFE), to find the optimal feature subset that consists of the most robust EEG markers of stable distributions among multiple training subjects and a single testing subject. We adopt the DEAP database to validate the effectiveness of the T-RFE algorithm. The subject-generic emotion classification paradigm is also constructed and investigated. By implementing a linear least square support vector machine model, the T-RFE performance is compared with several conventional feature selection methods. We also found the statistical significance in the improvement of the classification accuracy. The classification rate and F-score outperform several recent reported works on the same database.

Importantly, there is a growing need for a better understanding of brain plasticity and the neural involvements for the initiation and control of these abilities so as to develop better rehabilitation programmes and external support devices. In this paper, we attempt to identify gait-related neural activities by decoding neural signals obtained from electroencephalography (EEG) measurements while subjects performed three types of walking: without exoskeleton (free walking), and with exoskeleton support (zero force and assisting force). An average classification accuracy of 92.0% for training and 73.8% for testing sets was achieved using features extracted from mu and beta frequency bands. Furthermore, we found that mu band features contributed significantly to the classification accuracy and were localized mainly in sensorimotor regions that are associated with the control of the exoskeleton. These findings contribute meaningful insight on the neural dynamics associated with lower limb movements and provide useful information for future developments of orthotic devices and rehabilitation programs.

Therefore, human factors study in air traffic control (ATC) is increasingly essential, paving the way to a safer air transportation system. In this paper, we conducted an ATC experiment, where Electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected throughout the experiment. Compared to traditional questionnaires and psychological tests used in human factors study, the proposed novel EEG approach provides monitoring of situation awareness (SA) in a non-invasive and non-interruptive fashion. SA was represented as the response latency in situation-present assessment method (SPAM), which was predicted from EEG signals using three machine learning algorithms. Support vector regression obtained the lowest prediction error of 1.5 seconds, which is lower than 10% of the range of actual response latency. The results show that EEG is a promising approach forward in measuring situation awareness of ATCOs in both real-time and accurate manner.

A method that has established itself as an important part of EEG analysis is the application of independent component analysis (ICA). It decomposes the multi-channel EEG into linearly independent components (ICs) that then can be classified as artifact or EEG signal component. However, classification of the ICs still requires visual, time-intensive inspection by experts. In order to develop an automated artifact elimination method, we apply several classification algorithms on feature vectors extracted from ICA components via image processing algorithms. We compare their performance with the ratings of experts and identify range filtering as a feature extraction method with great potential. Range images classified with artificial neuronal networks yield accuracy rates of 95.5%. The results are very promising regarding automated IC artifact recognition. Compared to existing automated solutions the proposed method has the main advantage that it is not limited to a specific number or type of artifact. Furthermore, it is an automatic, real-time capable, and practical tool that reduces the time-intensive manual selection of ICs for artifact removal.

Therefore, it is necessary to diagnose stroke in the early stage and give accurate prognosis assessment to improve stroke management. This study tried to automatically classify AIS severity based on EEG signals by using digital signal processing such as Wavelet transform and feedforward type of neural network with ELM algorithm. In this study, Delta Alpha Ratio (DAR), (Delta+Theta)/(Alpha+Beta) Ratio (DTABR) and Brain Symmetry Index (BSI)'s value were used as the ELM input feature score, which were obtained by using Wavelet transformation (Daubechies 4) and Welch's method to classify the acute ischemic stroke severity which refers to the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). It had shown that the performance of system test accuracy, the sensitivity and specificity were above 72%. These results were useful for classifying AIS based on EEG signals.

However, EEG recordings are contaminated by other interferences, particularly facial and ocular artifacts generated by the user. This is specifically an issue during continuous EEG recording sessions, and is therefore a key step in using EEG signals for either physiological monitoring and diagnosis or brain-computer interface to identify such artifacts from useful EEG components. In this study, we aim to design a new generic framework in order to process and characterize EEG recording as a multi-component and non-stationary signal with the aim of localizing and identifying its component (e.g., artifact). In the proposed method, we gather three complementary algorithms together to enhance the efficiency of the system. Algorithms include time-frequency (TF) analysis and representation, two-dimensional multi-resolution analysis (2D MRA), and feature extraction and classification. Then, a combination of spectro-temporal and geometric features are extracted by combining key instantaneous TF space descriptors, which enables the system to characterize the non-stationarities in the EEG dynamics. We fit a curvelet transform (as a MRA method) to 2D TF representation of EEG segments to decompose the given space to various levels of resolution. Such a decomposition efficiently improves the analysis of the TF spaces with different characteristics (e.g., resolution). Our experimental results demonstrate that the combination of expansion to TF space, analysis using MRA, and extracting a set of suitable features and applying a proper predictive model is effective in enhancing the EEG artifact identification performance. We also compare the performance of the designed system with another common EEG signal processing technique-namely, 1D wavelet transform. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms 1D wavelet.

Thus, motor imagery classification in ALS patients has been considered challenging in the brain-computer interface (BCI) community. In this study, we address this critical issue by introducing the Grassberger-Procaccia and Higuchi's methods to estimate the fractal dimensions (GPFD and HFD, respectively) of the electroencephalography (EEG) signals from ALS patients. Moreover, a Fisher's criterion-based channel selection strategy is proposed to automatically determine the best patient-dependent channel configuration from 30 EEG recording sites. An EEG data collection paradigm is designed to collect the EEG signal of resting state and the imagination of three movements, including right hand grasping (RH), left hand grasping (LH), and left foot stepping (LF). Five late-stage ALS patients without receiving any SMR training participated in this study. Experimental results show that the proposed GPFD feature is not only superior to the previously-used SMR features (mu and beta band powers of EEG from sensorimotor cortex) but also better than HFD. The accuracies achieved by the SMR features are not satisfactory (all lower than 80%) in all binary classification tasks, including RH imagery vs. resting, LH imagery vs. resting, and LF imagery vs. resting. For the discrimination between RH imagery and resting, the average accuracies of GPFD in 30-channel (without channel selection) and top-five-channel configurations are 95.25% and 93.50%, respectively. When using only one channel (the best channel among the 30), a high accuracy of 91.00% can still be achieved by the GPFD feature and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The results also demonstrate that the proposed Fisher's criterion-based channel selection is capable of removing a large amount of redundant and noisy EEG channels. The proposed GPFD feature extraction combined with the channel selection strategy can be used as the basis for further developing high-accuracy and high-usability motor imagery BCI systems from which the patients with ALS can really benefit.

However, the commonly used electroencephalography (EEG) provides signals of low signal-to-noise ratio, making the systems slow and inaccurate. As an alternative noninvasive recording technique, the magnetoencephalography (MEG) could provide more advantageous electrophysiological signals due to a higher number of sensors and the magnetic fields not being influenced by volume conduction. We investigated whether MEG provides higher accuracy in detecting event-related fields (ERFs) compared to detecting ERPs in simultaneously recorded EEG, both evoked by a covert attention task, and whether a combination of the modalities is advantageous. In our approach, a detection algorithm based on spatial filtering is used to identify ERP/ERF components in a data-driven manner. We found that MEG achieves higher decoding accuracy (DA) compared to EEG and that the combination of both further improves the performance significantly. However, MEG data showed poor performance in cross-subject classification, indicating that the algorithm's ability for transfer learning across subjects is better in EEG. Here we show that BCI control by covert attention is feasible with EEG and MEG using a data-driven spatial filter approach with a clear advantage of the MEG regarding DA but with a better transfer learning in EEG.

Brain-machine interfaces (BMI) exploiting these signals have been developed to provide closed-loop feedback and induce neuro-plasticity. Several offline and online studies have already demonstrated that discriminable information related to movement can be decoded from low-frequency EEG activity. However, there is still not a well-established procedure to guarantee that this activity is optimally filtered from the background noise. This work compares different configurations of non-causal (i.e., offline) and causal (i.e., online) filters to classify movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP) with six healthy subjects during reaching movements. Our results reveal important differences in MRCP decoding accuracy dependent on the selected frequency band for both offline and online approaches. In summary, this paper underlines the importance of optimally choosing filter parameters, since their variable response has an impact on the classification of low EEG frequencies for BMI.

Methods: We studied EEG activity in epilepsy patients with lesional epilepsy. Lesions were classified by type and by location (region and depth). We marked a maximum of 50 IEDs during deep non-rapid eye movement sleep. IEDs were identified as spikes or sharp waves with or without slow waves, or bursts of spikes or sharp waves with or without slow waves. We analyzed HFOs in the studies showing at least 50 IEDs. Results: In 192 scalp EEG studies, the differences in the percentage of studies showing IEDs in each depth-related group were not statistically significant, whereas HFOs (55 studies) predominated in patients exhibiting superficial lesions (p < 0.001). Sharp waves, as predominant pattern, were more prevalent in hippocampal abnormalities (p < 0.001), whereas bursts predominated in patients with malformations of cortical development (p < 0.001). Significance: The depth of the lesion does not influence the presence of IEDs, as one might expect, but it influences that of HFOs. This is explained as follows. HFOs are generated in the epileptogenic region, do not propagate, and hence are only visible on scalp EEG with superficial lesions. IEDs can result from a nearby focus or propagate from a deep generator and are therefore equally present with deep, intermediate, and superficial lesions. Additionally, IED morphology provides information in determining the lesion type.

EEG analysis of seizure patterns using visibility graphs for detection of generalized seizures	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Visibility graph (VG); Horizontal VG (HVG); Difference VG (DVG); EEG seizure pattern; Seizure detection; Intellectual disability	THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; COMPLEX NETWORKS; TIME-SERIES; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM; BRAIN	Background: The traditional EEG features in the time and frequency domain show limited seizure detection performance in the epileptic population with intellectual disability (ID). In addition, the influence of EEG seizure patterns on detection performance was less studied. New method: A single-channel EEG signal can be mapped into visibility graphs (VGS), including basic visibility graph (VG), horizontal VG (HVG), and difference VG (DVG). These graphs were used to characterize different EEG seizure patterns. To demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying EEG seizure patterns and detecting generalized seizures, EEG recordings of 615 h on one EEG channel from 29 epileptic patients with ID were analyzed. Results: A novel feature set with discriminative power for seizure detection was obtained by using the VGS method. The degree distributions (DDs) of DVG can clearly distinguish EEG of each seizure pattern. The degree entropy and power-law degree power in DVG were proposed here for the first time, and they show significant difference between seizure and non-seizure EEG. The connecting structure measured by HVG can better distinguish seizure EEG from background than those by VG and DVG. Comparison with existing method: A traditional EEG feature set based on frequency analysis was used here as a benchmark feature set. With a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, the seizure detection performance of the benchmark feature set (sensitivity of 24%, FDt/h of 1.8s) can be improved by combining our proposed VGS features extracted from one EEG channel (sensitivity of 38%, FDt/h of 1.4s). Conclusions: The proposed VGS-based features can help improve seizure detection for ID patients. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Wang, Lei; Long, Xi; Arends, Johan B. A.

The ability to passively identify yet accurately correlate brainwaves with our immediate emotions opens up truly meaningful and previously unattainable human-computer interactions such as in forensic neuroscience, rehabilitative medicine, affective entertainment and neuro-marketing. One particularly useful yet rarely explored areas of EEG-based emotion classification is preference recognition [1], which is simply the detection of like versus dislike. Within the limited investigations into preference classification, all reported studies were based on musically-induced stimuli except for a single study which used 2D images. The main objective of this study is to apply deep learning, which has been shown to produce state-of-the-art results in diverse hard problems such as in computer vision, natural language processing and audio recognition, to 3D object preference classification over a larger group of test subjects. A cohort of 16 users was shown 60 bracelet-like objects as rotating visual stimuli on a computer display while their preferences and EEGs were recorded. After training a variety of machine learning approaches which included deep neural networks, we then attempted to classify the users' preferences for the 3D visual stimuli based on their EEGs.

One of tools to support the diagnosis of epilepsy is Electroencephalograph (EEG), which describes the recording of brain electrical activity. Abnormal EEG patterns in epilepsy patients consist of Spike and Sharp waves. While both waves, there is a normal pattern that sometimes misinterpreted as epileptiform by electroenchepalographer (EEGer), namely Wicket Spike. The main difference of the three waves are on the time duration that related to the frequency. In this study, we proposed a method to classify a EEG wave into Sharp wave, Spike wave or Wicket spike group using Backpropagation Neural Network based on the frequency and amplitude of each wave. The results show that the proposed method can classifies the three group of waves with good accuracy.

The aim is to improve the variance between the normal and abnormal EEG patterns in feature extraction process. The affinity matrix of the graph spectral decomposition that derive the Laplacian matrix encodes the dataset of the CSP covariance matrix as a correlation instead of Euclidean (or Minkowski) distance on Gaussian kernel function. The feature vector containing pattern of abnormality is sorted in order of the magnitude of their simple statistical mean values. The results obtained show that the CSP-Spectral Graph Decompsotion approach seems to provide a better discriminative features than CSP feature extraction process.

Classifying the Perceptual Interpretations of a Bistable Image Using EEG and Artificial Neural Networks	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain; ambiguous image; multistability; EEG; artificial neuronal network; brain states recognition	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NECKER CUBE; SLEEP SPINDLES; DYNAMICS; FEATURES; PATTERN; BAND; CLASSIFICATION; MULTISTABILITY; REPRESENTATION	In order to classify different human brain states related to visual perception of ambiguous images, we use an artificial neural network (ANN) to analyze multichannel EEG. The classifier built on the basis of a multilayer perceptron achieves up to 95% accuracy in classifying EEG patterns corresponding to two different interpretations of the Necker cube. The important feature of our classifier is that trained on one subject it can be used for the classification of EEG traces of other subjects. This result suggests the existence of common features in the EEG structure associated with distinct interpretations of bistable objects. We firmly believe that the significance of our results is not limited to visual perception of the Necker cube images; the proposed experimental approach and developed computational technique based on ANN can also be applied to study and classify different brain states using neurophysiological data recordings. This may give new directions for future research in the field of cognitive and pathological brain activity, and for the development of brain-computer interfaces.

The influences of different factors on agreement were determined.& para;& para;Results: 1919 Events extracted from 280 h EEG of 71 neonates were reviewed by 4 raters. Majority voting was applied to assign a seizure/non-seizure classification. 44% of events were classified with high, 36% with moderate, and 20% with poor agreement, resulting in a Kappa value o f 0.39. 68% of events were labelled as seizures, and in 46%, all raters were convinced about electrographic seizures. The most common seizure duration was <30 s. Raters agreed best for seizures lasting 60-120 s. There was a significant difference in electrographic characteristics of seizures versus dubious events, with seizures having longer duration, higher power and amplitude.& para;& para;Conclusions: There is a wide variability in identifying rhythmic ictal and non-ictal EEG events, and only the most robust ictal patterns are consistently agreed upon. Database composition and electrographic characteristics are important factors that influence interrater agreement.& para;& para;Significance: The use of well-described databases and input of different experts will improve neonatal EEG interpretation and help to develop uniform seizure definitions, useful for evidence-based studies of seizure recognition and management.

J	Vareka, L; Mautner, P				Vareka, Lukas; Mautner, Pavel			Stacked Autoencoders for the P300 Component Detection	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-computer interfaces; deep learning; event-related potentials; machine learning; P300; stacked autoencoders	CLASSIFICATION; BCI	Novel neural network training methods (commonly referred to as deep learning) have emerged in recent years. Using a combination of unsupervised pre-training and subsequent fine-tuning, deep neural networks have become one of the most reliable classification methods. Since deep neural networks are especially powerful for high-dimensional and non-linear feature vectors, electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) are one of the promising applications. Furthermore, to the authors' best knowledge, there are very few papers that study deep neural networks for EEG/ERP data. The aim of the experiments subsequently presented was to verify if deep learning-based models can also perform well for single trial P300 classification with possible application to P300-based brain-computer interfaces. The P300 data used were recorded in the EEG/ERP laboratory at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of West Bohemia, and are publicly available. Stacked autoencoders (SAEs) were implemented and compared with some of the currently most reliable state-of-the-art methods, such as LDA and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The parameters of stacked autoencoders were optimized empirically. The layers were inserted one by one and at the end, the last layer was replaced by a supervised softmax classifier. Subsequently, fine-tuning using backpropagation was performed. The architecture of the neural network was 209-130-100-50-20-2. The classifiers were trained on a dataset merged from four subjects and subsequently tested on different 11 subjects without further training. The trained SAE achieved 69.2% accuracy that was higher (p < 0.01) than the accuracy of MLP (64.9%) and LDA (65.9%). The recall of 58.8% was slightly higher when compared with MLP (56.2%) and LDA (58.4%). Therefore, SAEs could be preferable to other state-of-the-art classifiers for high-dimensional event-related potential feature vectors.

The mining problems that are studied in this paper are lag correlation discovery and classification. For the first problem, a new lag correlation algorithm for time series, the Highly Sparse Lag Correlation (HSLC) is proposed. This algorithm is a combination of Boolean Lag Correlation (BLC) and Hierarchical Boolean Representation (HBR) algorithms and aims to improve the time performance of Pearson Lag Correlation (PLC) algorithm. The classification algorithm that is employed for data streams is an incremental support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed schemes, the lag correlation discovery algorithm is experimentally tested on electroencephalography (EEG) data, whereas the classification algorithm that operates on streams is tested on real financial data. The HSLC algorithm achieves better time performance than previous state-of-the-art methods such as the PLC algorithm and the incremental SVM learning algorithm that we adopt, increases the accuracy achieved by non-incremental models.

However, they still are not used in everyday life because BCIs are controlled by means of few intuitive electrophysiological sources. To address this problem, work has been carried out with the objective of classifying EEG signals recorded while imagining speech. In this paper, the emerging techniques of sonification and textification are applied to EEG signals, which allows us to characterize EEG signals as either an audio signal or a text document. The aim is to analyze whether these techniques can help to do a better discrimination or to highlight patterns, and assess which of the two methods performs better in order to improve classification results of unspoken words. For proving this we processed signals, from 27 subjects, with and without the application of the proposed methods of sonification and textification. The average accuracy rate using the original EEG signals, the EEG sonified signals and the EEG textified signals are 58.41 +/- 12.41%, 63.82 +/- 13.44% and 83.34 +/- 6.12%, respectively. It can be clearly noticed that the methods of sonification and textification of EEG improve the classification rates obtained using the EEG signals in their original form. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This method however requires the clean speech signals of both the attended and the unattended speaker to be available as reference signals. Since in practice only the binaural signals consisting of a reverberant mixture of both speakers and background noise are available, in this paper we explore the potential of using these (unprocessed) signals as reference signals for decoding auditory attention in different acoustic conditions (anechoic, reverberant, noisy, and reverberant-noisy). In addition, we investigate whether it is possible to use these signals instead of the clean attended speech signal for filter training. The experimental results show that using the unprocessed binaural signals for filter training and for decoding auditory attention is feasible with a relatively large decoding performance, although for most acoustic conditions the decoding performance is significantly lower than when using the clean speech signals.

These methods improve recognition performance of human mental states showing intrinsic motivation from brain wave. Conventionally, data augmentation is used to image recognition research. Scaling, rotation, and distortion are applied to the original images to increase examples for machine learning. However, these augmentation methods are not effective for use with biological signals, as they involve spatial manipulation designed to represent the fluctuations of natural images. In the present study, we proposed four novel methods for data augmentation of biological signals. These methods are designed to represent variations inherent to bio-signals, especially for event-related signals. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data from participants engaged in an intrinsic motivation task were utilized to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed data augmentation methods. Our findings demonstrated that the proposed methods are particularly effective for improving prediction accuracy in small datasets.

Many individuals with ASD show severe deficits in facial affect recognition, an important component of social communication. In recent years, computer-assisted technologies (CAT) have been developed to train the facial affect recognition skills of individuals with ASD. The goal of this paper is to explore whether electroencephalogram (EEG) could be used to predict the performance of facial affect recognition of individuals with ASD, so that CAT-based intervention system could be dynamically adapted according to the needs of specific individuals. In addition, we investigated whether verbal communication, which serves as the social context for the emotional facial expression, could provide valuable information to improve the accuracy of facial affect recognition performance prediction. We designed a CAT-based facial affect recognition task with seven emotional facial expressions and four strength levels. EEG data were recorded from eight subjects; each of them participated in two sessions. The extracted time and frequency domain features were evaluated with seven machine learning algorithms. Results indicate that EEG-based facial affect recognition performance prediction achieved high accuracies. The social context that related to the emotional facial expression was shown to increase the performance prediction accuracy. This improvement is statistically significant with a medium effect size. The averaged best classification results is 87%. These results provide the basis for the development of an adaptive closed-loop CAT-based training system to teach individuals with ASD the facial affect recognition skills.

EEG Channels Reduction using PCA to Increase XGBoost's Accuracy for Stroke Detection	INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON CURRENT PROGRESS IN MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCES 2016 (ISCPMS 2016)	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Symposium on Current Progress in Mathematics and Sciences (ISCPMS)	NOV 01-02, 2016	Univ Indonesia, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Depok, INDONESIA		Univ Indonesia, Fac Math & Nat Sci			In Indonesia, based on the result of Basic Health Research 2013, the number of stroke patients had increased from 8.3 % (2007) to 12.1 % (2013). These days, some researchers are using electroencephalography (EEG) result as another option to detect the stroke disease besides CT Scan image as the gold standard. A previous study on the data of stroke and healthy patients in National Brain Center Hospital (RS PON) used Brain Symmetry Index (BSI), Delta-Alpha Ratio (DAR), and Delta-Theta-Alpha-Beta Ratio (DTABR) as the features for classification by an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The study got 85% accuracy with sensitivity above 86 % for acute ischemic stroke detection. Using EEG data means dealing with many data dimensions, and it can reduce the accuracy of classifier (the curse of dimensionality). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) could reduce dimensionality and computation cost without decreasing classification accuracy. XGBoost, as the scalable tree boosting classifier, can solve real-world scale problems (Higgs Boson and Allstate dataset) with using a minimal amount of resources. This paper reuses the same data from RS PON and features from previous research, preprocessed with PCA and classified with XGBoost, to increase the accuracy with fewer electrodes. The specific fewer electrodes improved the accuracy of stroke detection. Our future work will examine the other algorithm besides PCA to get higher accuracy with less number of channels.

An adaptive human-machine system is designed based on a non-linear dynamic CTL classifier, which maps a set of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) related features to a few CTL classes. The least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM) is used as dynamic pattern classifier. A series of electrophysiological and performance data acquisition experiments were performed on seven volunteer participants under a simulated process control task environment. The participant-specific dynamic LSSVM model is constructed to classify the instantaneous CTL into five classes at each time instant. The initial feature set, comprising 56 EEG and ECG related features, is reduced to a set of 12 salient features (including 11 EEG-related features) by using the locality preserving projection (LPP) technique. An overall correct classification rate of about 80% is achieved for the 5-class CTL classification problem. Then the predicted CTL is used to adaptively allocate the number of process control tasks between operator and computer-based controller. Simulation results showed that the overall performance of the human-machine system can be improved by using the adaptive automation strategy proposed.

This emotion recognition capability of machines enables them to act according to the observed mental state. Human feelings and emotions are triggered by stimuli which are external or internal and manifest themselves in the form of pulse rate, tone, facial expressions and many more. In this paper we classify human emotions using EEG signals into four discrete states, namely happy, sad, angry and relaxed. The preprocessed signals from the DEAP database is used and spectral and statistical features are extracted by discrete wavelet transform. These features are classified using a SVM classifier and the performance of the classifier is optimized using the PSO algorithm. An overall emotional accuracy of 80.625% was obtained for a combination of 32 electrodes with a valence and arousal accuracy of 86.25% and 88.125%.

Feature Selection (FS) routines for electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have been extensively studied in the past years. Current research is often based on machine learning algorithms. This paper investigates the impact of a new evolutionary approach to Multi- Objective Optimization (MOO) of FS routine for memory load classification using EEG. The main contributions of this study consist in: i) the analysis of candidate feature vectors regarding the accuracy of classification and parsimony; ii) the development of a multi- objective Genetic Algorithm (GA) with an improved selection of the preferred final solution, able to optimize the accuracy and the parsimony of any associated classifier. The feature vectors are classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forests (RF) classifiers. The suggested algorithms are verified on two benchmark datasets, optimizing feature selection for memory load level recognition using EEG data. The testing scenarios motivate the necessity of MOO for EEG signal feature selection. The superior performance of the proposed method recommends it as a preprocessing phase in EEG complex applications.

Automated classification of pain perception using high-density electroencephalography data	JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						pain; classification; medial prefrontal cortex; gamma; EEG	FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CORTEX; BRAIN; MOTOR; FMRI; MODULATION; INTENSITY; OSCILLATIONS; SENSITIVITY; POTENTIALS	The translation of brief, millisecond-long pain-eliciting stimuli to the subjective perception of pain is associated with changes in theta, alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations over sensorimotor cortex. However, when a pain-eliciting stimulus continues for minutes, regions beyond the sensorimotor cortex, such as the prefrontal cortex, are also engaged. Abnormalities in prefrontal cortex have been associated with chronic pain states, but conventional, millisecond-long EEG paradigms do not engage prefrontal regions. In the current study, we collected high-density EEG data during an experimental paradigm in which subjects experienced a 4-s, low-or high-intensity pain-eliciting stimulus. EEG data were analyzed using independent component analyses, EEG source localization analyses, and measure projection analyses. We report three novel findings. First, an increase in pain perception was associated with an increase in gamma and theta power in a cortical region that included medial prefrontal cortex. Second, a decrease in lower beta power was associated with an increase in pain perception in a cortical region that included the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. Third, we used machine learning for automated classification of EEG data into low-and high-pain classes. Theta and gamma power in the medial prefrontal region and lower beta power in the contralateral sensorimotor region served as features for classification. We found a leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy of 89.58%. The development of biological markers for pain states continues to gain traction in the literature, and our findings provide new information that advances this body of work. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The development of a biological marker for pain continues to gain traction in literature. Our findings show that high- and low-pain perception in human subjects can be classified with 89% accuracy using high- density EEG data from prefrontal cortex and contralateral sensorimotor cortex. Our approach represents a novel neurophysiological paradigm that advances the literature on biological markers for pain.

Modern Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) systems, especially applications designed for user training and assessment (e.g., educational or smart-rehabilitation systems), should be able to track and monitor those signals and adapt their parameters accordingly in order to optimally facilitate the special needs of each individual. Towards this end, we propose a passive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), using a wireless non-intrusive EEG sensor under a robot assisted training task designed for cognitive assessment.

The need of Falsehood recognition has been a piece of our general public from hundreds of years back. Different requirements drifted over the general public raising the need to create trick evidence philosophies for Falsehood identification. The established similar addressing tests have been having a tendency to gather uncertain results against which new hearty strategies are being explored upon for acquiring more productive Falsehood discovery set up. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-obtrusive strategy to quantify the action of mind through the anodes appended to the scalp of a subject. Electroencephalogram is a record of the electric signs produced by the synchronous activity of mind cells over a timeframe. The fundamental goal is to accumulate and distinguish the important information through this action which can be acclimatized for giving surmising to Falsehood discovery in future analysis. This work proposes a strategy for Falsehood discovery utilizing EEG database recorded on irregular people of various age gatherings and social organizations. The factual investigation is directed utilizing MATLAB v-14. It is a superior dialect for specialized registering which spares a considerable measure of time with streamlined investigation systems. In this work center is made on Falsehood Classification by Support Vector Machine (SVM). 72 Samples are set up by making inquiries from standard poll with a Wright and wrong replies in a diverse era from the individual in wearable head unit. 52 samples are trained and 20 are tested. By utilizing Bluetooth based Neurosky's Mindwave kit, brain waves are recorded and qualities are arranged appropriately. In this work confusion matrix is derived by matlab programs and accuracy of56.25 % is achieved.	[Mallikarjun, H. M.] Karpagam Univ, RNSIT, Dept EIE, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Mallikarjun, H.

They have great potential but their complexity also bears unexpected pitfalls. In this paper, we explore the possibilities that arise from the high sensitivity of MVPA for stimulus-related differences, which may confound estimations of class differences during decoding of cognitive concepts. We propose a method that takes advantage of concept-unrelated grouping factors, uses blocked permutation tests, and gradually manipulates the proportion of concept-related information in data while the stimulus-related, concept-irrelevant factors are held constant. This results in a concept-response curve, which shows the relative contribution of these two components, i.e. how much of the decoding performance is specific to higher-order category processing and to lower order stimulus processing. It also allows separating stimulus-related from concept-related neuronal processing, which cannot be achieved experimentally. We applied our method to three different EEG data sets with different levels of stimulus-related confound to decode concepts of digits vs. letters, faces vs. houses, and animals vs. fruits based on event-related potentials at the single trial level. We show that exemplar-specific differences between stimuli can drive classification accuracy to above chance levels even in the absence of conceptual information. By looking into time-resolved windows of brain activity, concept-response curves can help characterize the time-course of lower-level and higher-level neural information processing and detect the corresponding temporal and spatial signatures of the corresponding cognitive processes. In particular, our results show that perceptual information is decoded earlier in time than conceptual information specific to processing digits and letters. In addition, compared to the stimulus-level predictive sites, concept-related topographies are spread more widely and, at later time points, reach the frontal cortex. Thus, our proposed method yields insights into cognitive processing as well as corresponding brain responses.

This is a new strategy of human-computer interaction. A method of electroencephalogram (EEG) phase synchronization combined with band energy was proposed to construct a feature vector for pattern recognition of brain-computer interaction based on EEG induced by motor imagery in this paper. rhythm and beta rhythm were first extracted from EEG by band pass filter and then the frequency band energy was calculated by the sliding time window; the instantaneous phase values were obtained using Hilbert transform and then the phase synchronization feature was calculated by the phase locking value (PLV) and the best time interval for extracting the phase synchronization feature was searched by the distribution of the PLV value in the time domain. Finally, discrimination of motor imagery patterns was performed by the support vector machine (SVM). The results showed that the phase synchronization feature more effective in 4 s - 7 s and the correct classification rate was 91.4 %. Compared with the results achieved by a single EEG feature related to motor imagery, the correct classification rate was improved by 3.5 and 4.3 percentage points by combining phase synchronization with band energy. These indicate that the proposed method is effective and it is expected that the study provides a way to improve the performance of the online real-time brain-computer interaction control system based on EEG related to motor imagery.

Simple algorithms to analyse the feature and reduce the EEG channel number will give an indispensable advantages. Therefore, this study explores a combination of wavelet entropy and average wavelet coefficient (WEAVE) as a potential EEG-emotion feature to classify valence and arousal emotions with the advantage of the ability to identify the occurrence of a pattern while at the same time identify the shape of a pattern in EEG emotion signal. The complexity of the feature was reduced using the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) method to obtain a reduced number of channels. Classification with the WEAVE feature achieved 76.8% accuracy for valence and 74.3% for arousal emotion, respectively. The analysis with NMI shows that the WEAVE feature has linear characteristics and offers possibilities to reduce the EEG channels to a certain number. Further analysis also reveals that detection of valence emotion with reduced EEG channels has a different combination of EEG channels compared to arousal emotion.

Stress is a mental condition that effects the brain electrical activity to be different from the normal state. A system is designed to classify three levels of stress; Low Stress, Moderate Stress and High Stress. Validation of algorithm is carried out using by Stroop color-word test as stimuli to induce various levels of stress. EEG signals are collected using EEG reusable electrodes, which are placed on forehead scalp during the experiment. Measure of stress is taken by means of questionnaires method. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used for pre-processing and using Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the classifier. Further analysis of stress is done by using trained algorithm as reference. Signals collected are continually given to algorithm to verify stress, three levels of stress can be recognized. Stress levels of the person under test are seen on screen using graph.

Typically marketed for meditation and neurotherapy, these devices are limited in scope and currently too obtrusive to be a ubiquitous wearable. Stemming from recent advancements made in hearing aid technology, wearables have been shrinking to the point that the necessary sensors, circuitry, and batteries can be fit into a small in-ear wearable device. In this work, an ear-EEG device is created with a novel system for artifact removal and signal interpretation. The small, compact, cost-effective, and discreet device is demonstrated against existing consumer electronics in this space for its signal quality, comfort, and usability. A custom mobile application is developed to process raw EEG from each device and display interpreted data to the user. Artifact removal and signal classification is accomplished via a combination of support matrix machines (SMMs) and soft thresholding of relevant statistical properties.

J	Finke, M; Billinger, M; Buchner, A				Finke, Mareike; Billinger, Martin; Buechner, Andreas			Toward Automated Cochlear Implant Fitting Procedures Based on Event-Related Potentials	EAR AND HEARING			English	Article						Cochlear implant; Event-related potentials; Fitting procedure; Objective measures; P3; Single-trial classification		Objectives: Cochlear implants (CIs) restore hearing to the profoundly deaf by direct electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. To provide an optimal electrical stimulation pattern the CI must be individually fitted to each CI user. To date, CI fitting is primarily based on subjective feedback from the user. However, not all CI users are able to provide such feedback, for example, small children. This study explores the possibility of using the electroencephalogram (EEG) to objectively determine if CI users are able to hear differences in tones presented to them, which has potential applications in CI fitting or closed loop systems. Design: Deviant and standard stimuli were presented to 12 CI users in an active auditory oddball paradigm. The EEG was recorded in two sessions and classification of the EEG data was performed with shrinkage linear discriminant analysis. Also, the impact of CI artifact removal on classification performance and the possibility to reuse a trained classifier in future sessions were evaluated. Results: Overall, classification performance was above chance level for all participants although performance varied considerably between participants. Also, artifacts were successfully removed from the EEG without impairing classification performance. Finally, reuse of the classifier causes only a small loss in classification performance. Conclusions: Our data provide first evidence that EEG can be automatically classified on single-trial basis in CI users. Despite the slightly poorer classification performance over sessions, classifier and CI artifact correction appear stable over successive sessions. Thus, classifier and artifact correction weights can be reused without repeating the set-up procedure in every session, which makes the technique easier applicable. With our present data, we can show successful classification of event-related cortical potential patterns in CI users. In the future, this has the potential to objectify and automate parts of CI fitting procedures.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have been widely used to detect epilepsy and other brain abnormalities. In this work, we propose and evaluate a novel methodology based on shearlet and contourlet transforms to decompose the EEG signals into frequency bands. A set of features are extracted from these time frequency coefficients and used as input to different classifiers. Experiments are conducted on a public data set to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed classification method. The developed system can help neurophysiologists identify EEG patterns in epilepsy diagnostic tasks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These recorded signals are interfaced with a computer which is referred to as noninvasive Brain Computer Interface (BCI). An important application of this technology is to help facilitate the lives of the tetraplegic through assimilating human brain impulses and converting them into mechanical motion. However, BCI systems are remarkably challenging to implement as recorded brain signals can be unreliable and vary in pattern throughout time. In this paper, a novel classifier structure is proposed to classify different types of imaginary motions (left hand, right hand, and imagination of words starting with the same letter) across multiple sessions using an optimized set of electrodes for each user. The proposed technique uses raw brain signals obtained utilizing 32 electrodes and classifies the imaginary motions using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). To enhance the classification rate and optimize the set of electrodes of each subject, a majority voting system combining a set of simple ANNs is used. This electrode optimization technique achieved classification accuracies of 69.83%, 94.04% and 84.56% respectively for the three subjects considered in this study.

However, many irrelevant features make it difficult to identify patterns accurately. Obtaining valid features from electroencephalogram can improve the classification and generalization performance. In this paper, an improved normalized mutual information feature selection algorithm which is based on Grassberger entropy estimator (G-NMIFS) is proposed for EEG data. We employ the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes methods to compare the proposed approach with normalized mutual information feature selection using Naive estimator and Miller-adjust method. Experimental results on two EEG data sets show that the proposed method can select relevant subsets and improve classification performance effectively.

Such a process is time consuming and labor intensive. To reduce the workload and to improve the sleep stage scoring performance of sleep experts, this paper introduces an intelligent rapid eye movement (REM) sleep detection method that requires only a single EEG channel. The proposed approach distinguishes itself from previous automatic sleep staging methods by introducing two sets of auxiliary features to help resolve the difficulties caused by interpersonal EEG signal differences. In addition to adopting conventional time and frequency domain features, two empirical rules are introduced to enhance REM detection performance based on sleep being a continuous process. The approach was tested with 779,661 epochs obtained from 947 overnight PSG studies. The REM sleep detection results show a kappa coefficient at 0.752, an accuracy level of 0.930, a sensitivity score of 0.814, and a positive predictive value of 0.775. The results also show that the performance of the approach varies with the ratio of REM sleep and the severity of sleep apnea of the subjects. The experimental results also show that it is possible to improve the performance of an automatic sleep staging method by tailoring it to subgroups of persons that have similar sleep architecture and clinical characteristics.

J	Usman, SM; Usman, M; Fong, S				Usman, Syed Muhammad; Usman, Muhammad; Fong, Simon			Epileptic Seizures Prediction Using Machine Learning Methods	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							EEG; SIGNALS	Epileptic seizures occur due to disorder in brain functionality which can affect patient's health. Prediction of epileptic seizures before the beginning of the onset is quite useful for preventing the seizure by medication. Machine learning techniques and computational methods are used for predicting epileptic seizures from Electroencephalograms (EEG) signals. However, preprocessing of EEG signals for noise removal and features extraction are two major issues that have an adverse effect on both anticipation time and true positive prediction rate. Therefore, we propose a model that provides reliable methods of both preprocessing and feature extraction. Our model predicts epileptic seizures' sufficient time before the onset of seizure starts and provides a better true positive rate. We have applied empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for preprocessing and have extracted time and frequency domain features for training a prediction model. The proposed model detects the start of the preictal state, which is the state that starts few minutes before the onset of the seizure, with a higher true positive rate compared to traditional methods, 92.23%, and maximum anticipation time of 33 minutes and average prediction time of 23.6 minutes on scalp EEG CHB-MIT dataset of 22 subjects.

This research aims to investigate population variability of EEG features and their ability to classify patients based on patient characteristics. We first propose a data-driven method of evaluating consistency and variability of commonly used EEG features. Using a Kruskal-Wallis test we find normalized features compared across different time intervals within a given recording to be consistent. Further, we find certain features to have better intra-subject consistency than others, notably spectral entropy, skew, and kurtosis. Using these results we apply machine learning techniques to classify patients based on sex, age, medications taken, and clinical impressions. We find statistically significant classifications for age, medications taken, and clinical impressions, achieving accuracies above 86%, '72%, and 74%, respectively.

In the present study, we explored the EEG correlates of ten different positive emotions (joy, gratitude, serenity, interest, hope, pride, amusement, inspiration, awe, and love). A group of 20 participants were invited to watch 30 short film clips with their EEGs simultaneously recorded. Distinct topographical patterns for different positive emotions were found for the correlation coefficients between the subjective ratings on the ten positive emotions per film clip and the corresponding EEG spectral powers in different frequency bands. Based on the similarities of the participants' ratings on the ten positive emotions, these emotions were further clustered into three representative clusters, as 'encouragement' for awe, gratitude, hope, inspiration, pride, `playfulness' for amusement, joy, interest, and 'harmony' for love, serenity. Using the EEG spectral powers as features, both the binary classification on the higher and lower ratings on these positive emotions and the binary classification between the three positive emotion clusters, achieved accuracies of approximately 80% and above. To our knowledge, our study provides the first piece of evidence on the EEG correlates of different positive emotions.

As the approaches to tackle these applications usually involve optimized codes that implement different types of parallelism, the use of heterogeneous architectures with multicore microprocessors along with GPUs could provide relevant performance improvements after careful code optimizing.

JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Postanoxic encephalopathy; Coma; EEG monitoring; Outcome prediction	CARDIAC-ARREST PATIENTS; THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA; PROGNOSTICATION; SURVIVORS; TOOL	Introduction: Increasing evidence supports that early EEG recordings reliably contribute to outcome prediction in comatose patients with postanoxic encephalopathy. As postanoxic encephalopathy typically results in generalized EEG abnormalities, spatial resolution of a small number of electrodes is likely sufficient, which will reduce set-up time. Here, the authors compare a reduced and a 21-channel EEG for outcome prediction. Methods: EEG recordings from 142 prospectively collected patients with postanoxic encephalopathy were reassessed by two independent reviewers using a reduced (10 electrodes) bipolar montage. Classification and prognostic accuracy were compared with the full (21 electrodes) montage. The full montage consensus was considered Gold Standard. Results: Sixty-seven patients (47%) had good outcome. The agreement between the individual reviewers using the reduced montage and the Gold Standard score was good (k = 0.75-0.79). The interobserver agreement was not affected by reducing the number of electrodes (k = 0.78 for the reduced montage vs. 0.71 for the full montage). An isoelectric, low-voltage, or burst-suppression with identical bursts pattern at 24 hours invariably predicted poor outcome in both montages, with similar prognostic accuracy. A diffusely slowed or normal EEG pattern at 12 hours was associated with good outcome in both montages. Conclusions: Reducing the number of electrodes from 21 to 10 does not affect EEG classification or prognostic accuracy in patients with postanoxic coma.

The frequency components that give effective discrimination between different emotion states are subject specific. Identification of these subject-specific discriminative frequency components (DFCs) is important for the accurate classification of emotional activities. This paper investigated the potential of adaptive tracking of DFCs as an effective method for choosing the discriminative bands of EEG patterns and improving emotion recognition performance. 13 healthy volunteers were emotionally elicited by pictures selected from the International Affective Picture System (LAPS). Discriminative frequency components were tracked and analyzed for each subject and classification of three emotions (pleasant/high arousal, neutral, unpleasant/high arousal) was performed by employing a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our results showed that adaptive tracking of DFCs improved classification accuracies significantly and the highest average accuracy of 82.85% was achieved by SVM.

Previous BCI systems mostly relied on visual patterns or auditory stimulation (e.g., loudspeakers) to evoke synchronous brain signals. There would be difficulties to cover a large range of spatial locations with such a stimulation protocol. The present study explored the possibility of using virtual acoustic space and a visual-auditory matching paradigm to overcome this issue. The technique has the flexibility of generating sound stimulation from virtually any spatial location. Brain signals of eight human subjects were obtained with a 32-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG). Two amplitude-modulated noise or speech sentences carrying distinct spatial information were presented concurrently. Each sound source was tagged with a unique modulation phase so that the phase of the recorded EEG signals indicated the sound being attended to. The phase-tagged sound was further filtered with head-related transfer functions to create the sense of virtual space. Subjects were required to pay attention to the sound source that best matched the location of a visual target. For all the subjects, the phase of a single sound could be accurately reflected over the majority of electrodes based on EEG responses of 90 s or less. The electrodes providing significant decoding performance on auditory attention were fewer and may require longer EEG responses. The reliability and efficiency of decoding with a single electrode varied with subjects. Overall, the virtual acoustic space protocol has the potential of being used in practical BCI systems.

Successful application of CSP depends on the character of input signals and the first and last m eigenvectors of projection matrix. In this study, we proposed a novel and robust feature extraction method designated frequency domain CSP (FDCSP) that the samples in frequency domain obtained by fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm and evenly distributed in 8-30Hz were employed as the input signals of CSP. Besides, we made some modifications to classical CSP to address the inconsistent issue and enhance the generalization ability. Cross validation classification accuracy and standard deviation based on training data were employed as the principle to optimize the subject-specific parameter m. Two public EEG datasets (BCI competition IV dataset 2a and 2b) were used to validate the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed many other state-of-the-art methods in classification performance. What's more, samples in frequency domain as the input signals of CSP are demonstrated more robust against preprocessing. Based on the two public datasets, the proposed FDCSP method has potential significance to motor imagery based BCI design in practice.

There is no validated method to combine risk factors and guide clinicians in assessing seizure risk.& para;& para;OBJECTIVE To use seizure risk factors from EEG and clinical history to create a simple scoring system associated with the probability o f seizures in patients with acute illness.& para;& para;DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used a prospective multicenter (Emory University Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Yale University Hospital) database containing clinical and electrographic variables on 5427 continuous EEG sessions from eligible patients if they had continuous EEG for clinical indications, excluding epilepsy monitoring unit admissions. We created a scoring system model to estimate seizure risk in acutely ill patients undergoing continuous EEG, The model was built using a new machine learning method (Risks LI M) that is designed to produce accurate, risk-calibrated scoring systems with a limited number of variables and small integer weights. We validated the accuracy and risk calibration of our model using cross-validation and compared its performance with models built with state-of-the-art logistic regression methods. The database was developed by the Critical Care EEG Research Consortium and used data collected over 3 years. The EEG variables were interpreted using standardized terminology by certified reviewers.& para;& para;EXPOSURES All patients had more than 6 hours o f uninterrupted EEG recordings.& para;& para;MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was the average risk calibration error.& para;& para;RESULTS There were 5427 continuous EEGs performed on 4772 participants (2868 men, 49.9%; median age, 61 years) performed at 3 institutions, without further demographic stratification. Our final model, 2HELPS2B, had an area under the curve o f 0.819 and average calibration error of 2.7% (95% Cl, 2.0%-3.6%). It included 6 variables with the following point assignments; (1) brief (ictal) rhythmic discharges (B[l]RDs) (2 points); (2) presence of lateralized periodic discharges, lateralized rhythmic delta activity, or bilateral independent periodic discharges (1 point); (3) prior seizure (1 point); (4) sporadic epileptiform discharges (1 point); (5) frequency greater than 2.0 Hz for any periodic or rhythmic pattern (1 point); and (6) presence o f "plus" features (superimposed, rhythmic, sharp, or fast activity) (1 point). The probable seizure risk of each score was 5% for a score of 0,12% for a score of 1,27% for a score of 2,50% for a score of 3,73% for a score of 4,88% for a score of 5, and greater than 95% for a score of 6 or 7.& para;& para;CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The 2HELPS2B model is a quick accurate tool to aid clinical judgment of the risk of seizures in critically ill patients.

Recognizing of stereotypic patterns in epileptic EEG using empirical modes and wavelets	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Wavelet-analysis; Empirical mode decomposition; Patterns; Electroencephalogram	GENETIC ABSENCE EPILEPSY; SLEEP SPINDLES; WAG/RIJ RATS; DECOMPOSITION METHOD; TIME-SERIES; DISCHARGES; SPIKE; TRANSFORM; CLASSIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS	Epileptic activity in the form of spike-wave discharges (SWD) appears in the electroencephalogram (EEG) during absence seizures. This paper evaluates two approaches for detecting stereotypic rhythmic activities in EEG, i.e., the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and the empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The CWT is a well-known method of time-frequency analysis of EEG, whereas EMD is a relatively novel approach for extracting signal's waveforms. A new method for pattern recognition based on combination of CWT and EMD is proposed. It was found that this combined approach resulted to the sensitivity of 86.5% and specificity of 92.9% for sleep spindles and 97.6% and 93.2% for SWD, correspondingly. Considering strong within- and between-subjects variability of sleep spindles, the obtained efficiency in their detection was high in comparison with other methods based on CWT. It is concluded that the combination of a wavelet-based approach and empirical modes increases the quality of automatic detection of stereotypic patterns in rat's EEG. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Conventional methods for measuring IQ however are exposed to biasness issues. An alternative solution to classify IQ levels via electroencephalogram (EEG) based intelligence classifier model is proposed. 50 students from foundation program have participated in the pilot study. Resting EEG is recorded from the left prefrontal cortex. The signal is initially pre-processed for noise removal. Next, the extracted power ratio features are fed to the previously established classification model, enabling it to classify IQ level for each sample. Majority of the samples are classified as high IQ.

Epilepsy can be detected from Electroencephalogram (EEG) as EEG captures and presents the electrical activity of the brain. Non-invasive EEG or scalp EEG is generally used where electrodes are placed on the scalp in order to record the brain activity. In this work a unsupervised machine learning technique is explored which is used to cluster and extract features from EEG recordings (non-invasive) to detect seizures. A patient specific approach is adopted on an open dataset (Physionet database) from where 51 seizure and 51 non seizure recordings of pediatric subjects (age ranging from 1yrs to 12yrs) are considered for the related work. Unsupervised algorithm used here is the k-means algorithm to cluster the recordings into two distinct clusters of seizure and non-seizure data. When the performance of the algorithm was tested the algorithm worked with 91.43% accuracy from nearly 18, 00, 000 data taken from various subject. In future scope of work the accuracy of the method can be enhanced using appropriate features for distinctly identifying different intractable seizures according to their characteristics that are prevalent among pediatric patients.

Movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs), representing movement intention, preparation, and execution, is a slow negative deflection observed in EEG signals up to 1.5s prior to the onset of movement. However, detecting movement intention from MRCPs is still a challenging task. In this paper, we proposed a new movement intention detection model using a multilayer feed-forward neural network (MFNN) with dictionary learning during a voluntary reaching task. The detection features were extracted automatically using the dictionary learning algorithm. The detection performances of MFNN were compared with the common classifiers, i.e. random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), in the EEG analysis field. Our results showed that the detection performances of MFNN outperformed those of RF and SVM. Moreover, the detection accuracies were further improved with the features extracted by the dictionary learning method. And the optimal number of dictionary learning components was proved to be 5. In conclusion, the proposed MFNN with dictionary learning based movement intention detection method is superior to previous approaches and is a promising technique in EEG signal analysis and BCI applications where it is difficult to obtain large datasets from individual subject.

Objective video quality metrics usually under-perform in terms of perceptual quality, thus evaluation is usually performed offline by people, an arduous and time consuming task that is also affected by external conditions and by user preferences. The use of physiological signals, recorded from users exposed to multimedia stimuli, has the potential to offer a more robust and unbiased method for evaluating perceptual quality. In this work, we propose the evaluation of the perceptual quality of video by means of cerebral (Electroencephalography - EEG) and peripheral (Electrocardiography - ECG and Electromyography - EMG) physiological signals. A machine learning approach is employed in order to map features extracted from these signals to a subjective video quality scale. Five 4K video sequences were encoded at different quality levels using the state-of-the-art HEVC codec and their quality was evaluated by real users while recording their physiological signals. The quality levels decided by the proposed model were then evaluated against the user-provided MOSs and the results demonstrated the potential of the proposed method for accurate perceptual video quality evaluation.

J	Zhang, JM; Wu, Y				Zhang, Junming; Wu, Yan			A New Method for Automatic Sleep Stage Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Convolutional neural network; electroen-cephalography; feature extraction; fisher criterion; sleep stage	WAKE CLASSIFICATION; FEATURE-SELECTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; EEG; SYSTEM; SIGNAL; RECOGNITION; COMBINATION; ALGORITHM; FEATURES	Traditionally, automatic sleep stage classification is quite a challenging task because of the difficulty in translating open-textured standards to mathematical models and the limitations of handcrafted features. In this paper, a new system for automatic sleep stage classification is presented. Compared with existing sleep stage methods, our method can capture the sleep information hidden inside electroencephalography (EEG) signals and automatically extract features from raw data. To translate open sleep stage standards into machine rules recognized by computers, a new model named fast discriminative complex-valued convolutional neural network (FDCCNN) is proposed to extract features from raw EEG data and classify sleep stages. The new model combines complex-valued backpropagation and the Fisher criterion. It can learn discriminative features and overcome the negative effect of imbalance dataset. More importantly, the orthogonal decision boundaries for the real and imaginary parts of a complex-valued convolutional neuron are proven. A speed-up algorithm is proposed to reduce computational workload and yield improvements of over an order of magnitude compared to the normal convolution algorithm. The classification performances of handcrafted features and different convolutional neural networks are compared with that of the FDCCNN. The total accuracy and kappa coefficient of the proposed method are 92% and 0.84, respectively. Experiment results demonstrated that the performance of our system is comparable to those of human experts.

In specific, use of classification algorithms to highly multivariate non-stationary recordings like EEG is a challenging and promising task. This study investigated two substantial novelty of the topics, (1) Distinction between meditation (Kriya Yoga) and non-meditation state allied EEG, (2) Characterization of the underlying mechanism of cognitive process that is associated with meditation using topographical analysis. The topographic wavelet coherence based brain connectivity between two different groups is shown. Two groups of data, one with 23 meditators (meditator group) and other with ten non-meditators (controlled group) are analyzed. The spatial distribution between two groups can be well distinguished by the topographical approach. The quantification has been done by the colour intensity embedded in the topographical plots. The wavelet coherence is found to be a different parameter to represent the distinctiveness between two groups. The time-frequency quantification regarding wavelet coherence spectrum is shown the unique patterns among meditators and non-meditators. Thus time-frequency based wavelet coherence has found to be an unusual brain pattern in the distinction between meditators and non-meditators.

However, the optimal frequency band and time segment for extracting such features differ from subject to subject. In this work, we aim to improve the multi-class classification and to reduce the required EEG channel in motor imagery-based BCI by subject-specific time-frequency selection. Our method is based on a criterion namely Fisher discriminant analysis-type F-score to simultaneously select the optimal frequency band and time segment for multi-class classification. The proposed method uses only few Laplacian EEG channels (C3, Cz and C4) located around the sensorimotor area for classification. Applied to a standard multi-class BCI dataset (BCI competition III dataset Ilia), our method leads to better classification performance and smaller standard deviation across subjects compared to the state-of-art methods. Moreover, adding artifacts contaminated trials to the training dataset does not necessarily deteriorate our classification results, indicating that our method is tolerant to artifacts.

In conventional CSP algorithm, pairs of the eigenvectors corresponding to both extreme eigenvalues are selected to construct the optimal spatial filter. In addition, an appropriate selection of subject-specific time segments and frequency bands plays an important role in its successful application. New method: This study proposes to optimize spatial-frequency-temporal patterns for discriminative feature extraction. Spatial optimization is implemented by channel selection and finding discriminative spatial filters adaptively on each time-frequency segment. A novel Discernibility of Feature Sets (DFS) criteria is designed for spatial filter optimization. Besides, discriminative features located in multiple time-frequency segments are selected automatically by the proposed sparse time-frequency segment common spatial pattern (STFSCSP) method which exploits sparse regression for significant features selection. Finally, a weight determined by the sparse coefficient is assigned for each selected CSP feature and we propose a Weighted Naive Bayesian Classifier (WNBC) for classification. Results: Experimental results on two public EEG datasets demonstrate that optimizing spatial-frequency temporal patterns in a data-driven manner for discriminative feature extraction greatly improves the classification performance. Comparison with existing methods: The proposed method gives significantly better classification accuracies in comparison with several competing methods in the literature. Conclusions: The proposed approach is a promising candidate for future BC! systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Describe the system function first: In the case of only two types of control signal, the implementation of multi-task Manipulator relies on a toggle-confirmation mode of operation: the task is switched when imagining the left-hand movement, and the task is confirmed when the right-hand movement is imagined. In the BCI system, common spatial pattern (CSP) is used for feature extraction, mutual information for feature selection, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for pattern classification. The EEG signal is processed and classified into two categories, imagery of left-hand and right-hand movement. In this way, we can achieve the multi-task control of the manipulator under the premise of ensuring the accuracy of EEG recognition.

The PDC analysis estimates the intensity and direction of propagation from neural activities generated in the cerebral cortex, and analyzes the coefficients obtained from employing multivariate autoregressive model (MVAR). Features extracted by using PDC are transformed into binary matrices by using surrogate data testing with a 0.05 significance level. The significant propagations are represented as 1 in the binary matrix and 0 otherwise. Binary matrices are converted into binary vectors. These vectors are then selected as the inputs of a multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. The first classifier is trained to distinguish between 2 types of IEDs and tenfold cross validation is implemented to evaluate the system. The performance of the classifier was evaluated, where it achieved the highest F1 score of 100.00% when performed on IS vs RSS and 96.67% on IS vs CSS. The average F1 score of the first classifier obtained was 91.11%. The second classifier was trained to perform all types of IEDs classifications. The classifier yielded an overall accuracy of 86.67% with the highest achieved F1 score of 90.00%. Both classifiers were able to detect and classify different types of IEDs when using the features extracted from PDC with a very high performance.

The common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is a widely used feature extraction method for MI-based BCIs. In this work, we propose a novel spatial-frequency-temporal optimized feature sparse representation-based classification method. Optimal channels are selected based on relative entropy criteria. Significant CSP features on frequency-temporal domains are selected automatically to generate a column vector for sparse representation-based classification (SRC). We analyzed the performance of the new method on two public EEG datasets, namely BCI competition III dataset IVa which has five subjects and BCI competition IV dataset IIb which has nine subjects. Compared to the performance offered by the existing SRC method, the proposed method achieves average classification accuracy improvements of 21.568 and 14.38% for BCI competition III dataset IVa and BCI competition IV dataset IIb, respectively. Furthermore, our approach also shows better classification performance when compared to other competing methods for both datasets.

To reduce the intrinsic cross-subject differences of EEG data and background noise variations during signal acquisition, we adopt two classes of transfer learning methods to build subject-independent classifiers. One is to find a subspace by matrix decomposition and regularization theory, and the other is to learn the common shared structure with the deep autoencoder. The experimental results demonstrate that deep transfer learning model achieves the mean classification accuracy of 82.16% in comparison with the baseline SVM (65.74%) and outperforms other transfer learning methods. Our experimental results also indicate that the neural patterns of different sleep quality are discriminative and stable: the delta responses increase, the alpha responses decrease when sleep is partially deprived, and the neural patterns of 4-h sleep and 6-h sleep are more similar compared with 8-h sleep.

The clinical use of BCI includes current studies on neurorehabilitation ([Frolov et al., 2013; Ang et al., 2010]), and there is the prospect of using BCI to restore movement and communication capabilities, providing alternative effective pathways to those that may be lost due to injury or illness. The processing of electrophysiological data requires analysis of high-dimensional, nonstationary, noisy signals reflecting complex underlying processes and structures. We have shown that for non-invasive neuroimaging methods such as EEG the potential improvement lies in the field of machine learning and involves designing data analysis algorithms that can model physiological and psychoemotional variability of the user. The development of such algorithms can be conducted in different ways, including the classical Bayesian paradigm as well as modern deep learning architectures. The interpretation of nonlinear decision rules implemented by multilayer structures would enable automatic and objective knowledge extraction from the neurocognitive experiments data. Despite the advantages of non-invasive neuroimaging methods, a radical increase in the bandwidth of the BCI communication channel and the use of this technology for the prosthesis control is possible only through invasive technologies. Electrocorticogram (ECoG) is the least invasive of such technologies, and in the final part of this work we demonstrate the possibility of using ECoG to decode the kinematic characteristics of the finger movement.

J	Bandt, C				Bandt, Christoph			A New Kind of Permutation Entropy Used to Classify Sleep Stages from Invisible EEG Microstructure	ENTROPY			English	Article						permutation entropy; sleep stages; ordinal time series	SCALP EEG; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM	Permutation entropy and order patterns in an EEG signal have been applied by several authors to study sleep, anesthesia, and epileptic absences. Here, we discuss a new version of permutation entropy, which is interpreted as distance to white noise. It has a scale similar to the well-known chi(2) distributions and can be supported by a statistical model. Critical values for significance are provided. Distance to white noise is used as a parameter which measures depth of sleep, where the vigilant awake state of the human EEG is interpreted as "almost white noise". Classification of sleep stages from EEG data usually relies on delta waves and graphic elements, which can be seen on a macroscale of several seconds.

Within-Category Decoding of Information in Different Attentional States in Short-Term Memory	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						attention; multivariate pattern analysis; neural representations; short-term memory; working memory	PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; FOCUS; REPRESENTATIONS; STORAGE; ACCESS; BRAIN	A long-standing assumption of cognitive neuroscience has been that working memory (WM) is accomplished by sustained, elevated neural activity. More recently, theories of WM have expanded this view by describing different attentional states in WM with differing activation levels. Several studies have used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) data to study neural activity corresponding to these WM states. Intriguingly, no evidence was found for active neural representations for information held in WM outside the focus of attention ("unattended memory items,"UMIs),suggesting that only attended memory items (AMIs) are accompanied by an active trace. However, these results depended on category-level decoding, which lacks sensitivity to neural representations of individual items. Therefore, we employed a WM task in which subjects remembered the directions of motion of two dot arrays, with a retrocue indicating which was relevant for an imminent memory probe (the AMI). This design allowed MVPA decoding of delay-period fMRI signal at the stimulus-item level, affording a more sensitive test of the neural representation of UMIs. Whereas evidence for the AMI was reliably high, evidence for the UMI dropped to baseline, consistent with the notion that different WM attentional states may have qualitatively different mechanisms of retention.

In particular, this diagnosis heavily depends on the detection of interictal (between seizures) paroxysmal epileptic discharges (IPED) in the EEG. This is a time-consuming task requiring significant training and experience. Automatic detection of these EEG patterns would greatly assist visual inspections of human readers. We present a new method, which allows automatic detection of IPED based on discrete wavelet decomposition and a random forest classifier. The algorithm was trained and cross validated using 17 subjects with scalp EEG and 10 subjects with intracranial EEG. The performance of this method reached 62% recall and 26% precision for surface EEG subjects and 63% recall and 53% precision for intracranial EEG subjects. Thus, the method hereby proposed has great potential for diagnosis support in clinical environments.	[Le Douget, J.

Mining Time-Resolved Functional Brain Graphs to an EEG- Based Chronnectomic Brain Aged Index (CBAI)	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; time-varying network analysis; chronnectomics; dominant coupling modes; cross-frequency coupling; maturation index; signal processing; symbolic analysis	RESTING-STATE NETWORKS; DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; FMRI DATA; CONNECTIVITY; DYNAMICS; PREDICTION; MACHINES; PATTERNS; RECONFIGURATION; QUANTIZATION	The brain at rest consists of spatially and temporal distributed but functionally connected regions that called intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). Resting state electroencephalography (rs-EEG) is a way to characterize brain networks without confounds associated with task EEG such as task difficulty and performance. A novel framework of how to study dynamic functional connectivity under the notion of functional connectivity microstates (FC mu states) and symbolic dynamics is further discussed. Furthermore, we introduced a way to construct a single integrated dynamic functional connectivity graph (IDFCG) that preserves both the strength of the connections between every pair of sensors but also the type of dominant intrinsic coupling modes (DICM). The whole methodology is demonstrated in a significant and unexplored task for EEG which is the definition of an objective Chronnectomic Brain Aged index (CBAI) extracted from resting-state data (N = 94 subjects) with both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. Novel features have been defined based on symbolic dynamics and the notion of DICM and FC mu states. The transition rate of FC mu states, the symbolic dynamics based on the evolution of FC mu states (the Markovian Entropy, the complexity index), the probability distribution of DICM, the novel Flexibility Index that captures the dynamic reconfiguration of DICM per pair of EEG sensors and the relative signal power constitute a valuable pool of features that can build the proposed CBAI. Here we applied a feature selection technique and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier to discriminate young adults from middle-aged and a Support Vector Regressor to build a linear model of the actual age based on EEG-based spatio-temporal features. The most significant type of features for both prediction of age and discrimination of young vs. adults age groups was the dynamic reconfiguration of dominant coupling modes derived from a subset of EEG sensor pairs. Specifically, our results revealed a very high prediction of age for eyes-open (R-2 = 0.60; y = 0.79x + 8.03) and lower for eyes-closed (R-2 = 0.48; y = 0.71x + 10.91) while we succeeded to correctly classify young vs. middle-age group with 97.8% accuracy in eyes-open and 87.2% for eyes-closed. Our results were reproduced also in a second dataset for further external validation of the whole analysis. The proposed methodology proved valuable for the characterization of the intrinsic properties of dynamic functional connectivity through the age untangling developmental differences using EEG resting-state recordings.

Best practice for single-trial detection of event-related potentials: Application to brain-computer interfaces	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Event-related potentials; Brain-computer Interface; Biomedical engineering; Spatial filtering; Multivariate pattern analysis; Classification	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MENTAL CHRONOMETRY; ERP COMPONENTS; P300; CLASSIFICATION; EEG; PROSTHESIS; ALGORITHMS; SPEED; MEG	The detection of event-related potentials (ERPs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is a fundamental component in non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) research, and in modern cognitive neuroscience studies. Whereas the grand average response across trials provides an estimation of essential characteristics of a brain evoked response, an estimation of the differences between trials for a particular type of stimulus can provide key insight about the brain dynamics and possible origins of the brain response. The research in ERP single trial detection has been mainly driven by applications in biomedical engineering, with an interest from machine learning and signal processing groups that test novel methods on noisy signals. Efficient single-trial detection techniques require processing steps that include temporal filtering, spatial filtering, and classification. In this paper, we review the current state-of-the-art methods for single-trial detection of event-related potentials with applications in BCI. Efficient single-trial detection techniques should embed simple yet efficient functions requiring as few hyper-parameters as possible. The focus of this paper is on methods that do not include a large number of hyper-parameters and can be easily implemented with datasets containing a limited number of trials. A benchmark of different classification methods is proposed on a database recorded from sixteen healthy subjects during a rapid serial visual presentation task. The results support the conclusion that single-trial detection can be achieved with an area under the ROC curve superior to 0.9 with less than ten sensors and 20 trials corresponding to the presentation of a target. Whereas the number of sensors is not a key element for efficient single-trial detection, the number of trials must be carefully chosen for creating a robust classifier. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In traditional biometric identification solutions used for person recognition in border security or humanitarian aid activities, biometrics like face, fingerprint or iris have usually been preferred. However, especially in illegal border crossing or asylum seeking processes, EEG signals can also be used to identify both the seekers' real intentions by emotion analysis and identities by biometric analysis. For instance, when content related to their origin are presented to subjects, their EEG response can be observed and used for person verification at border gates.

This paper presents a three-class classification system based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the nonlinear sparse extreme learning machine (SELM) for epilepsy and epileptic seizure detection. Three-level lifting DWT using Daubechies order 4 wavelet is introduced to decompose EEG signals into delta, theta, alpha, and beta subbands. Considering classification accuracy and computational complexity, the maximum and standard deviation values of each subband are computed to create an eight-dimensional feature vector. After comparing five multiclass SELM strategies, the one-against-one strategy with the highest accuracy is chosen for the three-class classification system. The performance of the designed three-class classification system is tested with publicly available epilepsy dataset. The results show that the system achieves high enough classification accuracy by combining the SELM and DWT and reduces training and testing time by decreasing computational complexity and feature dimension. With excellent classification performance and low computation complexity, this three-class classification system can be utilized for practical epileptic EEG detection, and it offers great potentials for portable automatic epilepsy and seizure detection system in the future hardware implementation.

J	Oliva, JT; Rosa, JLG				Oliva, Jefferson Tales; Garcia Rosa, Joao Luis			How an epileptic EEG segment, used as reference, can influence a cross-correlation classifier?	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						EEG; Epilepsy; Signal processing; Cross-correlation; Machine learning; Predictive models	APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; VECTOR; PARAMETERS; CAUSALITY; SPECTRUM	Several neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, can be diagnosed by electroencephalogram (EEG). Data mining supported by machine learning (ML) techniques can be used to find patterns and to build classifiers for the data. In order to make it possible, data should be represented in an appropriate format, e.g. attribute-value table, which can be built by feature extraction approaches, such as the cross-correlation (CC) method, which uses one signal as reference and correlates it with other signals. However, the reference is commonly selected randomly and, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted to evaluate whether this choice can affect the ML method performance. Thereby, this work aims to verify whether the choice of an epileptic EEG segment as reference can affect the performance of classifiers built from data. Also, a CC with artificial reference (CCAR) method is proposed in order to reduce possible consequences of the random selection of a signal as reference. Two experimental evaluations were conducted in a set of 200 EEG segments to induce classifiers using ML algorithms, such as J48, 1NN, naive Bayes, BP-MLP, and SMO. In the first study, each epileptic EEG segment was selected as reference to apply CC and ML methods. The evaluation found extremely significant difference, evidencing that the choice of an EEG segment as reference can influence the performance of ML methods. In the second study, the CCAR method was performed, in which statistical tests, only in comparisons involving the SMO classifier, showed not-so-good results.

However, the conventional subject-specific classifiers may induce additional burdens to each subject for preparing multiple-session EEG data as training sets. To this end, we developed a new EEG feature selection approach, transfer recursive feature elimination (T-RFE), to determine a set of the most robust EEG indicators with stable geometrical distribution across a group of training subjects and a specific testing subject. A validating set is introduced to independently determine the optimal hyper-parameter and the feature ranking of the T-RFE model aiming at controlling the overfitting. The effectiveness of the T-RFE algorithmfor such cross-subject emotion classification paradigmhas been validated by DEAP database. With a linear least square support vector machine classifier implemented, the performance of the T-RFE is compared against several conventional feature selection schemes and the statistical significant improvement has been found. The classification rate and F-score achieve 0.7867, 0.7526, 0.7875, and 0.8077 for arousal and valence dimensions, respectively, and outperform several recent reported works on the same database. In the end, the T-RFE based classifier is compared against two subject-generic classifiers in the literature. The investigation of the computational time for all classifiers indicates the accuracy improvement of the T-RFE is at the cost of the longer training time.

Traditionally, self-assessment with questionnaires is used to evaluate the attention degree of subjects in experiments. However, this kind of self-assessment approach is subjective and inaccurate. Low quality EEG data from subjects without attention might influence the experiment evaluation and degrade the performance of affective models. In this paper, we extract scanpaths of subjects while watching emotion clips with eye tracking glasses and propose an attention evaluation method with spacial-temporal scanpath analysis. Based on the assumption that subjects with attention have similar scanpath patterns under the same clips, our approach clusters these similar scanpath patterns and evaluate the attention degree. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach can cluster EEG features under attentive conditions effectively and significantly improve the classification performance. The mean accuracy of emotion recognition based on clustered high quality data is 81.70%, whereas the mean accuracy of using the whole dataset is 68.54%.

One non-invasive approach to investigate AD is to use electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The data are usually non-stationary with a strong background activity and noise which makes the analysis difficult leading to low performance in many real world applications including the detection of AD. In this study, we present a method based on local texture changes of EEG signals to differentiate AD patients from the healthy ones, using one-dimensional local binary patterns (1D-LBPs) coupled with support vector machines (SVM). Our proposed method maps the EEG data into a less detailed representation which is less sensitive to noise. A 10 fold cross validation performed at both the epoch and subject level show the discriminancy power of 1D-LBP feature vectors with application to AD data.				santosh.tirunagari@surrey.ac.uk; d.abasolo@surrey.ac.uk; n.poh@surrey.ac.uk	Poh, Norman/Y-8261-2019; Abasolo, Daniel/B-7322-2009	Abasolo, Daniel/0000-0002-4268-2885; Kouchaki, Samaneh/0000-0002-5870-4030	Medical Research Council (MRC) [R/M023281/1]	Medical Research Council (MRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))	The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. Simon Bull for his contribution in preparation of this paper.

J	Fuglsang, SA; Dau, T; Hjortkjaer, J				Fuglsang, Soren Asp; Dau, Torsten; Hjortkjaer, Jens			Noise-robust cortical tracking of attended speech in real-world acoustic scenes	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Auditory attention; Speech; Cortical entrainment; EEG; Decoding; Acoustic simulations; Delta rhythms; Theta rhythms	HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; PHASE PATTERNS; COCKTAIL PARTY; ENTRAINMENT; REPRESENTATION; RESPONSES; ENVELOPE; SOUND	Selectively attending to one speaker in a multi-speaker scenario is thought to synchronize low-frequency cortical activity to the attended speech signal. In recent studies, reconstruction of speech from single-trial electroencephalogram (EEG) data has been used to decode which talker a listener is attending to in a two-talker situation. It is currently unclear how this generalizes to more complex sound environments. Behaviorally, speech perception is robust to the acoustic distortions that listeners typically encounter in everyday life, but it is unknown whether this is mirrored by a noise-robust neural tracking of attended speech. Here we used advanced acoustic simulations to recreate real-world acoustic scenes in the laboratory. In virtual acoustic realities with varying amounts of reverberation and number of interfering talkers, listeners selectively attended to the speech stream of a particular talker. Across the different listening environments, we found that the attended talker could be accurately decoded from single-trial EEG data irrespective of the different distortions in the acoustic input. For highly reverberant environments, speech envelopes reconstructed from neural responses to the distorted stimuli resembled the original clean signal more than the distorted input. With reverberant speech, we observed a late cortical response to the attended speech stream that encoded temporal modulations in the speech signal without its reverberant distortion. Single-trial attention decoding accuracies based on 40-50 s long blocks of data from 64 scalp electrodes were equally high (80-90% correct) in all considered listening environments and remained statistically significant using down to 10 scalp electrodes and short (<30-s) unaveraged EEG segments. In contrast to the robust decoding of the attended talker we found that decoding of the unattended talker deteriorated with the acoustic distortions. These results suggest that cortical activity tracks an attended speech signal in a way that is invariant to acoustic distortions encountered in real-life sound environments. Noise-robust attention decoding additionally suggests a potential utility of stimulus reconstruction techniques in attention-controlled brain-computer interfaces.

Two main issues are addressed in this work: the first one consists of an adaptive filter design to increase the classification accuracy for motor imagery. The second issue deals with the design of an efficient hardware/software embedded architeclture integrating the entire EEG signal processing chain. In this embedded system organization, the pre-processing techniques, which are time consuming, are integrated as hardware accelerators. The remaining blocks (Intellectual Properties - IP) are developed as embedded-software running on an embedded soft-core processor. The pre-processing step is designed to be self-adjusted according to the intrinsic characteristics of each subject. The feature extraction process uses the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) as a filter due to its effectiveness to extract the ERD/ERS (Event-Related Desynchronization/Synchronization) effect, where the classifier is based on the Mahalanobis distance. The advantage of the proposed system lies in its simplicity and short processing time while maintaining a high performance in term of classification accuracy. A prototype of the embedded system has been implemented on an Altera FPGA-based platform (Stratix-IV). It is shown that the proposed architecture can effectively extract discriminative features for motor imagery with a maximum frequency of 150 MHz. The proposed system was validated on EEG data of twelve subjects from the BCI competition data sets. The prototype performs a fast classification within time delay of 0.399 second per trial, an accuracy average of 94.47 %, an average transfer rate over all subjects of 20.74 bits/min. The estimated power consumption of the proposed system is around 1.067 Watt (based on an integrated tool-power analysis of Altera corporation).

Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are collected from a user in real-time during tasks of imaginary movements. The imagined body kinematics are decoded using a regression model to calculate the user-intended velocity. Then, the decoded kinematic information is mapped to control the gestures of a social robot.

EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interface for Decoding Motor Imagery Tasks within the Same Hand Using Choi-Williams Time-Frequency Distribution	SENSORS			English	Article						motor imagery; Choi-Williams time-frequency distribution; electroencephalography; time-frequency features; hierarchical classification; support vector machines; subject-independent analysis	HIGHER-ORDER STATISTICS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; SIGNAL; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; PROSTHESIS; MOVEMENTS; FEATURES; SEIZURE	This paper presents an EEG-based brain-computer interface system for classifying eleven motor imagery (MI) tasks within the same hand. The proposed system utilizes the Choi-Williams time-frequency distribution (CWD) to construct a time-frequency representation (TFR) of the EEG signals. The constructed TFR is used to extract five categories of time-frequency features (TFFs). The TFFs are processed using a hierarchical classification model to identify the MI task encapsulated within the EEG signals. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, EEG data were recorded for eighteen intact subjects and four amputated subjects while imagining to perform each of the eleven hand MI tasks. Two performance evaluation analyses, namely channel-and TFF-based analyses, are conducted to identify the best subset of EEG channels and the TFFs category, respectively, that enable the highest classification accuracy between the MI tasks. In each evaluation analysis, the hierarchical classification model is trained using two training procedures, namely subject-dependent and subject-independent procedures. These two training procedures quantify the capability of the proposed approach to capture both intra-and inter-personal variations in the EEG signals for different MI tasks within the same hand. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach for classifying the MI tasks within the same hand. In particular, the classification accuracies obtained for the intact and amputated subjects are as high as 88.8% and 90.2%, respectively, for the subject-dependent training procedure, and 80.8% and 87.8%, respectively, for the subject-independent training procedure. These results suggest the feasibility of applying the proposed approach to control dexterous prosthetic hands, which can be of great benefit for individuals suffering from hand amputations.

More specifically, we perform a comparison between Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) related features and features based on Power Spectral Density (PSD) techniques. Furthermore, for the identification of MI tasks, two well-known classifiers are used, the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and the Support Vector Machines (SVM). Our results confirm that PSD features demonstrate the most consistent robustness and effectiveness in extracting patterns for accurately discriminating between left and right MI tasks.

The proposed system is based upon machine learning classifiers, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect artifacts and wavelet decomposition by cascaded discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to remove artifacts from EEG signal. Our proposed system is able to operate and process 1 Sec window of EEG signal with 512 Hz sample rate in less than one second. We present the overall technique, with preliminary results for software and hardware implementation when using real EEG data recordings. The method outperforms the more common ICA based solution in terms of computational complexity and memory requirements.

Electroencephalogram (EEG), a useful measure for analysing the brain's electrical activity, has been widely used for the detection of epileptic seizures. Most existing classification techniques are primarily aimed at increasing detection accuracy, while the interpretability of the methods have received relatively little attention. In this work, we concentrate on the epileptic classification of EEG signals with interpretability. We propose an epilepsy detection framework, followed by a comparative study under this framework to evaluate the accuracy and interpretability of four rule based classifiers, namely, the decision tree algorithm C4.5, the random forest algorithm (RF), the support vector machine (SVM)-based decision tree algorithm (SVM+C4.5), and the SVM-based RF algorithm (SVM+RF), in two-group, three-group, and the most challenging of all five-group classifications of EEG signals. The experimental results showed that RF outperformed the other three rule -based classifiers, achieving average accuracies of 0.9896, 0.9600, and 0.8260 for the two-group, three-group, and five-group seizure classifications respectively, and exhibiting higher interpretability.

Abnormal local and long-range brain connectivity have been widely reported in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet the nature of these abnormalities and their functional relevance at distinct cortical rhythms remains unknown. Investigations of intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) and their coherence across whole brain networks hold promise for determining whether patterns of functional connectivity abnormalities vary across frequencies and networks in ASD. In the present study, we aimed to probe atypical intrinsic brain connectivity networks in ASD from resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data via characterizing the whole brain network. Approach. Connectivity within individual ICNs (measured by spectral power) and between ICNs (measured by coherence) were examined at four canonical frequency bands via a time-frequency independent component analysis on high-density EEG, which were recorded from 20 ASD and 20 typical developing (TD) subjects during an eyes-closed resting state. Main results. Among twelve identified electrophysiological ICNs, individuals with ASD showed hyper-connectivity in individual ICNs and hypo-connectivity between ICNs. Functional connectivity alterations in ASD were more severe in the frontal lobe and the default mode network (DMN) and at low frequency bands. These functional connectivity measures also showed abnormal age-related associations in ICNs related to frontal, temporal and motor regions in ASD. Significance. Our findings suggest that ASD is characterized by the opposite directions of abnormalities (i.e. hypo-and hyper-connectivity) in the hierarchical structure of the whole brain network, with more impairments in the frontal lobe and the DMN at low frequency bands, which are critical for top-down control of sensory systems, as well as for both cognition and social skills.

However, the dynamical properties of the testing physiological data regarding the time series may influence the feature distribution variation and inter-class discrimination across different time steps. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel EEG feature selection method, dynamical recursive feature elimination (D-RFE), to find the optimal but different feature rankings at each time instant for arousal and valence recognition. With the classification framework implemented via a model-selected least square support vector machine, the participant-specific classification performance has been significantly improved against conventional RFE model and several common classifiers. The optimal classification accuracy and F1-score elicited by the proposed method are 0.7896, 0.7991, 0.7143, and 0.7257 for arousal and valence dimensions, respectively, which are quite competitive among recent reported works on the same EEG database.

En route to future technical applications of neuromorphic computing, a major current challenge lies in the identification and implementation of brain inspired algorithms to decode recorded signals. Neuromorphic computing is believed to allow real-time implementation of large scale spiking models for processing and computation in non-invasive BMIs. Taking inspiration from the olfactory system of insects, we advance and implement a novel approach to decode and predict imaginary movements from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We use a spiking neural network implemented on SpiNNaker (4 chip, 64 cores) neuromorphic hardware. Our work provides a proof of concept for a successful implementation of a functional spiking neural network for decoding two motor imagery (MI) movements on the SpiNNaker system. The approach can be extended to classify more complex MI movements on larger SpiNNaker systems.

On the contrary, recent evidence suggests that in humans the motor cortex is also significantly engaged during complex locomotion tasks. However, a detailed understanding of cortical contribution to locomotion is still lacking especially during stereotyped activities. Here, we show that cortical motor areas finely control leg muscle activation during treadmill stereotyped walking. Using a novel technique based on a combination of Reliable Independent Component Analysis, source localization and effective connectivity, and by combining electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) recordings in able-bodied adults we were able to examine for the first time cortical activation patterns and cortico-muscular connectivity including information flow direction. Results not only provided evidence of cortical activity associated with locomotion, but demonstrated significant causal unidirectional drive from contralateral motor cortex to muscles in the swing leg. These insights overturn the traditional view that human cortex has a limited role in the control of stereotyped locomotion, and suggest useful hypotheses concerning mechanisms underlying gait under other conditions. One sentence summary: Motor cortex proactively drives contralateral swing leg muscles during treadmill walking, counter to the traditional view of stereotyped human locomotion.

Sequential EEG-sleep analysis in preterm infants provides insights into functional brain integrity and can document deviations of the biologically pre-programmed process of sleep onto genesis during the neonatal period. Visual assessment of neonatal sleep-EEG, with integration of both cerebral and non-cerebral measures to better define neonatal state, is still considered the gold standard. Electrographic patterns evolve over time and are gradually time locked with behavioural characteristics which allow classification of quiet sleep and active sleep periods during the last 10 weeks of gestation. Near term age, the neonate expresses a short ultradian sleep cycle, with two distinct active and quiet sleep, as well as brief periods of transitional or indeterminate sleep. Qualitative assessment of neonatal sleep is however challenged by biological and environmental variables that influence the expression of EEG-sleep patterns and sleep organization. Developing normative EEG-sleep data with the aid of automated analytic methods, can further improve our understanding of extra-uterine brain development and state organization under stressful or pathological conditions. Based on those developmental biomarkers of normal and abnormal brain function, research can be conducted to support and optimise sleep in the NICU, with the ultimate goal to improve therapeutic interventions and neurodevelopmental outcome.

Notably, spontaneous brain activity recorded at rest can be characterized by four distinctive topographies. Despite their well-established role during resting state, their implication in the generation of motor behavior is debated. Evidence of such a functional role of spontaneous brain activity would provide support for the design of novel and sensitive biomarkers in neurological disorders. Here we examined whether and to what extent intrinsic brain activity contributes and plays a functional role during natural motor behaviors. For this we first extracted subject-specific EEG microstates and muscle synergies during reaching-and-grasping movements in healthy volunteers. We show that, in every subject, well-known resting-state microstates persist during movement execution with similar topographies and temporal characteristics, but are supplemented by novel task-related microstates. We then show that the subject-specific microstates' dynamical organization correlates with the activation of muscle synergies and can be used to decode individual grasping movements with high accuracy. These findings provide first evidence that spontaneous brain activity encodes detailed information about motor control, offering as such the prospect of a novel tool for the definition of subject-specific biomarkers of brain plasticity and recovery in neuro-motor disorders.

J	Song, JL; Zhang, R				Song, Jiang-Ling; Zhang, Rui			Application of extreme learning machine to epileptic seizure detection based on lagged Poincare plots	MULTIDIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Epilepsy; EEG; Lagged Poincare plot; Extreme learning machine (ELM)	EEG; CLASSIFICATION; ENTROPY; PREDICTION	Epilepsy is a serious brain disorder affecting nearly 1 % of the world's population. Detecting the epileptic seizures in EEGs is not only the first step for the diagnosis, but also a significant evidence for the treatment follow-up in epilepsy patients. In recent years, automatic seizure detection using epileptic EEGs has been developed with the significance of relieving the heavy workload of traditional visual inspection for diagnosing epilepsy. The appropriate feature extraction method and efficient classifier are recognized to be crucial in the successful realization. This paper first designs a novel lagged-PoincaA center dot e-based feature extraction method on the basis of a class of lagged PoincaA center dot e plots, as well as the scatter-degree and distribution-uniformity of them which are explored to characterize the lag-T PoincaA center dot e plots from the quantitative point of view. Then we propose an automatic seizure detection method LPBF-ELM which integrates the lagged-PoincaA center dot e-based feature LPBF and extreme learning machine (ELM). Experimental results on Bonn database demonstrate that the proposed method LPBF-ELM does a good job in epileptic seizure detection while preserving the efficiency and simplicity.

J	Park, SH; Lee, SG				Park, Sang-Hoon; Lee, Sang-Goog			Small Sample Setting and Frequency Band Selection Problem Solving Using Subband Regularized Common Spatial Pattern	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); regularized common spatial pattern (R-CSP); electroencephalogram (EEG); subband; small sample; motor imagery	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; CLASSIFICATION; FILTERS	For the last few years, motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems have received the significant amount of attention in various areas, including medicine and engineering. The common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is the most commonly used method to extract features from motor imagery EEG. However, the CSP algorithm has limited applicability in small-sample setting (SSS) situations because these rely on a covariance matrix. In addition, the large differences in performance depend on the frequency bands that are being used. To address these problems, 4-40 Hz band EEG signals are divided into nine subbands, and regularized CSP (R-CSP) is applied to individual subbands. Fisher's linear discriminant (FLD) is applied to the features of R-CSP extracted from individual subbands, and the results obtained through the foregoing are connected for all subbands to make an FLD score vector. Furthermore, principal component analysis is applied to use the FLD score vectors as the inputs of the classifier least square support vector machine. The proposed method yielded a classification accuracy of 86.61%, 98.21%, 63.78%, 87.05%, and 77.78% from five subjects ("aa", "l", "av", "aw", and "ay", respectively) for BCI competition III data set IVa by using 18 channels in the vicinity of the motor area of the cerebral cortex. The proposed method offers particularly excellent performance in SSS situations.

Trained on patient intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data, our algorithm has a high seizure prediction sensitivity while maintaining an acceptably low number of false positives. In order to transition this algorithm to an implantable clinical device, the hardware solution must draw minimal power and conform to a small form factor. With the end goal of designing and fabricating an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), we have implemented our machine learning algorithmic pipeline on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). This FPGA implementation runs on real-time patient data and maintains all performance specifications.

J	Boyle, SC; Kayser, SJ; Kayser, C				Boyle, Stephanie C.; Kayser, Stephanie J.; Kayser, Christoph			Neural correlates of multisensory reliability and perceptual weights emerge at early latencies during audio-visual integration	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cross-modal; electroencephalography; psychophysics; single-trial analysis	AUDITORY-VISUAL INTERACTIONS; DECISION-MAKING; CUE INTEGRATION; SHAPE INFORMATION; HUMANS; SIGNALS; TEXTURE; PRINCIPLES; ATTENTION; VISION	To make accurate perceptual estimates, observers must take the reliability of sensory information into account. Despite many behavioural studies showing that subjects weight individual sensory cues in proportion to their reliabilities, it is still unclear when during a trial neuronal responses are modulated by the reliability of sensory information or when they reflect the perceptual weights attributed to each sensory input. We investigated these questions using a combination of psychophysics, EEG-based neuroimaging and single-trial decoding. Our results show that the weighted integration of sensory information in the brain is a dynamic process; effects of sensory reliability on task-relevant EEG components were evident 84 ms after stimulus onset, while neural correlates of perceptual weights emerged 120 ms after stimulus onset. These neural processes had different underlying sources, arising from sensory and parietal regions, respectively. Together these results reveal the temporal dynamics of perceptual and neural audio-visual integration and support the notion of temporally early and functionally specific multisensory processes in the brain.

Decoding of Self-paced Lower-Limb Movement Intention: A Case Study on the Influence Factors	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						brain-machine interface (BMI); electroencephalography (EEG); lower-limb movement; onset detection; movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs); sensory motor rhythms (SMRs)	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; EEG; DESYNCHRONIZATION; COMMUNICATION; PREDICTION; POTENTIALS; ANKLE	Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have been applied as new rehabilitation tools for motor disabled individuals. Active involvement of cerebral activity has been shown to enhance neuroplasticity and thus to restore mobility. Various studies have focused on the detection of upper-limb movement intention, while the fewer study has investigated the lower-limb movement intention decoding. This study presents a BMI to decode the self-paced lower-limb movement intention, with 10 healthy subjects participating in the experiment. We varied four influence factors including the movement type (dorsiflexion or plantar flexion), the limb side (left or right leg), the processing method (time-series analysis based on MRCP, i.e., movement-related cortical potential or frequency-domain estimation based on SMR, i.e., sensory motor rhythm) and the frequency band (e.g., delta, theta, mu, beta and MRCP band at [0.1 1] Hz), to estimate both single-trial and sample-based performance. Feature analysis was then conducted to show the discriminant power (DP) and brain modulations. The average detection latency was 0.334 +/- 0.216 s in single-trial basis across all conditions. An average area under the curve (AUC) of 91.0 +/- 3.5% and 68.2 +/- 4.6% was obtained for the MRCP-based and SMR-based method in the classification, respectively. The best performance was yielded from plantar flexion with left leg using time-series analysis on the MRCP band. The feature analysis indicated a cross-subject consistency of DP with the MRCP-based method and subject-specific variance of DP with the SMR-based method. The results presented here might be further exploited in a rehabilitation scenario. The comprehensive factor analysis might be used to shed light on the design of an effective brain switch to trigger external robotic devices.

Brain-computer interface technology offers the possibility of decoding the attempt to move paretic limbs in real time to improve existing motor rehabilitation. However, a major difficulty for the practical application of the BCI to stroke survivors is that the brain rhythms that encode the motor states might be diminished due to the lesion. This study investigates the continuous decoding of natural attempt to move the paralyzed upper limb in stroke survivors from electroencephalographic signals of the unaffected contralesional motor cortex. Results: Experiments were carried out with the aid of six severely affected chronic stroke patients performing/attempting self-selected reaching movements of the unaffected/affected upper limb. The electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis showed significant cortical activation on the uninjured motor cortex when moving the contralateral unaffected arm and in the attempt tomove the ipsilateral affected arm. Using this activity, significant continuous decoding of movement was obtained in six out of six participants in movements of the unaffected limb, and in four out of six participants in the attempt to move the affected limb. Con-clusion: This study showed that it is possible to construct a decoder of the attempt to move the paretic arm for chronic stroke patients using the EEG activity of the healthy contralesional motor cortex. Significance: This decoding model could provide to stroke survivors with a natural, easy, and intuitive way to achieve control of BCIs or robot-assisted rehabilitation devices.

Since electroencephalogram (EEG) signals carry extensive information about cognition skills, which include attention, then the potential of using EEG signals for people with low attention span can be quite significant. EEG can be read using the new wireless EEG reading devices often used by Brain-computer Interface (BCI) researchers. In parallel, serious games have been recently utilized for rehabilitating various cognitive and emotional deficits. In this paper, we put the two things together, and we investigate the integration of an EEG-controlled serious game that trains and strengthens patients' attention ability while using machine learning to detect their attention level. Our preliminary experiments with healthy individuals show an accuracy of up to 96% in classifying the EEG data to detect the correct attention state during gameplay. This promising result serves as motivation to test our models with actual ADHD patients in the future.

Most of the studies focused on short clips and were designed with specific tasks. This paper investigated the emotional states from electroencephalogram (EEG) activities during music appreciation. An emotion evoked experiment paradigm was designed during music appreciation. The EEG signals were recorded in 15 healthy adults during the entire process of music listening. The band power change (BPC) and higher order crossing (HOC) features were extracted from the EEG signals. A correlation-based feature analysis approach was proposed to find the most relevant features in time, frequency and channel space domains. From the results, this method achieved the average accuracy of 67.2% for the classification of high and low valence in the combination of BPC and HOC features. A deeper understanding of the brain emotional patterns could be helpful in building an intelligent and friendly affective application.

Multi-feature classifiers for burst detection in single EEG channels from preterm infants	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG bursts; preterm infants; automated detection; logistic regression	HEALTHY FULL-TERM; INTERBURST INTERVAL; AUTOMATED DETECTION; PREMATURE-INFANTS; STATES; SLEEP; BORN; AGE	Objective. The study of electroencephalographic (EEG) bursts in preterm infants provides valuable information about maturation or prognostication after perinatal asphyxia. Over the last two decades, a number of works proposed algorithms to automatically detect EEG bursts in preterm infants, but they were designed for populations under 35 weeks of post menstrual age (PMA). However, as the brain activity evolves rapidly during postnatal life, these solutions might be under-performing with increasing PMA. In this work we focused on preterm infants reaching term ages (PMA. 36 weeks) using multi-feature classification on a single EEG channel. Approach. Five EEG burst detectors relying on different machine learning approaches were compared: logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machines (SVM) and thresholding (Th). Classifiers were trained by visually labeled EEG recordings from 14 very preterm infants (born after 28 weeks of gestation) with 36-41 weeks PMA. Main results. The most performing classifiers reached about 95% accuracy (kNN, SVM and LR) whereas Th obtained 84%. Compared to human-automatic agreements, LR provided the highest scores (Cohen's kappa = 0.71) using only three EEG features. Applying this classifier in an unlabeled database of 21 infants. 36 weeks PMA, we found that long EEG bursts and short inter-burst periods are characteristic of infants with the highest PMA and weights. Significance. In view of these results, LR-based burst detection could be a suitable tool to study maturation in monitoring or portable devices using a single EEG channel.

At this point, especially forecasting chaotic systems has been a remarkable research approach. As being associated with the works on forecasting chaotic systems, some application areas are very interested in benefiting from advantages of forecasting time series. For instance, forecasting electroencephalogram (EEG) time series enables researchers to learn more about future status of the brain activity in terms of any physical or pathological case. In this sense, this work introduces an ANFIS-VOA hybrid system, which is based on ANFIS and a new optimization algorithm called as vortex optimization algorithm (VOA). Generally, the system provides a basic, strong enough, alternative forecasting solution way for EEG time series. The performed evaluation applications have shown that the ANFIS-VOA approach here provided effective enough solution way for forecasting EEG time series, as a result of learning-reasoning infrastructure achieved by the combination of two different artificial intelligence techniques.

In this paper, we presented a new machine learning method for CIT in which each subject is considered independent of the others. The main goal of this study is to adapt the discriminative sparse models to be applicable for subject-based concealed information test. Methods: In order to provide sufficient discriminability between guilty and innocent subjects, we introduced a novel discriminative sparse representation model and its appropriate learning methods. For evaluation of the method forty-four subjects participated in a mock crime scenario and their EEG data were recorded. As the model input, in this study the recurrence plot features were extracted from single trial data of different stimuli. Then the extracted feature vectors were reduced using statistical dependency method. The reduced feature vector went through the proposed subject-based sparse model in which the discrimination power of sparse code and reconstruction error were applied simultaneously. Results: Experimental results showed that the proposed approach achieved better performance than other competing discriminative sparse models. The classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the presented sparsity-based method were about 93%, 91% and 95% respectively. Conclusions: Using the EEG data of a single subject in response to different stimuli types and with the aid of the proposed discriminative sparse representation model, one can distinguish guilty subjects from innocent ones. Indeed, this property eliminates the necessity of several subject EEG data in model learning and decision making for a specific subject. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Motor imagery is an efficient way for rehabilitation. To achieve the supervision of multiple rehabilitation targets simultaneously, the promotion of multi-class motor imagery classification accuracy is critical. In this paper, a multi-class classification method is proposed by utilizing singular value decomposition and deep boltzmann machine. Singular value decomposition is applied to suppress the artifacts and acquire the channel-individual characteristics. The deep boltzmann machine is employed to extract and model the characteristics and achieve the motor imagery classification. Results demonstrate that the proposed method has achieved a 14.2% higher classification accuracy than the common spatial pattern on average.

In this paper, empirical wavelet transform (EWT) is introduced for EEG feature extraction, and then a new EEG recognition method based on EWT is proposed. In the proposed method, the EEG features of the left arm flexion and extension motor imagery mode were first extracted via EWT and compared with those extracted by the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), and then the extracted features were classified by support vector machine (SVM). The results show that the EWT method significantly outperforms the EMD method, which can effectively decompose the intrinsic modes of EEG, and it presents several merits of fewer modes, no false mode and low computation cost. Therefore, the EWT method can effectively extract the local transient features of EEG and realize the effective classification through SVM, thus providing the chance of driving assistance through the arm flexion and extension imagination.

Different feature selection algorithms have been proposed to overcome this problem but most of them involve complex transformed features, which require high computation and also result in increasing size of the feature set. In this paper, we present a new hybrid method to select features that involves a Differential Evolution (DE) optimization algorithm for searching the feature space to generate the optimal feature subset, with performance evaluated by a classifier. We provide a comprehensive study of the significance of evolutionary algorithm in selecting the best features for EEG signals. The BCI competition III, dataset IVa has been used to evaluate the method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs well with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, with an average classification accuracy of above 95% with a minimum of just 10 features. We also present a comparison of Differential Evolution (DE) with other evolutionary algorithms, and the results show the superiority of DE which implies that, with the selection of a good searching algorithm, a simple Common Spatial Pattern filter features can produce good results.

Classifier transfers usually come with dataset shifts. To overcome dataset shifts in practical applications, we consider the limitations in computational resources in this paper for the adaptation of batch learning algorithms, like the support vector machine (SVM). Approach. We focus on data selection strategies which limit the size of the stored training data by different inclusion, exclusion, and further dataset manipulation criteria like handling class imbalance with two new approaches. We provide a comparison of the strategies with linear SVMs on several synthetic datasets with different data shifts as well as on different transfer settings with electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Main results. For the synthetic data, adding only misclassified samples performed astoundingly well. Here, balancing criteria were very important when the other criteria were not well chosen. For the transfer setups, the results show that the best strategy depends on the intensity of the drift during the transfer. Adding all and removing the oldest samples results in the best performance, whereas for smaller drifts, it can be sufficient to only add samples near the decision boundary of the SVM which reduces processing resources. Significance. For brain-computer interfaces based on EEG data, models trained on data from a calibration session, a previous recording session, or even from a recording session with another subject are used. We show, that by using the right combination of data selection criteria, it is possible to adapt the SVM classifier to overcome the performance drop from the transfer.

Theta Oscillations Rapidly Convey Odor-Specific Content in Human Piriform Cortex	NEURON			English	Article							BULB GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; OLFACTORY SYSTEM; BETA-OSCILLATIONS; HUMAN AMYGDALA; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; RAT; DISCRIMINATION; PHASE; BRAIN; TASK	Olfactory oscillations are pervasive throughout vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. Such observations have long implied that rhythmic activity patterns play a fundamental role in odor coding. Using intracranial EEG recordings from rare patients with medically resistant epilepsy, we find that theta oscillations are a distinct electrophysiological signature of olfactory processing in the human brain. Across seven patients, odor stimulation enhanced theta power in human piriform cortex, with robust effects at the level of single trials. Importantly, classification analysis revealed that piriform oscillatory activity conveys olfactory-specific information that can be decoded within 110-518 ms of a sniff, and maximally within the theta frequency band. This temporal window was also associated with increased thetaspecific phase coupling between piriform cortex and hippocampus. Together these findings suggest that human piriform cortex has access to olfactory content in the time-frequency domain and can utilize these signals to rapidly differentiate odor stimuli.

It may be elicited by intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). PS mostly affects young individuals, with adolescent females at greatest risk. The diagnosis of PS is based on visual EEG assessment. To date, no objective test of PS has been established. Method: Here we describe 89 individuals of both sexes, aged 5-18 years, epileptic and non-epileptic, in whom a PPR was elicited by IPS during a standard EEG procedure. The distribution of amplitude and intrahemispheric coherence indices were analyzed and, in each case, revealed a unique pattern of PPR propagation. Results: A lateral (occipito-temporo-frontal) track was found in 52% of recordings, and 55% of individuals tested showed symmetric patterns. A bilateral pattern dominated in all age groups, all grades of PS, and across epileptic and non-epileptic groups. Conclusion: A symmetric, bilateral pattern is the most common type of PPR across genders and all ages, regardless of grade of PS and the presence of epilepsy. The results of this study show the current PPR classification in a new light and provide a basis for the concept of PPR lateralization based on objective, quantitative findings.

Interictal network synchrony and local heterogeneity predict epilepsy surgery outcome among pediatric patients	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy surgery; Epileptogenic zone; Pediatric epilepsy; Intracranial EEG; Functional connectivity	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SEIZURE ONSET; EEG; CHILDREN; CLASSIFICATION; ADULTS; BRAIN; ZONE	Objective: Epilepsy is a disorder of aberrant cortical networks. Researchers have proposed that characterizing presurgical network connectivity may improve the surgical management of intractable seizures, but few studies have rigorously examined the relationship between network activity and surgical outcome. In this study, we assessed whether local and global measures of network activity differentiated patients with favorable (seizure-free) versus unfavorable (seizure-persistent) surgical outcomes. Methods: Seventeen pediatric intracranial electroencephalography (IEEG) patients were retrospectively examined. For each patient, 1,200 random interictal epochs of 1s duration were analyzed. Functional connectivity networks were constructed using an amplitude-based correlation technique (Spearman correlation). Global network synchrony was computed as the average pairwise connectivity strength. Local signal heterogeneity was defined for each channel as the variability of EEG amplitude (root mean square) and absolute delta power (mu V-2/Hz) across epochs. A support vector machine learning algorithm used global and local measures to classify patients by surgical outcome. Classification was assessed using the Leave-One-Out (LOO) permutation test. Results: Global synchrony was increased in the seizure-persistent group compared to seizure-free patients (Student's t-test, p = 0.006). Seizure-onset zone (SOZ) electrodes exhibited increased signal heterogeneity compared to non-SOZ electrodes, primarily in seizure-persistent patients. Global synchrony and local heterogeneity measures were used to accurately classify 16 (94.1%) of 17 patients by surgical outcome (LOO test, iterations = 10,000, p < 0.001). Significance: Measures of global network synchrony and local signal heterogeneity represent promising biomarkers for assessing patient candidacy in pediatric epilepsy surgery.

They rely on manual scoring of sleep stages from raw polisomnography signals, which is a tedious visual task requiring the workload of highly trained professionals. Consequently, research efforts to purse for an automatic stage scoring based on machine learning techniques have been carried out over the last years. In this work, we resort to multitaper spectral analysis to create visually interpretable images of sleep patterns from EEG signals as inputs to a deep convolutional network trained to solve visual recognition tasks. As a working example of transfer learning, a system able to accurately classify sleep stages in new unseen patients is presented. Evaluations in a widely-used publicly available dataset favourably compare to state-of-the-art results, while providing a framework for visual interpretation of outcomes.

Beyond hypsarrhythmia	REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA			Spanish	Article						Epileptic spasms; Hypsarrhythmia; Video-EEG; West's syndrome	WEST-SYNDROME; ILAE COMMISSION; SLOW WAVES; CLASSIFICATION; SEIZURES; EEG; TERMINOLOGY	Epileptic spasms are the most frequent type of epileptic seizures in infants. They can also occur beyond the period of infancy, within the context of other epileptic encephalopathies or as an expression of a focal or generalised epilepsy. The clinical semiology of epileptic spasms varies greatly. They sometimes consist of very subtle clinical manifestations, which occur in series, without the typical axorhizomelic contraction, or in association with focal seizures. The critical EEG correlate is also very variable and basically consists of the combination of a hypervoltage slow wave, a bout of rapid low-amplitude activity or a diffuse attenuation of the trace. The electromyographic recording of both deltoids during the EEG-video study helps to detect clinically subtle spasms and to define certain features of them that are clinically hard to determine. The classic interictal EEG pattern of hypsarrhythmia, or one of its variants, is not always present. Epileptic spasms can sometimes be mistaken for another type of paroxysmal episodes that can be epileptic or non-epileptic, and the EEG-video study may play a key role for the differential diagnosis. Taken together, the findings from the EEG-video study allow an adequate diagnosis and classification of the different epileptic seizures and syndromes, which can optimise both the therapeutic management and aetiological investigation.

Renyi entropy generalizes the well-known Shannon entropy, and hence providing better flexibility in application to real data. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of Renyi entropy as feature extraction method for motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). In this paper, Renyi entropy has been implemented in MI systems of various settings using BCI competition data sets. The classification accuracy of Renyi entropy in all data sets is benchmarked against common spatial pattern (CSP), the state-of-the-art feature extraction method. For common binary class data sets, Renyi entropy achieves an accuracy of approximately 3.4 % higher for BCI Competition II Data Set III and 0.87 % lower for BCI Competition III Data Set I, and there is no difference in accuracy for BCI Competition III Data Set IVc when compared against conventional CSP. In small sample setting, the average classification accuracy using Renyi entropy is approximately 3.4 and 0.3 % higher as compared to conventional CSP and best performing variant of regularized CSP, respectively. In addition, Renyi entropy is also compared to other chaos-inspired feature extraction methods, namely Katz and Higuchi which are implemented for MI systems by earlier researchers. The effect of implementing Renyi entropy on multiple narrower frequency sub-bands is also investigated in this study. In multi-class setting, Renyi entropy shows no statistical difference (p = 0.6022, paired t test) in accuracy when compared to the algorithm of the BCI competition winner. However, Renyi entropy has an advantage of requiring only one single application of feature extraction regardless of the number of classes, while multiple implementation of CSP is required as CSP is originally designed for binary class problem. The successful application of Renyi entropy in all the aforementioned settings indicates that Renyi entropy is a viable feature extraction alternative for MI-based BCI systems.

J	Sharma, M; Pachori, RB				Sharma, Manish; Pachori, Ram Bilas			A NOVEL APPROACH TO DETECT EPILEPTIC SEIZURES USING A COMBINATION OF TUNABLE-Q WAVELET TRANSFORM AND FRACTAL DIMENSION	JOURNAL OF MECHANICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Electroencephalography; EEG; epilepsy; seizure; tunable-Q wavelet transforms; fractal dimension	AUTOMATED DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; LEAST-SQUARES; FILTER BANKS; TIME-SERIES; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; ENTROPY; DESIGN	The detection and quantification of seizures can be achieved through the analysis of nonstationary electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The detection of these intractable seizures involving human beings is a challenging and difficult task. The analysis of EEG through human inspection is prone to errors and may lead to false conclusions. The computer-aided systems have been developed to assist neurophysiologists in the identification of seizure activities accurately. We propose a new machine learning and signal processing-based automated system that can detect epileptic episodes accurately. The proposed algorithm employs a promising time-frequency tool called tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT) to decompose EEG signals into various sub-bands (SBs). The fractal dimensions (FDs) of the SBs have been used as the discriminating features. The TQWT has many attractive features, such as tunable oscillatory attribute and time-invariance property, which are favorable for the analysis of nonstationary and transient signals. Fractal dimension is a nonlinear chaotic trait that has been proven to be very useful in the analysis and classifications of nonstationary signals including EEG. First, we decompose EEG signals into the desired SBs. Then, we compute FD for each SB. These FDs of the SBs have been applied to the least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier with radial basis function (RBF) kernel. We have used 10-fold cross-validation to ensure reliable performance and avoid the possible over-fitting of the model. In the proposed study, we investigate the following four popular classification tasks (CTs) related to different classes of EEG signals: (i) normal versus seizure (ii) seizure-free versus seizure (iii) nonseizure versus Seizure (iv) normal versus seizure-free. The proposed model surpassed existing models in the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), average classification accuracy (ACA), and average classification sensitivity (ACS). The proposed system attained perfect 100% ACS for all CTs considered in this study. The method achieved the highest classification accuracy as well as the largest area under ROC curve (AUC) for all classes. The salient feature of our proposed model is that, though many models exist in the literature, which gave high ACA, however, their performance has not been evaluated using MCC and AUC along with ACA simultaneously. The evaluation of the performance in terms of only ACA which may be misleading. Hence, the performance of the proposed model has been assessed not only in terms of ACA but also in terms AUC and MCC. Moreover, the performance of the model has been found to be almost equivalent to a perfect model, and the performance of the proposed model surpasses the existing models for the CTs investigated by us. Therefore, the proposed model is expected to assist clinicians in analyzing seizures accurately in less time without any error.

It has a prime importance in the development of p300-based braincomputer interface (BCI). Hence, accurate detection of p300 components will improve the performance of such BCI systems. There are various conventional machine learning techniques have been implemented for the p300 detection. However, the existing conventional techniques are incapable to handle high-dimensional and complex non-linear learning tasks. In such cases, deep learning techniques are the most reliable classification tools. Among them, deep convolution neural network (DCNN), a one of the powerful tool, has adopted in this work to classify the target and non-target p300 components from acquired EEG signal. The experimentation has been carried out on a self-generated dataset which was acquired using 16-channel V-amp EEG recorder. Experimental results illustrated that the proposed technique has achieved 94.18% accuracy for P300 detection which is higher than existing techniques.

Methods: Patients with changes of consciousness in the neurological intensive care unit (NICU) were consecutively monitored with cEEG during 2 years. Their clinical, electrophysiological, radiological and laboratory findings were evaluated retrospectively. Results: This sample consisted of 57 (25 men) patients with a mean age of 68.2 years. Mean duration of cEEG monitoring was 2532.6 minutes. The most common electrographic patterns were PD (33%) and NCS-NCSE (26.3%). The presence of NCS-NCSE was significantly associated with PD (57.9%, p< 0.001). PD and NCS-NCSE were the mostly seen in patients with acute stroke and hypoxic encephalopathy. Duration of monitoring was significantly longer in the group with PD and NCS-NCSE (p: 0.004, p: 0.014). Detection of any electrographic pattern in EEG before monitoring was associated with the presence of any pattern in cEEG (59.3%, p< 0.0001). Convulsive or nonconvulsive seizure during monitoring was common in patients with electrographic patterns (p< 0.0001). 66.7% of NCS-NCSE was seen within the first 12 hours and 26.7% was seen within the 12-24 hours of the monitoring. Conclusion: Detection of any electrographic pattern in EEG before monitoring was associated with the presence of any important pattern in cEEG monitoring. This association suggest that at least 24 hours-monitoring of these patients could be useful for the diagnosis of clinical and/ or electrographic seizures.

Since these patterns have high variability between subjects and sessions, the BCI system necessarily requires 20-30 minutes for the calibration process each time the system is used. This time-consuming process requires a high level of the user's concentration; most users experience uncomfortable feelings such as tiredness, exhaustion, and loss of attention, which are symptoms of mental fatigue. In this paper, we introduce a self-paced training that terminates the calibration process within a few minutes. In this training paradigm, users perform MI tasks continuously without an inter-stimulus-interval (ISI). Also, we propose a data selection method to extract the most prominent features from the short calibration data by assuming the data distribution probabilistically and using the prior knowledge of event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns. The results from 19 subjects indicate that the proposed method gained a comparable classification performance to the conventional method but with a much shorter calibration period (12 min/ 73.8%, 30 min/76.1%, respectively). In this regard, the proposed method could be of great benefit for real-world BCI applications by providing a quicker calibration process.

Extensive research has indicated that machine learning approaches generate significant improvements when used for the pre-processing of medical time-series data signals and have assisted in obtaining high accuracy in the classification of medical data. The aim of this paper is to present findings for several classes of learning algorithm for medically related problems. The initial case study addressed in this paper involves classifying the dosage of medication required for the treatment of patients with Sickle Cell Disease. We use different machine learning architectures in order to investigate the accuracy and performance within the case study. The main purpose of applying classification approach is to enable healthcare organisations to provide accurate amount of medication. The results obtained from a range of models during our experiments have shown that of the proposed models, recurrent networks produced inferior results in comparison to conventional feedforward neural networks and the Random Forest model. For our dataset, it was found that the Random Forest Classifier produced the highest levels of performance overall.

The Echo State Network (ESN), a type of RC paradigm, has been widely used for time series forecasting. Whereas, few works exist on classification with ESN. In this paper, we shed light on the use of ESN for pattern recognition problem, i.e. emotion recognition from Electroencephalogram (EEG). We show that the reservoir with its recurrence is able to perform the feature extraction step directly from the EEG raw. Such kind of recurrence rich of nonlinearities allows the projection of the input data into a high dimensional state space. It is well known that the ESN fails due to the poor choices of its initialization. Nevertheless, we show that pretraining the ESN with the Intrinsic Plasticity (IP) rule remedies the shortcoming of randomly initialization. To validate our approach, we tested our system on the benchmark DEAP containing EEG signals of 32 subjects and the results were promising.

In this study we thus aimed at predicting the difficulty level of a video game a person is playing at a particular moment from the ongoing EEG activity. Therefore, we made use of power modulations in the theta (4-7 Hz) and alpha (8-13 Hz) frequency bands of the EEG which are known to reflect cognitive workload. Since the goal was to predict from multiple difficulty levels, established binary classification approaches are futile. Here, we employ a novel spatial filtering method (SPoC) that finds spatial filters such that their corresponding bandpower dynamics maximally covary with a given target variable, in this case the difficulty level. EEG was recorded from 6 participants playing a modified Tetris game at 10 different difficulty levels. We found that our approach predicted the levels with high accuracy, yielding a mean prediction error of less than one level.

Real-Time Epileptic Seizure Detection Using EEG	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; seizure detection; harmonic wavelet packet transform; fractal feature; relevance vector machine	FRACTAL DIMENSION; ALGORITHM; ONSET; CLASSIFICATION; MACHINE; ENTROPY; SERIES; BRAIN	This paper proposes a novel patient-specific real-time automatic epileptic seizure onset detection, using both scalp and intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG). The proposed technique obtains harmonic multiresolution and self-similarity-based fractal features from EEG for robust seizure onset detection. A fast wavelet decomposition method, known as harmonic wavelet packet transform (HWPT), is computed based on Fourier transform to achieve higher frequency resolutions without recursive calculations. Similarly, fractal dimension (FD) estimates are obtained to capture self-similar repetitive patterns in the EEG signal. Both FD and HWPT energy features across all EEG channels at each epoch are organized following the spatial information due to electrode placement on the skull. The final feature vector combines feature configurations of each epoch within the specified moving window to reflect the temporal information of EEG. Finally, relevance vector machine is used to classify the feature vectors due to its efficiency in classifying sparse, yet high-dimensional data sets. The algorithm is evaluated using two publicly available long-term scalp EEG (data set A) and short-term intracranial and scalp EEG (data set B) databases. The proposed algorithm is effective in seizure onset detection with 96% sensitivity, 0.1 per hour median false detection rate, and 1.89 s average detection latency, respectively. Results obtained from analyzing the short-term data offer 99.8% classification accuracy. These results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective with both short-and long-term EEG signal analyzes recorded with either scalp or intracranial modes, respectively. Finally, the use of less computationally intensive feature extraction techniques enables faster seizure onset detection when compared with similar techniques in the literature, indicating potential usage in real-time applications.

P300 speller is one of the most famous BCI systems choosing the characters from a virtual keyboard through the analysis of EEG signals. P300 detection is an important processing step of these systems. The accuracy of P300 detection highly depends on the feature extraction method. In this study, the maximum signal to noise ratio (Max-SNR) has been used for feature extraction, which rarely applied in this area. This study presents a novel feature extraction technique, named spatio-temporal Max-SNR (ST. Max-SNR). Unlike the standard Max-SNR which only uses spatial patterns of a signal, the proposed method, separately consider the spatial and temporal patterns of the signal to enhance the accuracy of feature extraction. Due to the similarity of the common spatial pattern (CSP) and the MaxSNR algorithms, the performance of this technique and its extension, common Spatiotemporal pattern (CSTP), has been compared with the proposed method. Then, the LDA and SWLDA classifiers are used for classification of the features. Our experimental results show that the Max-SNR based spatio-temporal features lead to an average classification accuracy of 94.4 percent suggesting the best performance.

In this paper, we proposed enhanced One Versus One (OVO) structure to classify EEG-based multi-class motor imagery signals. Also, shrinkage estimator based Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) is used to overcome disadvantages of conventional CSP. Shrinkage estimator is a procedure to estimate covariance matrix that regularizes CSP versus overfitting. The results of four-class classification of BCI competition IV dataset 2a, show that the performance is improved to 0.61 kappa score.

Deep learning offers approaches able to automatically extract patterns and abstractions from different types of data (images, sound, biomedical signals, etc.) to perform classification. However, the application of these techniques in the automatic sleep stage scoring field is less widespread to date. This paper proposes a new approach based on a multi-state deep learning neural network architecture, which we named Asymmetrical Multi-State Neural Network. This new network is able to merge two different neural networks, based on two different architectures receiving different input data: single-channel EEG raw signal in time and the respective spectrum. The proposed Asymmetrical Multi-State Neural Network shows to enhance the separated networks' performance for the given problem on a complete wellknown sleep database.

Redundant or superfluous features either slow down the training process or dilute the quality of classification. Many methods are available in literature for dimensionality reduction. Earlier studies explored a discernibility matrix ( DM) based reduct calculation for dimensionality reduction. Discernibility matrix works only on discrete values. But most real-world datasets are continuous in nature. Use of traditional discernibility matrix approach inevitably incurs information loss due to discretization. In this paper, we propose a fuzzified adaptation of discernibility matrix with four variants of dissimilarity measure to deal with continuous data. The proposed algorithm has been applied on EEG dataset-III from BCI competition-II. The reduced dataset is then classified using Support Vector Machine ( SVM). The performance of the proposed Fuzzy Discernibility Matrix ( FDM) variants are compared with original discernibility matrix based method and Principal Component Analysis ( PCA). In our empirical study, the proposed method outperforms the other two methods, thus suggesting that it is competitive with them.

In recent years different biological signals are also combined with EEG signals to produce hybrid BCI devices to overcome the limitation of lower accuracy rates in BCI. This paper presents a new approach of combining EEG and Electromyogram (EMG) signals using the spectral power correlation (SPC) to create a hybrid BCI device for controlling a hand exoskeleton. The proposed method was tested on 10 healthy individuals for measuring its performance level in terms of accuracy. The EEG-EMG SPC based hybrid BCI was trained to classify the grasp attempt and resting states of the user. Upon successful detection of a grasp attempt, the hybrid BCI triggers the hand exoskeleton to perform a finger flexion-extension motion. The proposed EEG-EMG SPC method is also compared with the conventional only EEG based method which uses common spatial pattern (CSP) based spatial filtering. The results have shown that the proposed EEG-EMG SPC method y ielded an average accuracy of 90 +/- 4.86% while the conventional EEG-C SP method yielded 79.75 +/- 5.71%. This significantly (p<0.02) improved performance in terms of classification accuracy indicates that EEG-EMG SPC based hybrid BCI is a better alternative than the conventional EEG-CSP based BCI to generate hand exoskeleton based neurofeedback.

ICA is used for obtaining the Independent Components (IC's) that are linear in nature from the EEG signal. These IC's also known as topoplots are used for feature extraction and classification. Local binary pattern (LBP) is being utilized to obtain the features. These features are used for training the classifiers and helps in achieving automatic artifact elimination. Classifiers such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for identifying the artifacts and thereby to remove such signals. The remaining IC components are used for reconstructing the de-noised signal. Of the existing methods mentioned, with respect to artifact elimination methods, LDA gives the best performance in artifact removal and helps in reconstruction of the signal.

Currently available representations, however, fail to produce sufficiently accurate results. Previously used features tend to struggle with artifacts and inter-patient variability. To address these issues, an aligned time-frequency block structure model was created. This model can be learned by building upon a combination of existing denoising and consensus clustering techniques. Across multiple datasets, this model significantly reduced error rates from raw spectral features and outperformed bandpower features commonly used in commercial tools. For the DREAMS dataset, classic band power features yielded a 30% error rate; raw spectral features had a higher error rate of 37%; and the novel Dense Denoised Spectral (DDS) features resulted in a 17% error rate.

The main challenge in restoring independent,reaching and grasping in patients is to develop assistive technologies with intuitive and non-invasive user interfaces. We believe that this challenge can be met by directly translating movement-related brain activity into control signals. During the last decade, we have conducted research on EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for the decoding of movement parameters, such as trajectories and targets. Although our findings are promising, the control is still unnatural. Therefore, we sur mise that natural and intuitive control of neuroprostheses could be achieved by developing a novel control framework that incorporates detection of goal directed movement intention, movement decoding, identifying the type of grasp, error potentials detection and delivery of feedback.

In this paper, a novel virtual reality (VR)-based driving system was introduced to teach driving skills to adolescents with ASD. This driving system is capable of gathering eye gaze, electroencephalography, and peripheral physiology data in addition to driving performance data. The objective of this paper is to fuse multimodal information to measure cognitive load during driving such that driving tasks can be individualized for optimal skill learning. Individualization of ASD intervention is an important criterion due to the spectrum nature of the disorder. Twenty adolescents with ASD participated in our study and the data collected were used for systematic feature extraction and classification of cognitive loads based on five well-known machine learning methods. Subsequently, three information fusion schemes-feature level fusion, decision level fusion and hybrid level fusion-were explored. Results indicate that multimodal information fusion can be used to measure cognitive load with high accuracy. Such a mechanism is essential since it will allow individualization of driving skill training based on cognitive load, which will facilitate acceptance of this driving system for clinical use and eventual commercialization.

It determines whether the classification performance is high or low. In this paper, a new type of feature called "symmetrical feature" is proposed. This innovative feature extraction method is built upon the features "common spatial pattern (CSP)" algorithm. After an electroencephalo-graphic signal is enhanced, class discrimination using the CSP algorithm can be extracted using optimal symmetrical axis chosen by a 10-fold cross-validation technique. Simulation results from nine data sets provided by brain-computer interface competition III and Iva showed that, on average, the proposed symmetrical feature can be combined with the CSP power band feature to boost the performance of the classification in a BCI system.

Quaternion Common Spatial Patterns	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Augmented statistics; common spatial pattern; quaternion domain	MOTOR IMAGERY; CLASSIFICATION; FILTERS; SIGNALS; MU	A novel quaternion-valued common spatial patterns (QCSP) algorithm is introduced to model co-channel coupling of multi-dimensional processes. To cater for the generality of quaternion-valuednon-circular data, we propose a generalized QCSP (G-QCSP) which incorporates the information on power difference between the real and imaginary parts of data channels. As an application, we demonstrate how G-QCSP can be used to provide high classification rates, even at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as low as -10 dB. To illustrate the usefulness of our method in EEG analysis, we employ G-QCSP to extract features for discriminating between imagery left and right hand movements. The classification accuracy using these features is 70%. Furthermore, the proposed method is used to distinguish between Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and healthy control subjects, providing an accuracy of 87%.	[Enshaeifar, S.; Took, C.

However, use of a large number of channels will make common spatial pattern tend to over-fitting and the classification of electroencephalographic signals time-consuming. To overcome these problems, it is necessary to choose an optimal subset of the whole channels to save computational time and improve the classification accuracy. In this paper, a novel method named backtracking search optimization algorithm is proposed to automatically select the optimal channel set for common spatial pattern. Each individual in the population is a N-dimensional vector, with each component representing one channel. A population of binary codes generate randomly in the beginning, and then channels are selected according to the evolution of these codes. The number and positions of 1's in the code denote the number and positions of chosen channels. The objective function of backtracking search optimization algorithm is defined as the combination of classification error rate and relative number of channels. Experimental results suggest that higher classification accuracy can be achieved with much fewer channels compared to standard common spatial pattern with whole channels.

However, CSP is a supervised filter, which needs some subject-specific calibration data to design. This is time-consuming and not userfriendly. A promising approach for shortening or even completely eliminating this calibration session is transfer learning, which leverages relevant data or knowledge from other subjects or tasks. This paper reviews three existing approaches for incorporating transfer learning into CSP, and also proposes a new transfer learning enhanced CSP approach. Experiments on motor imagery classification demonstrate their effectiveness. Particularly, our proposed approach achieves the best performance when the number of target domain calibration samples is small.

For these interventions to be effective, repeated sessions need to be carried out to achieve functional long-lasting plastic changes of cortical circuits. Electroencephalography-based Brain-Computer Interfaces typically show significant decreases in accuracy when used across multiple sessions with fixed parameters. Therefore, it is important to look for optimal strategies to recalibrate these classifiers. Here we compare different recalibration strategies for systems decoding motor intentions based on electroencephalographic data of neurological patients.	[Ibanez, J.; Pons, J.

In cognitive neuroscience domain, EEG-based assessment method is found to be superior due to its non-invasive ability to detect deep brain structure while exhibiting superior spatial resolutions. Especially for studying the neurodynamic behavior of epileptic seizures, EEG recordings reflect the neuronal activity of the brain and thus provide required clinical diagnostic information for the neurologist. This specific proposed study makes use of wavelet packet based log and norm entropies with a recurrent Elman neural network (REN) for the automated detection of epileptic seizures. Three conditions, normal, pre-ictal and epileptic EEG recordings were considered for the proposed study. An adaptive Weiner filter was initially applied to remove the power line noise of 50 Hz from raw EEG recordings. Raw EEGs were segmented into 1 s patterns to ensure stationarity of the signal. Then wavelet packet using Haar wavelet with a five level decomposition was introduced and two entropies, log and norm were estimated and were applied to REN classifier to perform binary classification. The non-linear Wilcoxon statistical test was applied to observe the variation in the features under these conditions. The effect of log energy entropy (without wavelets) was also studied. It was found from the simulation results that the wavelet packet log entropy with REN classifier yielded a classification accuracy of 99.70 % for normal-pre-ictal, 99.70 % for normal-epileptic and 99.85 % for pre-ictal-epileptic.

In motor imagery (MI) based BCI, features that characterize ERS/ERD phenomenon could favor the discriminant of different kinds of MI tasks. Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), a spatial filtering method which is often used in MI-EEG feature extraction, shows outstanding performance due to its effectiveness in maximizing the difference of variance between each class. But one of the shortcomings of CSP is that performance is greatly affected by the frequency of the signal, because the variances can be used to discriminate each class only by processing those task related frequency bands. However, individual differences existed in EEG is an obstacle for CSP. Although MI related frequency bands focus on mu and beta rhythms, for every subject, the distinguishing hands could be different. In this paper, a novel feature extraction method (Subject Dependent Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition, SD-MEMD) for MI based BCI is proposed, it utilizes MEMD algorithm to decompose the multi-channel EEG into a set of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), each IMF represents an inherent oscillation mode of the raw signal. Then an enhanced EEG is re-constructed after a careful selection of the task related IMF subset. Classification accuracy for right hand and left hand MI tasks is improved by 5.76% on our dataset.

Selection of optimal frequency bands of the electroencephalogram signal in eye-brain-computer interface	XII INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS 2016, (INTELS 2016)	Procedia Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Symposium on Intelligent Systems (INTELS)	OCT 05-07, 2016	Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Moscow, RUSSIA	Minist Educ & Sci Russian Federat	Peoples Friendship Univ Russia	eye-brain-computer; hybrid interface; recognition of patterns		An eye-brain-computer interface (EBCI) is a hybrid system that combines properties of eye tracking systems and brain-computer interfaces, based on the analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG). In the hybrid interface the object of interest on a screen is determined by tracking the user's gaze direction. At the same time, the EEG signal is used to detect the user's intent to give a command. This article discusses the recognition of EEG patterns that correspond to spontaneous and control gaze fixations. We propose to extract the most informative features of the EEG signal by selecting optimal frequency bands of the signal. The method is based on solving one-criterion optimization task, in which variable parameters are the boundaries of frequency bands, and the quality of the class separation acts as an objective function. To find optimal values of variable parameters we suggest using the particle swarm optimization. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method on EEG recordings obtained at the Kurchatov Complex of NBICS Technologies for users working with a hybrid interface. It is shown that for all users our method improves classification accuracy in comparison with other methods of feature extraction. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, the lack of data due to the difficulties in collecting data in BCI is a common challenge in training the systems. Since most of machine learning tools are based on the assumption that the distribution of training and testing data are the same and they need adequate training data, they would fail in such situations. To overcome this problem and because of the vague and uncertain essence of EEG data, in this paper, we used a fuzzy transfer learning (FTL) method based on Generalized Hidden-Mapping Ridge Regression (GHRR) to improve the classification task in BCI. Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy logical system (TSK) with proposed modified Wang-Mendel fuzzy rule generation were employed for classification. Then the session-to-session transfer of knowledge is adopted. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in classification and outperform the well-known SVM classifier.

However, the recognition accuracy is hardly ideal mainly due to the following reasons: (i) the features extracted from EEG signals may not solely reflect one's emotional patterns and their quality is easily affected by noise; and (ii) increasing feature dimension may enhance the recognition accuracy, but it often requires extra computation time. In this paper, we propose a feature smoothing method to alleviate the aforementioned problems. Specifically, we extract six statistical features from raw EEG signals and apply a simple yet cost-effective feature smoothing method to improve the recognition accuracy. The experimental results on the well-known DEAP dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Comparing to other studies on the same dataset, ours achieves the shortest feature processing time and the highest classification accuracy on emotion recognition in the valence-arousal quadrant space.

An alternative to machine learning, which tries to establish predictive links between features of the observed data and clinical variables, is the deployment of computational models for inferring on the (patho)physiological and cognitive mechanisms that generate behavioural and neuroimaging responses. This paper discusses the rationale behind a computational approach to neuroimaging-based single-subject inference, focusing on its potential for characterising disease mechanisms in individual subjects and mapping these characterisations to clinical predictions. Following an overview of two main approaches - Bayesian model selection and generative embedding- which can link computational models to individual predictions, we review how these methods accommodate heterogeneity in psychiatric and neurological spectrum disorders, help avoid erroneous interpretations of neuroimaging data, and establish a link between a mechanistic, model-based approach and the statistical perspectives afforded by machine learning.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a very powerful tool for investigating patient's health and different physiological activities of the brain. A significant challenge in this BCI application is the accurate and reliable recognition of motor imagery (MI) task. A brain-computer interface based on MI interprets the patient's brain activities into a control signal through classifying EEG patterns of various motor imagination tasks. The appropriate features are essential to achieving higher classification accuracy of EEG motor imagery task. For EEG signal feature extraction, wavelet transform is suitable for analysis of nonlinear time series signals. Nevertheless, the dimension of the extracted feature is huge and it may reduce the performance of classification method. Dimensionality reduction and classification play an important role in BCI motor imagery research. In this study, hybridization of particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based rough set feature selection technique is proposed for achieving a minimal set of relevant features from extracted features. The selected features are applied to the proposed novel neighborhood rough set classifier (NRSC) method for classification of multiclass motor imagery. The experimental results are delivered for nine subjects of the BCI Competition 2008 Dataset IIa to show the greater performance of the proposed algorithm. The outcome of proposed algorithms produces a higher mean kappa of 0.743 compared to 0.70 from sequential updating semi-supervised spectral regression kernel discriminant analysis. Experimental results show that the strength of the proposed PSO-rough set and NRSC algorithms outperforms the champion of the BCI Competition IV Dataset IIa and other existing research using this dataset.

Rama			EEG signal analysis for Seizure detection using Discrete Wavelet Transform and Random Forest	2017 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AND APPLICATIONS (ICCA)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Computer and Applications (ICCA)	SEP 06-07, 2017	Doha, U ARAB EMIRATES			EEG; Epilepsy; seizures; ictal; inter-ictal; DWT; MLP; Random Forest		Epilepsy, a recurring disorder is symptomized by unprovoked seizures. Considered as one of the most common neurological disorders, Epilepsy affects people of all ages. Around 65 Million people across the world suffer from this disease. Manual diagnosis of EEG signals of long duration may be a source of error as well as a cumbersome task. Hence automation in Seizure Detection is essential for diagnosis of Epilepsy. Therefore, in this paper, an expert system for EEG signal classification has been proposed. The proposed system aims at classifying EEG signals into 3 classes- Normal, inter-ictal (EEG recordings of epileptic patients during non-seizure period) and ictal (EEG recordings of epileptic patients during seizure period). Discrete Wavelet Transform, a technique for analyzing signals in time-frequency domain has been quite successful in this respect for extraction of features from EEG signals. Further Envelope Analysis has been used on the DWT coefficients before feature extraction in order to elevate the performance of the system. Finally several Machine Learning techniques (E.g: MLP and Random Forest) have been used for classification of the EEG signals and the relative accuracy of these Classifiers with regard to this problem have been compared. The results from the experiments show that the Random Forest Classifier is the most effective classifier for this problem delivering an accuracy of 98%. The data that has been used for this work has been taken from the publicly available EEG database of University of Bonn which presents 100 single channel EEG records for each of the above classes.

In this EMD-TQWT method, the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) obtained from EEG signals using EMD method are considered as a set of amplitude modulated and frequency modulated (AM-FM) components, which are further processed using TQWT method to generate sub-band signals, which can be considered as narrow-band signals. After that, we have measured the information potential (IP) of these obtained sub-band signals using information theory learning based technique. Finally, the IP features are fed to least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier with radial basis function (RBF) kernel. We have computed the optimal subset of features with feature ranking methods. The proposed approach has been applied on a publicly available EEG database which include healthy, seizure-free, and seizure EEG signals. We have achieved the highest classification accuracy of 99% for classification of seizure and non-seizure EEG signals.

It holds great promise for advancements in patient care and applications to neurorehabilitation. Here, we propose a novel neurofeedback-based BCI robotic platform using a personalized social robot in order to assist patients having cognitive deficits through bilateral rehabilitation and mental training. For initial testing of the platform, electroencephalography (EEG) brainwaves of a human user were collected in real time during tasks of imaginary movements. First, the brainwaves associated with imagined body kinematics parameters were decoded to control a cursor on a computer screen in training protocol. Then, the experienced subject was able to interact with a social robot via our real-time BMI robotic platform. Corresponding to subject's imagery performance, he/she received specific gesture movements and eye color changes as neural-based feedback from the robot. This hands-free neurofeedback interaction not only can be used for mind control of a social robot's movements, but also sets the stage for application to enhancing and recovering mental abilities such as attention via training in humans by providing real-time neurofeedback from a social robot.

At the core of BCli research is development of data acquisition, filtration and classification techniques that can accurately decode the brain activity that occurs while performing a motor task. In this study, we investigate the classification accuracy of Ida, QDA, Naive Bayes, quadratic SVM and RBF SVM classifiers for classifying the flexion/extension of forearm and wrist. Moreover, hjorth parameters and PSD are employed as feature extraction techniques to derive four different feature vectors that are later used to train our classifiers. At the culmination of this study, it is shown that QDA classifier trained with PSD feature vector has the highest classification accuracy at 77.37% followed by q-SVM trained with activity feature vector at 73.97%. Apart from enhancing accuracy of classifying the four fundamental upper limb movements, this study will eventually contribute towards developing better controllers for neuro-prosthetic devices. The study has been performed experimentally with Emotiv headsets equipped with 14 electrodes to acquire EEG data from two human test subjects in synchronous mode. Classification and data analysis has been performed offline however in future the study will be extended to an online BCI system.

The feature sets, combined with multiclass classification and post-processing schemes aim at the generation of alarms and reduced influence of false positives. This study considers 216 patients from the European Epilepsy Database, and includes 185 patients with scalp EEG recordings and 31 with intracranial data. The strategy was tested over a total of 16,729.80 h of inter-ictal data, including 1206 seizures. We found an overall sensitivity of 38.47% and a false positive rate per hour of 0.20. The performance of the method achieved statistical significance in 24 patients (11% of the patients). Despite the encouraging results previously reported in specific datasets, the prospective demonstration on long-term EEG recording has been limited. Our study presents a prospective analysis of a large heterogeneous, multicentric dataset. The statistical framework based on conservative assumptions, reflects a realistic approach compared to constrained datasets, and/or in-sample evaluations. The improvement of these results, with the definition of an appropriate set of features able to improve the distinction between the pre-ictal and nonpre-ictal states, hence minimizing the effect of confounding variables, remains a key aspect.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for participant-dependent and participant-independent emotion recognition using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We aim to distinguish between positive and negative valence emotions on the valencearousal graph, i.e., considering a binary classification problem. The EEG signals of DEAP dataset, where forty different videos were used to stimulate 32 participants is considered for the classification problem. Participant-dependent features are extracted in order to classify emotions for each participant, where a perfect classification score is shown to be achieved for one of the participants. Next, we consider generalization across participants and find participant-independent features. Applying the widely used or conventional method in this regard, we observe that the training time increases many fold with increase in participants. We propose a technique called averaging of features and show that the computational complexity of the proposed technique is significantly low as compared to the conventional method with increase in participants. The results obtained by detailed experiments and evaluation procedure indicate that averaging of features technique yields nearly the same performance as the conventional approach, but scarcely consumes computational time. The maximum classification accuracy for 32 participants was obtained to be 81.03% and 77.46% using conventional and averaging approaches respectively.

In motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCI), covariance matrices play a central role in the extraction of features from recorded electroencephalograms (EEGs); therefore, correctly estimating covariance is crucial for EEG classification. This letter discusses algorithms to average sample covariance matrices (SCMs) for the selection of the reference matrix in tangent space mapping (TSM)-based MI-BCI. Tangent space mapping is a powerful method of feature extraction and strongly depends on the selection of a reference covariance matrix. In general, the observed signals may include outliers; therefore, taking the geometric mean of SCMs as the reference matrix may not be the best choice. In order to deal with the effects of outliers, robust estimators have to be used. In particular, we discuss and test the use of geometric medians and trimmed averages (defined on the basis of several metrics) as robust estimators. The main idea behind trimmed averages is to eliminate data that exhibit the largest distance from the average covariance calculated on the basis of all available data. The results of the experiments show that while the geometric medians show little differences from conventional methods in terms of classification accuracy in the classification of electroencephalographic recordings, the trimmed averages show significant improvement for all subjects.

Nevertheless, BCI is less accessible to artists compared to other sensors because signal processing and machine learning are required. This paper proposes a work-in-progress example of BCI applications for performances that has been designed in collaboration with contemporary dancers. Its contribution is that the piece is not an add-on to a performance, but the implementation reflects practices of contemporary dance.

The overall architecture is made up by two subsystems: the Brain-to-Computer System (BCS) and the mechanical actuator (a proof of concept of the proposed BCI is shown using a prototype car). The BCS is devoted to signal acquisition (6 EEG channels from wireless headset), visual stimuli delivery for P300 evocation and signal processing. Due to the P300 inter-subject variability, a first stage of Machine Learning (ML) is required. The ML stage is based on a custom algorithm (t-RIDE) which allows a fast calibration phase (only similar to 190 s for the first learning). The BCI presents a functional approach for time-domain features extraction, which reduces the amount of data to be analyzed. The real-time function is based on a trained linear hyper-dimensional classifier, which combines high P300 detection accuracy with low computation times. The experimental results, achieved on a dataset of 5 subjects (age: 26 +/- 3), show that: (i) the ML algorithm allows the P300 spatio-temporal characterization in 1.95 s using 38 target brain visual stimuli (for each direction of the car path); (ii) the classification reached an accuracy of 80.5 +/- 4.1% on single-trial P300 detection in only 22 ms (worst case), allowing real-time driving. For its versatility, the BCI system here described can be also used on different mechatronic actuators.

Forecasting epileptic seizures with an acceptable confidence level, could improve the disease treatment and thus the lifestyle of the people who suffer it. To do that the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is usually studied through spectral power band filtering, but this paper proposes an alternative novel method of preprocessing the EEG signal based on supervised filters. Such filters have been employed in a machine learning algorithm, such as the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), to improve the prediction of seizures. The proposed solution extends with this novel approach an algorithm that was submitted to win the third prize of an international Data Science challenge promoted by Kaggle contest platform and the American Epilepsy Society, the Epilepsy Foundation, National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Mayo Clinic. A formal description of these preprocessing methods is presented and a detailed analysis in terms of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve and Area Under ROC curve is performed. The obtained results show statistical significant improvements when compared with the spectral power band filtering (PBF) typical baseline. A trend between performance and the dataset size is observed, suggesting that the supervised filters bring better information, compared to the conventional PBF filters, as the dataset grows in terms of monitored variables ( sensors) and time length. The paper demonstrates a better accuracy in forecasting when new filters are employed and its main contribution is in the field of machine learning algorithms to develop more accurate predictive systems.

Many of these applications related to the so-called Big Data show different implicit parallelism that can benefit from the efficient use, in terms of performance and power consumption, of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) accelerators. Although the GPU microarchitectures make possible the acceleration of applications by exploiting parallelism at different levels, the characteristics of their memory hierarchy and the location of GPUs as coprocessors require a careful organization of the memory access patterns and data transferences to get efficient speedups. This paper aims to take advantage of heterogeneous parallel codes on GPUs to accelerate evolutionary approaches in Electroencephalogram (EEG) classification and feature selection in the context of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) tasks. The results show the benefits of taking into account not only the data parallelism achievable by GPUs, but also the memory access patterns, in order to increase the speedups achieved by superscalar cores.

New method: In this paper, an offline seizure detection algorithm based on definition of a seizure-specific wavelet (Seizlet) is presented. After designing the Seizlet, by forming cone of influence map of the EEG signal, four types of layouts are analytically designed that are called Seizure Modulus Maximas Patterns (SMMP). By mapping CorrEntropy Induced Metric (CIM) series, four structural features based on least square estimation of fitted non-tilt conic ellipse are extracted that are called CorrEntropy Ellipse Features (CEF). The parameters of the SMMP and CEF are tuned by employing a hybrid optimization algorithm based on honeybee hive optimization in combination with Las Vegas randomized algorithm and Elman recurrent classifier. Eventually, the optimal features by AdaBoost classifiers in a cascade structure are classified into the seizure and non-seizure signals. Results: The proposed algorithm is evaluated on 844 h signals with 163 seizure events recorded from 23 patients with intractable seizure disorder and accuracy rate of 91.44% and false detection rate of 0.014 per hour are obtained by 7-channel EEG signals. Comparison with existing method(s): To overcome the restrictions of general kernels and wavelet coefficient-based features, we designed the Seizlet as an exclusive kernel of seizure signal for first time. Also, the Seizlet-based patterns of EEG signals have been modeled to extract the seizure. Conclusions: The reported results demonstrate that our proposed Seizlet is effectiveness to extract the patterns of the epileptic seizure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Portable, inexpensive BCIs can mitigate these problems, but it remains unclear whether their low-cost design compromises their performance. Therefore, we developed a portable, low-cost BCI and compared its performance to that of a conventional BCI. Methods: The BCI was assembled by integrating a custom electroencephalogram (EEG) amplifier with an open-source microcontroller and a touchscreen. The function of the amplifier was first validated against a commercial bioamplifier, followed by a head-to-head comparison between the custom BCI (using four EEG channels) and a conventional 32-channel BCI. Specifically, five able-bodied subjects were cued to alternate between hand opening/closing and remaining motionless while the BCI decoded their movement state in real time and provided visual feedback through a light emitting diode. Subjects repeated the above task for a total of 10 trials, and were unaware of which system was being used. The performance in each trial was defined as the temporal correlation between the cues and the decoded states. Results: The EEG data simultaneously acquired with the custom and commercial amplifiers were visually similar and highly correlated (rho = 0.79). The decoding performances of the custom and conventional BCIs averaged across trials and subjects were 0.70 +/- 0.12 and 0.68 +/- 0.10, respectively, and were not significantly different. Conclusion: The performance of our portable, low-cost BCI is comparable to that of the conventional BCIs. Significance: Platforms, such as the one developed here, are suitable for BCI applications outside of a laboratory.

It translates human brain electrical activity to useful command by extracting meaningful features from Electroencephalogram signals. In present work, feature extraction techniques and classification methods are proposed for implementation of Brain Computer Interface system. Proposed methodology is carried out in four methodological steps. At first step, segmentation and windowing of Electroencephalogram signals are performed. The S-transform of segmented Electroencephalogram signals is evaluated in second step. At third step, mean and maximum values of Katz's Fractal Dimension are calculated from S-transform coefficients as features. Classification of extracted features is carried out in the fourth step using three machine learning techniques viz. Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine. Classification results reflect the efficiency of S-transform based feature extraction technique in Brain Computer Interface implementation.

Real-time inference of word relevance from electroencephalogram and eye gaze	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interfacing; electroencephalography; eye movements; reading; relevance detection; semantics; unrestricted viewing	FIXATION-RELATED POTENTIALS; SERIAL VISUAL PRESENTATION; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; MOVEMENTS; P300; EEG	Objective. Brain-computer interfaces can potentially map the subjective relevance of the visual surroundings, based on neural activity and eye movements, in order to infer the interest of a person in real-time. Approach. Readers looked for words belonging to one out of five semantic categories, while a stream of words passed at different locations on the screen. It was estimated in real-time which words and thus which semantic category interested each reader based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and the eye gaze. Main results. Words that were subjectively relevant could be decoded online from the signals. The estimation resulted in an average rank of 1.62 for the category of interest among the five categories after a hundred words had been read. Significance. It was demonstrated that the interest of a reader can be inferred online from EEG and eye tracking signals, which can potentially be used in novel types of adaptive software, which enrich the interaction by adding implicit information about the interest of the user to the explicit interaction. The study is characterised by the following novelties. Interpretation with respect to the word meaning was necessary in contrast to the usual practice in brain-computer interfacing where stimulus recognition is sufficient. The typical counting task was avoided because it would not be sensible for implicit relevance detection. Several words were displayed at the same time, in contrast to the typical sequences of single stimuli.

Epilepsy is present in 70-75% of Patients and an age-dependent electroclinical pattern has been described. Up to date, there are studies with overnight sleep EEGs, probably because of the severe intellectual disability (ID) and hyperactivity of these Patients. Our purpose was to verify the hypothesis that MWS Patients might have electrical status epilepticus in slow wave sleep (ESES pattern). Methods: A retrospective analysis of anamnestic and electrographic data was performed on 7 consecutive MWS Patients followed between 2007 and 2016. Only Patients with at least one overnight sleep EEG were included in the study. Results: Five out of 7 Patients had overnight sleep EEG studies and were included in this study. All of them had an anterior ESES pattern with spike-and-wave index > 85%. The architecture of sleep was abnormal. An ESES related regression of cognitive and motor functions with impact on daily activities (ESES-related syndrome) was demonstrated in 3 out of 5 (60%) Patients. In two Patients marked improvement of cognitive and motor performances was observed when the epileptiform activity during sleep was successfully controlled or it was spontaneously reduced. Conclusions: The clinical significance of the ESES pattern is hard to assess in MWS Patients due to severe ID, but changing in behaviour or in motor and cognitive functions should mandate sleep EEG investigation and, if ESES is present, an appropriate treatment should be tried. Furthermore, overnight sleep EEG recordings, if regularly performed in the follow up, might help to understand if ESES pattern hampers the cognitive and communicative profile in MWS.

However, few studies investigate how to daily monitor patient's electrophysiological signals through a more convenient way for a doctor, especially on the monitoring of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for depression diagnosis. Since a person's mental state and physiological state are changing over time, the most insured diagnosis of depression requires doctors to collect and analyze subject's EEG signals every day until two weeks for the clinical practice. In this work, we designed a real-time depression monitoring system to capture the user's EEG data by a wearable device and to perform real-time signal filtering, artifacts removal and power spectrum visualization, which could be combined with psychological test scales as an auxiliary diagnosis. In addition to collecting the resting EEG signals for real-time analysis or diagnosis of depression, we also introduced an external audio stimulus paradigm to further make a detection of depression. Through the machine learning method, system can give a credible probability of depression under each stimulus as a user's self-rating score from continuous EEG data. EEG signals collected from 81 early-onset patients and 89 normal controls are used to build the final classification model and to verify the practical performance.

Multi-Scale Ranked Organizing Map coupled with Implicit Function as Squashing Time algorithm(MS-ROM/I-FAST) is a new, complex system based on Artificial Neural networks (ANNs) able to extract features of interest in computerized EEG through the analysis of few minutes of their EEC without any preliminary pre-processing. A proof of concept study previously published showed accuracy values ranging from 94%-98% in discerning subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment and/or Alzheimer's Disease from healthy elderly people. The presence of deviant patterns in simple resting state EEG recordings in autism, consistent with the atypical organization of the cerebral cortex present, prompted us in applying this potent analytical systems in search of a EEG signature of the disease. Aim of the study. The aim of the study is to assess how effectively this methodology distinguishes subjects with autism from typically developing ones. Methods. Fifteen definite ASD subjects (13 males; 2 females; age range 7-14; mean value = 10.4) and ten typically developing subjects (4 males; 6 females; age range 7-12; mean value 9.2) were included in the study. Patients received Autism diagnoses according to DSM-V criteria, subsequently confirmed by the ADOS scale. A segment of artefact-free EEG lasting 60 seconds was used to compute input values for subsequent analyses. MS-ROM/I-FAST coupled with a well-documented evolutionary system able to select predictive features (TWIST) created an invariant features vector input of EEC on which supervised machine learning systems acted as blind classifiers. Results. The overall predictive capability of machine learning system in sorting out autistic cases from normal control amounted consistently to 100% with all kind of systems employed using training-testing protocol and to 84% - 92.8% using Leave One Out protocol. The similarities among the ANN weight matrixes measured with apposite algorithms were not affected by the age of the subjects. This suggests that the ANNs do not read age-related EEG patterns, but rather invariant features related to the brain's underlying disconnection signature. Conclusion. This pilot study seems to open up new avenues for the development of non-invasive diagnostic testing for the early detection of ASD. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Due to the hyperactive firing of neurons on a cellular level, epilepsy is caused. The activities of the cortical regions are recorded with the help of Electroencephalogram (EEG) which helps in the diagnosis of epilepsy. The normal patterns of the activities of neurons becomes severely disturbed in the case of epilepsy, thereby causing several hazardous consequences to the patients. The recordings of the EEG are quite long and so with the help of Hilbert Transform the dimensions of the EEG signals are reduced. Now with the help of Elman Backpropagation and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Networks, the dimensionally reduced values through Hilbert Transform are classified for assessing the epilepsy risk levels from EEG signals. The result analysis show an average accuracy of about 100% is obtained when the combination of Hilbert transform with Elman Backpropagation neural network is used. Similarly when Hilbert transform is implemented with the help of MLP, an average accuracy of about 97.916% along with a Performance Index of 95.74% is obtained.

Recently, the development of deep learning technology has provided a new direction. This paper introduces a new method of the seizure detection based on EEG signal using the short time Fourier transform(STFT) and convolution neural network(CNN). And the paper verifies the feasibility of this method through the actual research data and parameter setting. Afterwards, the method of single threshold is adopted to combine the multi-channel results. Then, the comparison with the classical method using the support vector machine(SVM) has been done, which shows that the approach presented in this paper is better. And the experimental result on single channel is that the average accuracy is 86%. In addition, the method of the multi-channel could increase the average accuracy to 90% and the average true positive rate(TPR) to 96.5% while decrease the average false positive rate(FPR) to 7%. All of those indexes reveal the high performance and stability of the approach for the epileptic seizure detection.

In this research, some promising results are presented for classification of emotions induced by watching music videos, a multivariate empirical mode decomposition(MEMD) based feature extraction method is proposed to identify emotional state as high/low arousal and high/low valence. Multi-channel EEG signals are decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), the information-bearing IMFs are selected to extract power, volatility index, hjorth parameters and asymmetrical properties on the left and right hemispher. The performances of the proposed MEMD based methods are evaluated using the publicly available DEAP data set. High/low arousal and high/low valence states of participants are recognized using the MEMD based features with KNN and SVM classifier. For the recorded 8-channel EEG signals, extracted features with KNN have accuracy rates of 67.7% and 70.5%, while SVM yields the accuracy of 67.9% and 70.9 % for arousal and valence states.

EEG displays the electrical activity of brain and, nowadays it is the most common tool for the diagnosis of neurological maladies. This paper aims at effective de-noising of EEG signals. EEG is obtained by recording the spontaneous electrical activity of the brain over a period of time and it may contain a whole lot of information. This information can be decoded by signal processing methods, but in most cases artifacts interrupt these signals. The recommended approach is based on ICA which is proven better by performance analysis having 96% accuracy and can decompose EEG recording into a number of event related and artifacts related potentials. This study shows that the proposed method significantly enhance the classification accuracy, by effective identification and removal of artifacts.	[Lakshmi, K. G.

Well-functioning BCIs often require many channels, which can be difficult to properly prepare and require expert support. Low-channel setups, however, can lead to poor or unreliable classification of intent. Here we introduce a novel method for extracting more information from a single EEG channel and test it on a ten subject motor imagery dataset. Instead of looking at bandpower or phase synchrony, we test the average frequency within each trial to see if there are task-dependent changes in the spectral locations of neural frequency peaks. We show that using this feature in combination with standard bandpower features is significantly better than bandpower features alone across subjects, both for standard electrodes and electrodes that include a Laplacian filter.

Here, magnetoencephalography (MEG) data recorded in the resting state is used to discriminate between healthy subjects and patients with either idiopathic generalized epilepsy or frontal focal epilepsy. Signal features extracted from interictal periods without any epileptiform activity are used to train a machine learning algorithm to draw a diagnosis. This is potentially relevant to patients without frequent or easily detectable spikes. To analyze the data, we use an up-to-date machine learning algorithm and explore the benefits of including different features obtained from the MEG data as inputs to the algorithm. We find that the relative power spectral density of the MEG time-series is sufficient to distinguish between healthy and epileptic subjects with a high prediction accuracy. We also find that a combination of features such as the phase locked value and the relative power spectral density allow to discriminate generalized and focal epilepsy, when these features are calculated over a filtered version of the signals in certain frequency bands. Machine learning algorithms are currently being applied to the analysis and classification of brain signals. It is, however, less evident to identify the proper features of these signals that are prone to be used in such machine learning algorithms. Here, we evaluate the influence of the input feature selection on a clinical scenario to distinguish between healthy and epileptic subjects. Our results indicate that such distinction is possible with a high accuracy (86%), allowing the discrimination between idiopathic generalized and frontal focal epilepsy types.

However, in those patients, sensory functions such as proprioception are at least partly preserved. The aim of this study was to investigate whether afferent feedback interferes with the BCI-based detection of efferent motor commands during execution of movements. Methods: Brain activity of 13 able-bodied subjects (age: 29.1 +/- 4.8 years; 11 males) was compared between a motor task (MT) consisting of an isometric, isotonic grip and a somatosensory electrical stimulation (SS) of the fingertips. Modulation of the mu rhythm (8-13 Hz) was investigated to identify changes specifically related to the generation of efferent commands. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to investigate the activation pattern on a single-trial basis. Classifiers were trained with MT vs. REST (periods without MT/SS) and tested with SS and vice versa to quantify the impact of afferent feedback on the classification results. Results: Few differences in the spatial pattern between MT and SS were found in the modulation of the mu rhythm. All were characterized by event-related desynchronization (ERD) peaks at electrodes C3, C4, and CP3. Execution of the MT was associated with a significantly stronger ERD in the majority of sensorimotor electrodes [C3 (p < 0.01); CP3 (p < 0.05); C4 (p < 0.01)]. Classification accuracy of MT vs. REST was significantly higher than SS vs. REST (77% and 63%; p < 10 8). Classifiers trained on MT vs. REST were able to classify SS trials significantly above chance even though no motor commands were present during SS. Classifiers trained on SS performed better in classifying MT instead of SS. Conclusion: Our results challenge the notion that the modulation of the mu rhythm is a robust phenomenon for detecting efferent commands when afferent feedback is present. Instead, they indicate that the mu ERD caused by the processing of afferent feedback generates ERD patterns in the sensorimotor cortex that are masking the ERD patterns caused by the generation of efferent commands. Thus, processing of afferent feedback represents a considerable source of false positives when the mu rhythm is used for the detection of efferent commands.

Standardized computer-based organized reporting of EEG: SCORE - Second version	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Clinical assessment; Database; Report; Standardized; Terminology; EEG	ILAE COMMISSION; POSITION PAPER; SEIZURE TYPES; TERMINOLOGY; CLASSIFICATION; SOCIETY; AGREEMENT; EPILEPSY; QUALITY; IFCN	Standardized terminology for computer-based assessment and reporting of EEG has been previously developed in Europe. The International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology established a taskforce in 2013 to develop this further, and to reach international consensus. This work resulted in the second, revised version of SCORE (Standardized Computer-based Organized Reporting of EEG), which is presented in this paper. The revised terminology was implemented in a software package (SCORE EEG), which was tested in clinical practice on 12,160 EEG recordings. Standardized terms implemented in SCORE are used to report the features of clinical relevance, extracted while assessing the EEGs. Selection of the terms is context sensitive: initial choices determine the subsequently presented sets of additional choices. This process automatically generates a report and feeds these features into a database. In the end, the diagnostic significance is scored, using a standardized list of terms. SCORE has specific modules for scoring seizures (including seizure semiology and ictal EEG patterns), neonatal recordings (including features specific for this age group), and for Critical Care EEG Terminology. SCORE is a useful clinical tool, with potential impact on clinical care, quality assurance, data-sharing, research and education. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

We propose an asynchronous MI-based BCI that allows the user to control the moving direction of robot hand and arm by intension whenever he feels necessary to adjust the moving path. In order to improve the classification accuracy and real-time performance, the thresholding method and LDS modeling approach are employed for online motor imagery pattern recognition. Then, the shared control strategy combines the automatic grasping control of robot and mental control by our asynchronous MI-based BCI to grasp the object with obstacle. Finally, the two experiments illustrate the advantages of our methods in the classification accuracy and grasping performance aspects.

The event-related potential (ERP)based BCI problem consists of a binary pattern recognition. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is widely used to solve this type of classification problems, but it fails when the number of features is large relative to the number of observations. In this work we propose a penalized version of the sparse discriminant analysis (SDA), called generalized sparse discriminant analysis (GSDA), for binary classification. This method inherits both the discriminative feature selection and classification properties of SDA and it also improves SDA performance through the addition of Kullback-Leibler class discrepancy information. The GSDA method is designed to automatically select the optimal regularization parameters. Numerical experiments with two real ERP-EEG datasets show that, on one hand, GSDA outperforms standard SDA in the sense of classification performance, sparsity and required computing time, and, on the other hand, it also yields better overall performances, compared to well-known ERP classification algorithms, for single-trial ERP classification when insufficient training samples are available. Hence, GSDA constitute a potential useful method for reducing the calibration times in ERP-based BCI systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Exploring dynamic functional connectivity in spontaneous SEEG signals provides a rich framework for studying brain networks. Tensor decomposition is a powerful tool for decoding dynamic networks, capturing the intrinsic interactions between multiple dimensions with less restrictive constraints than traditional 2D matrix decomposition methods such as PCA and ICA. Tensor decomposition, however, is seldom used for decoding large resting brain datasets due to its high computational complexity and poor robustness. In this paper, we describe a Scalable and Robust Sequential Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (SRSCPD) framework that can sequentially and robustly identify tensor models of successively higher rank. We demonstrate that SRSCPD is not only more robust than the popular Alternating Least Square (ALS) algorithm, but can also be extended to large-scale problems.

A thorough belief mechanism is used for the extraction of deep characteristics rather than raw feature vectors to train the classifier. It is shown that the classification accuracy is satisfactory by learning deep from the experimental data. Experiments have validated the usefulness of the algorithm.

Open Access database of EEG signals recorded during imagined speech	12TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MEDICAL INFORMATION PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Symposium on Medical Information Processing and Analysis (SIPAIM)	DEC 05-07, 2016	Tandil, ARGENTINA	SIPAIM Fdn, Univ Nacl Centro Prov Buenos Aires, Univ Nacl Colombia, Univ Panamericana, Ministerio Ciencia, Tecnologia & Innovac Productiva, Comis Investigaciones Cientificas, Consejo Nacl Investigaciones Cientificas & Tecnicas Argentina		EEG; Database; Imagined Speech; Covert Speech; Classification		Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) that could decode thoughts into commands would improve the quality of life of patients who have lost control over voluntary muscles. Imagined speech consists in imagining the pronunciation of words, without moving or emitting sounds. In this study, we introduce a new open access database of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded while 15 subjects imagined the pronunciation of two groups of Spanish words. The first one contained the vowels / a /, / e /, / i /, / o /, / u /; and the second one corresponds to the commands up, down, left, right, backward and forward. Each subject repeated each word 50 times in a random order, meanwhile EEG signals were recorded using a six channel acquisition system and sampled at 1024 Hz. For comparison, some blocks were recorded using the pronounced speech condition, in which audio and EEG signals were acquired simultaneously. The EEG signals were filtered for artifact's removal between 2 Hz and 40 Hz using a finite impulse response (FIR) pass-band filter. As a preliminary analysis of the EEG data, an offline classification method is presented. Accuracy rate is above chance level for almost all subjects, suggesting that EEG signals possess discriminative information about the imagined word.

OSAS is a sleep disorder that affects the life comfortability in human life. Diagnosis of OSAS is usually done by expensive devices and specialist physicians. Since OSAS is serious, it should be diagnosed and treated early. In this study, a new feature extraction method is proposed for OSAS diagnosis from snoring signals. With one (1) dimensional ternary pattern method, effective attributes were extracted from raw snoring signals and identification process was performed by classification methods. According to the obtained results, 1D-TP method has shown significant success in diagnosing OSAS from snore signals.

Assessing Continuous Operator Workload With a Hybrid Scaffolded Neuroergonomic Modeling Approach	HUMAN FACTORS			English	Article						human performance modeling; physiological measurement; discrete-event simulation; neuroergonomics; mental workload; operator state assessment	MENTAL WORKLOAD; PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY; VIGILANCE	Objective: We aimed to predict operator workload from neurological data using statistical learning methods to fit neurological-to-state-assessment models. Background: Adaptive systems require real-time mental workload assessment to perform dynamic task allocations or operator augmentation as workload issues arise. Neuroergonomic measures have great potential for informing adaptive systems, and we combine these measures with models of task demand as well as information about critical events and performance to clarify the inherent ambiguity of interpretation. Method: We use machine learning algorithms on electroencephalogram (EEG) input to infer operator workload based upon Improved Performance Research Integration Tool workload model estimates. Results: Cross-participant models predict workload of other participants, statistically distinguishing between 62% of the workload changes. Machine learning models trained from Monte Carlo resampled workload profiles can be used in place of deterministic workload profiles for cross-participant modeling without incurring a significant decrease in machine learning model performance, suggesting that stochastic models can be used when limited training data are available. Conclusion: We employed a novel temporary scaffold of simulation-generated workload profile truth data during the model-fitting process. A continuous workload profile serves as the target to train our statistical machine learning models. Once trained, the workload profile scaffolding is removed and the trained model is used directly on neurophysiological data in future operator state assessments. Application: These modeling techniques demonstrate how to use neuroergonomic methods to develop operator state assessments, which can be employed in adaptive systems.

Objective: To review etiology, electroencephalographic patterns, and the outcome of neonatal seizures, as well as to seek associations between NS and other neurological risk factors. Methods: We studied 22 patients with NS. Pre-, peri-, and postnatal antecedents were collected. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed, classifying the results into normal, mild, moderate and severe alterations. A general linear model was used to demonstrate possible associations between seizures and other neurological risk factors. Results: Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy was the most frequent etiology, approximately 40% of the subjects showed a good outcome, and the most frequent sequel was epilepsy (40.9%). EEG was normal only in 13.63% of patients. The analysis of possible statistical associations showed statistically significant associations between the EEG outcome and the patient's outcome (p=0.015), between gestational age and outcome (p=0.003) as well as between birth weight and outcome (p=0.003). Conclusions: The prediction of morbid damage has made it necessary to search for biochemical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging indicators in order to identify early lesions that threaten the satisfactory evolution of children due to morphological and functional alterations.

The P300 signal, an Evoked Related Potential (ERP) devoted to the cognitive brain activity, is induced for purpose by visual stimulation. The EEG data are collected by 6 smart wireless electrodes from the parietal-cortex area and online classified by a linear threshold classifier, basing on a suitable stage of Machine Learning (ML). The ML is implemented on a mu PC dedicated to the system and where the data acquisition and processing is performed. The main improvement in remote driving car by EEG, regards the approach used for the intentions recognition. In this work, the classification is based on the P300 and not just on the average of more not well identify potentials. This approach reduces the number of electrodes on the EEG helmet. The ML stage is based on a custom algorithm (t-RIDE) which tunes the following classification stage on the user's "cognitive chronometry". The ML algorithm starts with a fast calibration phase (just similar to 190s for the first learning). Furthermore, the BCI presents a functional approach for time-domain features extraction, which reduces the amount of data to be analyzed, and then the system response times. In this paper, a proof of concept of the proposed BCI is shown using a prototype car, tested on 5 subjects (aged 26 +/- 3). The experimental results show that the novel ML approach allows a complete P300 spatio-temporal characterization in 1.95s using 38 target brain visual stimuli (for each direction of the car path). In free-drive mode, the BCI classification reaches 80.5 +/- 4.1% on single-trial detection accuracy while the worst-case computational time is 19.65ms +/- 10.1. The BCI system here described can be also used on different mechatronic actuators, such as robots.	[De Venuto, D.; Annese, V.

As a first step toward developing such a method, we aimed to reconstruct the imagery of rhythm, which is one element of music. It has been reported that a periodic electroencephalogram (EEG) response is elicited while a human imagines a binary or ternary meter on a musical beat. However, it is not clear whether or not brain activity synchronizes with fully imagined beat and meter without auditory stimuli. To investigate neural entrainment to imagined rhythm during auditory imagery of beat and meter, we recorded EEG while nine participants (eight males and one female) imagined three types of rhythm without auditory stimuli but with visual timing, and then we analyzed the amplitude spectra of the EEG. We also recorded EEG while the participants only gazed at the visual timing as a control condition to confirm the visual effect. Furthermore, we derived features of the EEG using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and conducted an experiment to individually classify the three types of imagined rhythm from the EEG. The results showed that classification accuracies exceeded the chance level in all participants. These results suggest that auditory imagery of meter elicits a periodic EEG response that changes at the imagined beat and meter frequency even in the fully imagined conditions. This study represents the first step toward the realization of a method for reconstructing the imagined music from brain activity.

Robust Wavelet Stabilized 'Footprints of Uncertainty' for Fuzzy System Classifiers to Automatically Detect Sharp Waves in the EEG after Hypoxia Ischemia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						EEG; hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE); high frequency micro-scale seizures; sharp wave detection; Type-2 fuzzy; wavelet transform; machine learning; automatic detection	NEURAL NETWORK METHODOLOGY; SYNCHRONIZATION LIKELIHOOD; CHAOS METHODOLOGY; SEIZURE DETECTION; SPIKE DETECTION; BRAIN-INJURY; FETAL SHEEP; PRETERM; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS	Currently, there are no developed methods to detect sharp wave transients that exist in the latent phase after hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in order to determine if these micro-scale transients are potential biomarkers of HI. A major issue with sharp waves in the HI-EEG is that they possess a large variability in their sharp wave profile making it difficult to build a compact ` footprint of uncertainty' (FOU) required for ideal performance of a Type-2 fuzzy logic system (FLS) classifier. In this paper, we develop a novel computational EEG analysis method to robustly detect sharp waves using over 30 h of post occlusion HI-EEG from an equivalent, in utero, preterm fetal sheep model cohort. We demonstrate that initial wavelet transform (WT) of the sharp waves stabilizes the variation in their profile and thus permits a highly compact FOU to be built, hence, optimizing the performance of a Type-2 FLS. We demonstrate that this method leads to higher overall performance of 94% +/- 1 for the clinical 64Hz sampled EEG and 97% +/- 1 for the high resolution 1024 Hz sampled EEG that is improved upon over conventional standard wavelet 67% +/- 5 and 82% +/- 3, respectively, and fuzzy approaches 88% +/- 2 and 90% +/- 3, respectively, when performed in isolation.

Exoskeleton Control System Based on Motor-Imaginary Brain-Computer Interface	SOVREMENNYE TEHNOLOGII V MEDICINE			English	Article						brain-computer interface; motor imagery; lower limb exoskeleton; exoskeleton control system; post-stroke rehabilitation	REHABILITATION; POTENTIALS; IMAGERY; LEG	The aim of the investigation was to develop the neuro-integrated control system for a lower-limb robotic exoskeleton (RE) using brain-computer interface (BCI) technology based on recognition of EEG patterns evoked by motor imagery of limb movement. Materials and Methods. The proposed neuro-integrated RE control system based on BCI technology consists of three main modules: EEG signal recording module, EEG signal classifier and the software for transmission of commands to RE. EEG patterns evoked by motor imagery are recognized by the classifier based on linear discriminant analysis that uses the features identified by spatial filtering applying CSP method for all types of commands pairwise. The proposed algorithms for classification of motor imagery patterns and user training techniques make it possible to reliably distinguish several (up to 4) different commands. After training and testing the classifier, the operator may proceed to control the external device, i.e. the lower-limb RE. RE control software has been developed for easy system customization. The software has a simple graphical user interface and allows the user to change the mapping of RE patterns and commands in the operation process. Results. As a result of testing in 14 healthy volunteers, the average accuracy of lower limb exoskeleton control based on the developed motor imagery BCI for three commands was found to average 70% in three sessions.

J	Wei, Y; Wu, Y; Tudor, J				Wei, Yang; Wu, Yue; Tudor, John			A real-time wearable emotion detection headband based on EEG measurement	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL			English	Article						Emotion sensing; EEG; Wearable; Printing; Real time	POSITIVE EMOTIONS; VALENCE; STYLE	A real-time emotion detection system based on electroencephalogram (EEG) measurement has been realised by means of an emotion detection headband coupled with printed signal acquisition electrodes and open source signal processing software (OpenViBE). Positive and negative emotions are the states classified and the Theta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma frequency bands are selected for the signal processing. It is found that, by using a combination of Power Spectral Density (PSD), Signal Power (SP) and Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) as the features, the highest subject-dependent accuracy (86.83%) and independent accuracy (64.73%) is achieved, when using Linear Discrimination Analysis (LDA) as the classification algorithm. The standard deviation of the results is 5.03. The electrode locations were then improved for the detection of emotion, by moving them from Fl, F2, T3 and T4 to Al, F2, F7 and F8. The subject-dependent accuracy, using the improved locations, increased to 91.75% from 86.83% and 75% of participants achieved a classification accuracy higher than 90%, compared with only 16% of participants before improving the electrode arrangement.

J	Chen, DW; Han, N; Chen, JJ; Guo, H				Chen, Dong-Wei; Han, Na; Chen, Jun-Jie; Guo, Hao			Novel Algorithm for Measuring the Complexity of Electroencephalographic Signals in Emotion Recognition	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Electroencephalographic Signal; Nonlinear Dynamics; Lerupel-Ziv Complexity; Emotion Recognition	LEMPEL-ZIV COMPLEXITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; BRAIN POTENTIALS; CIRCUMPLEX MODEL; EEG; DYNAMICS; AROUSAL; RECORDINGS; ENTROPY; VALENCE	Emotion recognition in electroencephalographic signals has attracted increasing attention in medical literatures. The Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) measurement is an effective method for processing nonlinear dynamical analysis of electroencephalograms (EEGs), and has been used for emotion recognition in affective brain -computer interface (aBCI) systems. In this paper, an improved algorithm based on conventional LZC was proposed for resolving emotion recognition in EEGs. In the new method, the EEG signal was first preprocessed by employing wavelet packet transform to remove EEG series with low frequencies. Then, a nonlinear filter was used to remove ectopic values from the EEG. Furthermore, an effective adaptive LZC algorithm was proposed for measuring the complexity of EEG signals, and this method was applied to recognize emotions. The fluctuations of LZC sequences in designated electrode sites were constructed using three different LZC algorithms. Then, statistical analysis was carried out for group comparisons of the statistically significant fluctuation of LZC sequences. Finally, it was used as the classified features in a support vector machine classification algorithm. The experiment demonstrated that the proposed method effectively discovered more patterns occurring in EEG signals. Also, it precisely detected oscillations of EEG signals, which may help reveal intrinsic nonlinearity in EEG -based emotion recognition. The adaptive LZC algorithm reached a high average accuracy of 82.43%.

The EMD method is employed to decompose the EEG signals into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then, a set of features is extracted from the obtained IMFs. These features are used to construct a three-layer hierarchical classification model to discriminate between four MI tasks of the same hand, namely rest, wrist-related tasks, finger-related task, and grasp-related task. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we have collected EEG signals for 18 able-bodied subjects while imaging to perform the four MI tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in decoding MI tasks of the same hand based on analyzing EEG signals using the EMD method.

This feature extraction method is inspired by LP_SVD and is tested in the context of motor imagery electroencephalogram. The extracted features are classified and benchmarked against extracted features of LP_SVD method. The two applied methods are also compared regarding the required execution time, which further highlights their respective merits and demerits. This paper closely examines the contribution of EEG channels of these two information extraction algorithms too. Consequently, a detailed analysis of the role of EEG channels concerning the nature of the extracted information is presented. This study is conducted on the BCI Ilia competition database of four motor imagery movements. The obtained results indicate that the proposed method is the better choice if simplicity is demanded. The investigation into the role of EEG channels reveals that level of contribution each channel can be quite dissimilar for different feature extraction algorithms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A new improved detector architecture is proposed that applies a combination of wavelets and descriptors in a multivariate matrix of features to extract and enhance discriminatory information of spikes. The number of extracted features is reduced by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) that always determines a one-dimensional matrix containing distributions of spike and non-spike samples. A simple linear classifier is used after LDA for binary classification. The area under the curve (AUC) drawn by the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) is used as index to compare performance among different classifier configurations. The result is a classifier architecture that has an AUC index of 0.9941 representing sensitivity and specificity of 97.37% and 97.21%, respectively. The proposed architecture allows different configurations to be tested without changing the classifier architecture and its training is done without iteration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Benozzo, D; Olivetti, E; Avesani, P				Benozzo, Danilo; Olivetti, Emanuele; Avesani, Paolo			Supervised Estimation of Granger-Based Causality between Time Series	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						causal inference; brain effective connectivity; Granger causality; machine learning; Geweke measure in time; causal interaction classification	EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; LINEAR-DEPENDENCE; FEEDBACK; FLOW; MEG	Brain effective connectivity aims to detect causal interactions between distinct brain units and it is typically studied through the analysis of direct measurements of the neural activity, e.g., magneto/electroencephalography (M/EEG) signals. The literature on methods for causal inference is vast. It includes model-based methods in which a generative model of the data is assumed and model-free methods that directly infer causality from the probability distribution of the underlying stochastic process. Here, we firstly focus on the model based methods developed from the Granger criterion of causality, which assumes the autoregressive model of the data. Secondly, we introduce a new perspective, that looks at the problem in a way that is typical of the machine learning literature. Then, we formulate the problem of causality detection as a supervised learning task, by proposing a classification based approach. A classifier is trained to identify causal interactions between time series for the chosen model and by means of a proposed feature space. In this paper, we are interested in comparing this classification-based approach with the standard Geweke measure of causality in the time domain, through simulation study. Thus, we customized our approach to the case of a MAR model and designed a feature space which contains causality measures based on the idea of precedence and predictability in time. Two variations of the supervised method are proposed and compared to a standard Granger causal analysis method. The results of the simulations show that the supervised method outperforms the standard approach, in particular it is more robust to noise. As evidence of the efficacy of the proposed method, we report the details of our submission to the causality detection competition of Biomag2014, where the proposed method reached the 2nd place. Moreover, as empirical application, we applied the supervised approach on a dataset of neural recordings of rats obtaining an important reduction in the false positive rate.

J	Boostani, R; Karimzadeh, F; Nami, M				Boostani, Reza; Karimzadeh, Foroozan; Nami, Mohammad			A comparative review on sleep stage classification methods in patients and healthy individuals	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Review						Sleep stage classification; Wavelet transform; Random forest classifier; Entropy	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; FEATURE-SELECTION; OPTIMAL COMBINATION; AUTOMATED DETECTION; EEG SIGNALS; CHANNEL; SYSTEM; POLYSOMNOGRAPHY; RECHTSCHAFFEN; AASM	Background and objective: Proper scoring of sleep stages can give clinical information on diagnosing patients with sleep disorders. Since traditional visual scoring of the entire sleep is highly time-consuming and dependent to experts' experience, automatic schemes based on electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis are broadly developed to solve these problems. This review presents an overview on the most suitable methods in terms of preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection and classifier adopted to precisely discriminate the sleep stages. Methods: This study round up a wide range of research findings concerning the application of the sleep stage classification. The fundamental qualitative methods along with the state-of-the-art quantitative techniques for sleep stage scoring are comprehensively introduced. Moreover, according to the results of the investigated studies, five research papers are chosen and practically implemented on a well-known public available sleep EEG dataset. They are applied to single-channel EEG of 40 subjects containing equal number of healthy and patient individuals. Feature extraction and classification schemes are assessed in terms of accuracy and robustness against noise. Furthermore, an additional implementation phase is added to this research in which all combinations of the implemented features and classifiers are considered to find the best combination for sleep analysis. Results: According to our achieved results on both groups, entropy of wavelet coefficients along with random forest classifier are chosen as the best feature and classifier, respectively. The mentioned feature and classifier provide 87.06% accuracy on healthy subjects and 69.05% on patient group. Conclusions: In this paper, the road map of EEG-base sleep stage scoring methods is clearly sketched. Implementing the state-of-the-art methods and even their combination on both healthy and patient datasets indicates that although the accuracy on healthy subjects are remarkable, the results for the main community (patient group) by the quantitative methods are not promising yet. The reasons rise from adopting non-matched sleep EEG features from other signal processing fields such as communication. As a conclusion, developing sleep pattern-related features deem necessary to enhance the performance of this process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Since the underlying physiological mechanisms of tinnitus are still under study, there is no universally effective treatment to cure tinnitus so far. There is even no method for objectively classifying tinnitus patients from normal people. In this paper, we utilize a Multi-view Intact Space Learning (MISL) method for the analysis and classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using power value of frequency bands. At first, the power values of seven frequency bands are calculated by using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) so as to obtain seven single views of features. Next, Multi-view Intact Space Learning is applied to integrate the seven single views together to get better classification results. Compared with the single view classification, the Multi-view Intact Space Learning method has achieved significant accuracy improvements by 6.32-23.25%.

Ictal speech and language dysfunction in adult epilepsy: Clinical study of 95 seizures	REVUE NEUROLOGIQUE			English	Article						Epilepsy semiology; Focal seizures; Aphasia; Video-EEG use in epilepsy; Epileptic focus	TEMPORAL-LOBE SEIZURES; LATERALIZATION	Purpose. - To analyze the semiological characteristics of the language and speech disorders arising during epileptic seizures, and to describe the patterns of language and speech disorders that can predict laterality of the epileptic focus. Method. - This study retrospectively analyzed 95 consecutive videos of seizures with language and/or speech disorders in 44 patients admitted for diagnostic video-EEG monitoring. Laterality of the epileptic focus was defined according to electro-clinical correlation studies and structural and functional neuroimaging findings. Language and speech disorders were analyzed by a neurologist and a speech therapist blinded to these data. Results. - Language and/or speech disorders were subdivided into eight dynamic patterns: pure anterior aphasia; anterior aphasia and vocal; anterior aphasia and "arthria''; pure posterior aphasia; posterior aphasia and vocal; pure vocal; vocal and arthria; and pure arthria. The epileptic focus was in the left hemisphere in more than 4/5 of seizures presenting with pure anterior aphasia or pure posterior aphasia patterns, while discharges originated in the right hemisphere in almost 2/3 of seizures presenting with a pure vocal pattern. No laterality value was found for the other patterns. Conclusion. - Classification of the language and speech disorders arising during epileptic seizures into dynamic patterns may be useful for the optimal analysis of anatomo-electro-clinical correlations. In addition, our research has led to the development of standardized tests for analyses of language and speech disorders arising during seizures that can be conducted during video-EEG sessions.

Code-modulated visual evoked potentials using fast stimulus presentation and spatiotemporal beamformer decoding	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; COMMUNICATION; LOCALIZATION; TIME; LCMV	When encoding visual targets using various lagged versions of a pseudorandom binary sequence of luminance changes, the EEG signal recorded over the viewer's occipital pole exhibits so-called codemodulated visual evoked potentials (cVEPs), the phase lags of which can be tied to these targets. The cVEP paradigm has enjoyed interest in the brain-computer interfacing (BCI) community for the reported high information transfer rates (ITR, in bits/min). In this study, we introduce a novel decoding algorithm based on spatiotemporal beamforming, and show that this algorithm is able to accurately identify the gazed target. Especially for a small number of repetitions of the coding sequence, our beamforming approach significantly outperforms an optimised support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier, which is considered state-of-the-art in cVEP-based BCI. In addition to the traditional 60 Hz stimulus presentation rate for the coding sequence, we also explore the 120 Hz rate, and show that the latter enables faster communication, with a maximal median ITR of 172.87 bits/min. Finally, we also report on a transition effect in the EEG signal following the onset of the stimulus sequence, and recommend to exclude the first 150 ms of the trials from decoding when relying on a single presentation of the stimulus sequence.

Deep learning has advanced rapidly since the early 2000s and now demonstrates state-of-theart performance in various fields. Accordingly, application of deep learning in bioinformatics to gain insight from data has been emphasized in both academia and industry. Here, we review deep learning in bioinformatics, presenting examples of current research. To provide a useful and comprehensive perspective, we categorize research both by the bioinformatics domain (i.e. omics, biomedical imaging, biomedical signal processing) and deep learning architecture (i.e. deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, emergent architectures) and present brief descriptions of each study. Additionally, we discuss theoretical and practical issues of deep learning in bioinformatics and suggest future research directions. We believe that this review will provide valuable insights and serve as a starting point for researchers to apply deep learning approaches in their bioinformatics studies.

However, there is still a lack of knowledge of using CNN models to decode motor imagery based Brain Computer Interface (BCI). This paper presents a method applying CNN to analyze the EEG signals, which are produced by left and right hand motor imagery tasks. EEG signals are transferred into time-frequency images using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and then those images are fed as input of the network for classification. A comparison is made to verify the performance of three different activation functions during the network's learning procedure. They arc rectified linear unit (ReLU), exponential linear unit (ELU) and the newly proposed scaled exponential linear unit (SELU). The results show that our method using CNN model can achieve better accuracy than the conventional method and SELU function shows superior ability for the network to convergence.

In this sense, the signal features are extracted to train a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm for classification. However, although brain signals are chaotic, feature extraction process might reduce the chaos rendering features in a way that they can be generated. Besides, even if features are chaotic, ML techniques might classify them in such a manner that an element in a particular class becomes easy to generate. In this paper, we perform entropy analysis on common features used in EEG-based security systems to estimate their information content, which is used to propose a novel technique for EEG signal generation in feature domain instead of time domain. These generated signals can potentially be used for spoofing attacks. We consider five types of feature extraction techniques and six classifiers found in recently proposed security systems, and analyze their vulnerability to spoofing attacks using generated EEG signals. The results show that the generation scheme can synthesize artificial signals to get classified as genuine brain signals by ML algorithms.

With the majority rule based on an electroencephalogram (EEG), a technique to determine the attention of multiple users is proposed. In general, a single-shot EEG ensures short-time response, but it is inevitably deteriorated by artifacts. To enhance the accuracy of the majority rule, the collaborative signals of P300 evoked potentials are focused. The collaborative P300 signal is prepared by averaging individual single-shot P300 signals among subjects. In experiments, the EEG signals of twelve volunteers were collected by using auditory stimuli. The subjects paid attention to target stimuli and no attention to standard stimuli. The collaborative P300 signal was used to evaluate the performance of the majority rule. The proposed algorithm enables us to estimate the degree of attention of the group. The classification is based on supervised machine learning, and the accuracy approximately 80%. The applications of this novel technique in multimedia content evaluations as well as neuromarketing and computer-supported co-operative work are discussed.

J	Raduntz, T				Raduentz, Thea			Dual Frequency Head Maps: A New Method for Indexing Mental Workload Continuously during Execution of Cognitive Tasks	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						mental workload; electroencephalography; biomedical signal processing; pattern recognition; state monitoring	WORKING-MEMORY; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; COMPONENT; ALPHA; LOAD; INTERFERENCE; PERFORMANCE; RETENTION; RESPONSES; FEATURES	One goal of advanced information and communication technology is to simplify work. However, there is growing consensus regarding the negative consequences of inappropriate workload on employee's health and the safety of persons. In order to develop a method for continuous mental workload monitoring, we implemented a task battery consisting of cognitive tasks with diverse levels of complexity and difficulty. We conducted experiments and registered the electroencephalogram (EEG), performance data, and the NASA-TLX questionnaire from 54 people. Analysis of the EEG spectra demonstrates an increase of the frontal theta band power and a decrease of the parietal alpha band power, both under increasing task difficulty level. Based on these findings we implemented a new method for monitoring mental workload, the so-called Dual Frequency Head Maps (DFHM) that are classified by support vectors machines (SVMs) in three different workload levels. The results are in accordance with the expected difficulty levels arising from the requirements of the tasks on the executive functions. Furthermore, this article includes an empirical validation of the new method on a secondary subset with new subjects and one additional new task without any adjustment of the classifiers. Hence, the main advantage of the proposed method compared with the existing solutions is that it provides an automatic, continuous classification of the mental workload state without any need for retraining the classifier-neither for new subjects nor for new tasks. The continuous workload monitoring can help ensure good working conditions, maintain a good level of performance, and simultaneously preserve a good state of health.

Methods: We computed the PLV between the phase of the amplitude of high gamma activity (80-150 Hz) and the phase of lower frequency rhythms (4-30 Hz) from ECoG recordings obtained from 10 patients with epilepsy (21 seizures). We extracted five features from the PLV and used a machine learning approach based on logistic regression to build a model that classifies electrodes as SOZ or non-SOZ. Results: More than 96% of electrodes identified as the SOZ by our algorithm were within the resected area in six seizure-free patients. In four non-seizure-free patients, more than 31% of the identified SOZ electrodes by our algorithm were outside the resected area. In addition, we observed that the seizure outcome in non-seizure-free patients correlated with the number of non-resected SOZ electrodes identified by our algorithm. Conclusion: This machine learning approach, based on features extracted from the PLV, effectively identified electrodes within the SOZ.

Decoding the infant mind: Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) using fNIRS	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INFORMATION; CORTEX	The MRI environment restricts the types of populations and tasks that can be studied by cognitive neuroscientists (e.g., young infants, face-to-face communication). FNIRS is a neuroimaging modality that records the same physiological signal as fMRI but without the constraints of MRI, and with better spatial localization than EEG. However, research in the fNIRS community largely lacks the analytic sophistication of analogous fMRI work, restricting the application of this imaging technology. The current paper presents a method of multivariate pattern analysis for fNIRS that allows the authors to decode the infant mind (a key fNIRS population). Specifically, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) employs a correlationbased decoding method where a group model is constructed for all infants except one; both average patterns (i.e., infant-level) and single trial patterns (i.e., trial-level) of activation are decoded. Between subjects decoding is a particularly difficult task, because each infant has their own somewhat idiosyncratic patterns of neural activation. The fact that our method succeeds at across-subject decoding demonstrates the presence of group-level multi-channel regularities across infants. The code for implementing these analyses has been made readily available online to facilitate the quick adoption of this method to advance the methodological tools available to the fNIRS researcher.

This technology is promising for elderly or disabled patient assistance with daily life. The key issue of a BRI system is to identify human mental activities, by decoding brainwaves, acquired with an EEG device. Compared with other BCI applications, such as word speller, the development of these applications may be more challenging since control of robot systems via brainwaves must consider surrounding environment feedback in real-time, robot mechanical kinematics, and dynamics, as well as robot control architecture and behavior. This article reviews the major techniques needed for developing BRI systems. In this review article, we first briefly introduce the background and development of mind-controlled robot technologies. Second, we discuss the EEG- based brain signal models with respect to generating principles, evoking mechanisms, and experimental paradigms. Subsequently, we review in detail commonly used methods for decoding brain signals, namely, preprocessing, feature extraction, and feature classification, and summarize several typical application examples. Next, we describe a few BRI applications, including wheelchairs, manipulators, drones, and humanoid robots with respect to synchronous and asynchronous BCI-based techniques. Finally, we address some existing problems and challenges with future BRI techniques.

To overcome the problems, numerous automated seizure detection techniques, combining signal processing and machine learning, have been developed. Although. 100% accuracy has been achieved for classifying non-seizure and seizure EEG records in up-to-date articles, the result of distinguishing normal, interictal and ictal EEG is still, not satisfying. In this paper, a fusion method of variational mode decomposition (VMD) and autoregression (AR) based quadratic feature extraction was proposed for feature extraction and the random forest classifier was employed to hand with three-classification task. The raw EEG was decomposed into a fixed number of band-limited intrinsic mode functions (BLIMFs) using VMD, then a logarithmic operation was imposed on each BLIMF. Subsequently, optimal AR based quadratic feature extraction was conducted on all the BLIMFs and the extracted feature vectors were fed into random forest classifier for classification. Experimental results on the Bonn epilepsy EEG dataset show that the best accuracy of the proposed scheme is 97.352% and it outperforms than the fixed-order AR based feature extraction technique. The developed technology is proven efficient for seizure detection. It can be further programmed into software and the software can be applied in hospitals to assist the neurologists for seizure detection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based predictions of antidepressant's treatment outcome may help during antidepressant's selection and ultimately improve the quality of life for MDD patients. In this study, a machine learning (ML) method involving pretreatment EEG data was proposed to perform such predictions for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRIs). For this purpose, the acquisition of experimental data involved 34 MDD patients and 30 healthy controls. Consequently, a feature matrix was constructed involving time-frequency decomposition of EEG data based on wavelet transform (WT) analysis, termed as EEG data matrix. However, the resultant EEG data matrix had high dimensionality. Therefore, dimension reduction was performed based on a rank-based feature selection method according to a criterion, i.e., receiver operating characteristic (ROC). As a result, the most significant features were identified and further be utilized during the training and testing of a classification model, i.e., the logistic regression (LR) classifier. Finally, the LR model was validated with 100 iterations of 10-fold cross-validation (10-CV). The classification results were compared with short-time Fourier transform (STFT) analysis, and empirical mode decompositions (EMD). The wavelet features extracted from frontal and temporal EEG data were found statistically significant. In comparison with other time-frequency approaches such as the STFT and EMD, the WT analysis has shown highest classification accuracy, i.e., accuracy = 87.5%, sensitivity = 95%, and specificity = 80%. In conclusion, significant wavelet coefficients extracted from frontal and temporal pre-treatment EEG data involving delta and theta frequency bands may predict antidepressant's treatment outcome for the MDD patients.

Time-invariant multi-scale matrices are constructed in the first step. The two-directional two-dimensional principal component analysis then operates on the multi-scale matrices to reduce the dimension, rather than vectors in conventional PCA. Results are presented from an experiment to classify twenty hand motions using 89-channel EMG signals recorded in stroke survivors, which illustrates the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method for biomedical signal analysis. With this multi-scale two-directional two-dimensional principal component analysis for high-dimensional signal classification, spatial-time-frequency discriminant information from high-dimensional EMG electrode array can be effectively extracted and reduced using the proposed method. Compared with the time domain feature extraction in conjunction with PCA, MS2D(2)PCA performed better with higher classification accuracy and less PCs in EMG classification. The efficiency and effectiveness of the method can be further validated by using high-dimensional EEG, MEG, fMRI signals. Although the present study focuses on high-dimensional signal pattern classification, based on the PCs obtained at multiple scales, it is relatively straightforward to expand MS2D(2)PCA for high-dimensional signal compression, denoising, component extraction, and other related tasks.

Motor imagery (MI)-based BCI is one of the standard concepts of BCI, in that the user can generate induced activity by imagining motor movements. However, variations in performance over sessions and subjects are too severe to overcome easily; therefore, a basic understanding and investigation of BCI performance variation is necessary to find critical evidence of performance variation. Here we present not only EEG datasets for MI BCI from 52 subjects, but also the results of a psychological and physiological questionnaire, EMG datasets, the locations of 3D EEG electrodes, and EEGs for non-task-related states.Findings: We validated our EEG datasets by using the percentage of bad trials, event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) analysis, and classification analysis. After conventional rejection of bad trials, we showed contralateral ERD and ipsilateral ERS in the somatosensory area, which are well-known patterns of MI. Finally, we showed that 73.08% of datasets (38 subjects) included reasonably discriminative information. Conclusions: Our EEG datasets included the information necessary to determine statistical significance; they consisted of well-discriminated datasets (38 subjects) and less-discriminative datasets. These may provide researchers with opportunities to investigate human factors related to MI BCI performance variation, and may also achieve subject-to-subject transfer by using metadata, including a questionnaire, EEG coordinates, and EEGs for non-task-related states.

The main purpose of this study is classifying two groups of healthy volunteers and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients using nonlinear features of EEG signals while performing cognitive tasks. EEG signals were recorded when users were doing two different attentional tasks. One of the tasks was based on detecting a desired change in color luminance and the other task was based on detecting a desired change in direction of motion. EEG signals were analyzed in two ways: EEG signals analysis without rhythms decomposition and EEG sub-bands analysis. After recording and preprocessing, time delay embedding method was used for state space reconstruction; embedding parameters were determined for original signals and their sub-bands. Afterwards nonlinear methods were used in feature extraction phase. To reduce the feature dimension, scalar feature selections were done by using T-test and Bhattacharyya criteria. Then, the data were classified using linear support vector machines (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) method. The best combination of the criteria and classifiers was determined for each task by comparing performances. For both tasks, the best results were achieved by using T-test criterion and SVM classifier. For the direction-based and the color-luminance-based tasks, maximum classification performances were 93.08 and 79.79% respectively which were reached by using optimal set of features. Our results show that the nonlinear dynamic features of EEG signals seem to be useful and effective in MS diseases diagnosis.

It translates the electrical activity of the brain to understandable commands to operate a machine or a device. In this study, we propose a method to improve the accuracy of a 3 class BCI using electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. This BCI discriminates rest against imaginary grasps and elbow movements of the same limb. This classification task is challenging because imaginary movements within the same limb have close spatial representations on the motor cortex area. The proposed method extracts time-domain features and classifies them using a support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis kernel function (RBF). An average accuracy of 74.2% was obtained when using the proposed method on a dataset collected, prior to this study, from 12 healthy individuals. This accuracy was higher than that obtained when other widely used methods, such as common spatial patterns (CSP), filter bank CSP (FBCSP), and band power methods, were used on the same dataset. These results are encouraging and the proposed method could potentially be used in future applications including BCI-driven robotic devices, such as a portable exoskeleton for the arm, to assist individuals with impaired upper extremity functions in performing daily tasks.

After the original EEG signal passes empirical mode decomposition (EMD), we can extract the first three order intrinsic mode function(IMF) of each lead and its reconstruction signal, and we can obtain two-dimensional feature from this signal through CSP feature extraction, meanwhile, calculate the Autoregressive model parameters and fuzzy entropy to form the fusion feature vector. Finally, use linear classifier to classify the extracted features. The data provided by the second BCI competition are extracted by this method, and the accuracy of the training set and test set is achieved by 90% and 88.6% respectively. It is proved that the algorithm can effectively improve the effect of recognition.

Recent studies have shown that feature combination of each specifically tailored for different physiological phenomena such as Readiness Potential (RP) and Event Related Desynchronization (ERD) might benefit BCI making it robust against artifacts. Hence, the objective is to design a CSSBP with combined feature vectors, where the signal is divided into several sub bands using a band pass filter, and this channel and frequency configurations are then modeled as preconditions before learning base learners and introducing a new heuristic of stochastic gradient boost for training the base learners under these preconditions. Results showed that Boosting approach using feature combination clearly outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithms, and improved the classification performance, resulting in increased robustness.

Its diagnostic power and ability to interpret brain states in schizophrenia is demonstrated on a set of 50 subjects that constituted of 25 healthy and 25 diagnosed with schizophrenia and treated with medication. The method can also be used for the automatic detection of schizophrenia; it exhibits higher sensitivity than state-of-the-art methods with no false positives. The detection is based on an analysis from a minute long pattern-recognition computer task. Moreover, this connectivity analysis leads naturally to an optimal choice of electrodes and hence to highly statistically significant results that are based on data from only 3-5 electrodes. The method is general and can be used for the diagnosis of other psychiatric conditions, provided an appropriate computer task is devised.

After reviewing the literature in this controversial field, I present an exploratory EEG study that addresses this hypothesis. I used a pattern classification algorithm drawing on EEG data prior to stimulus presentation to successfully predict upcoming motor responses that were constrained by the upcoming stimulus. Both the phase of peak alpha activity and overall amplitude at similar to 550 ms prior to the presentation of the stimulus were useful in predicting the upcoming motor response. Although these results support the idea that brain activity may reflect precognitive processes in certain situations, due to the exploratory nature of this study, additional pre-registered confirmatory experiments are required before the results can be considered solid. Implications for creating a closed-loop predictive system based on human physiology are discussed.

Brief Potentially Ictal Rhythmic Discharges [B(I)RDs] in Noncritically Ill Adults	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Brief potentially ictal rhythmic discharges; B(I)RDs; Medically refractory epilepsy; Seizures; Nonconvulsive seizures; Epilepsy	PAROXYSMAL FAST ACTIVITY; ABSENCE SEIZURES; EEG PATTERNS; SCALP EEG; TERMINOLOGY; EPILEPSIES; CLASSIFICATION; CHILDREN	Introduction: Brief potentially ictal rhythmic discharges (B(I)RDs) have been described in neonates and critically ill adults, and their association with seizures has been demonstrated. Their significance in noncritically ill adults remains unclear. We aimed to investigate their prevalence, electrographic characteristics, and clinical significance. Methods: We identified adult patients with B(I)RDs who received long-term EEG recordings either in the epilepsy monitoring unit or in the ambulatory setting. Patients with acute findings on imaging or statusepilepticus were excluded. B(I)RDs were defined as very brief (< 10 seconds) runs of focal or generalized sharply contoured rhythmic activity greater than 4 Hz, with or without evolution, that were not consistent with any known normal or benign pattern. The clinical history, EEG, and imaging results were retrieved. Each patient with B(I)RDs was matched by age and etiology to a control group with epileptiform discharges but without B(I)RDs in a 1:2 ratio. Results: We identified B(I)RDs in 15 patients of 1,230 EEGs (1.2%). The pattern typically consisted of 0.5 to 4 second runs of sharply contoured alpha activity without evolution. All patients with B(I)RDs had epilepsy, and, when compared with controls with epilepsy but without BIRDs, were more likely to be medically refractory (10 of 15 [67%] vs. 5 of 30 [17%]; P < 0.01). All seizure onsets colocalized to the B(I)RDs, and most were morphologically similar. Conclusions: In noncritically ill patients, B(I)RDs are associated with refractory epilepsy and their location is correlated with the seizure onset area.

The formulation of the conventional CSP based on L2-norm, however, implies that it is sensitive to the presence of outliers. Local temporal correlation common spatial patterns (LTCCSP), as an extension of CSP by introducing the local temporal correlation information into the covariance modelling of the classical CSP algorithm, extracts more discriminative features. In order to further improve the robustness of the classification, in this paper, we generalize the LTCCSP algorithm by replacing the L2-norm with Lp-norm (0 < p < 2) in the objective function, called LTCCSP-Lp. An iterative algorithm is designed under the framework of minorization-maximization (MM) optimization algorithm to obtain the optimal spatial filters of LTCCSP-Lp. The iterative solution is justified in theory and the effectiveness of our novel proposed method is verified by experimental results on a toy example and datasets of BCI competitions.

It is also very essential for interaction between human and machine. Emotion recognition has been receiving significant attention from various research communities and capturing user's emotional state such as facial expressions, voice and body language, all of which are emerging way to find the human emotions. In recent years, physiological signals based emotion recognition has drawn increasing attention. Most of the physiological signals based methods use well-designed classifiers with hand-crafted features to recognize human emotions. In this paper, we present an approach to perform emotional states classification by end-to-end learning of deep convolutional neural network (CNN), which is inspired by the breakthroughs in the image domain using deep convolutional neural network. The approach is tested using the database "DEAP" including electroencephalogram (EEG) and peripheral physiological signals. We transform EEG into images combine extract hand-crafted features of other peripheral physiological signals, and classify emotions into valence and arousal. The results show this approach is possible to improve classification accuracy.

We propose and develop an EEG-based system to monitor and analyze human factors measurements in maritime simulators. The EEG is used as a tool to monitor and record the brain states of subjects during human factors study experiments. In traditional human factors studies, the data of mental workload, stress, and emotion are obtained through questionnaires that are administered upon completion of some task/tasks or the whole experiment. However, this method only offers the evaluation of overall feelings of subjects during the task performance in the simulators. Real-time EEG-based human factors evaluation in maritime virtual simulator allows researchers to analyze the changes of subjects' brain states during the performance of various navigational tasks under different environmental and collaborative scenarios. Machine learning techniques are applied to the EEG data to recognize levels of mental workload, stress and emotions. By utilizing the proposed EEG-based system, true understanding of subjects working pattern can be obtained. Based on the analyses of the objective real-time data together with the subjective feedback from the subjects, we are able to reliably evaluate human factors during experiments in simulator. We describe real-time algorithms of emotion recognition, mental workload, and stress recognition from EEG and its integration in the cadets/captains stress assessment systems. We design a simulator-based experiment to record EEG signals of cadets, from which we recognize the changes of their emotions, mental workload, and stress levels during the task performance. We recorded EEG of 12 participants using Emotiv device in maritime simulator. The participants went through four exercises (around 30 minutes per exercise) with 20-minutes break in between. The exercises were with increasing difficulty levels and shuffled to be given to the participants. Videos were taken to analyze the behavioral data of the participants and used to label EEG data. Emotion, workload and stress levels are calculated from EEG recording with the time resolution 1 sec.

The system works by first computing a motion surprise map on image sub-regions (chips) of incoming sensor video data and then uses those surprise maps to label the chips as either "static" or "moving". This information tells the system whether to use a static or video RSVP presentation and decoding algorithm in order to optimize EEG based detection of IOI in each chip. Using this method, we are able to demonstrate classification of a series of image regions from video with an azimuth value of 1, indicating perfect classification, over a range of display frequencies and video speeds.

The putative link between mirror neuron system activity and the mu rhythm has been used to study the involvement of the mirror system in a wide range of socio-cognitive processes and clinical disorders. However, previous research has failed to convincingly demonstrate the specificity of the mu rhythm, meaning that it is unclear whether the mu rhythm reflects mirror neuron activity. It also remains unclear whether mu rhythm suppression during action observation reflects the processing of motor or tactile information. In an attempt to assess the validity of the mu rhythm as a measure of mirror neuron activity, we used crossmodal pattern classification to assess the specificity of EEG mu rhythm response to action varying in terms of action type (whole-hand or precision grip), concurrent tactile stimulation (stimulation or no stimulation), or object use (transitive or intransitive actions) in 20 human participants. The main results reveal that above-chance crossmodal classification of mu rhythm activity was obtained in the central channels for tactile stimulation and action transitivity but not for action type. Furthermore, traditional univariate analyses applied to the same data were insensitive to differences between conditions. By calling into question the relationship between mirror system activity and the mu rhythm, these results have important implications for the use and interpretation of mu rhythm activity.

Various entropy-based signal processing methods are being used to project actual cortical sources which could be utilized for low-cost and portable BC. This paper empirically demonstrates a potential application of coherent-Maximum Entropy on the Mean (cMEM), a solution to the well-known electroencephalogram (EEG) inverse problem, in the context of classifying two motor imagery (MI) tasks, i.e., right hand and right foot, with a reduced number of channels involved. A paradigm of 10-fold cross validation, to train common spatial pattern (CSP) and regularized common spatial pattern (RCSP) for the estimation of spatially distinguishable features and to train support vector machine (SVM) classifier model, were used. The maximum classification accuracy of 93.21 +/- 3.56 has been achieved for a particular subject using only 17 channels and this is very close to 94.65 +/- 3.86 achieved with 118 channels. In addition, reduced number of channels requires lower computational time compared to 118 channels. Moreover, the effects of outliers on BCI performances can be reduced using only the optimal task-related channels. The results listed in this paper present the cMEM as a promising channel selection tool for efficient BCI systems.

Decoding eye-of-origin outside of awareness	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						MVPA; Cortical columns; Awareness; Binocular vision	HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; UTROCULAR DISCRIMINATION; ANATOMICAL DEMONSTRATION; CONTRAST DISCRIMINATION; PATTERN-ANALYSIS; STRIATE CORTEX; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; ACTIVATION	In the primary visual cortex of many mammals, ocular dominance columns segregate information from the two eyes. Yet under controlled conditions, most human observers are unable to correctly report the eye to which a stimulus has been shown, indicating that this information is lost during subsequent processing. This study investigates whether eye-of-origin information is available in the pattern of electrophysiological activity evoked by visual stimuli, recorded using EEG and decoded using multivariate pattern analysis. Observers (N=24) viewed sine-wave grating and plaid stimuli of different orientations, shown to either the left or right eye (or both). Using a support vector machine, eye-of-origin could be decoded above chance at around 140 and 220 ms post stimulus onset, yet observers were at chance for reporting this information. Other stimulus features, such as binocularity, orientation, spatial pattern, and the presence of interocular conflict (i.e. rivalry), could also be decoded using the same techniques, though all of these were perceptually discriminable above chance. A control analysis found no evidence to support the possibility that eye dominance was responsible for the eye-of-origin effects. These results support a structural explanation for multivariate decoding of electrophysiological signals - information organised in cortical columns can be decoded, even when observers are unaware of this information.

The calibration of these BMI systems is of paramount importance in order to establish a precise contingent link between the brain activity related to movement intention and the peripheral feedback. However, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, commonly used to build non-invasive BMIs, can be easily contaminated by artifacts of electrical or physiological origin. The way these interferences can affect the performance of movement intention decoders has not been deeply studied, especially when dealing with severely paralyzed patients, which often generate more artifacts by compensatory movements. This paper evaluates the effects of removing artifacts from the data used to train a BMI decoder on a dataset of 28 severely paralyzed stroke patients. We show that cleaning the training datasets reduces the global BMI performance for decoding attempts of movement. Further, we demonstrate that this performance drop especially affects the test trials contaminated by artifacts (i.e., trials that might not reflect cortical activity but noise), but not the clean test trials (i.e., trials representing correct cortical activity). This paper underlines the importance of cleaning the datasets used to train BMI systems to improve their efficacy for decoding movement intention and maximize their neurorehabilitative potential.

Reliable MF classifier modeled and tested by the physiological data collected from different subjects is quite practical since such cross-subject paradigm avoids preparing comprehensive subject-specific training sets. This paper proposes a novel EEG-based cross-subject MF classifier, ensemble deep belief networks (EDBN), by exploiting advantages of the deep leaning principle for abstraction higher-level EEG representations. The EDBN framework builds two different DBNs for each training subject as the static feature abstractor and the adaptive estimator to track the novel physiological property in EEG abstractions of the testing subject. The temporal OFS is predicted by switching the ensembles of the two DBNs at each time step via a Gaussian-kernel based criterion. The competence of the EDBN is validated by examining the OFS classes defined by the mental workload, mental fatigue, and the coupling effect of the two variables stimulated by the AutoCAMS platform. The comparison of the cross-subject OFS classification accuracy demonstrates the EDBN significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art classifiers.

These signals reflect the cortical electrical activity. The technique for utilization of EEG data has emerged to be a safe and portable non-invasive Brain Computer Interface (BCI) that can easily be used for studying the human cognitive states. In this paper we have focused on studying the pilot's cortical potentials in simulated flight environment in order to classify his mental state into three categories i.e. rest mode, navigation flying mode, and dogfight mode. 14 channel Emotiv EEG headset was used by the subjects while playing a fighter aircraft game which could simulate all the required scenarios. The subject was screened in a dark room with huge projector screen along with audio stimuli. Several sessions of EEG data were recorded and feature extraction was carried out. Random Forest Tree classification algorithm proved to produce the best results. The pilot's cognitive state was classified according to the labeled recordings by taking one second of data each time and classifying it. As a result 81.7 % accuracy was achieved. The decent accuracy of results prove that real time pilot cognitive state can be decoded effectively, and if transmitted live onto the ground command and control room, it can be utilized for ensuring pilots safety as well as for training and monitoring of pilots on-board activities.

This paper deals with classification of motor imagery tasks for brain-computer interfacing (BCI), which is a hard problem involving a relatively small number of high-dimensional training patterns where curse of dimensionality issue has to be taken into account and feature selection is an important requirement to build a suitable classifier. Evolutionary metaheuristics for feature selection are usually more time-consuming than other alternatives, but their high performances in terms of classification accuracy make them desirable approaches. In this paper, feature selection through a wrapper procedure based on multi-objective optimization is compared with the use of deep belief networks (DBN) that constitute powerful classifiers implementing feature selection implicitly. Two different classifiers, LDA (linear discriminant analysis) and DBN, have been used to classify EEG signals with features extracted by multiresolution analysis (MRA) and selected by a multiobjective evolutionary method that also uses LDA to implement the fitness function of the solutions. The experimental results show that DBNs usually provide better or similar classification performances without requiring an explicit feature selection phase. Nevertheless, the DBN's classification performance significantly decreases in problems with a very large number of features. Moreover, to achieve high classification rates, it is necessary to determine a suitable structure for the DBN. Therefore, in this paper we also propose a multiobjective approach to tackle this problem.

In this experimental study, we developed a deep learning neural network (DLNN) system that extracted the relationships between a learner's mental states and a teacher's utterances plus the learner's physiological information. The learner's physiological information consisted of the NIRS signals, the EEG signals, respiration intensity, skin conductance, and pulse volume. The learner's mental states were elicited through the learner's introspective reports using the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire (AEQ). According to the AEQ, the learner's mental states were divided into nine categories: Enjoy, Hope, Pride, Anger, Anxiety, Shame, Hopelessness, Boredom, and Others. In a simulation, the DLNN system exhibited the ability to estimate the learner's mental states from the learner's physiological information with high accuracy.

To construct a well-suited electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding module for BHCR, we conducted a comparative inspection on the selection of classification algorithms, and adopted linear discriminant analysis and random forests as a feature extraction method and classification algorithm, respectively. We also introduced a CV system based on convolutional neural network (CNN) as a component of BHCR. A Bayesian brain-computer interaction (BBC') module was carefully designed so that for each presented image, a Bayesian model that takes HV insight as prior information and CV insights as sample information is built up to present retrieval results. Unlike existing HV-CV coupled works that usually require extra manual labor, BHCR directly enhanced retrieval performance with the help of CV insights. As an auxiliary work and a natural extension of BHCR, we then proposed a probability propagation scheme that incorporates EEG decoding insights to improve the CV system and a one-shot image database retrieval scheme. We demonstrated the effectiveness of BHCR by extensive experiments and simulations on both the entire framework and its sub-components. The results showed the following: (1) The performance of BHCR was significantly better than the EEG-only mechanism in both receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and classification aspects; (2) The robustness of BHCR was ensured by its process flow and the steady performances of its sub-components.

ERP has been introduced into brain computer interfaces (BCIs) to communicate the computer with the subject's intention. Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG, most ERP studies are based on grand-averaging over many trials. Recently single-trial ERP detection attracts more attention, which enables real time processing tasks as rapid face identification. All the targets needed to be retrieved may appear only once, and there is no knowledge of target label for averaging. More interestingly, how the features contribute temporally and spatially to single-trial ERP detection has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we propose to implement a local-learning-based (LLB) feature extraction method to investigate the importance of spatial-temporal components of ERP in a task of rapid face identification using single-trial detection. Comparing to previous methods, LLB method preserves the nonlinear structure of EEG signal distribution, and analyze the importance of original spatial-temporal components via optimization in feature space. As a data-driven methods, the weighting of the spatial-temporal component does not depend on the ERP detection method. The importance weights are optimized by making the targets more different from non-targets in feature space, and regularization penalty is introduced in optimization for sparse weights. This spatial-temporal feature extraction method is evaluated on the EEG data of 15 participants in performing a face identification task using rapid serial visual presentation paradigm. Comparing with other methods, the proposed spatial-temporal analysis method uses sparser (only 10% of the total) features, and could achieve comparable performance (98%) of single-trial ERP detection as the whole features across different detection methods. The interesting finding is that the N250 is the earliest temporal component that contributes to single-trial ERP detection in face identification. And the importance of N250 components is more laterally distributed toward the left hemisphere. We show that using only the left N250 component over-performs the right N250 in the face identification task using single-trial ERP detection. The finding is also important in building a fast and efficient (fewer electrodes) BCI system for rapid face identification.

Most existing OFS recognizers were built via a subject-dependent manner, where a new model has to be trained based on historical physiological data of the same subject. The main objective of this paper is to generalize such paradigm to cross-subject OFS recognition by exploiting the new improvements in deep learning principles. To this end, we propose a novel EEG-based OFS classifier, switching deep belief networks with adaptive weights (SDBN), which is generic for detecting variations of mental workload, mental fatigue, and the coupling effect of the two variables across multiple subjects. The temporal OFS is predicted by switching the ensembles of the static and adaptive DBNs at each time step via a Gaussian-kernel based criterion. The results comparison demonstrates that the SDBN not only significantly improves classification accuracy but also has the capability to distinguish multiple dimensions in OFS. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Background: Certain QEEG parameters have been seen to be associated with dementia in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Studies have also shown some parameters to be dependent on the stage of the disease. We wanted to investigate the differences in high-resolution QEEG measures between groups of PD patients and healthy individuals, and come up with a small subset of features that could accurately distinguish between the two groups. Methods: High-resolution 256-channel EEG were recorded in 50 PD patients (age 68.8 +/- 7.0 year; female/male 17/33) and 41 healthy controls (age 71.1 +/- 7.7 year; female/male 20/22). Data was processed to calculate the relative power in alpha, theta, delta, beta frequency bands across the different regions of the brain. Median, peak frequencies were also obtained and alpha1/theta ratios were calculated. Machine learning methods were applied to the data and compared. Additionally, penalized Logistic regression using LASSO was applied to the data in R and a subset of best-performing features was obtained. Results: Random Forest and LASSO were found to be optimal methods for feature selection. A group of six measures selected by LASSO was seen to have the most effect in differentiating healthy individuals from PD patients. The most important variables were the theta power in temporal left region and the alpha1/theta ratio in the central left region. Conclusion: The penalized regression method applied was helpful in selecting a small group of features from a dataset that had high multicollinearity.

Here we present Multi-Connection Pattern Analysis (MCPA), which works by learning mappings between the activity patterns of the populations as a factor of the information being processed. These maps are used to predict the activity from one neural population based on the activity from the other population. Successful MCPA-based decoding indicates the involvement of distributed computational processing and provides a framework for probing the representational structure of the interaction. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of MCPA in realistic circumstances. In addition, we demonstrate that MCPA can be applied to different signal modalities to evaluate a variety of hypothesis associated with information coding in neural communications. We apply MCPA to fMRI and human intracranial electrophysiological data to provide a proof-of-concept of the utility of this method for decoding individual natural images and faces in functional connectivity data. We further use a MCPA-based representational similarity analysis to illustrate how MCPA may be used to test computational models of information transfer among regions of the visual processing stream. Thus, MCPA can be used to assess the information represented in the coupled activity of interacting neural circuits and probe the underlying principles of information transformation between regions.

We employ a data-driven method developed in a previous study, Spectral Linear Discriminant Analysis, to discover the relationships between the classification task and independent neuronal sources, optimally utilizing multiple frequency bands. A detailed investigation of the classifier provides insight into the neuronal sources related with emotional valence, and the individual differences of the subjects in processing emotions. Our findings show: (1) sources whose locations are similar across subjects are consistently involved in emotional responses, with the involvement of parietal sources being especially significant, and (2) even though the locations of the involved neuronal sources are consistent, subjects can display highly varying degrees of valence-related EEG activity in the sources.

Sleep Heart Hlth Study Res Grp	Correlates of sleep quality in midlife and beyond: a machine learning analysis	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						Sleep quality; Machine learning; Polysomnography; Aging; Sex differences	HEALTH; POLYSOMNOGRAPHY; INDEX	Objectives: In older adults, traditional metrics derived from polysomilography (PSG) are not well correlated with subjective sleep quality. Little is known about whether the association between PSG and subjective sleep quality changes with age, or whether quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) is associated, with sleep quality. Therefore, we examined the relationship between subjective sleep quality and objective sleep characteristics (standard PSG and qEEG) across middle to older adulthood. Methods: Using cross-sectional analyses of 3173 community-dwelling men and women aged between 39 and 90 participating in the Sleep Heart Health Study, we examined the relationship between a morning rating of the prior night's sleep quality (sleep depth and restfulness) and polysomnographic, and qEEG descriptors of that single night of sleep, along with clinical and demographic measures. Multivariable models were constructed using two machine learning methods, namely lasso penalized regressions and random forests. Results: Little variance was explained across models. Greater objective sleep efficiency, reduced wake after sleep onset, and fewer sleep-to-wake stage transitions were each associated with higher sleep quality; qEEG variables contributed little explanatory power. The oldest adults reported the highest sleep quality even as objective sleep deteriorated such that they would rate their sleep better, given the same level of sleep efficiency. Despite this, there were no major differences in the predictors of subjective sleep across the age span. Conclusion: Standard metrics derived from PSG, including qEEG, contribute little to explaining subjective sleep quality in middle-aged to older adults. The objective correlates of subjective sleep quality do not appear to systematically change with age despite a change in the relationship between subjective sleep quality and objective sleep efficiency.

The effects of gender and depression severity on the association between alpha asymmetry and depression across four brain regions	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article							FRONTAL EEG ASYMMETRY; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ASYMMETRY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; RESTING EEG; ANXIETY; SYMPTOMS; RELIABILITY; PATTERNS; VALIDITY	Data describing the association between EEG asymmetry and depression status have been equivocal. Effects from brain regions involved, depression severity, and the generalisability of findings across genders, have been inconsistently examined and/or verified. This study investigated these issues within a community sample to potentially expand the asymmetry hypothesis to non-severe depression participants. The singular effects of brain region and electrode site, gender, and depression severity, plus the interaction between gender and depression severity across brain regions were investigated in a study of alpha asymmetry among 46 males and 54 females (M age =32.5 yr, SD = 14.13 yr) using the Self-rating Depression Scale (Zung, 1973). There was no significant difference across genders or age for depression severity. Dichotomous classification of depressed state produced similar but slightly different results from analysis of the whole range of depression status, although the frontal region was the only area where depression was consistently significantly associated with EEG asymmetry, and then only for females. However, the direction of those differences for females was opposite of that predicted by the EEG asymmetry-depression hypothesis. Several methodological issues that may have contributed to these findings are discussed, with suggestions made for future research that focusses upon individual depression symptom profiles rather than dichotomous or total depression scores in order to assist in developing a clinically-relevant model of EEG asymmetry in depressed persons.

Decision-Level Fusion-Based Structure of Autism Diagnosis Using Interpretation of EEG Signals Related to Facial Expression Modes	NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						autism spectrum disorders (ASDs); facial expression modes; EEG signal interpretations; hybrid model; decision-level fusion	SPECTRUM DISORDERS; SEIZURE; FEATURES; ALGORITHM; PATTERN; CLASSIFICATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; METHODOLOGY; PREVALENCE; STRATEGIES	A structure of decision-level fusion-based autism diagnosis using analysis of EEG signals related to presentation of facial expression modes has been proposed. EEG signals of autistic and normal children were recorded during processing images of emotional facial expression modes, such as sadness, happiness, and calmness. Then brain signals were mapped into the feature space by applying a novel hybrid model utilizing the brain potentials recorded during the examination task. The aim of mapping was to achieve separation of the autistic samples from normal ones with the highest precision. The created map provides the feature vectors that reflected spatial, temporal, and spectral data, as well as the coherence degrees for distinct areas of the brain. The mapping process was optimized using a genetic algorithm by assigning weighs to the feature vectors. Then the feature vectors corresponding to the three facial expressions of emotional modes were classified by support vector machines. Finally, using decision-level fusion through a majority voting rule, we see that the proposed structure is able to effectively distinguish the autistic individuals from normal ones.

The achievement of multiple instances of control with the same type of mental strategy represents a way to improve flexibility of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Here we test the hypothesis that pure visual motion imagery of an external actuator can be used as a tool to achieve three classes of electroencephalographic (EEG) based control, which might be useful in attention disorders. Approach. We hypothesize that different numbers of imagined motion alternations lead to distinctive signals, as predicted by distinct motion patterns. Accordingly, a distinct number of alternating sensory/perceptual signals would lead to distinct neural responses as previously demonstrated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We anticipate that differential modulations should also be observed in the EEG domain. EEG recordings were obtained from twelve participants using three imagery tasks: imagery of a static dot, imagery of a dot with two opposing motions in the vertical axis (two motion directions) and imagery of a dot with four opposing motions in vertical or horizontal axes (four directions). The data were analysed offline. Main results. An increase of alpha-band power was found in frontal and central channels as a result of visual motion imagery tasks when compared with static dot imagery, in contrast with the expected posterior alpha decreases found during simple visual stimulation. The successful classification and discrimination between the three imagery tasks confirmed that three different classes of control based on visual motion imagery can be achieved. The classification approach was based on a support vector machine (SVM) and on the alpha-band relative spectral power of a small group of six frontal and central channels. Patterns of alpha activity, as captured by single-trial SVM closely reflected imagery properties, in particular the number of imagined motion alternations. Significance. We found a new mental task based on visual motion imagery with potential for the implementation of multiclass (3) BCIs. Our results are consistent with the notion that frontal alpha synchronization is related with high internal processing demands, changing with the number of alternation levels during imagery. Together, these findings suggest the feasibility of pure visual motion imagery tasks as a strategy to achieve multiclass control systems with potential for BCI and in particular, neurofeedback applications in non-motor (attentional) disorders.

Methods: The demographic data, clinical characteristics, electroencephalogram (EEG), and polyelectromyography (PEMG) features were analyzed in 12 infantile spasm patients with atonic elements. Results: A total of 29 EEGs were recorded. Hypsarrhythmia or hypsarrhythmia variants were identified during interictal EEG. Insular or clustered epileptic spasms occurred in all. Three subtypes of atonic elements combined or uncombined with epileptic spasms (spasm-atonic, pure atonic, and atonic-spasm seizures) were observed electroclinically, which could present insularly or in cluster or altered with epileptic spasms in the same cluster. The ictal EEG showed generalized high-amplitude slow waves presenting alone or combined with other patterns. The corresponding PEMG showed an obvious electrical silence alone or preceding or following a crescendo-decrescendo pattern generated from myoelectric burst. Conclusions: Atonic elements combined or uncombined with epileptic spasms was a newly noticed phenomenon in infantile spasms, which was artificially divided into three subtypes here. It might be a variant of epileptic spasms or a unique seizure type. Significance: Atonic elements combined or uncombined with epileptic spasms was a previously ignored phenomenon in infantile spasms, which should be seriously considered in clinical practice.

Our aim is to investigate measures that can be used objectively to state a subject's listening effort. To obtain a comprehensive and reliable measure as an indicator for a person's listening effort, we need to have a better understanding of electroencephalograpic (EEG) activities. Decoding EEG signals specifically by the analysis of the instantaneous phase information has been a new trend in the last decades. Throughout many studies conducted in the past, it has been shown that the instantaneous phase of oscillatory signals reset in relation to various cognitive processes. This is based on a hypothesis presented for the generation of event related potentials. In this study, we measure the degree of phase re-organization through fitting a von Mises distribution to EEG recordings. The concentration parameter of a von Mises distribution has been shown as an informative feature for reflecting the level of attention. This feature has been used for predicting the listening effort and the results are compared among three different hearing aid settings.	[Mortezapouraghdam, Z.; Bernarding, C.; Strauss, D.

Classifying sleep stages is the fundamental problem in recent diagnoses and clinical researches. However, sleep staging suffers from a serious weakness; clinical experts visually inspect the brain and myoelectric signals to improve sleep staging accuracy. This is because recent diagnoses and clinical researches require classification accuracy at least 95% so as to enhance preciseness of their analyses. In this paper, we present an automatic classification method MASC based on the following three approaches: (1) it extracts effective features for fully representing each sleep stage property, (2) it classifies sleep stages by using temporal patterns of sleep stage transitions, and (3) it re-classifies sleep stages only for the results with low-confidence. As a result, MASC achieves more than 95% accuracy for both noisy and noiseless mice data.

To solve it a continuous wave bioradar operating at 7 GHz is used for non-contact monitoring of rats respiratory pattern and movement activity. The proposed bioradar data processing algorithm automatically detects time intervals of the animal active state and estimates respiration pattern for the rest of the record. The features extracted from the bioradar signal are utilized to classify wakefulness and sleep. The EMG and EEG data analyzed by an experienced biologist are used to train the classifier and test its performance. As a result the accuracy of 82% for 2-stages classification (wakefulness/sleep) has been achieved for bioradar data with the designed classifier.

These movement intentions contain task-related information and if this is decoded, the neurorehabilitation could potentially be optimized. The aim of this study was to classify single-trial movement intentions associated with two levels of force and speed and three different grasp types using EEG rhythms and components of the movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) as features. The feature importance was used to estimate encoding of discriminative information. Two data sets were used. 29 healthy subjects executed and imagined different hand movements, while EEG was recorded over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. The following features were extracted: delta, theta, mu/alpha, beta, and gamma rhythms, readiness potential, negative slope, and motor potential of the MRCP. Sequential forward selection was performed, and classification was performed using linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines. Limited classification accuracies were obtained from the EEG rhythms and MRCP-components: 0.48 +/- 0.05 (grasp types), 0.41 +/- 0.07 (kinetic profiles, motor execution), and 0.39 +/- 0.08 (kinetic profiles, motor imagination). Delta activity contributed the most but all features provided discriminative information. These findings suggest that information from the entire EEG spectrum is needed to discriminate between task-related parameters from single-trial movement intentions.

Monitoring the proportion and distribution of sleep stages can help to diagnose sleep disorder and measure sleep quality. Traditional process of sleep scoring by well-trained experts is quite subjective and time-consuming. Automatic sleep staging analysis has demonstrated a lot of usefulness and attracted increasing attentions. With the massively growing size of accessible data and the rapid development of computational power, Deep Learning (DL) has achieved significant improvement in a lot of areas. In this work, an intelligent system for sleep stage classification is developed by using polysomnographic (PSG) data including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG) based on a DL architecture. In our method, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed as the feature detector, which is combined with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for its strengths of dealing with temporal data. Experiment results have shown a performance improvement compared to those methods with hand-crafted features or unsupervised feature learning by Deep Brief Learning (DBN).

At the same time, they may raise significant security and privacy threats. One such device, forming the central focus of this work, is an EEG headset, which allows a user to control her computer only using her thoughts. In this paper, we show how such a malicious EEG device or a malicious application having access to EEG signals recorded by the device can be turned into a new form of a keylogger, called PEEP, that passively eavesdrops over user's sensitive typed input, specifically numeric PINs and textual passwords, by analyzing the corresponding neural signals. PEEP works because user's input is correlated with user's innate visual processing as well as hand, eye, and head muscle movements, all of which are explicitly or implicitly captured by the EEG device. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we design and develop PEEP against a commodity EEG headset and a higher-end medical-scale EEG device based on machine learning techniques. Second, we conduct the comprehensive evaluation with multiple users to demonstrate the feasibility of PEEP for inferring PINs and passwords as they are typed on a physical keyboard, a virtual keyboard, and an ATM-style numeric keypad. Our results show that PEEP can extract sensitive input with an accuracy significantly higher than a random guessing classifier. Compared to prior work on this subject, PEEP is highly surreptitious as it only requires passive monitoring of brain signals, not deliberate, and active strategies that may trigger suspicion and be detected by the user. Also, PEEP achieves orders of magnitude higher accuracies compared to prior active PIN inferring attacks. Our work serves to raise awareness to a potentially hard-to-address threat arising from EEG devices which may remain attached to the users almost invariably soon.	[Neupane, Ajaya; Rahman, Md.

L.; Eimer, Martin			Multivariate EEG analyses support high-resolution tracking of feature-based attentional selection	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							VISUAL-SEARCH; RESPONSES; INFORMATION; COMPONENT; MEMORY; N2PC	The primary electrophysiological marker of feature-based selection is the N2pc, a lateralized posterior negativity emerging around 180-200 ms. As it relies on hemispheric differences, its ability to discriminate the locus of focal attention is severely limited. Here we demonstrate that multivariate analyses of raw EEG data provide a much more fine-grained spatial profile of feature-based target selection. When training a pattern classifier to determine target position from EEG, we were able to decode target positions on the vertical midline, which cannot be achieved using standard N2pc methodology. Next, we used a forward encoding model to construct a channel tuning function that describes the continuous relationship between target position and multivariate EEG in an eight-position display. This model can spatially discriminate individual target positions in these displays and is fully invertible, enabling us to construct hypothetical topographic activation maps for target positions that were never used. When tested against the real pattern of neural activity obtained from a different group of subjects, the constructed maps from the forward model turned out statistically indistinguishable, thus providing independent validation of our model. Our findings demonstrate the power of multivariate EEG analysis to track feature-based target selection with high spatial and temporal precision.	[Fahrenfort, Johannes Jacobus; Olivers, Christian N.

If possible this would allow for the development of BCI interfaces to train disorders of action and intention understanding beyond simple imitation, such as autism. Methods: We used EEG recordings from 20 healthy participants, as well as electrocorticography (ECoG) in one, based on a virtual reality setup. To test feasibility of discrimination between each type of imagery at the single trial level, time-frequency and source analysis were performed and further assessed by data-driven statistical classification using Support Vector Machines. Results: The main observed differences between self-other imagery conditions in topographic maps were found in Frontal and Parieto-Occipital regions, in agreement with the presence of 2 independent non mu related contributions in the low alpha frequency range. ECOG corroborated such separability. Source analysis also showed differences near the temporo- parietal junction and single-trial average classification accuracy between both types of motor imagery was 67 +/- 1%, and raised above 70% when 3 trials were used. The single-trial classification accuracy was significantly above chance level for all the participants of this study (p < 0.02). Conclusions: The observed pattern of results show that Self and Third Person MI use distinct electrophysiological mechanisms detectable at the scalp (and ECOG) at the single trial level, with separable levels of involvement of the mirror neuron system in different regions. These observations provide a promising step to develop new BCI training/rehabilitation paradigms for patients with neurodevelopmental disorders of action understanding beyond simple imitation, such as autism, who would benefit from training and anticipation of the perceived intention of others as opposed to own intentions in social contexts.

We compared 25 QEEG features in 61 dementia patients (20 patients with probable AD, 20 patients with PDD or probable DLB (DLBPD), and 21 patients with bvFTD). Support vector machine classifiers were trained to distinguish among the three groups. Out of the 25 features, 23 turned out to be significantly different between AD and DLBPD, 17 for AD versus bvFTD, and 12 for bvFTD versus DLBPD. Using leave-one-out cross validation, the classification achieved an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 100% using only the QEEG features Granger causality and the ratio of theta and beta1 band powers. These results indicate that classifiers trained with selected QEEG features can provide a valuable input in distinguishing among AD, DLB or PDD, and bvFTD patients. In this study with 61 patients, no misclassifications occurred. Therefore, further studies should investigate the potential of this method to be applied not only on group level but also in diagnostic support for individual subjects.

Seizure-induced brain damage is not conclusively demonstrated either in humans or in animal models of epilepsy. We evaluated the expression of brain injury biomarkers on postsurgical brain tissue obtained from 20 patients with frequent seizures and a long history of drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Methods: The expression patterns of specific glial, neuronal, and inflammatory molecules were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in the core of type II focal cortical dysplasias (FCD-II), at the FCD boundary (perilesion), and in the adjacent normal-appearing area included in the epileptogenic region. We also analyzed surgical specimens from cryptogenic patients not presenting structural alterations at imaging. Results: Astroglial and microglial activation, reduced neuronal density, perivascular CD3-positive T-lymphocyte clustering, and fibrinogen extravasation were demonstrated in the core of FCD-II lesions. No pathological immunoreactivity was observed outside the FCD-II or in cryptogenetic specimens, where the occurrence of interictal and ictal epileptiform activity was confirmed by either stereo-electroencephalography or intraoperative electrocorticography. Interpretation: Recurrent seizures do not induce the expression of brain damage markers in nonlesional epileptogenic cortex studied in postsurgical tissue from cryptogenic and FCD patients. This evidence argues against the hypothesis that epileptiform activity per se contributes to focal brain injury, at least in the neocortical epilepsies considered here.

Functional and structural connectivity between bilateral auditory-related cortical areas (ARCAs) facilitates spectro-temporal analyses, whereas the dynamic interplay between ARCAs and Broca's area (i.e., dorsal pathway) contributes to verbal memory functions, articulation, and sound-to-motor mapping. However, it remains unclear whether these two neural circuits are preferentially driven by spectral or temporal acoustic information, and whether their recruitment is predictive of speech perception performance and learning. Therefore, we evaluated EEG-based intracranial (eLORETA) functional connectivity (lagged coherence) in both pathways (i.e., between bilateral ARCAs and in the dorsal stream) while good- (GPs, N = 12) and poor performers (PPs, N = 13) learned to decode natural pseudowords (CLEAN) or comparable items (speech-noise chimeras) manipulated in the envelope (ENV) or in the fine-structure (FS). Learning to decode degraded speech was generally associated with increased functional connectivity in the theta, alpha, and beta frequency range in both circuits. Furthermore, GPs exhibited increased connectivity in the left dorsal stream compared to PPs, but only during the FS condition and in the theta frequency band. These results suggest that both pathways contribute to the decoding of spectro-temporal degraded speech by increasing the communication between brain regions involved in perceptual analyses and verbal memory functions. Otherwise, the left-hemispheric recruitment of the dorsal stream in GPs during the FS condition points to a contribution of this pathway to articulatory based memory processes that are dependent on the temporal integrity of the speech signal. These results enable to better comprehend the neural circuits underlying word-learning as a function of temporal and spectral signal integrity and performance.

Another early appearing sign of PD consists in electroencephalographic (EEG) alterations. The combination of olfactory and EEG assessment may improve the identification of patients with early stages of PD. We hypothesized that olfactory capacity would be correlated with EEG alterations and motor and cognitive impairment in PD patients. To the best of our knowledge, the mutual influence of both markers of PD-olfactory decrease and EEG changes-was not studied before. We assessed the function of odor identification using olfactory "Screening 12 Test" ("Sniffin' Sticks (R)"), between two samples: patients with PD and healthy controls (HC). We analyzed correlations between the olfactory function and demographical parameters, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III), cognitive task performance, and spectral alpha/theta ratio (alpha/theta). In addition, we used receiver operating characteristic-curve analysis to check the classification capacity (PD vs HC) of olfactory function, a/theta ,and a combined marker (olfaction and a/theta). Olfactory capacity was significantly decreased in PD patients, and correlated with age, disease duration, UPDRS-III, and with items of UPDRS-III related to gait and axial rigidity. In HC, olfaction correlated with age only. No correlation with a/theta was identified in both samples. Combined marker showed the largest area under the curve. In addition to EEG, the assessment of olfactory function may be a useful tool in the early characterization and follow-up of PD.

Childhood onset ADD frequently persists to adulthood. Etiology may be hereditary or disease associated. Prevalence is 5% but recognition may be 'overshadowed' by comorbidities (brain injury, mood disorder) thereby escaping formal recognition. Blinded diagnosis by MRI has failed. ADD may not itself manifest a single anatomical pattern of brain abnormality but may reflect multiple, unique responses to numerous and diverse etiologies. Alternatively, a stable ADD-specific brain pattern may be better detected by brain physiology. EEG coherence, measuring cortical connectivity, is used to explore this possibility. Methods: Participants: Ages 2 to 22 years; 347 ADD and 619 neurotypical controls (CON). Following artifact reduction, principal components analysis (PCA) identifies coherence factors with unique loading patterns. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) determines discrimination success differentiating ADD from CON. Split-half and jackknife analyses estimate prospective diagnostic success. Coherence factor loading constitutes an ADD-specific pattern or 'connectome'. Results: PCA identified 40 factors explaining 50% of total variance. DFA on CON versus ADD groups utilizing all factors was highly significant (p <= 0.0001). ADD subjects were separated into medication and comorbidity subgroups. DFA (stepping allowed) based on CON versus ADD without comorbidities or medication treatment successfully classified the correspondingly held out ADD subjects in every instance. Ten randomly generated split-half replications of the entire population demonstrated high-average classification success for each of the left out test-sets (overall: CON, 83.65%; ADD, 90.07%). Higher success was obtained with more restricted age sub-samples using jackknifing: 2-8 year olds (CON, 90.0%; ADD, 90.6%); 8-14 year olds (CON, 96.8%; ADD 95.9%); and 14-20 year-olds (CON, 100.0%; ADD, 97.1%). The connectome manifested decreased and increased coherence. Patterns were complex and bi-hemispheric; typically reported front-back and left-right loading patterns were not observed. Subtemporal electrodes (seldom utilized) were prominently involved. Conclusions: Results demonstrate a stable coherence connectome differentiating ADD from CON subjects including subgroups with and without comorbidities and/or medications. This functional ` connectome', constitutes a diagnostic ADD phenotype. Split-half replications support potential for EEG-based ADD diagnosis, with increased accuracy using limited age ranges. Repeated studies could assist recognition of physiological change from interventions (pharmacological, behavioral).

J	Alimardani, F; Boostani, R; Blankertz, B				Alimardani, Fatemeh; Boostani, Reza; Blankertz, Benjamin			Weighted spatial based geometric scheme as an efficient algorithm for analyzing single-trial EEGS to improve cue-based BCI classification	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Riemannian geometry; Cue-based Brain computer interface; Weighting algorithm; Covariance matrix	FILTERS	There is a growing interest in analyzing the geometrical behavior of electroencephalogram (EEG) covariance matrix in the context of brain computer interface (BCI). The bottleneck of the current Riemannian framework is the bias of the mean vector of EEG signals to the noisy trials, which deteriorates the covariance matrix in the manifold space. This study presents a spatial weighting scheme to reduce the effect of noisy trials on the mean vector. To assess the proposed method, dataset Ha from BCI competition IV, containing the EEG trials of 9 subjects performing four mental tasks, was utilized. The performance of the proposed method is compared to the classical Riemannian method along with Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) on the dataset. The results show that when considering just two imagery classes, the proposed method performs on par with CSP method, whereas in the multi class scenario, the proposed algorithm outperforms the CSP approach on seven out of nine subjects. Incidentally, the proposed method obtains better accuracy for the majority of subjects compared to the classical Riemannian method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thus, it is relevant and timely to present a systematic review describing significant applications in the framework of computational intelligence-based SAS, including its performance, beneficial and challenging effects, and modeling for the decision-making on multiple scenarios. Methods: This study aims to systematically review the literature on systems for the detection and/or prediction of apnea events using a classification model. Results: Forty-five included studies revealed a combination of classification techniques for the diagnosis of apnea, such as threshold-based (14.75%) and machine learning (ML) models (85.25%). In addition, the ML models, were clustered in a mind map, include neural networks (44.26%), regression (4.91%), instance-based (11.47%), Bayesian algorithms (1.63%), reinforcement learning (4.91%), dimensionality reduction (8.19%), ensemble learning (6.55%), and decision trees (3.27%). Conclusions: A classification model should provide an auto-adaptive and no external-human action dependency. In addition, the accuracy of the classification models is related with the effective features selection. New high-quality studies based on randomized controlled trials and validation of models using a large and multiple sample of data are recommended.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Removal of Spurious Phase Variations in Oscillatory Signals	2017 39TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY		English	Proceedings Paper	39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 11-15, 2017	SOUTH KOREA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, PubMed, MEDLINE, Korean Soc Med & Biol Engn			ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; EEG	The study of oscillatory electroencephalogram ( EEG) data has been one of the main sources for the analysis of different brain functions and decoding a variety of cognitive processes. One of the interesting features that has been the focus of study in the last decades is the study of instantaneous phase information in EEG. Phase synchronization techniques are among the main analysis tools that measure the degree of phase re-organization in signals. In phase re-organization approach, the phase alignment in stimulus induced potentials has been shown to be informative for decoding cognitive processes. Despite the developments in this area, the precision of measures may vary based on the level of noise. Phase distortion due to artefacts and a variety of pre-processing steps that are applied on data, can introduce artificial phase alignment. These artificial phase variations (that is referred to spurious phase variations) are not correlated to any stimulus or event. In a new study, it has been showed that a low instantaneous envelope lead to abrupt changes in IP, which could distort the results of phase synchronization. In this work, we propose a method that is able to estimate the true phase based on the measurements and estimate a standard deviation for the computed phase. The method enables to remove the effect of artificial phase changes due to low envelope. In this approach the analytic signal is modeled by a Kalman smoother, and estimates a more reliable version of the IP from the measurements. At last, we evaluate the model on different synthetic data sets.	[Mortezapouraghdam, Z.; Strauss, D. J.] Saarland Univ, Fac Med, Syst Neurosci & Neurotechnol Unit, Homburg, Germany; [Strauss, D.

Generally, this component has an amplitude significantly smaller in patients at high risk of developing the disease than in low risk ones, being a major endophenotype of the disease. In this work, we propose an alternative system to automatically classify P300 signals of individuals with high risk and low risk, composed by two modules: a discrete wavelet transform that extracts features and an artificial neural network module which identifies the patterns. After training, 97.36 % of correct classification was obtained in the database from Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism.

For decoding the high-dimensional data-tensor, a kernel regression was coupled with multilinear PLS (NPLS). Two ways to introduce nonlinearity were studied: a generalized linear model with kernel link function and kernel regression in the NPLS latent variables space (inside or outside the NPLS iterations). The efficiency of these approaches was tested on the publically available database of the simultaneous recordings of three-dimensional hand trajectories and epidural electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals of a Japanese macaque. Compared to linear methods, nonlinearity did not significantly improve the prediction accuracy but did significantly improve the smoothness of the prediction.

For a successful interaction, related brain activities and events should be reliably detected; using various approaches including machine learning techniques. To this end, a variety of characteristic signal features as well as different types of classifiers can be used. One possible application of such an interaction is for epilepsy patients. A novel approach for the group of patients with difficult to treat epilepsy is the application of electrical stimulation in the early stages of the seizure generation in a closed-loop manner which can be realized in an implant. Herein, we show results of studies on the detection of epileptic seizure patterns in human intracranial long-term recordings and their dependence on selection parameters which have to be chosen for the realization in an implant. Random forest classifier is shown to allow an energy-efficient implementation of algorithm which uses a set of time and frequency domain features for seizure detection. In this study, we searched for further possibilities to optimize the performance of our algorithm and made it more robust to signal variations for online applications. In this regard, we studied the effects of detection time window, raw data normalization, feature scaling and electrode montages on performance of random forest classifier. Results of this optimization process indicate a decrease of detection delay, which is crucial to successful seizure suppression, and increased sensitivity; while preserving the false positive detections low compared to presently available closedloop intervention in epilepsy.

It employs the classification of event-related potential to control the equipment rather than using language or limb movement. Currently, one of the most important issues for ERP-based BCIs is that the ERP classification performance degrades when the training number of samples is small. In order to solve this problem, semi-supervised regularized discriminant analysis (SRDA) was proposed to extract features and classify ERP patterns by integrating semi-supervised learning and regularization approach. The labeled data was used to maximize the separability between different classes and calculate the within-class covariance matrix by regularization. The labeled and unlabeled data were employed to construct the penalty term by neighbor graph. Our proposed approach was evaluated on the BCI Competition Challenge Dataset and the simulation results indicated that it achieved a better accuracy than the traditional algorithms.

To disentangle this puzzle, four orthogonalized word categories in Chinese: unambiguous nouns (UN), unambiguous verbs (UV), ambiguous words with noun-biased semantics (AN), and ambiguous words with verb-biased semantics (AV) were adopted in an auditory task for recording electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from 128 electrodes on the scalps of twenty-two subjects. With the advanced current density reconstruction (CDR) algorithm and the constraint of standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography, the spatiotemporal brain dynamics of word processing were explored with the results that in multiple time periods including P1 (6090 ms), N1 (100-140 ms), P200 (150-250 ms) and N400 (350-450 ms), noun-verb dissociation over the parietal occipital and frontal-central cortices appeared not only between the UN-UV grammatical classes but also between the grammatically identical but semantically different AN AV pairs. The apparent semantic dissociation within one grammatical class strongly suggests that the semantic difference rather than grammatical classification could be interpreted as the origin of the noun-verb neural dissociation. Our results also revealed that semantic dissociation occurs from an early stage and repeats in multiple phases, thus supporting a functionally hierarchical word processing mechanism. (C) 2017 IBRO.

However, the low specificity of MI-BCI is usually associated with a mis-triggering problem, which means the irrelevant task would induce a false positive output. Traditional classification method collects more training data for interferences which overburdens patients. To reduce mistriggering rate in MI-BCI, we proposed a source selection common spatial pattern (SS-CSP) method to build the MI classifier without extra training sessions on irrelevant tasks. Using this approach, we were able to acquire a mis-triggering rate for interference task as low as 36%, showing a decrease of nearly 23% compared to traditional method. Meanwhile, the accuracy of two methods only had difference of 6%.

Unlike the Remote Supervised Method (ReSuMe), synapse delays and axonal delays in CCDS are variants which are modulated together with weights during learning. The CCDS rule is both biologically plausible and computationally efficient. The properties of this learning rule are investigated extensively through experimental evaluations in terms of reliability, adaptive learning performance, generality to different neuron models, learning in the presence of noise, effects of its learning parameters and classification performance. Results presented show that the CCDS learning method achieves learning accuracy and learning speed comparable with ReSuMe, but improves classification accuracy when compared to both the Spike Pattern Association Neuron (SPAN) learning rule and the Tempotron learning rule. The merit of CCDS rule is further validated on a practical example involving the automated detection of interictal spikes in EEG records of patients with epilepsy. Results again show that with proper encoding, the CCDS rule achieves good recognition performance.

The effectiveness of L1-regularization on significant trial selection highly depends on the regularization parameter setting, which can be typically determined by cross-validation (CV). However, CV will substantially reduce the practicability of BCI system due to additional data requirement for the parameter validation and relatively high computational cost. To solve the problem, this study proposes a Bayesian version of L1-MCCA (called SBMCCA) by exploiting sparse Bayesian learning. The SBMCCA method avoids CV and can efficiently estimate the model parameters under the Bayesian evidence framework. Experimental results show that the SBMCCA method achieved comparable recognition accuracy but much higher computational efficiency in contrast to the L1-MCCA method.

Nevertheless, there has been relatively little research on brain dynamics in prodromal AD. As a consequence, its neural substrates remain unclear. Methods: In the present research, electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings from patients with dementia due to AD, subjects with MCI due to AD and healthy controls (HC) were analyzed using relative power (RP) in conventional EEG frequency bands and a novel parameter useful to explore the spatio-temporal fluctuations of neural dynamics: the spectral flux (SF). Results: Our results suggest that dementia due to AD is associated with a significant slowing of EEG activity and several significant alterations in spectral fluctuations at low (i.e. theta) and high (i.e. beta and gamma) frequency bands compared to HC (p < 0.05). Furthermore, subjects with MCI due to AD exhibited a specific frequency-dependent pattern of spatio-temporal abnormalities, which can help identify neural mechanisms involved in cognitive impairment preceding AD. Classification analyses using linear discriminant analysis with a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure showed that the combination of RP and within-electrode SF at the beta band was useful to obtain a 77.3 % of accuracy to discriminate between HC and AD patients. In the case of comparison between HC and MCI subjects, the classification accuracy reached a value of 79.2 %, combining within-electrode SF at beta and gamma bands. SF has proven to be a useful measure to obtain an original description of brain dynamics at different stages of AD. Conclusion: Consequently, SF may contribute to gain a more comprehensive understanding into neural substrates underlying MCI, as well as to develop potential early AD biomarkers.

The envisioned device interprets signals and categorizes them on classes of typical responses. This could enable a speechless interaction between an observer and a participant wearing the device. This framework is different from the brain-computer-interface (BCI) framework as it focuses on indicators relevant to the human observer, brain-observer-indicator (BOI). Sensors detect resting states of the brain with associated patterns, synchrony between regions, and spectral changes in response to a cognitive event. A cognitive event results in notable changes in the associated patterns of electrical potentials. Recognition of these patterns has a broad application base, if the pattern-activity mechanism is characterized and recognized. The scope of the project includes development of a smart interaction support system BOI, relying on utilization of an EEG toolkit and an artificial neural network for personalization. The objective is to develop software that will support applications requiring feedback (i.e., training), along with a method for obtaining statistical data on the associated brain activity for engineering studies geared to improve signal acquisition and device performance. The findings from preliminary stages of the project are encouraging but indicate multiple challenges that must be addressed including a trade between a reduction of noise and complexity of classification software, definition of classes and recognition of classes and patterns, and development of an effective training data set acquisition strategy.

Here, we contribute a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the robust classification of a steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) paradigm. We measure electroencephalogram (EEG)-based SSVEPs for a brain-controlled exoskeleton under ambulatory conditions in which numerous artifacts may deteriorate decoding. The proposed CNN is shown to achieve reliable performance under these challenging conditions. To validate the proposed method, we have acquired an SSVEP dataset under two conditions: 1) a static environment, in a standing position while fixated into a lower-limb exoskeleton and 2) an ambulatory environment, walking along a test course wearing the exoskeleton (here, artifacts are most challenging). The proposed CNN is compared to a standard neural network and other state-of-the-art methods for SSVEP decoding (i.e., a canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-based classifier, a multivariate synchronization index (MSI), a CCA combined with k-nearest neighbors (CCA-KNN) classifier) in an offline analysis. We found highly encouraging SSVEP decoding results for the CNN architecture, surpassing those of other methods with classification rates of 99.28% and 94.03% in the static and ambulatory conditions, respectively. A subsequent analysis inspects the representation found by the CNN at each layer and can thus contribute to a better understanding of the CNN's robust, accurate decoding abilities.

In this paper, we hypothesize that a combination of these two signal modalities provides improvements in a brain-computer interface (BCI) performance with respect to using the two methods separately, and generate novel types of multi-class BCI systems. Thirty two subjects were randomly divided into a Control-Group and a Hybrid-Group. In the Control-Group, the subjects performed left and right hand motor imagery (i.e., L-MI and R-MI). In the Hybrid-Group, the subjects performed the four mental tasks (i.e., L-MI, R-MI, L-SAO, and R-SAO). The results indicate that combining two of the tasks in a hybrid manner (such as L-SAO and R-MI) resulted in a significantly greater classification accuracy than when using two MI tasks. The hybrid modality reached 86.1% classification accuracy on average, with a 7.70% increase with respect to MI (P < 0.01), and 7.21% to SAO (P < 0.01) alone. Moreover, all 16 subjects in the hybrid modality reached at least 70% accuracy, which is considered the threshold for BCI illiteracy. In addition to the two-class results, the classification accuracy was 68.1% and 54.1% for the three-class and four-class hybrid BCI. Combining the induced brain signals from motor and somatosensory cortex, the proposed stimulus-independent hybrid BCI has shown improved performance with respect to individual modalities, reducing the portion of BCI-illiterate subjects, and provided novel types of multi-class BCIs.

In the last years, the use of this recording for recognition of negative stress has been receiving growing attention. However, precise identification of this emotional state is still an interesting unsolved challenge. Nowadays, stress presents a high prevalence in developed countries and, moreover, its chronic condition often leads to concomitant physical and mental health problems. Recently, a measure of time series irregularity, such as quadratic sample entropy (QSEn), has been suggested as a promising single index for discerning between emotions of calm and stress. Unfortunately, this index only considers repetitiveness of similar patterns and, hence, it is unable to quantify successfully dynamics associated with the data temporal structure. With the aim of extending QSEn ability for identification of stress from the EEG signal, permutation entropy (PEn) and its modification to be amplitude-aware (AAPEn) have been analyzed in the present work. These metrics assess repetitiveness of ordinal patterns, thus considering causal information within each one of them and obtaining improved estimates of predictability. Results have shown that PEn and AAPEn present a discriminant power between emotional states of calm and stress similar to QSEn, i.e., around 65%. Additionally, they have also revealed complementary dynamics to those quantified by QSEn, thus suggesting a synchronized behavior between frontal and parietal counterparts from both hemispheres of the brain. More precisely, increased stress levels have resulted in activation of the left frontal and right parietal regions and, simultaneously, in relaxing of the right frontal and left parietal areas. Taking advantage of this brain behavior, a discriminant model only based on AAPEn and QSEn computed from the EEG channels P3 and P4 has reached a diagnostic accuracy greater than 80%, which improves slightly the current state of the art. Moreover, because this classification system is notably easier than others previously proposed, it could be used for continuous monitoring of negative stress, as well as for its regulation towards more positive moods in controlled environments.

Several studies showed the important role of the brain Pre-Frontal Cortex in decoding information coming from the gustatory system. It is also widely known, in neuroscientific literature, that the asymmetry of Pre-Frontal Cortex Activity is closely linked to the feeling of pleasantness experienced by the subject during sensorial stimulation. In this regard, from the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal it is possible to estimate the Approach/Withdrawal (AW) index, which has been largely investigated and validated in scientific literature, regarding visual, acoustic and olfactory stimuli. On the contrary there are no evidences about the relationship between such an index and taste. In this work, it has been investigated if such AW index could provide reliable information regarding the pleasantness felt during taste experience. In particular, the EEG-based AW indexes of 15 healthy subjects tasting 7 creams of different flavor have been compared with the subjective appreciation judgement. The results showed a high significant correlation between EEG-based and subjective data. Also, it has been used to statistically investigate differences of perception between the different flavors, demonstrating the potential applicability of such technology towards real applications.

In this work, multiple linear regression models under the SBL framework are used for the problem of multiclass classification when multiple subjects are available. As a case study, we apply our method to the detection of Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP), a problem that arises frequently into the Brain Computer Interface (BCI) paradigm. The multiclass classification problem is decomposed into multiple regression problems. By solving these regression problems, a discriminant vector is learned for further processing. In addition the adoption of the kernel trick and the special treatment of produced similarity matrix provides us with the ability to use a Leave-One-Subject-Out training procedure resulting in a classification system suitable for subject independent classification. Extensive comparisons are carried out between the proposed algorithm, the SVM classifier and the CCA based methodology. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the competing approaches, in terms of classification accuracy and Information Transfer Rate (ITR), when the number of utilized EEG channels is small.

A technique for estimating the common direction of the gaze of multiple subjects is studied with a view to controlling a virtual object in a virtual environment. The electro-encephalograms (EEG) of eight volunteers are simultaneously recorded with two virtual cubes as visual stimuli. These two virtual cubes flicker at different rates, 6 Hz and 8 Hz, and the corresponding SSVEP is observed around the occipital area. The amplitude spectra of the EEG activity of individual subjects are analyzed, averaged, and synthesized to obtain the collaborative SSVEP. Machine learning is applied to estimate the common gaze direction of the eight subjects with the supervised data from fewer than eight subjects. The estimation accuracy is perfect only in the case of the collaborative SSVEP. One-dimensional control of a virtual ball is performed by controlling the common eye gaze direction, which induces the collaborative SSVEP.

Traditional interactive image segmentation methods focus on using the way of manually adding interactive information, such as sketching the edges, distinguishing foreground backgrounds with dotted frames, and so on. The information acquisition and decoding technology has become more mature, such as in eye movement and electroencephalogram, and based on which, this paper presents an interactive image segmentation method that uses eye movement trajectory and EEG as interactive information. While observing the image, it collects the data from EEG and eye movement, based on these physiological signals to establish a more natural interactive image object segmentation method. The results show that the method of brain-computer interaction based image segmentation has advantages in the following aspects: first, it is hand-free, and can be applied to special occasions; second, there will be higher efficiency and better results in multi-target image segmentation. This research provides a new way to establish a new method of image segmentation based on human-computer cooperation.

Utilizing Retinotopic Mapping for a Multi-Target SSVEP BCI With a Single Flicker Frequency	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces; Neurocontrollers; Spatial filters; Pattern recognition	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; HALF-FIELD STIMULATION; VISUAL-EVOKED-RESPONSE; VEP; EEG; IDENTIFICATION; PATTERN; TIME	In brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that use the steady-state visual evoked response (SSVEP), the user selects a control command by directing attention overtly or covertly to one out of several flicker stimuli. The different control channels are encoded in the frequency, phase, or time domain of the flicker signals. Here, we present a new type of SSVEP BCI, which uses only a single flicker stimulus and yet affords controlling multiple channels. The approach rests on the observation that the relative position between the stimulus and the foci of overt attention result in distinct topographies of the SSVEP response on the scalp. By classifying these topographies, the computer can determine at which position the user is gazing. Offline data analysis in a study on 12 healthy volunteers revealed that 9 targets can be recognized with about 95 +/- 3% accuracy, corresponding to an information transfer rate (ITR) of 40.8 +/- 3.3 b/min on average. We explored how the classification accuracy is affected by the number of control channels, the trial length, and the number of EEG channels. Our findings suggest that the EEG data from five channels over parieto-occipital brain areas are sufficient for reliably classifying the topographies and that there is a large potential to improve the ITR by optimizing the trial length. The robust performance and the simple stimulation setup suggest that this approach is a prime candidate for applications on desktop and tablet computers.

We train a binary decoder that can distinguish two different mental states, which is applied in a cascaded manner to efficiently control the exoskeleton in three different directions: walk front, turn left and turn right. This is realized by first classifying the user's intention to walk front or change the direction. If the user decides to change the direction, a subsequent classification is performed to decide turn left or right. The user's mental command is conditionally executed considering the possibility of obstacle collision. All five subjects were able to successfully complete the 3-way navigation task using brain signals while mounted in the exoskeleton. We observed on average 10.2% decrease in overall task completion time compared to the baseline protocol. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The signals that are acquired are classified into movements on the basis of feature vector after being extracted from raw signals. This paper presents a novel method of classification of four finger movements (thumb movement, index finger movement, middle and index finger combined movement and fist movement) of the right hand on the basis of EEG (Electroencephalogram) data of the movements. The data-set was obtained from a right-handed neurologically intact volunteer using a noninvasive BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) system. The signals were obtained using a 14 channel electrode headset. The EEG signals that are obtained are first filtered to retain alpha and beta band (8-30 Hz) as they contain the maximum information of movement. Power Spectral Density (PSD) is used for analysis of the filtered EEG data. Classification of the features is done using various classifiers. Various classifiers have been tested and compared on basis of the mean class accuracy achieved. The classifier chosen for the study is logistic regression, which gives an accuracy of 65%. Other classifiers that were tested were multi-layer perceptron, linear discriminant analysis, and quadratic discriminant analysis. The novelty of this research is the targeted finger movements. These movements were targeted so they can be further used for control of upper limb prosthesis.

Towards a novel HMI paradigm based on mixed EEG and indoor localization platforms	2017 FIRST NEW GENERATION OF CAS (NGCAS)			English	Proceedings Paper	1st New Generation of CAS Conference (NGCAS )	SEP 06-09, 2017	Genova, ITALY	IEEE, IEEE Circuits & Syst Soc, IEEE Council Elect Design Automat, Univ Degli Studi Genova, Connected Objects Sensing Mat Integrated Circuits, Gruppo FOS				Location Based Services (LBS) have been gaining a great deal of attention thanks to their capability to enhance mobile services with location awareness. While outdoor localization is almost universally achieved via Global Positioning System (GPS), indoor localization is still challenging and a general solution is yet to be found. In a vision where wearable devices are taking over smartphones' leading role as gateway to the cyber world, new paradigms of interactive Human Machine Interfaces (iHMI) are arising. Among others, one of the most intriguing alternative iHMI is based on decoding the brain signals. Combining EEG activity data and indoor localization could dramatically improve the pervasiveness of the interaction between human, devices and environment. For these reasons, we propose a portable Hardware-Software platform that acquires brain EEG signals using a dedicated board along with position information from a cloud service. The positive results of the preliminary analysis successfully show the correlation between EEG signal and motion. Understanding that this is one of the first intents to merge these two sources of information, we intend to share publicly the ever-growing dataset to allow other researchers to investigate better the interaction between subjects and environments, and to lay the foundation of new paradigms in HMI.

Empirical evidence for the relationship between cognitive workload and attentional reserve	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						EEG; ER; Workload; Attention	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; EEG ALPHA; WORKING-MEMORY; FRONTAL THETA; PERFORMANCE; LOAD; BAND; OSCILLATIONS; POTENTIALS; DYNAMICS	While the concepts of cognitive workload and attentional reserve have been thought to have an inverse relationship for some time, such a relationship has never been empirically tested. This was the purpose of the present study. Aspects of the electroencephalogram were used to assess both cognitive workload and attentional reserve. Specifically, spectral measures of cortical activation were used to assess cognitive workload, while amplitudes of the event-related potential from the presentation of unattended "novel" sounds were used to assess attentional reserve. The relationship between these two families of measures was assessed using canonical correlation. Twenty-seven participants performed a flight simulator task under three levels of challenge. Verification of manipulation was performed using self-report measures of task demand, objective task performance, and heart rate variability using electrocardiography. Results revealed a strong, negative relationship between the spectral measures of cortical activation, believed to be representative of cognitive workload, and ERP amplitudes, believed to be representative of attentional reserve. This finding provides support for the theoretical and intuitive notion that cognitive workload and attentional reserve are inversely related. The practical implications of this result include improved state classification using advanced machine learning techniques, enhanced personnel selection/recruitment/placement, and augmented learning/training.

Recent studies showed that complex kinematics like grasping can be successfully decoded from low frequency electroencephalogram. In this work we present a hierarchical method to asynchronously discriminate two different grasps often used in daily life actions (palmar, pincer) from a combined set of motor execution and motor intention. We compared sensorimotor rhythms based features and time features from the low frequency spectrum for best discrimination results. Our results show not only the principle feasibility of the proposed method with detection of asynchronous motor intention at rates of 80% accuracy and subsequent grasping discrimination over 60%, but also that low frequency time domain features provide a more consistent detection pattern. Although the basis of this results is still an off-line analysis we are confident that these results can be transferred to on-line use.

Recently, network theory has gained traction and is at the forefront of providing a possible explanation to not only the mechanism of information transfer but also in the identification of different neuropathologies. The perception of a phantom ringing in the ear called tinnitus, similar to other neuropathologies, has been shown to be accompanied by aberrant functional connectivity between different brain areas. Although, there have been independent studies showing that specific groups of areas encode individual symptoms of tinnitus, there has not been one study to show that tinnitus is the unified percept of distinguishable sub-networks encoding different behavioral aspects. This study combines resting-state functional connectivity obtained from the source-localized electroencephalography of 311 tinnitus patients and 264 controls, and a k-fold cross-validation machine learning algorithm to develop a predictive model that verifies the presence of behaviorally specific, spatiotemporally overlapping sub-networks in tinnitus. This reorganization is found to be exclusive to tinnitus, even when compared to physiologically similar disorders such as chronic pain, with each behavioral symptom having a unique oscillatory signature. This frequency-specific transmission of information, called multiplexing, enables different types of information to be carried between two brain regions through the same anatomical connection. In addition to understanding the efficient compensation mechanism of the brain in the presence of multisymptom disorders, the exclusivity of the prediction model presents an encouraging possibility for an objective neural marker for tinnitus.

J	Li, JH; Li, C; Cichocki, A				Li, Junhua; Li, Chao; Cichocki, Andrzej			Canonical Polyadic Decomposition With Auxiliary Information for Brain-Computer Interface	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD); EEG and MEG classification; multiway decomposition; physiological signal processing	TENSOR DECOMPOSITIONS; EEG; OPTIMIZATION	Physiological signals are often organized in the form of multiple dimensions (e.g., channel, time, task, and 3-D voxel), so it is better to preserve original organization structure when processing. Unlike vector-based methods that destroy data structure, canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) aims to process physiological signals in the form of multiway array, which considers relationships between dimensions and preserves structure information contained by the physiological signal. Nowadays, CPD is utilized as an unsupervised method for feature extraction in a classification problem. After that, a classifier, such as support vector machine, is required to classify those features. In this manner, classification task is achieved in two isolated steps. We proposed supervised CPD by directly incorporating auxiliary label information during decomposition, by which a classification task can be achieved without an extra step of classifier training. The proposed method merges the decomposition and classifier learning together, so it reduces procedure of classification task compared with that of respective decomposition and classification. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, three different kinds of signals, synthetic signal, EEG signal, and MEG signal, were used. The results based on evaluations of synthetic and real signals demonstrated that the proposed method is effective and efficient.

At the same time, the recent rediscovery of deep learning combined to the large interest of scientific community on generative methods has enabled the generation of realistic images by learning a data distribution from noise. The quality of generated images increases when the input data conveys information on visual content of images. Leveraging on these recent trends, in this paper we present an approach for generating images using visually-evoked brain signals recorded through an electroencephalograph (EEG). More specifically, we recorded EEG data from several subjects while observing images on a screen and tried to regenerate the seen images. To achieve this goal, we developed a deep-learning framework consisting of an LSTM stacked with a generative method, which learns a more compact and noise-free representation of EEG data and employs it to generate the visual stimuli evoking specific brain responses. Our Brain2Image approach was trained and tested using EEG data from six subjects while they were looking at images from 40 ImageNet classes. As generative models, we compared variational autoencoders (VAE) and generative adversarial networks (GAN). The results show that, indeed, our approach is able to generate an image drawn from the same distribution of the shown images. Furthermore, GAN, despite generating less realistic images, show better performance than VAE, especially as concern sharpness. The obtained performance provides useful hints on the fact that EEG contains patterns related to visual content and that such patterns can be used to effectively generate images that are semantically coherent to the evoking visual stimuli.

J	Behnam, M; Pourghassem, H				Behnam, Morteza; Pourghassem, Hossein			Spectral Correlation Power-based Seizure Detection using Statistical Multi-Level Dimensionality Reduction and PSO-PNN Optimization Algorithm	IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH			English	Article						Epileptic seizure; kernel matrix; multi-level dimensionality reduction; spectral correlation power; Walsh-Hadamard transform	ONSET DETECTION; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES; SIGNALS; DESIGN; SYSTEM; SVM	Offline EEG signal processing for seizure detection is an important clinical application. In this paper, we introduce the offline seizure detection algorithms using single-channel and one-second-length of short-time EEG signals based on time domain and novel frequency-sequency features and also novel feature reduction scenarios. After preprocessing stages, the EEG signals are decomposed to five brain rhythms using uniform discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based filter bank. Then, transform-based features by the DFT and discrete Walsh-Hadamard transform are defined. With computing spectral correlation model (SCM) using Fourier and Walsh patterns of the rhythms, the Walsh power is computed as a modulus maximum feature that is called spectral correlation power. By segmenting the SCM, the histogram-based statistical features namely; kurtosis, skewness and negentropy as non-Gaussianity measures of probability density function for each epoch of the SCM are calculated. These extracted features are fused in multi-level structures with four different arrangements of kernel-principle component analysis, linear discriminant analysis and kernel matrix. These feature reduction methods are called multi-level dimensionality reduction (MLDR) algorithms. Ultimately, the reduced features with a hybrid model of particle swarm optimization and probabilistic neural network are applied to select the optimal features. To classify the EEG signals into the seizure and non-seizure classes, an optimized non-linear support vector machine classifier with the Gaussian radial basis function kernel is employed. The proposed methods are evaluated on selected 104-hour of EEG records from 23 pediatric patients and the sensitivity rates of 86.38%, 86.05%, 84.71% and 84.65%, precision rates of 95.33%, 96.97%, 95.33% and 95.57% and false detection rates of 0.0853, 0.0805, 0.0926 and 0.0921 per hour are obtained for different MLDRs algorithms, respectively. With regard to utilize the short-time EEG single-channel signal processing scenarios for different patients with different seizures foci, our proposed algorithms obtain the acceptable performances.

In the first method, spectral entropy feature ranking is based on a t-test statistic that maximizes class separation between wakefulness/stagel sleep. Prior to classification, PCA is performed on the ranked and non-ranked feature subsets to study the contribution of ranked channels on classifier performance. The second method uses SEPCOR analysis to automatically select an optimal feature subset with low correlation among the chosen features and maximum separation between their class means. A correlation threshold is chosen heuristically in steps of 0.05 from 0.6 to 0.75 in order to select different subsets of features. The optimal feature subsets are evaluated using multi layered perceptron (MLP) network & k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifiers with 50% hold out cross validation. For ranked feature subsets N =3, 4, 5, k-NN classifier outperforms MLP network with an increase in the number of principal components (pcs). Results indicate that the pcs of ranked channels enhance the performance of k-NN classifier whereas MLP network shows only a marginal improvement with ranking for number of channels, N <= 4. As the number of pcs is varied from 2 to 4 in steps of one, there is an improvement of approximately 2% in the classification accuracies of k-NN classifier with ranking as compared to their non-ranked counterparts. The MLP exhibits only 1% improvement with ranking for the same case with number of hidden neurons, N=50. The k-NN classifier responds with maximum accuracies of 96.43%, 95.7% and 94.10% (pc = 4, 3, 2 for no. of ranked channels, N = 4) as compared to 94.71%, 93.13% and 92% (pc =4, 3, 2 non-ranked N =4) respectively. The SEPCOR results show that with correlation threshold increasing from 0.6 to 0.75 in steps of 0.05, it automatically selects feature subsets of 2, 3, 4 and 5 which contribute to detection accuracies of 72.4%, 80%, 91.6% and 92% with k-NN classifier and improved accuracies of 73%, 85%, 95.6% and 95.8% with MLP network (no. of hidden neurons, N = 50) respectively. The SE feature ranking provides better classification results using k-NN classifier than non-ranked cases whereas features obtained using SEPCOR analysis prove to be better discriminators with MLP network for the classification of wake/stagel sleep data. The computation speed is faster in k-NN classifier and independent of increase in value of k whereas MLP takes much more computation time for training based on the number of hidden neurons.

Presurgical evaluation has advanced significantly using noninvasive techniques based on video monitoring, neuroimaging, and electrophysiological and neuropsychological tests; however, certain clinical settings call for invasive intracranial recordings such as stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG), aiming to accurately map the eloquent brain networks involved during a seizure. Most of the current presurgical evaluation procedures focus on semiautomatic techniques, where surgery diagnosis relies immensely on neurologists' experience and their time-consuming subjective interpretation of semiology or the manifestations of epilepsy and their correlation with the brain's electrical activity. Because surgery misdiagnosis reaches a rate of 30%, and more than one-third of all epilepsies are poorly understood, there is an evident keen interest in improving diagnostic precision using computer-based methodologies that in the past few years have shown near-human performance. Among them, deep learning has excelled in many biological and medical applications, but has advanced insufficiently in epilepsy evaluation and automated understanding of neural bases of semiology. In this paper, we systematically review the automatic applications in epilepsy for human motion analysis, brain electrical activity, and the anatomoelectroclinical correlation to attribute anatomical localization of the epileptogenic network to distinctive epilepsy patterns. Notably, recent advances in deep learning techniques will be investigated in the contexts of epilepsy to address the challenges exhibited by traditional machine learning techniques. Finally, we discuss and propose future research on epilepsy surgery assessment that can jointly learn across visually observed semiologic patterns and recorded brain electrical activity.

The interpretation of these classes varies from a single emotion such as stress [24] to features of emotional model such as valence-arousal [4]. There are two major issues here. First classification approach limits the analysis of the data within the selected classes and is also highly dependent on training data/cycles, all of which limits generalisation. Second issue is that it does not explore the inter-relationships between the data collected missing out on any correlations that could tell us interesting facts beyond emotional recognition. This second issue would be of particular interest to psychologists and medical professions. In this paper, we investigate the use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) in identifying clusters from EEG signals that could then be translated into classes. We start by training varying sizes of SOM with the EEG data provided in a public dataset (DEAP). The produced graphs showing Neighbour Distance, Sample Hits, Weight Position are analysed holistically to identify patterns in the structure. Following that, we have considered the ground truth label provided in DEAP, in order to identify correlations between the label and the clustering produced by the SOM. The results show the potential of SOM for class discovery in this particular context. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of this work and the difficulties in evaluating the outcome.

However, classical time-averaged methods of connectivity dismiss dynamic and temporal characteristics of functional configurations. Here we demonstrate a new approach which characterizes timevarying patterns of functional connectivity at the subsecond time scale. Methods: We introduce phaselag entropy (PLE), a measure of the diversity of temporal patterns in the phase relationships between two signals. The proposed measure was applied to multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG), which were recorded from two distinct experimental settings: (1) propofol was administrated at a constant infusion rate for 60 min (n = 96); (2) administration of propofol by a target effect-site concentration-controlled infusion with simultaneous assessment of the level of consciousness (n = 10). Results: From the first dataset, two substantial changes of the phase relationship during anesthesia was found: (1) the dynamics of the phase relationship between frontal channels became progressively less diverse and more stereotyped during unconsciousness, quantified as a reduction in PLE; and (2) the reduction in PLE was consistent across subjects. Furthermore, PLE provided better performance in the classification of states of consciousness than did phase-lag index, a classical time-averaged connectivity method. From the second dataset, PLE showed the highest agreement with the level of consciousness, compared to existing anesthetic depth indicators. Conclusions: This study suggests that a scarcity of functional configurations is closely associated with anesthetically induced unconsciousness, and shows promise as a basis for a new consciousness monitoring system during general anesthesia.

MI-based BCI was used as single-pole double throw brain switch (SPDTBS). By combining the SPDTBS with 4-class SSEVP-based BCI, movement of robotic arm was controlled in three-dimensional (3D) space. In addition, muscle artifact (EMG) of "teeth clenching" condition recorded from EEG signal was detected and employed as interrupter, which can initialize the statement of SPDTBS. Real-time writing task was implemented to verify the reliability of the proposed noninvasive hybrid EEG-EMG-BCI. Eight subjects participated in this study and succeeded to manipulate a robotic arm in 3D space to write some English letters. The mean decoding accuracy of writing task was 0.93 + 0.03. Four subjects achieved the optimal criteria of writing the word "HI" which is the minimum movement of robotic arm directions (15 steps). Other subjects had needed to take from 2 to 4 additional steps to finish the whole process. These results suggested that our proposed hybrid noninvasive EEG-EMG-BCI was robust and efficient for real-time multidimensional robotic arm control.

Particulates less than 2.5 micrometer (PM2.5) are more hazardous as compared to coarse particles of size 10 micrometer (PM10). The damage due to APM can be minimized through appropriate preventive measures. In order to gage the sway of air on the health and welfare of every living being it is necessary to perform an analysis of air quality for accurate decisions about preventive measures. Different machine learning methods including Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Neural Networks and Linear Discriminant analysis have been proposed for robust forecasting and prediction. This work is aimed at analyzing and benchmarking different methods for the prediction of average PM2.5 concentrations. For this purpose, data was acquired during the hours of the day from the ambient air and indoor environment in the suburb of Muzaffarabad (Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan). Linear and Radial Support Vector Regressors and RF algorithm were used for model generation and prediction. Results from these methods are then compared using root mean squared error (RMSE) for accurate predictions. The finding indicated that RF method and Radial Support Vector Regressor provided better prediction with RMSE as compared to Linear Support Vector Regressor.

Among the alternative methods, multivariate synchronization index (MSI) is a potential one to achieve robust performance for SSVEP-based BCI. This study further presents an extension to MSI (termed as EMSI) for frequency recognition, which leverage the method of time delay embedding. The new method incorporates the first-order time delayed version of the EEG data during calculation the synchronization index. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by comparing it with the standard MSI on the actual SSVEP datasets collected from eleven subjects. The experimental results indicate that the EMSI significantly outperforms the MSI at four time windows. It suggests that the EMSI is a promising methodology for frequency recognition and could further improve the performance of SSVEP-based BCI system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recent advances in Brain- Computer Interfaces (BCI) and cognitive training (CT) have provided new tools and evidence that NF improves cognitive functions, such as attention and working memory (WM), beyond what is provided by traditional CT. More published studies have demonstrated the efficacy of NF, particularly for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. In contrast, there have been fewer studies done in older adults with or without cognitive impairment, with some notable exceptions. The focus of this review is to summarize current success in RT NF training of older brains aiming to match those of younger brains during attention/ WM tasks. We also outline potential future advances in RT brainwave- based NF for improving attention training in older populations. The rapid growth in wireless recording of brain activity, machine learning classification and brain network analysis provides new tools for combating cognitive decline and brain aging in older adults. We optimistically conclude that NF, combined with new neuro- markers (event- related potentials and connectivity) and traditional features, promises to provide new hope for brain and CT in the growing older population.

Specifically, of importance for clinicians and researchers managing patients with epilepsies, new methods of brain imaging in search of the seizure-producing abnormalities have been implemented, and older methods have undergone additional refinement. Methodology to predict seizure freedom and cognitive outcome has also rapidly progressed. In general, the image data processing methods are very different and more complicated than even a decade ago. In this review, we identify the recent developments in neuroimaging that are aimed at improved management of epilepsy patients. Advances in structural imaging, diffusion imaging, fMRI, structural and functional connectivity, hybrid imaging methods, quantitative neuroimaging, and machine-learning are discussed. We also briefly summarize the potential new developments that may shape the field of neuroimaging in the near future and may advance not only our understanding of epileptic networks as the source of treatment-resistant seizures but also better define the areas that need to be treated in order to provide the patients with better long-term outcomes.

J	Chen, LL; Hao, YR				Chen, Lili; Hao, Yaru			Feature Extraction and Classification of EHG between Pregnancy and Labour Group Using Hilbert-Huang Transform and Extreme Learning Machine	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							EPILEPTIC SEIZURE DETECTION; PRETERM DELIVERY; SAMPLE ENTROPY; EEG; IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION; PARAMETERS; ALGORITHM; SIGNALS; STATES	Preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of perinatal mortality and long-term morbidity, which results in significant health and economic problems. The early detection of PTB has great significance for its prevention. The electrohysterogram (EHG) related to uterine contraction is a noninvasive, real-time, and automatic novel technology which can be used to detect, diagnose, or predict PTB. This paper presents a method for feature extraction and classification of EHG between pregnancy and labour group, based on Hilbert-Huang transform(HHT) and extreme learning machine (ELM). For each sample, each channel was decomposed into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Then, the Hilbert transform was applied to IMF to obtain analytic function. The maximum amplitude of analytic function was extracted as feature. The identification model was constructed based on ELM. Experimental results reveal that the best classification performance of the proposed method can reach an accuracy of 88.00%, a sensitivity of 91.30%, and a specificity of 85.19%. The area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is 0.88. Finally, experimental results indicate that the method developed in this work could be effective in the classification of EHG between pregnancy and labour group.

The complexities involved in the subjective experience of pain make it difficult to obtain a quantitative assessment from the induced spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity of high dimensionality. Most previous studies have investigated the perception of pain by analyzing the amplitude or spatial patterns in the response of the brain to external stimulation. This study investigated the decoding of endogenous pain perceptions according to resting-state magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings. In our experiments, we applied a beamforming method to calculate the brain activity for every brain region and examined temporal and spectral features of brain activity for predicting the intensity of perceived pain in patients with primary dysmenorrhea undergoing menstrual pain. Our results show that the asymmetric index of sample entropy in the precuneus and the sample entropy in the left posterior cingulate gyrus were the most informative characteristics associated with the perception of menstrual pain. The correlation coefficient (p=0.64, p < 0.001) between the predicted and self-reported pain scores demonstrated the high prediction accuracy. In addition to the estimated brain activity, we were able to predict accurate pain scores directly from MEG channel signals (p=0.65, p < 0.001). These findings suggest the possibility of using the proposed model based on resting-state MEG to predict the perceived intensity of endogenous pain.

Despite a long tradition of perception research, it is not known whether access to consciousness is required to complete perceptual integration. To investigate this question, we manipulated access to consciousness using the attentional blink. We show that, behaviorally, the attentional blink impairs conscious decisions about the presence of integrated surface structure from fragmented input. However, despite conscious access being impaired, the ability to decode the presence of integrated percepts remains intact, as shown through multivariate classification analyses of electroencephalogram (EEG) data. In contrast, when disrupting perception through masking, decisions about integrated percepts and decoding of integrated percepts are impaired in tandem, while leaving feedforward representations intact. Together, these data show that access consciousness and perceptual integration can be dissociated.	[Fahrenfort, Johannes J.; van Leeuwen, Jonathan; Olivers, Christian N.

Albeit they have been hailed to (re-)establish communication in persons suffering from severe motor- and/or communication disabilities, only recently BCI applications have been challenging other assistive technologies. Owing to their considerably increased performance and the advent of affordable technological solutions, BCI technology is expected to trigger a paradigm shift not only in assistive technology but also in the way we will interface with technology. However, the flipside of the quest for accuracy and speed is most evident in EEG-based visual BCI where it has led to a gamut of increasingly complex classifiers, tailored to the needs of specific stimulation paradigms and use contexts. In this contribution, we argue that spatiotemporal beamforming can serve several synchronous visual BCI paradigms. We demonstrate this for three popular visual paradigms even without attempting to optimizing their electrode sets. For each selectable target, a spatiotemporal beamformer is applied to assess whether the corresponding signal-of-interest is present in the preprocessed multichannel EEG signals. The target with the highest beamformer output is then selected by the decoder (maximum selection). In addition to this simple selection rule, we also investigated whether interactions between beamformer outputs could be employed to increase accuracy by combining the outputs for all targets into a feature vector and applying three common classification algorithms. The results show that the accuracy of spatiotemporal beamforming with maximum selection is at par with that of the classification algorithms and interactions between beamformer outputs do not further improve that accuracy.

Where wireless electromagnetic communications are facing challenges such as device miniaturization, energy scarcity, limited range, and possibility of interception, solutions not only inspired but also based on natural communication means might result into valid alternatives. In this paper, a communication paradigm where digital information is propagated through the nervous system is proposed and analyzed on the basis of achievable information rates. In particular, this paradigm is based on an analytical framework where the response of a system based on haptic (tactile) information transmission and ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG)-based reception is modeled and characterized. Computational neuroscience models of the somatosensory signal representation in the brain, coupled with models of the generation and propagation of somatosensory stimulation from skin mechanoreceptors, are employed in this paper to provide a proof-of-concept evaluation of achievable performance in encoding information bits into tactile stimulation, and decoding them from the recorded brain activity. Based on these models, the system is simulated and the resulting data are utilized to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, which is finally used to provide a proof-of-concept validation of the system performance in terms of information rates against bit error probability at the reception.

The aim of this paper was to characterize brain non-stationarity during an auditory oddball task in schizophrenia (SCH). The level of non-stationarity was measured in the baseline and response windows of relevant tones in SCH patients and healthy controls. Approach. Event-related potentials were recorded from 28 SCH patients and 51 controls. Non-stationarity was estimated in the conventional electroencephalography frequency bands by means of Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). Relative power (RP) was also computed to assess a possible complementarity with KLD. Main results. Results showed a widespread statistically significant increase in the level of non-stationarity from baseline to response in all frequency bands for both groups. Statistically significant differences in nonstationarity were found between SCH patients and controls in beta-2 and in the alpha band. SCH patients showed more non-stationarity in the left parieto-occipital region during the baseline window in the beta-2 band. A leave-one-out cross validation classification study with feature selection based on binary stepwise logistic regression to discriminate between SCH patients and controls provided a positive predictive value of 72.73% and negative predictive value of 78.95%. Significance. KLD can characterize transient neural reorganization during an attentional task in response to novelty and relevance. Our findings suggest anomalous reorganization of neural dynamics in SCH during an oddball task. The abnormal frequency-dependent modulation found in SCH patients during relevant tones is in agreement with the hypothesis of aberrant salience detection in SCH. The increase in non-stationarity in the alpha band during the active task supports the notion that this band is involved in top-down processing. The baseline differences in the beta-2 band suggest that hyperactivation of the default mode network during attention tasks may be related to SCH symptoms. Furthermore, the classification improved when features from both KLD and RP were used, supporting the idea that these measures can be complementary.

The method, which is called minimum noise estimate filter is based on an iterative thresholding followed by Rayleigh quotient which tries to find an estimate of the noise and to minimize it over the original signal. MNE filter is capable to operate without any prior information about field potential signals. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by its application on two different type of signals namely electrocorticogram and electroencephalogram datasets through a decoding procedure. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms well-known artifacts removal techniques such as common average referencing, Laplacian method, independent component analysis and wavelet denoising approach.

To elucidate the process by which this is achieved, we used magnetoencephalography to measure spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity with high temporal resolution during visual discrimination among a large and carefully controlled set of faces. We also compared these neural data to lower level "image-based" and higher level "identitybased" model-based representations of our stimuli and to behavioral similarity judgments of our stimuli. Between similar to 50 and 400 ms after stimulus onset, face-selective sources in right lateral occipital cortex and right fusiform gyrus and sources in a control region (left V1) yielded successful classification of facial identity. In all regions, early responses were more similar to the image-based representation than to the identity-based representation. In the face-selective regions only, responses were more similar to the identity-based representation at several time points after 200 ms. Behavioral responses were more similar to the identity-based representation than to the image-based representation, and their structure was predicted by responses in the face-selective regions. These results provide a temporally precise description of the transformation from low-to high-level representations of facial identity in human face-selective cortex and demonstrate that faceselective cortical regions represent multiple distinct types of information about face identity at different times over the first 500 ms after stimulus onset. These results have important implications for understanding the rapid emergence of fine-grained, highlevel representations of object identity, a computation essential to human visual expertise.

Entropic Brain-computer Interfaces Using fNIRS and EEG to Measure Attentional States in a Bayesian Framework	PHYCS: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPUTING SYSTEMS			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Physiological Computing Systems (PhyCS)	JUL 27-28, 2017	Madrid, SPAIN			BCI; Brain-computer Interface; fNIRS; EEG; Workload; Implicit Interface; Attention; Task-positive Network; Default Mode Network; Entropy; Physiological Computing; Entropic Brain-computer Interface; Bidirectional Brain-computer Interface; ADHD; Meditation		Implicit Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) adapt system settings subtly based on real time measures of brain activation without the user's explicit awareness. For example, measures of the user's cognitive profile might drive a system that alters the timing of notifications in order to minimize user interruption. Here, we consider new avenues for implicit BCI based on recent discoveries in cognitive neuroscience and conduct a series of experiments using BCI's principal non-invasive brain sensors, fNIRS and EEG. We show how Bayesian and systems neuroscience formulations explain the difference in performance of machine learning algorithms trained on brain data in different conditions. These new formulations posit that the brain aims to minimize its long-term surprisal of sensory data and organizes its calculations on two anti-correlated networks. We consider how to use real-time input that portrays a user along these dimensions in designing Bidirectional BCIs, which are Implicit BCIs that aim to optimize the user's state by modulating computer output based on feedback from a brain monitor. We introduce Entropic Brain-Computer Interfacing as a type of Bidirectional BCI which uses physiological measurements of information theoretical dimensions of the user's state to evaluate the digital flow of information to the user's brain, tweaking this output in a feedback loop to the user's benefit.

Electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG) and mechanomyogram (MMG) signals were simultaneously recorded from twelve subjects while performing nine lower limb multi-joint motions. These multimodal data are used as the inputs of the fusion framework for identification of different motion intentions. Twelve fusion techniques are evaluated in this framework and a large number of comparative experiments are carried out. The results show that a support vector machine-based three-modal fusion scheme can achieve average accuracies of 98.61%, 97.78% and 96.85%, respectively, under three different data division forms. Furthermore, the relevant statistical tests reveal that this fusion scheme brings significant accuracy improvement in comparison with the cases of two-modal fusion or only a single modality. These promising results indicate the potential of the multimodal fusion framework for facilitating the future development of human-robot interaction for lower limb rehabilitation.

ASR for Under-Resourced Languages From Probabilistic Transcription	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						Automatic speech recognition; EEG; mismatched crowdsourcing; under-resourced languages	SPEECH RECOGNITION; NEURAL-NETWORK; ERROR; MODEL	In many under-resourced languages it is possible to find text, and it is possible to find speech, but transcribed speech suitable for training automatic speech recognition (ASR) is unavailable. In the absence of native transcripts, this paper proposes the use of a probabilistic transcript: A probability mass function over possible phonetic transcripts of the waveform. Three sources of probabilistic transcripts are demonstrated. First, self-training is a well-established semisupervised learning technique, in which a cross-lingual ASR first labels unlabeled speech, and is then adapted using the same labels. Second, mismatched crowdsourcing is a recent technique in which nonspeakers of the language are asked to write what they hear, and their nonsense transcripts are decoded using noisy channel models of second-language speech perception. Third, EEG distribution coding is a new technique in which nonspeakers of the language listen to it, and their electrocortical response signals are interpreted to indicate probabilities. ASR was trained in four languages without native transcripts. Adaptation using mismatched crowdsourcing significantly outperformed self-training, and both significantly outperformed a cross-lingual baseline. Both EEG distribution coding and text-derived phone language models were shown to improve the quality of probabilistic transcripts derived from mismatched crowdsourcing.

This paper solve this problem using the existing dataset of many subjects. By analyzing the differences in EEC signal among different users, removing these differences as much as possible and exploits the common points of different individual, the proposed method can correct the data in existing dataset to a new dataset close to the target data. Then using the ensemble method, we combine the model of the existing dataset to a final model.

In particular, the common spatial patterns (CSP) is one of the most successful solutions which has been widely used in MI-BCIs. However, studies have reported that the performance of CSP heavily depends on its channels configuration. To the best of our current knowledge, it is not available to obtain the active channels related to brain activities of stroke patients in advance. Hence, we usually set a relatively broad channels or try to select a subject-specific channels when applying CSP to stroke patients. In this paper, we present a novel approach which employs wavelet transform and boosting algorithm to improve accuracy and robustness of the conventional CSP. In our proposed approach, the channel configurations are initially divided into multiple preconditions. Then, the informative features of the predefined channels are obtained using the Wavelet Common Spatial Pattern (W-CSP) algorithm that provided high-temporal-spectral resolution. Eventually, we train weak classifiers on the obtained features and combine these weak classifiers to a weighted combinational model using boosting strategy. Extensive experiments have been performed on datasets from the famous BCI competition III and IV. The results demonstrate its superior performance.

Endogenous Control of Powered Lower-Limb Exoskeleton	WEARABLE ROBOTICS: CHALLENGES AND TRENDS	Biosystems and Biorobotics		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Symposium on Wearable Robotics (WeRob)	OCT 18-21, 2016	Segovia, SPAIN					We present an online decoding method for controlling a powered lower-limb exoskeleton using endogenously generated electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of human users. By performing a series of binary classifications, users control the exoskeleton in three directions: walk front, turn left and turn right. During the first classification phase, the user's intention to either walk front or change direction is detected. If the user's intention to change direction is detected, a subsequent classification for turning left or right is performed. Five subjects were able to successfully complete the 3-way navigation task while mounted in the exoskeleton. We report the improved accuracy of our cascaded protocol over a baseline method.

Whether the decoding process is bounded by the capacity of theta rhythm to follow syllabic rhythms in speech, or constrained by a more endogenous top-down mechanism, e.g., involving beta activity, is unknown. We addressed the dynamics of auditory decoding in speech comprehension by challenging syllable tracking and speech decoding using comprehensible and incomprehensible time-compressed auditory sentences. We recorded EEGs in human participants and found that neural activity in both theta and gamma ranges was sensitive to syllabic rate. Phase patterns of slow neural activity consistently followed the syllabic rate (4 - 14 Hz), even when this rate went beyond the classical theta range (4-8 Hz). The power of theta activity increased linearly with syllabic rate but showed no sensitivity to comprehension. Conversely, the power of beta ( 14 - 21 Hz) activity was insensitive to the syllabic rate, yet reflected comprehension on a single-trial basis. Wefound different long-range dynamics for theta and beta activity, with beta activity building up in time while more contextual information becomes available. This is consistent with the roles of theta and beta activity in stimulus-driven versus endogenous mechanisms. These data show that speech comprehension is constrained by concurrent stimulus-driven theta and low-gamma activity, and by endogenous beta activity, but not primarily by the capacity of theta activity to track the syllabic rhythm.

This paper proposed a cost-sensitive majority weighted minority oversampling strategy to address the imbalanced MWL data classification problem. Both the inter-class and intra-class imbalance problems are considered. For the former, imbalance ratio is defined to determine the number of the synthetic samples in the minority class. The latter problem is addressed by assigning different weights to borderline samples in the minority class based on the distance and density meaures of the sample distribution. Furthermore, multi-label classifier is designed based on an ensemble of binary classifiers. The results of analyzing 21 imbalanced UCI multi-class datasets showed that the proposed approach can effectively cope with the imbalanced classification problem in terms of several performance metrics including geometric mean (G-mean) and average accuracy (ACC). Moreover, the proposed approach was applied to the analysis of the EEG data of eight experimental participants subject to fluctuating levels of mental workload. The comparative results showed that the proposed method provides a competing alternative to several existing imbalanced learning algorithms and significantly outperforms the basic/referential method that ignores the imbalance nature of the dataset.

Common spatial pattern (CSP) is one of the most frequently used algorithms in BCI to extract features from electroencephalogram (EEG). However, since CSP would be a greedy algorithm by solving it through eigenvalue decomposition method, choosing features in a sequential way does not necessarily result in the minimal achievable classification error for higher than 2-dimensional feature vectors. To overcome this issue, Unbalanced Factorial ANOVA (UF-ANOVA) analysis based on linear regression has been used in order to evaluate features extracted from CSP algorithm. Finally, a criterion based on Mahalanobis distance and F distribution parameter resulted from ANOVA table is introduced to evaluate feature vectors. It is shown that proposed criterion is compatible with widely used criterions such as Fisher score (FS) and Mutual information (MI). Moreover, proposed analysis is not limited to one-dimensional feature vectors and can be applied to higher dimensions.

Finger Movements Are Mainly Represented by a Linear Transformation of Energy in Band-Specific ECoG Signals	2017 39TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY		English	Proceedings Paper	39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 11-15, 2017	SOUTH KOREA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, PubMed, MEDLINE, Korean Soc Med & Biol Engn				Electrocardiogram (ECoG) recordings are very attractive for Brain Machine Interface (BMI) applications due to their balance between good signal to noise ratio and minimal invasiveness. The design of ECoG signal decoders is an open research area to date which requires a better understanding of the nature of these signals and how information is encoded in them. In this study, a linear and a non-linear method, Linear Regression Model (LRM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) respectively, were used to decode finger movements from energy in band-specific ECoG signals. It is shown that the ANN only slightly outperformed the LRM, which suggests that finger movements are mainly represented by a linear transformation of energy in band-specific ECoG signals. In addition, comparing our results to similar Electroencephalogram (EEG) studies illustrated that the spatio-temporal summation of multiple neural signals is itself linearly correlated with movement, and is not an artifact introduced by the scalp or cranium. Furthermore, a new algorithm was employed to reduce the number of spectral features of the input signals required for either of the decoding methods.

Coherent averaging estimation autoencoders applied to evoked potentials processing	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Coherent Averaging; Artificial Neural Networks; Event Related Potentials; Brain Computer Interfaces; Autoencoders	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; BCI SYSTEM; SIGNALS; CLASSIFICATION; NETWORKS; NOISE; EEG	The success of machine learning algorithms strongly depends on the feature extraction and data representation stages. Classification and estimation of small repetitive signals masked by relatively large noise usually requires recording and processing several different realizations of the signal of interest. This is one of the main signal processing problems to solve when estimating or classifying P300 evoked potentials in brain-computer interfaces. To cope with this issue we propose a novel autoencoder variation, called Coherent Averaging Estimation Autoencoder with a new multiobjective cost function. We illustrate its use and analyze its performance in the problem of event related potentials processing. Experimental results showing the advantages of the proposed approach are finally presented.

Usually, the user has to face the task of manually browsing through the playlist of songs to select. Here we are proposing an efficient and accurate model, that would generate a playlist based on current emotional state and behavior of the user. Existing methods for automating the playlist generation process are computationally slow, less accurate and sometimes even require use of additional hardware like EEG or sensors. Speech is the most ancient and natural way of expressing feelings, emotions and mood and its and its processing requires high computational, time, and cost. This proposed system based on real-time extraction of facial expressions as well as extracting audio features from songs to classify into a specific emotion that will generate a playlist automatically such that the computation cost is relatively low.

The system is based on the Emotiv Epoc headset, which provides the capability of simultaneous recording of 14 EEG channels, as well as wireless connectivity by means of the Bluetooth protocol. The system is initially trained to decode what user thinks to properly formatted data. The headset communicates with a personal computer, which runs a dedicated software application, implemented under the Processing integrated development environment. The application acquires the data from the headset and invokes suitable commands to an Arduino Uno board. The board decodes the received commands and produces corresponding signals to a servo motor that controls the position of the robotic claw. The system was tested successfully on a healthy, male subject, aged 28 years. The results are promising, taking into account that no specialized hardware was used. However, tests on a larger number of users is necessary in order to draw solid conclusions regarding the performance of the proposed system.

Due to the fact that a large number of disabled people need to restore or improve walking ability, it is also important to investigate the use of MI-based BCIs for lower limb motor rehabilitation. The brain activity of lower limb MI is more difficult to detect because of low reliability. The purpose of this study is to find a suitable paradigm of walking imagery to achieve better training effect and ensure reliable brain activity. We developed the text-based paradigm and the virtual environment (VE)-based paradigm, and evaluated their performance on identifying walking imagery from idle state. The experimental results provide evidences that the VE-based paradigm could improve the average classification accuracy. This paradigm would induce EEG patterns that make them easier for single-trial detection of walking imagery. This study has the potential to improve the reliability and robustness of walking imagery based BCIs.

These biosignals-stemming from the articulators, the articulator muscle activities, the neural pathways, and the brain itself-can be used to circumvent limitations of conventional speech processing in particular, and to gain insights into the process of speech production in general. Research on biosignal-based speech processing is a wide and very active field at the intersection of various disciplines, ranging from engineering, computer science, electronics and machine learning to medicine, neuroscience, physiology, and psychology. Consequently, a variety of methods and approaches have been used to investigate the common goal of creating biosignal-based speech processing devices for communication applications in everyday situations and for speech rehabilitation, as well as gaining a deeper understanding of spoken communication. This paper gives an overview of the various modalities, research approaches, and objectives for biosignal-based spoken communication.

This research paper is divided into three main sections in order to address the above mentioned problem: (1) Firstly, it is proven that a suitable scaling of the class conditional covariance matrices can be used to link the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) solution with a predefined number of spatial filters for each class and its representation as a divergence optimization problem by making their different filter selection policies compatible; (2) A closed form formula for the gradient of the Alpha-Beta Log-Det divergences is derived that allows to perform optimization as well as easily use it in many practical applications; (3) Finally, in similarity with the work of Samek et al. 2014, which proposed the robust spatial filtering of the motor imagery movements based on the beta-divergence, the optimization of the Alpha-Beta Log-Det divergences is applied to this problem. The resulting subspace algorithm provides a unified framework for testing the performance and robustness of the several divergences in different scenarios.

Such extraction of features is typically manual. We contend that manual extraction of features may not be the best way to tackle text subtleties that characteristically prevail in complex classification tasks like sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection, and that even the extraction and choice of features should be delegated to the learning system. We introduce a framework to automatically extract cognitive features from the eye-movement / gaze data of human readers reading the text and use them as features along with textual features for the tasks of sentiment polarity and sarcasm detection. Our proposed framework is based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN learns features from both gaze and text and uses them to classify the input text. We test our technique on published sentiment and sarcasm labeled datasets, enriched with gaze information, to show that using a combination of automatically learned text and gaze features often yields better classification performance over (i) CNN based systems that rely on text input alone and (ii) existing systems that rely on handcrafted gaze and textual features.

Based on a motor learning theoretical context and on the failure of neuroelectric brain-computer interface (BCI) communication attempts in CLIS, we here report BCI communication using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and an implicit attentional processing procedure. Four patients suffering from advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-two of them in permanent CLIS and two entering the CLIS with-out reliable means of communication - learned to answer personal questions with known answers and open questions all requiring a "yes"or "no" thought using frontocentral oxygenation changes measured with fNIRS. Three patients completed more than 46 sessions spread over several weeks, and one patient (patient W) completed 20 sessions. Online fNIRS classification of personal questions with known answers and open questions using linear support vector machine (SVM) resulted in an above-chance-level correct response rate over 70%. Electroencephalographic oscillations and electrooculographic signals did not exceed the chance-level threshold for correct communication despite occasional differences between the physiological signals representing a "yes" or "no" response. However, electro-encephalogram (EEG) changes in the theta-frequency band correlated with inferior communication performance, probably because of decreased vigilance and attention. If replicated with ALS patients in CLIS, these positive results could indicate the first step towards abolition of complete locked-in states, at least for ALS.

Advances in noninvasive neuroimaging target two capabilities: 1) increased spatial and temporal resolution of measured neural activity; and 2) innovative methodologies to extract brain-behavior relationships from evolving neuroimaging technology. We target the second. Our novel methodology integrated three neuroimaging methodologies and elucidated expertise-dependent differences in functional (fused EEG-fMRI) and structural (dMRI) brain networks for a perception-action coupling task. A set of baseball players and controls performed a Go/No-Go task designed to mimic the situation of hitting a baseball. In the functional analysis, our novel fusion methodology identifies 50-ms windows with predictive EEG neural correlates of expertise and fuses these temporal windows with fMRI activity in a whole-brain 2-mm voxel analysis, revealing time-localized correlations of expertise at a spatial scale of millimeters. The spatiotemporal cascade of brain activity reflecting expertise differences begins as early as 200 ms after the pitch starts and lasts up to 700 ms afterwards. Network differences are spatially localized to include motor and visual processing areas, providing evidence for differences in perception-action coupling between the groups. Furthermore, an analysis of structural connectivity reveals that the players have significantly more connections between cerebellar and left frontal/ motor regions, and many of the functional activation differences between the groups are located within structurally defined network modules that differentiate expertise. In short, our novel method illustrates how multimodal neuroimaging can provide specific macroscale insights into the functional and structural correlates of expertise development.

A previous small study suggested that Brain Network Activation (BNA), a novel ERP-based brain network analysis, may have diagnostic utility in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study we examined the diagnostic capability of a new advanced version of the BNA methodology on a larger population of adults with and without ADHD. Method. Subjects were unmedicated right-handed 18- to 55-year-old adults of both sexes with and without a DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD. We collected EEG while the subjects were performing a response inhibition task (Go/NoGo) and then applied a spatio-temporal Brain Network Activation (BNA) analysis of the EEG data. This analysis produced a display of qualitative measures of brain states (BNA scores) providing information on cortical connectivity. This complex set of scores was then fed into a machine learning algorithm. Results. The BNA analysis of the EEG data recorded during the Go/NoGo task demonstrated a high discriminative capacity between ADHD patients and controls (AUC = 0.92, specificity = 0.95, sensitivity = 0.86 for the Go condition; AUC = 0.84, specificity = 0.91, sensitivity = 0.76 for the NoGo condition). Conclusions. BNA methodology can help differentiate between ADHD and healthy controls based on functional brain connectivity. The data support the utility of the tool to augment clinical examinations by objective evaluation of electro-physiological changes associated with ADHD. Results also support a network-based approach to the study of ADHD.

One use of EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in rehabilitation is the detection of movement intention. In this paper we investigate for the first time the instantaneous phase of movement related cortical potential (MRCP) and its application to the detection of gait intention. Approach. We demonstrate the utility of MRCP phase in two independent datasets, in which 10 healthy subjects and 9 chronic stroke patients executed a self-initiated gait task in three sessions. Phase features were compared to more conventional amplitude and power features. Main results. The neurophysiology analysis showed that phase features have higher signal-to-noise ratio than the other features. Also, BCI detectors of gait intention based on phase, amplitude, and their combination were evaluated under three conditions: session-specific calibration, intersession transfer, and intersubject transfer. Results show that the phase based detector is the most accurate for session-specific calibration (movement intention was correctly detected in 66.5% of trials in healthy subjects, and in 63.3% in stroke patients). However, in intersession and intersubject transfer, the detector that combines amplitude and phase features is the most accurate one and the only that retains its accuracy (62.5% in healthy subjects and 59% in stroke patients) w.r.t. session-specific calibration. Significance. MRCP phase features improve the detection of gait intention and could be used in practice to remove time-consuming BCI recalibration.

J	Alvarez-Meza, AM; Orozco-Gutierrez, A; Castellanos-Dominguez, G				Alvarez-Meza, Andres M.; Orozco-Gutierrez, Alvaro; Castellanos-Dominguez, German			Kernel-Based Relevance Analysis with Enhanced Interpretability for Detection of Brain Activity Patterns	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						relevance analysis; kernel method; brain activity; motor imagery; epileptic seizure detection	EPILEPTIC SEIZURE DETECTION; SCALP EEG RECORDINGS; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; COMPUTER-INTERFACE; NEURAL-NETWORK; DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; FEATURE-SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; TRANSFORM	We introduce Enhanced Kernel-based Relevance Analysis (EKRA) that aims to support the automatic identification of brain activity patterns using electroencephalographic recordings. EKRA is a data-driven strategy that incorporates two kernel functions to take advantage of the available joint information, associating neural responses to a given stimulus condition. Regarding this, a Centered Kernel Alignment functional is adjusted to learning the linear projection that best discriminates the input feature set, optimizing the required free parameters automatically. Our approach is carried out in two scenarios: (i) feature selection by computing a relevance vector from extracted neural features to facilitating the physiological interpretation of a given brain activity task, and (ii) enhanced feature selection to perform an additional transformation of relevant features aiming to improve the overall identification accuracy. Accordingly, we provide an alternative feature relevance analysis strategy that allows improving the system performance while favoring the data interpretability. For the validation purpose, EKRA is tested in two well-known tasks of brain activity: motor imagery discrimination and epileptic seizure detection. The obtained results show that the EKRA approach estimates a relevant representation space extracted from the provided supervised information, emphasizing the salient input features. As a result, our proposal outperforms the state-of-the-art methods regarding brain activity discrimination accuracy with the benefit of enhanced physiological interpretation about the task at hand.

However, the calibration of a BCI system is a time-consuming and fatiguing process for stroke patients, which leaves reduced time for actual therapeutic interaction. Studies have shown that passive movement (PM) (i.e., the execution of a movement by an external agency without any voluntary motions) and motor imagery (MI) (i.e., the mental rehearsal of a movement without any activation of the muscles) induce similar EEG patterns over the motor cortex. Since performing PM is less fatiguing for the patients, this paper investigates the effectiveness of calibrating MI-BCIs from PM for stroke subjects in terms of classification accuracy. For this purpose, a new adaptive algorithm called filter bank data space adaptation (FB-DSA) is proposed. The FB-DSA algorithm linearly transforms the band-pass-filtered MI data such that the distribution difference between the MI and PM data is minimized. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by an offline study on data collected from 16 healthy subjects and 6 stroke patients. The results show that the proposed FB-DSA algorithm significantly improved the classification accuracies of the PM and MI calibrated models (p < 0.05). According to the obtained classification accuracies, the PM calibrated models that were adapted using the proposed FB-DSA algorithm outperformed the MI calibrated models by an average of 2.3 and 4.5 % for the healthy and stroke subjects respectively. In addition, our results suggest that the disparity between MI and PM could be stronger in the stroke patients compared to the healthy subjects, and there would be thus an increased need to use the proposed FB-DSA algorithm in BCI-based stroke rehabilitation calibrated from PM.

It is a championship for severely motor impaired people using assistive prototype devices to compete against each other. Our team, the Graz BCI Racing Team MIRAGE91 from Graz University of Technology, participated in the discipline "Brain-Computer Interface Race". A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a device facilitating control of applications via the user's thoughts. Prominent applications include assistive technology such as wheelchairs, neuroprostheses or communication devices. In the CYBATHLON BCI Race, pilots compete in a BCI-controlled computer game. Methods: We report on setting up our team, the BCI customization to our pilot including long term training and the final BCI system. Furthermore, we describe CYBATHLON participation and analyze our CYBATHLON result. Results: We found that our pilot was compliant over the whole time and that we could significantly reduce the average runtime between start and finish from initially 178 s to 143 s. After the release of the final championship specifications with shorter track length, the average runtime converged to 120 s. We successfully participated in the qualification race at CYBATHLON 2016, but performed notably worse than during training, with a runtime of 196 s. Discussion: We speculate that shifts in the features, due to the nonstationarities in the electroencephalogram (EEG), but also arousal are possible reasons for the unexpected result. Potential counteracting measures are discussed. Conclusions: The CYBATHLON 2016 was a great opportunity for our student team. We consolidated our theoretical knowledge and turned it into practice, allowing our pilot to play a computer game. However, further research is required to make BCI technology invariant to non-task related changes of the EEG.

Challenges remain in offering real-time solutions with such technology because of the immediacy of electrographic ictal behavior. The nonstationary nature of electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals results in wide variation of both normal and ictal patterns among patients. The use of manually extracted features in a prediction task is impractical and the large amount of data generated even among a limited set of electrode contacts will create significant processing delays. Big data in such circumstances not only must allow for safe storage but provide high computational resources for recognition, capture and real-time processing of the preictal period in order to execute the timely abrogation of the ictal event. By leveraging the potential of cloud computing and deep learning, we develop and deploy BCI seizure prediction and localization from scalp EEG and ECoG big data. First, a new method for epileptic seizure prediction and localization of the seizure focus is presented. Second, an extended optimization approach on existing deep-learning structures, Stacked Auto-encoder and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is proposed based on principle component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and Differential Search Algorithm (DSA). Third, a cloud-computing solution (i.e., Internet of Things (IoT)), is developed to define the proposed structures for real-time processing, automatic computing and storage of big data. The ECoG clinical datasets on 11 patients illustrate the superiority of the proposed patient-specific BCI as an alternative to current methodology to offer support for patients with intractable focal epilepsy.

A comparative study of three systems for quantifying the spike and wave index in patients with continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep	REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA			Spanish	Article						Cognitive impairment.; Continuous spikes and waves during sleep; CSWS; Electrical status epilepticus during sleep; Electroencephalography; Epileptic encephalopathy; Sleep	ELECTRICAL STATUS EPILEPTICUS; ESES; ENCEPHALOPATHY; SPECTRUM; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; LEVETIRACETAM; EPILEPSIES; DISORDERS; CHILDREN	Introduction. Continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep (CSWS) is an epileptic encephalopathy of childhood with a pattern of epileptiform discharges during sleep, which, if prolonged over time, produce severe neuropsychological impairment. Quantification of the paroxysms by means of a spike and wave index (SWI) > 85% establishes a presumptive diagnosis and allows early therapy to be started to prevent such impairment. Aims. To compare the results of the classic method for calculating the SWI against two proposals that optimise the relation between the analysis time employed and the diagnostic sensitivity. Patients and methods. The nocturnal electroencephalographic registers of 17 patients with CSWS were studied. Two observers calculated the SWI with the classic method, as well as with two other methods, M2 and M3, first in the active phase and then in the remission phase. The time required by each method, the individual SWI values and the agreement between methods and observers were compared. Results. With M3 two of the patients failed to reach the cut-off point of SWI > 85%. Agreement in the active phase of CSWS after M2 and M3 was 0.762 and 0.704, respectively, while in the remission phase it was 0.951 and 0.830. Interobserver agreement exceeded 0.905 in all cases. Conclusions. The two abbreviated methods can be used in both the active and the remission phases, with a substantial reduction in the analysis time that is needed. Our results support the current tendency to consider SWI > 60% as suggestive of CSWS. Method M2 yields results that are closer to those of the classic method than those of M3.

Usability Comparison of Conventional Direct Control Versus Pattern Recognition Control of Transradial Prostheses	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Biomedical signal; Human factors; Man-machine systems; prosthetics	SUBJECTIVE MEASURES; MENTAL WORKLOAD; HEART-RATE; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGY; HAND	The goal of this study was to compare the usability of two control schemes for a transradial myoelectric prosthesis, including conventional direct control (DC) and pattern recognition (PR) control, when used by able-bodied individuals. Three types of response measures were captured to assess the control schemes, including learnability, performance, and cognitive workload. Prior research has applied performance and cognitive workload metrics for evaluation of prosthetics; however, workload measures applied in these studies (e.g., heart rate, electroencephalography, and respiration rate) have many limitations. This study used eye tracking to compare cognitive load implications of the different control schemes for a two degrees-of-freedom myoelectric prosthesis. In total, 12 participants were assigned to either control condition (six persons each) or perform a clothespin relocation task. Results revealed the PR scheme to be more intuitive for users and superior to DC across all response measures. We observed a lower learning percentage (i.e., greater learning potential), lower cognitive load, and greater productivity in task performance. This preliminary study illustrates efficacy of using eye-tracking-based measures of cognitive load and standardize test paradigms for assessment of upper limb prosthetic usability and supports PR prosthetic device control as an intuitive alternative to DC.

AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE FROM SHORT-TERM 12 LEAD ELECTROCARDIOGRAM SIGNALS BY USING WAVELET PACKET DECOMPOSITION AND COMMON SPATIAL PATTERN TECHNIQUES	JOURNAL OF MECHANICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Coronary artery disease; electrocardiogram; wavelet packet decomposition; common spatial patterns; classifier	TRIAL EEG CLASSIFICATION; RATE-VARIABILITY SIGNALS; FATTY LIVER-DISEASE; EMPIRICAL MODE; TRANSFORM; DIAGNOSIS; INDEX; FEATURES; ALGORITHM	The occlusion of the coronary arteries commonly known as coronary artery disease (CAD) restricts the normal blood circulation required to the heart muscles, thus results in an irreversible myocardial damage or death (myocardial infarction). Clinically, electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed as a primary diagnostic tool to capture these cardiac activities and detect the presence of CAD. However, the use of computer-aided techniques can reduce the visual burden and manual time required for the analysis of complex ECG signals in order to identify the CAD affected subjects from normal ones. Therefore, in this study, a novel computer-aided technique is proposed using 2 s of 12 lead ECG signals for the identification of CAD affected patients. Each of the 2 s 12 lead ECG signal beats (3791 normal and 12308 CAD ECG signal beats) are implemented with four levels of wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) to obtain various coefficients. Using the fourth-level coefficients obtained for each lead ECG signal beat, new 2 s. ECG signal beats are reconstructed. Later, the reconstructed signals are split into twofold data sets, in which one set is used for acquiring common spatial pattern (CSP) filter and the other for obtaining features vector (vice versa). The obtained features are one by one fed into k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier for automated classification. The proposed system yielded maximum average classification results of 99.65% accuracy, 99.64% sensitivity and 99.7% specificity using 10 features. Our proposed algorithm is highly efficient and can be used by the clinicians as an aiding system in their CAD diagnosis, thus, assisting in faster treatment and avoiding the progression of CAD condition.

In this paper, we propose and test a number of convolutional neural network (CNN) structures to identify and classify single-trial P300 in electroencephalogram (EEG) readings of an auditory BCI. The recorded data correspond to nine subjects in a series of experiment sessions in which auditory stimuli following the oddball paradigm were presented via earphones from six different virtual directions at time intervals of 200, 300, 400 and 500 ms. Using three different approaches for the pooling process, we report the average accuracy for 18 CNN structures. The results obtained for most of the CNN models show clear improvement over past studies in similar contexts, as well as over other commonly-used classifiers. We found that the models that consider data from the time and space domains and those that overlap in the pooling process usually offer better results regardless of the number of layers. Additionally, patterns of improvement with single-layered CNN models can be observed.

As the knee motor execution (ME) and motor imagery (MI) reflect the user's voluntary physical and imagination state of knee extension respectively, they have been analyzed in order to be used as control signals to restore motor function with neuroplasticity for BCI applications. This reactivity has been evaluated using the quantification of event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) patterns. Investigations on the cortical lateralization of ERD/ ERS during the left and right knee MI and ME for the extension task was done. During left and right knee MI, the foot area mu rhythm was desynchronized in all subjects, whereas no enhancement of the hand area mu rhythm was observed during any task. The frequency of the most reactive components for mu rhythm was 8.8 +/- 0.5 Hz. Interestingly a contralateral dominance was visible at a central electrode position, during left knee extension MI task. This lead to the establishment of an understanding of the left-right knee MI and its associated cognitive behavior.

Although ADHD was discovered at the beginning of the 20th century, its diagnosis is still confronted with many problems.& para;& para;Method: A novel classification approach that discriminates ADHD and nonADHD groups over the time-frequency domain features of event-related potential (ERP) recordings that are taken during Stroop task is presented. Time-Frequency Hermite-Atomizer (TFHA) technique is used for the extraction of high resolution time-frequency domain features that are highly localized in time-frequency domain.

J	Ertugrul, OF; Kaya, Y				Ertugrul, Omer Faruk; Kaya, Yilmaz			Determining the optimal number of body-worn sensors for human activity recognition	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Sensor reduction; Activity recognition; Local binary patterns; Grey relational analysis; Wearable sensors	EPILEPTIC EEG; MULTISENSOR; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEM	Recent developments in sensors increased the importance of action recognition. Generally, the previous studies were based on the assumption that the complex actions can be recognized by more features. Therefore, generally more than required body-worn sensor types and sensor nodes were used by the researchers. On the other hand, this assumption leads many drawbacks, such as computational complexity, storage and communication requirements. The main aim of this paper is to investigate the applicability of recognizing the actions without degrading the accuracy with less number of sensors by using a more sophisticated feature extraction and classification method. Since, human activities are complex and include variable temporal information in nature, in this study one-dimensional local binary pattern, which is sensitive to local changes, and the grey relational analysis, which can successfully classify incomplete or insufficient datasets, were employed for feature extraction and classification purposes, respectively. Achieved mean classification accuracies by the proposed approach are 95.69, 98.88, and 99.08 % while utilizing all data, data obtained from a sensor node attached to left calf and data obtained from only 3D gyro sensors, respectively. Furthermore, the results of this study showed that the accuracy obtained by using only a 3D acceleration sensor attached in the left calf, 98.8 %, is higher than accuracy obtained by using all sensor nodes, 95.69 %, and reported accuracies in the previous studies that made use of the same dataset. This result highlighted that the position and type of sensors are much more important than the number of utilized sensors.

Spectral Electroencephalogram Analysis for the Evaluation of Encephalopathy Grade in Children With Acute Liver Failure	PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						acute liver failure; electroencephalography; encephalopathy	AMPLITUDE-INTEGRATED EEG; HEPATIC-ENCEPHALOPATHY; NEONATAL SEIZURES; L-CARNITINE; SYSTEM	Objective: Spectral electroencephalogram analysis is a method for automated analysis of electroencephalogram patterns, which can be performed at the bedside. We sought to determine the utility of spectral electroencephalogram for grading hepatic encephalopathy in children with acute liver failure. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Tertiary care pediatric hospital. Patients: Patients between 0 and 18 years old who presented with acute liver failure and were admitted to the PICU. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Electroencephalograms were analyzed by spectral analysis including total power, relative delta, relative theta, relative alpha, relative beta, theta-to-Delta ratio, and alpha-to-Delta ratio. Normal values and ranges were first derived using normal electroencephalograms from 70 children of 0-18 years old. Age had a significant effect on each variable measured (p < 0.03). Electroencephalograms from 33 patients with acute liver failure were available for spectral analysis. The median age was 4.3 years, 14 of 33 were male, and the majority had an indeterminate etiology of acute liver failure. Neuroimaging was performed in 26 cases and was normal in 20 cases (77%). The majority (64%) survived, and 82% had a good outcome with a score of 1-3 on the Pediatric Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended at the time of discharge. Hepatic encephalopathy grade correlated with the qualitative visual electroencephalogram scores assigned by blinded neurophysiologists (r(s) = 0.493; p < 0.006). Spectral electroencephalogram characteristics varied significantly with the qualitative electroencephalogram classification (p < 0.05). Spectral electroencephalogram variables including relative Delta, relative theta, relative alpha, theta-to-Delta ratio, and alpha-to-Delta ratio all significantly varied with the qualitative electroencephalogram (p < 0.025). Moderate to severe hepatic encephalopathy was correlated with a total power of less than or equal to 50% of normal for children 0-3 years old, and with a relative. of less than or equal to 50% normal for children more than 3 years old (p > 0.05). Spectral electroencephalogram classification correlated with outcome (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Spectral electroencephalogram analysis can be used to evaluate even young patients for hepatic encephalopathy and correlates with outcome. Spectral electroencephalogram may allow improved quantitative and reproducible assessment of hepatic encephalopathy grade in children with acute liver failure.

We proposed a novel simultaneous hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) by incorporating electrical stimulation into a motor imagery (MI) based BCI system. The goal of this study was to enhance the overall performance of an MI-based BCI. In addition, the brain oscillatory pattern in the hybrid task was also investigated. Approach. 64-channel electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded during MI, selective attention (SA) and hybrid tasks in fourteen healthy subjects. In the hybrid task, subjects performed MI with electrical stimulation which was applied to bilateral median nerve on wrists simultaneously. Main results. The hybrid task clearly presented additional steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP) induced by electrical stimulation with MI-induced event-related desynchronization (ERD). By combining ERD and SSSEP features, the performance in the hybrid task was significantly better than in both MI and SA tasks, achieving a similar to 14% improvement in total relative to the MI task alone and reaching similar to 89% in mean classification accuracy. On the contrary, there was no significant enhancement obtained in performance while separate ERD feature was utilized in the hybrid task. In terms of the hybrid task, the performance using combined feature was significantly better than using separate ERD or SSSEP feature. Significance. The results in this work validate the feasibility of our proposed approach to form a novel MI-SSSEP hybrid BCI outperforming a conventional MI-based BCI through combing MI with electrical stimulation.

However, all the current commercially available exoskeletons require good upper limb function to operate them effectively. This limits their use for people with higher-level impairments, such as tetraplegia. In this paper we investigate the possibility of being able to decode from the user's brain signals, their intention to perform various actions, including standing up and walking, with a view to eventually controlling an exoskeleton with a brain-computer interface. As such, we present some preliminary results that show statistically significant changes in Mu band power, when preparing to execute movements and during the execution of movements.

J	Batula, AM; Kim, YE; Ayaz, H				Batula, Alyssa M.; Kim, Youngmoo E.; Ayaz, Hasan			Virtual and Actual Humanoid Robot Control with Four-Class Motor-Imagery-Based Optical Brain-Computer Interface	BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; CLASSIFICATION; MACHINE; EXECUTION; SIGNALS; TASK	Motor-imagery tasks are a popular input method for controlling brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), partially due to their similarities to naturally produced motor signals. The use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in BCIs is still emerging and has shown potential as a supplement or replacement for electroencephalography. However, studies often use only two or three motorimagery tasks, limiting the number of available commands. In thiswork, we present the results of the first four-class motor-imagerybased online fNIRS-BCI for robot control. Thirteen participants utilized upper-and lower-limb motor-imagery tasks (left hand, right hand, left foot, and right foot) that were mapped to four high-level commands (turn left, turn right, move forward, and move backward) to control the navigation of a simulated or real robot. A significant improvement in classification accuracy was found between the virtual-robot-based BCI (control of a virtual robot) and the physical-robot BCI (control of the DARwIn-OP humanoid robot). Differences were also found in the oxygenated hemoglobin activation patterns of the four tasks between the first and second BCI. These results corroborate previous findings that motor imagery can be improved with feedback and imply that a four-class motor-imagery-based fNIRS-BCI could be feasible with sufficient subject training.

Convolutional neural networks for event-related potential detection: impact of the architecture	2017 39TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY		English	Proceedings Paper	39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 11-15, 2017	SOUTH KOREA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, PubMed, MEDLINE, Korean Soc Med & Biol Engn			CLASSIFICATION	The detection of brain responses at the single-trial level in the electroencephalogram (EEG) such as event-related potentials (ERPs) is a difficult problem that requires different processing steps to extract relevant discriminant features. While most of the signal and classification techniques for the detection of brain responses are based on linear algebra, different pattern recognition techniques such as convolutional neural network (CNN), as a type of deep learning technique, have shown some interests as they are able to process the signal after limited pre-processing. In this study, we propose to investigate the performance of CNNs in relation of their architecture and in relation to how they are evaluated: a single system for each subject, or a system for all the subjects. More particularly, we want to address the change of performance that can be observed between specifying a neural network to a subject, or by considering a neural network for a group of subjects, taking advantage of a larger number of trials from different subjects. The results support the conclusion that a convolutional neural network trained on different subjects can lead to an AUC above 0.9 by using an appropriate architecture using spatial filtering and shift invariant layers.

The classification problems arising in such application usually involve a relatively small number of high-dimensional patterns and, as curse of dimensionality issues have to be taken into account, feature selection is an important requirement to build suitable classifiers. As the number of features defining the search space is high, the distribution of the searching space among different processors would contribute to find better solutions, requiring similar or even smaller amount of execution time than sequential counterpart procedures. We have implemented a parallel evolutionary multiobjective optimization procedure for feature selection, based on the island model, in which the individuals are distributed among different subpopulations that independently evolve and interchange individuals after a given number of generations. The experimental results show improvements in both computing time and quality of EEG classification with features extracted by multiresolution analysis (MRA), an approach widely used in the BCI field with useful properties for both temporal and spectral signal analysis.

Specifically, we show that BCI technology can be used to learn personalized decoding models that relate the global configuration of brain rhythms in individual subjects (as measured by EEG) to their motor performance during 3D reaching movements. We demonstrate that our models capture substantial across-subject heterogeneity, and argue that this heterogeneity is a likely cause of limited effect sizes observed in TES for enhancing motor performance. We conclude by discussing how our personalized models can be used to derive optimal TES parameters, e.g., stimulation site and frequency, for individual patients.

Due to the high trail-to-trial variability and low signal-to-noise ratio caused by volume conduction, analyzing brain states corresponding to ERP on a single trial is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient method for ERP feature extraction, termed spatial filtering and temporal down-sampling (SFTDS). The spatial filters and the temporal down-sampling weight vectors can be optimized under a single objective function by SFTDS. Experiments on real P300 data from 10 subjects show the superiority of SFTDS over other algorithms.

Modern hearing aids can suppress background noise; however, there is little that can be done to help a user attend to a single conversation without knowing which speaker is being attended to. Cognitively controlled hearing aids that use auditory attention decoding (AAD) methods are the next step in offering help. A number of challenges exist, including the lack of access to the clean sound sources in the environment with which to compare with the neural signals. We propose a novel framework that combines single-channel speech separation algorithms with AAD. We present an end-to-end system that 1) receives a single audio channel containing a mixture of speakers that is heard by a listener along with the listener's neural signals, 2) automatically separates the individual speakers in the mixture, 3) determines the attended speaker, and 4) amplifies the attended speaker's voice to assist the listener. Using invasive electrophysiology recordings, our system is able to decode the attention of a subject and detect switches in attention using only the mixed audio. We also identified the regions of the auditory cortex that contribute to AAD. Our quality assessment of the modified audio demonstrates a significant improvement in both subjective and objective speech quality measures. Our novel framework for AAD bridges the gap between the most recent advancements in speech processing technologies and speech prosthesis research and moves us closer to the development of cognitively controlled hearing aids.

Automated analysis of brain activity for seizure detection in zebrafish models of epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Local field potential (LFP); Epilepsy; Zebrafish larvae; Animal model; Seizure detection; Automated analysis; SVM; Classification; Machine learning	EEG; MULTICHANNEL	Background: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition, with over 30% of cases unresponsive to treatment. Zebrafish larvae show great potential to serve as an animal model of epilepsy in drug discovery. Thanks to their high fecundity and relatively low cost, they are amenable to high-throughput screening. However, the assessment of seizure occurrences in zebrafish larvae remains a bottleneck, as visual analysis is subjective and time-consuming. New method: For the first time, we present an automated algorithm to detect epileptic discharges in single-channel local field potential (LFP) recordings in zebrafish. First, candidate seizure segments are selected based on their energy and length. Afterwards, discriminative features are extracted from each segment. Using a labeled dataset, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained to learn an optimal feature mapping. Finally, this SVM classifier is used to detect seizure segments in new signals. Results: We tested the proposed algorithm both in a chemically-induced seizure model and a genetic epilepsy model. In both cases, the algorithm delivered similar results to visual analysis and found a significant difference in number of seizures between the epileptic and control group. Comparison with existing methods: Direct comparison with multichannel techniques or methods developed for different animal models is not feasible. Nevertheless, a literature review shows that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy, precision and specificity, while maintaining a reasonable sensitivity. Conclusion: Our seizure detection system is a generic, time-saving and objective method to analyze zebrafish LPF, which can replace visual analysis and facilitate true high-throughput studies.

A novel approach for time-frequency localization of scaling functions and design of three-band biorthogonal linear phase wavelet filter banks	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Time-frequency localization; Three-band wavelet filter bank; Discrete Fourier transform; Discrete time Fourier transform; Prolate spheroid sequence	INTRINSIC MODE FUNCTIONS; EEG SIGNALS; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE; VANISHING MOMENTS; FOURIER-ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; TRANSFORM; DIAGNOSIS; PATTERNS	Design of time-frequency localized filters and functions is a classical subject in the field of signal processing. Gabor's uncertainty principle states that a function cannot be localized in time and frequency domain simultaneously and there exists a nonzero lower bound of 0.25 on the product of its time variance and frequency variance called time-frequency product (TFP). Using arithmetic mean (AM) geometric mean (GM) inequality, product of variances and sum of variances can be related and it can be shown that sum of variances has lower bound of one. In this paper, we compute the frequency variance of the filter from its discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and propose an equivalent summation based discrete-time uncertainty principle which has the lower bound of one. We evaluate the performance of the proposed discrete-time time-frequency uncertainty measure in multiresolution setting and show that the proposed DFT based concentration measure generate sequences which are even more localized in time and frequency domain than that obtained from the Slepian, Ishii and Furukawa's concentration measures. The proposed design approach provides the flexibility in which the TFP can be made arbitrarily close to the lowest possible lower bound of 0.25 by increasing the length of the filter. In the other proposed approach, the sum of the time variance and frequency variance is used to formulate a positive definite matrix to measure the time-frequency joint localization of a bandlimited function from its samples. We design the time-frequency localized bandlimited low pass scaling and band pass wavelet functions using the eigenvectors of the formulated positive definite matrix. The samples of the time frequency localized bandlimited function are obtained from the eigenvector of the positive definite matrix corresponding to its minimum eigenvalue. The TFP of the designed bandlimited scaling and wavelet functions are close to the lowest possible lower bound of 0.25 and 2.25 respectively. We propose a design method for time-frequency localized three-band biorthogonal linear phase (BOLP) wavelet perfect reconstruction filter bank (PRFB) wherein the free parameters can be optimized for time-frequency localization of the synthesis basis functions for the specified frequency variance of the analysis scaling function. The performance of the designed filter bank is evaluated in classification of seizure and seizure free electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. It is found that the proposed filter bank outperforms other existing methods for the classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

By utilizing our unique test facility, we conduct a series of real-world-scenario-inspired tasks in which subjects are asked to guide a group of ground robots with various configurations to arrive at a sequence of randomly assigned targets. A range of neurophysiological and behavioral sensors are used to measure how cognitive states, e.g., cognitive load, behaviors, e.g., gazes, and performances, e.g., success rate, of human performs unfold in real time as the tasks evolve. Through an analysis of changes in gaze and cognitive load, we gain a wider understanding of the mechanisms of task failure; most notably the difficulty of estimating the complete state of the robotic group. The results of this study can help to inform the design of efficient interaction policies which can maximize task effectiveness between humans and robot swarms.

A common scenario of machine learning based brain computer interface (BCI) is class wise accuracy is different from overall accuracy. Accuracy for one class is worse than overall accuracy. Because, error rates of all classes are not converging in same rate during training of learner. Active class selection (ACS) can be a solution to non-uniform converging of error rates for different classes. ACS determines the class-wise proportion of samples in training set based on empirical error. One of the ACS methods is inverse proportion. It implies that class proportion is inverse of class accuracy. Entropy of unlabeled samples is an active learning (AL) approach of finding the most informative samples. The intuition of this work is to feed the learner with most informative samples maintaining the class proportion given by inverse ACS method. Following this idea, an improved weighted inverse ACS method is developed and combined with AL query concept for BCI. This proposed weighted informative inverse active class selection method has been applied on BCI competition IV motor imagery (MI) binary class data set 2B. It shows better or similar performance on most of the subjects with less amount of training samples. So, this method gives us a way of performance improvement as well as reduction of training samples in BCI.

However, because their size grows quadratically with respect to the number of variables, high-dimensionality can pose a difficulty when working with them. So, it may be advantageous to apply to them dimensionality reduction techniques. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a canonical tool for dimensionality reduction, which for vector data maximizes the preserved variance. Yet, the commonly used, naive extensions of PCA to matrices result in sub-optimal variance retention. Moreover, when applied to SPD matrices, they ignore the geometric structure of the space of SPD matrices, further degrading the performance. In this paper we develop a new Riemannian geometry based formulation of PCA for SPD matrices that (1) preserves more data variance by appropriately extending PCA to matrix data, and (2) extends the standard definition from the Euclidean to the Riemannian geometries. We experimentally demonstrate the usefulness of our approach as pre-processing for EEG signals and for texture image classification.

The recent positive results were gained for a treatment of the post-stroke impairments, the Parkinson disease, the pain syndrome, the tinnitus, the alcohol and nicotine abuse, the major depression, and phobias of contamination and spiders. The intervention was found to be less promising for schizophrenia and nearly ineffective for the criminal antisocial personality disorder. The reliability of the results is mostly poor due to suboptimal study designs, lack of the control groups, and insufficient sample sizes.

P300-Based Brain-Computer Interface Channel Selection using Swarm Intelligence	REVISTA IBEROAMERICANA DE AUTOMATICA E INFORMATICA INDUSTRIAL			Spanish	Article						Interfaces; machine learning; biomedical systems; optimization and computational methods; electroencephalography; communication systems	COLONY OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; BCI-COMPETITION-III; COMMUNICATION	Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) are direct communication pathways between the brain and the environment that translate certain features, which correspond to users' intentions, into device control commands. Channel selection in BCI systems is essential to avoid over-fitting, to reduce the computational cost and to increase the users' comfort. Although several algorithms have previously developed for that purpose, metaheuristics based on swarm intelligence have not been exploited yet in P300-based BCI systems. In this study, a comparative among five different swarm methods, based on the behavior of biological systems, is shown. Those methods have been applied in order to optimize the channel selection procedure in this kind of systems, and have been tested with the 'III BCI Competition 2005' database II. Results show that the five methods can achieve similar or even higher accuracies than that obtained without performing any channel selection procedure. Owing to the fact that all the applied methods are able to drastically reduce the required number of channels without compromising the system performance, as well as to overcome the common 8-channel set and the backward elimination algorithm, we conclude that all of them are suitable for use in the P300-BCI systems channel selection procedure.

A simple and efficient algorithm operating with linear time for MCEEG data compression	AUSTRALASIAN PHYSICAL & ENGINEERING SCIENCES IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Inverse logarithmic translation (ILT) transform; Integer fraction coder (IFC); Integer fraction decoder (IFD); Pseudo integer (PI); Translated logarithmic (TL) transform	LOSSLESS COMPRESSION; EEG SIGNALS; COMPONENTS; IMAGE	Popularisation of electroencephalograph (EEG) signals in diversified fields have increased the need for devices capable of operating at lower power and storage requirements. This has led to a great deal of research in data compression, that can address (a) low latency in the coding of the signal, (b) reduced hardware and software dependencies, (c) quantify the system anomalies, and (d) effectively reconstruct the compressed signal. This paper proposes a computationally simple and novel coding scheme named spatial pseudo codec (SPC), to achieve lossy to near lossless compression of multichannel EEG (MCEEG). In the proposed system, MCEEG signals are initially normalized, followed by two parallel processes: one operating on integer part and the other, on fractional part of the normalized data. The redundancies in integer part are exploited using spatial domain encoder, and the fractional part is coded as pseudo integers. The proposed method has been tested on a wide range of databases having variable sampling rates and resolutions. Results indicate that the algorithm has a good recovery performance with an average percentage root mean square deviation (PRD) of 2.72 for an average compression ratio (CR) of 3.16. Furthermore, the algorithm has a complexity of only O(n) with an average encoding and decoding time per sample of 0.3 ms and 0.04 ms respectively. The performance of the algorithm is comparable with recent methods like fast discrete cosine transform (fDCT) and tensor decomposition methods. The results validated the feasibility of the proposed compression scheme for practical MCEEG recording, archiving and brain computer interfacing systems.	[Titus, Geevarghese; Sudhakar, M.

Such information can potentially be exploited to make devices and interfacesmore user aware. In this line of research, we took a further step by studying neural correlates of different levels of cognitive processes and developing a method that allows to quantify how deeply presented information is processed in the brain. Methods/Approach : Seventeen participants took part in an EEG study in which we evaluated different levels of cognitive processing (no processing, shallow, and deep processing) within three distinct domains (memory, language, and visual imagination). Our investigations showed gradual differences in the amplitudes of event-related potentials (ERPs) and in the extend and duration of event-related desynchronization (ERD) which both correlate with task difficulty. We performed multi-modal classification to map the measured correlates of neurocognitive processing to the corresponding level of processing. Results : Successful classification of the neural components was achieved, which reflects the level of cognitive processing performed by the participants. The results show performances above chance level for each participant and a mean performance of 70-90% for all conditions and classification pairs. Significance : The successful estimation of the level of cognition on a single-trial basis supports the feasibility of user-state adaptation based on ongoing neural activity. There is a variety of potential use cases such as: a user-friendly adaptive design of an interface or the development of assistance systems in safety critical workplaces.

Classification of Movement and Inhibition Using a Hybrid BCI	FRONTIERS IN NEUROROBOTICS			English	Article						inhibition; brain computer interface; motor imagery (MI); event-related potentials (ERPs); machine learning	RESPONSE-INHIBITION; EEG	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are an emerging technology that are capable of turning brain electrical activity into commands for an external device. Motor imagery (MI)-when a person imagines a motion without executing it-is widely employed in BCI devices for motor control because of the endogenous origin of its neural control mechanisms, and the similarity in brain activation to actual movements. Challenges with translating a MI-BCI into a practical device used outside laboratories include the extensive training required, often due to poor user engagement and visual feedback response delays; poor user flexibility/freedom to time the execution/inhibition of their movements, and to control the movement type (right arm vs. left leg) and characteristics (reaching vs. grabbing); and high false positive rates of motion control. Solutions to improve sensorimotor activation and user performance of MI-BCIs have been explored. Virtual reality (VR) motor-execution tasks have replaced simpler visual feedback (smiling faces, arrows) and have solved this problem to an extent. Hybrid BCIs (hBCIs) implementing an additional control signal to MI have improved user control capabilities to a limited extent. These hBCIs either fail to allow the patients to gain asynchronous control of their movements, or have a high false positive rate. We propose an immersive VR environment which provides visual feedback that is both engaging and immediate, but also uniquely engages a different cognitive process in the patient that generates event-related potentials (ERPs). These ERPs provide a key executive function for the users to execute/inhibit movements. Additionally, we propose signal processing strategies and machine learning algorithms to move BCIs toward developing long-term signal stability in patients with distinctive brain signals and capabilities to control motor signals. The hBCI itself and the VR environment we propose would help to move BCI technology outside laboratory environments for motor rehabilitation in hospitals, and potentially for controlling a prosthetic.

We hypothesized that sleep stage dissociations can be objectively detected through the analysis of nocturnal Polysomnography (PSG) data, and that those affecting REM sleep can be used as a diagnostic feature for narcolepsy. New method: A Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model using 38 features extracted from EOG, EMG and EEG was used in control subjects to select features differentiating wake, stage N1, N2, N3 and REM sleep. Sleep stage differentiation was next represented in a 2D projection. Features characteristic of sleep stage differences were estimated from the residual sleep stage probability in the 2D space. Using this model we evaluated PSG data from NT1 and non-narcoleptic subjects. An LDA classifier was used to determine the best separation plane. Comparison with existing methods: This method replicates the specificity/sensitivity from the training set to the validation set better than many other methods. Results: Eight prominent features could differentiate narcolepsy and controls in the validation dataset. Using a composite measure and a specificity cut off 95% in the training dataset, sensitivity was 43%. Specificity/sensitivity was 94%/38% in the validation set. Using hypersomnia subjects, specificity/sensitivity was 84%/15%. Analyzing treated narcoleptics the specificity/sensitivity was 94%/10%. Conclusion: Sleep stage dissociation can be used for the diagnosis of narcolepsy. However the use of some medications and presence of undiagnosed hypersomnolence patients impacts the result.

People who suffer from hearing impairments can find it difficult to follow a conversation in a multi-speaker environment. Current hearing aids can suppress background noise; however, there is little that can be done to help a user attend to a single conversation amongst many without knowing which speaker the user is attending to. Cognitively controlled hearing aids that use auditory attention decoding (AAD) methods are the next step in offering help. Translating the successes in AAD research to real-world applications poses a number of challenges, including the lack of access to the clean sound sources in the environment with which to compare with the neural signals. We propose a novel framework that combines single-channel speech separation algorithms with AAD. Approach. We present an end-to-end system that (1) receives a single audio channel containing a mixture of speakers that is heard by a listener along with the listener's neural signals, (2) automatically separates the individual speakers in the mixture, (3) determines the attended speaker, and (4) amplifies the attended speaker's voice to assist the listener. Main results. Using invasive electrophysiology recordings, we identified the regions of the auditory cortex that contribute to AAD. Given appropriate electrode locations, our system is able to decode the attention of subjects and amplify the attended speaker using only the mixed audio. Our quality assessment of the modified audio demonstrates a significant improvement in both subjective and objective speech quality measures. Significance. Our novel framework for AAD bridges the gap between the most recent advancements in speech processing technologies and speech prosthesis research and moves us closer to the development of cognitively controlled hearable devices for the hearing impaired.

The intention of our study was to investigate postoperative clinical and epileptological outcome in adults who received FH for intractable epilepsy. Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 12 adult patients (18-56 years) with intractable epilepsy due to unihemispheric pathology. All patients underwent FH. Postoperative neurological and cognitive outcome as well as seizure status were evaluated with a mean follow-up period of 4.9 years. Results: Ten patients (83%) were seizure-free (Engel I), and two (17%) had recurrent seizures at last follow-up. Apart from one patient requiring operative revision for bone flap infection, no perioperative morbidity or mortality occurred. Postoperative functional assessment revealed deterioration of motor function in 7 patients, whereas 5 remained unchanged. Language was unchanged in 8 patients. The absence of background slowing in preoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) as well as ictal and interictal EEG patterns located ipsilateral to the side of surgery was associated with favorable seizure outcome. Conclusion: Favorable seizure control and acceptable functional outcome can be achieved by FH in adults with intractable epilepsy. The risk of postoperative deficits is moderate and even older patients are able to manage postoperative motor impairment. Therefore, FH should be considered in case of unihemispheric lesions also in adults. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

This integration can be applied to early prediction and prevention of disease, therefore promoting the shifting of disease care tradition to the healthcare paradigm. In this chapter, we summarize the physiological signals which can be detected by wearable sensors, the sharing of the physiological big data, and the mining methods for the discovery of disease-associated patterns for personalized diagnosis and treatment. We discuss the challenges of physiological informatics about the storage, the standardization, the analyses, and the applications of the physiological data from the wearable sensors and smartphone. At last, we present our perspectives on the models for disentangling the complex relationship between early disease prediction and the mining of physiological phenotype data.

Optimizing the stimulus presentation paradigm design for the P300-based brain-computer interface using performance prediction	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface; P300 speller; stimulus presentation paradigm; information theory; combinatorial problem; performance prediction; dynamic stopping	BCI; INTERVAL; MODEL	Objective. The role of a brain-computer interface (BCI) is to discern a user's intended message or action by extracting and decoding relevant information from brain signals. Stimulus-driven BCIs, such as the P300 speller, rely on detecting event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to a user attending to relevant or target stimulus events. However, this process is error-prone because the ERPs are embedded in noisy electroencephalography (EEG) data, representing a fundamental problem in communication of the uncertainty in the information that is received during noisy transmission. A BCI can be modeled as a noisy communication system and an information-theoretic approach can be exploited to design a stimulus presentation paradigm to maximize the information content that is presented to the user. However, previous methods that focused on designing error-correcting codes failed to provide significant performance improvements due to underestimating the effects of psycho-physiological factors on the P300 ERP elicitation process and a limited ability to predict online performance with their proposed methods. Maximizing the information rate favors the selection of stimulus presentation patterns with increased target presentation frequency, which exacerbates refractory effects and negatively impacts performance within the context of an oddball paradigm. An information-theoretic approach that seeks to understand the fundamental trade-off between information rate and reliability is desirable. Approach. We developed a performance-based paradigm (PBP) by tuning specific parameters of the stimulus presentation paradigm to maximize performance while minimizing refractory effects. We used a probabilistic-based performance prediction method as an evaluation criterion to select a final configuration of the PBP. Main results. With our PBP, we demonstrate statistically significant improvements in online performance, both in accuracy and spelling rate, compared to the conventional row-column paradigm. Significance. By accounting for refractory effects, an information-theoretic approach can be exploited to significantly improve BCI performance across a wide range of performance levels.	[Mainsah, B.

Prior studies demonstrate focal, neocortical epilepsy is associated with dysfunction, several hours before seizures. How does the epileptic network perpetuate dysfunction during baseline periods? To address this question, we developed an unsupervised machine learning technique to disentangle patterns of functional interactions between brain regions, or subgraphs, from dynamic functional networks constructed from approximately 100 h of intracranial recordings in each of 22 neocortical epilepsy patients. Using this approach, we found: (1) subgraphs from ictal (seizure) and interictal (baseline) epochs are topologically similar, (2) interictal subgraph topology and dynamics can predict brain regions that generate seizures, and (3) subgraphs undergo slower and more coordinated fluctuations during ictal epochs compared to interictal epochs. Our observations suggest that seizures mark a critical shift away from interictal states that is driven by changes in the dynamical expression of strongly interacting components of the epileptic network.

Segments of ECG signals are fed into dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) to generate frequency sub-bands. Three statistical moment parameters are then developed from the DT-CWT outputs. The suitability of these statistical moments in distinguishing normal and apneic ECG signals is investigated through extensive analyses. The overall algorithmic detection accuracy of the scheme is determined for various machine learning classifiers. Sleep apnea classification is done using logistic boosting (LogitBoost). Until now this is for the first time LogitBoost has been implemented for automated sleep apnea detection. We also performed cross validation for classification model evaluation and optimal parameter selection. Results suggest that the detection accuracy of the apnea screening scheme presented in this work is comparable to extant sleep apnea screening systems of the literature. It can be anticipated that upon its implementation, the detection scheme proposed in this work will take us one step closer to sleep apnea monitoring device implementation and eradicate the onus of the physicians.

Increasing number of research activities improves several areas such as signal acquisition techniques, hardware development, machine learning, and signal processing and system integration. However, there are many disadvantages of conventional BCI approaches. For example, Motor-imagery based BCIs requires extensive training of the subjects, P-300 based BCIs still requires several stimulus repetitions to obtain reliable accuracy and in SSVEP stimulus; number of commands is limited by the number of stimulus frequencies and many more. To overcome these disadvantages and further improvement in performance of the system, an increasing number of researchers have begun to explore hybrid BCI approaches, in which multiple BCI approaches are incorporated in a single BCI system. The purpose of this paper is to give a brief introduction to the different types of hybrid BCI techniques. There are many different types of hybrid BCI that can be used in a wide range of applications. The paradigm design plays a very important role in the performance of hybrid BCIs.

It is indicted that recurrent neural networks such as the Jordan network produce a great improvement with clinical data sets and have helped in acquiring high accuracy. The main aim of this study is to provide a sophisticated model to differentiate applications of dynamical neural networks for medically related problems. We attempt to classify the amount of medications for each patient with Sickle Cell disorder. We use different recurrent neural network architectures in terms of examining performance for each model within this study. The motivation for the classification approach used in this study is to support medical sectors to offer proper therapy advice depending on the former data set. The outcomes yield from different classifiers during our experiments indicated that Elman and hybrid recurrent neural networks produced inferior results when compared to Jordan neural networks. Results have indicated that for the recurrent network models tested, the Jordan architecture was found to yield considerably better results over the range of performance measures that been selected for this research.

Study design This retrospective cohort studied infants with mild, moderate, and severe neonatal encephalopathy who received therapeutic hypothermia at a single tertiary neonatal intensive care unit between 2013 and 2015. Two neuroradiologists masked to the clinical condition evaluated brain MRIs for cerebral injury after therapeutic hypothermia using the Barkovich classification system. Additional abnormalities not included in this classification system were also noted. The rate, pattern, and severity of abnormalities/injury were compared across the grades of neonatal encephalopathy. Results Eighty-nine infants received therapeutic hypothermia and met study criteria, 48 with mild neonatal encephalopathy, 35 with moderate neonatal encephalopathy, and 6 with severe neonatal encephalopathy. Fortyeight infants (54%) had an abnormality on MRI. There was no difference in the rate of overall MRI abnormalities by grade of neonatal encephalopathy (mild neonatal encephalopathy 54%, moderate neonatal encephalopathy 54%, and severe neonatal encephalopathy 50%; P = 89). Basal ganglia/thalamic injury was more common in those with severe neonatal encephalopathy (mild neonatal encephalopathy 4%, moderate neonatal encephalopathy 9%, severe neonatal encephalopathy 34%; P = 03). In contrast, watershed injury did not differ between neonatal encephalopathy grades (mild neonatal encephalopathy 36%, moderate neonatal encephalopathy 32%, severe neonatal encephalopathy 50%; P = 3). Conclusion Mild neonatal encephalopathy is commonly associated with MRI abnormalities after therapeutic hypothermia. The grade of neonatal encephalopathy during the first hours of life may not discriminate adequately between infants with and without cerebral injury noted on MRI after therapeutic hypothermia.

Despite many reports of enhanced brain activity during multisensory conditions, it remains unclear which dynamic processes implement the multisensory benefit for an upcoming decision in the human brain. Specifically, it remains difficult to attribute perceptual benefits to specific processes, such as early sensory encoding, the transformation of sensory representations into a motor response, or to more unspecific processes such as attention. We combined an audio-visual motion discrimination task with the single-trial mapping of dynamic sensory representations in EEG activity to localize when and where multisensory congruency facilitates perceptual accuracy. Our results show that a congruent sound facilitates the encoding of motion direction in occipital sensory - as opposed to parieto-frontal - cortices, and facilitates later - as opposed to early (i.e. below 100 ms) - sensory activations. This multisensory enhancement was visible as an earlier rise of motion-sensitive activity in middle-occipital regions about 350 ms from stimulus onset, which reflected the better discriminability of motion direction from brain activity and correlated with the perceptual benefit provided by congruent multisensory information. This supports a hierarchical model of multisensory integration in which the enhancement of relevant sensory cortical representations is transformed into a more accurate choice.

Aim To provide a better characterisation of clinical features and results of diagnostic investigations, especially at an early disease stage, in patients with sCJDVV2, the second most common sCJD subtype. Methods We evaluated neurological symptoms/signs, and results of brain diffusion-weighted resonance imaging (DW-MRI), electroencephalographic recordings (EEG) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker studies in 120 patients with a definite (n=93) or probable (n=27) diagnosis of sCJDVV2. Results All patients presented with prominent cerebellar signs, which were often associated with memory loss and/or oculomotor, visual or peripheral/spinal cord signs. In contrast, dementia was invariably a late finding. All CSF samples were positive for the 14-3-3 protein assay and had total-tau protein levels above 1250 pg/mL. Brain DW-MRI showed hyperintensity of basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebral cortex, respectively in 91.5%, 57.4% and 19.1% of cases. EEG revealed periodic sharp-wave complexes in only 17.8% of cases. Conclusions sCJDVV2 should be considered in any patient presenting with a rapidly progressive ataxia, especially when associated with oculomotor, visual or peripheral/spinal cord signs, even in the absence of dementia or myoclonus. CSF assays and brain DW-MRI represent sensitive diagnostic tests, even at an early stage. These data strongly suggest that sCJDVV2 can be clinically diagnosed early and accurately based on clinical data, DW-MRI, CSF assays and codon 129 genotyping and provide the basis for improved and subtype-specific diagnostic criteria of sCJD.

New aEEG systems are continuously enriching the market and clinicians are faced with different aEEG devices whose tracings may vary. Objectives: The aim of this work was to determine the role of different aEEG systems on quantitative measurements of the aEEG. Methods: In this observational study, a single-channel aEEG recording (Olympic CFM 6000) with corresponding EEG signal was obtained from 32 infants at a gestational age of 36-44 weeks. The signals were split into 334 episodes of 4 h. New aEEG tracings were generated using the NicoletOne Reader Software and aEEG emulations with varying filter profiles and peak detection settings. The aEEG amplitude margins and automated annotation of continuous normal voltage (CNV) were compared. Results: The output of the Olympic and the NicoletOne systems are very similar but not identical; the Spearman rank correlations of the aEEG amplitude margins exceeded 0.9 and the differences in the lower and upper amplitude margins were 1.55 mu V (SD 1.47) and -2.12 mu V (SD 1.44) on average (n = 309), respectively. The aEEG emulation showed that the differences between the output of the Olympic and the NicoletOne system could be primarily ascribed to the peak detection algorithm. The differences in output can affect automated analyses with agreement rates in CNV detection of 76% (n = 32, positive) and 92% (n = 32, negative) when comparing the Olympic to the NicoletOne outputs. Conclusions: Commercial aEEG systems have similar but not identical outputs. Care is advised when interpreting automated aEEG classifications across different devices. (C) 2017 S.

Catathrenia, a REM predominant disorder of arousal?	SLEEP MEDICINE			English	Article						Catathrenia; Sleep disordered breathing; Parasomnia; Arousal disorders	CENTRAL SLEEP-APNEA; PARASOMNIA; RARE	Objectives: Catathrenia is an uncommon and poorly understood disorder, characterized by groaning during sleep occurring in tandem with prolonged expiration. Its classification, pathogenesis, and clinical relevance remain debated, substantially due to the limited number of cases reported to date. We report a series of consecutive cases of catathrenia, their clinical and polysomnographic characteristics, and their subsequent management. Methods: Consecutive patients with catathrenia who had undergone full polysomnography in our institution over a 5.5-year period were included. Catathrenia events (CEs) were examined in clusters, which formulated catathrenia periods (CPs). The relationships between CPs, sleep stage distribution, electroencephalogram (EEG) arousals, and other sleep parameters were assessed, along with the clinical presentation and management of catathrenic patients. Results: A total of 427 CPs were identified in 38 patients, 81% arising from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. EEG arousals preceded or coincided with the onset of 84% of CPs, which were of longer duration than those not associated with an arousal (57.3 +/- 56.8 vs. 32.2 +/- 29.4 s, p < 0.001). Each CE had a characteristic airflow signal, with inspiration preceding a protracted expiration and a brief more rapid exhalation, followed by deep inspiration. Although the majority of patients were referred on the basis of bed partner complaints, 44.7% complained of daytime sleepiness. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy and sleep-consolidating pharmacotherapy led to subjective improvement, but were limited by poor long-term adherence. Conclusions: In the largest series of catathrenia patients reported to date, we found that this rare disorder is characterized by a distinct breathing pattern and arises predominantly from REM sleep, with arousals almost uniformly preceding or coinciding with the onset of CPs.

Due to its importance, over the years, different methods, designed to support decision-making process, were developed and used. Field of the decision-making support is still developing, and it uses the latest achievements of many sciences. Tools supporting the decision process fulfill their role in many different ways. Among them we can mention: information management, quantification of data or models manipulation. To this traditional approach, one more element could be added-indication of the conditions in which a better decision can be made. In this context, the cognitive neuroscience techniques can be very helpful. At the basis of this approach is the assumption that knowing the neurological grounds for decision making and decoding the decision-making process in the brain, we will be able to understand and take advantage of factors contributing to making the right decisions. In the presented research, we try to predict decisions on the basis of observations of brain signals activity during the time of the decision-making process. The data are registered with the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) due to its small size and low cost. The decisions made by participants are connected with the choice between two lotteries with different payoffs. The aim of the research is to determine, if by analyzing the brain signals, we are able to predict the decision adequacy.

The suite of paradigms is designed to test basic responses in the first step and to continue to more comprehensive tasks if the first tests are successful. The latter tasks require more cognitive functions, but they could provide communication, which is not possible with the basic tests. All assessment tests produce accuracy plots that show whether the algorithms were able to detect the patient's brain's response to the given tasks. If the accuracy level is beyond the significance level, we assume that the subject understood the task and was able to follow the sequence of commands presented via earphones to the subject. The tasks require users to concentrate on certain stimuli or to imagine moving either the left or right hand. All tasks are designed around the assumption that the user is unable to use the visual modality, and thus, all stimuli presented to the user (including instructions, cues, and feedback) are auditory or tactile.

However, due to event-related (de) synchronization(ERD/ERS) during motor imagery are not stable enough, the performance of classification of MI-BCI is relatively poor. It has become a focus of study that how to achieve the feature enhancement of motor imagery. Since motor imagery is a cognitive processing that engages parts of the motor resources, we try to improve suppression and enhancement of amplitude (ERD/ERS) in a novel way by changing cognitive state. In this study, we designed a cognitive parallel n-back task with varying memory load to carry out with motor imagery task synchronously. The result of 13 subjects who volunteered in this experiment was shown that increased memory load could activate much stronger power decrease of ERD pattern at alpha rhythms in both sides of sensorimotor cortex, especially in contralateral area. Furthermore, we calculated the accuracy of classification between motor imaginary and motor idle status in different conditions by two classifiers, respectively. Through the paired t-test, we obtained that the accuracy of high memory load condition was significantly higher than the low load condition(SVM: (76.3 +/- 13.3)% and (83.4 +/- 10.5)%, p<0.01; LDA: (78.0 +/- 13.5)% and (84.6 +/- 12.4)%, p<0.05). A conclusion can be drawn that memory load have a positive impact on ERD pattern, even it is not caused by motor imagery itself. Besides, it may imply a new approach to modulate brain oscillations related to motor imagery by changing cognitive state.

Multicenter clinical assessment of improved wearable multimodal convulsive seizure detectors	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy; Convulsive seizures; Electrodermal activity; Machine learning	POSTICTAL EEG SUPPRESSION; SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH; TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURES; WRIST ACCELEROMETER; AUTONOMIC CHANGES; DETECTION SYSTEMS; AUTOMATED SEIZURE; EPILEPSY; SUDEP; CHILDREN	Objective: New devices are needed for monitoring seizures, especially those associated with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). They must be unobtrusive and automated, and provide false alarm rates (FARs) bearable in everyday life. This study quantifies the performance of new multimodal wrist-worn convulsive seizure detectors. Methods: Hand-annotated video-electroencephalographic seizure events were collected from 69 patients at six clinical sites. Three different wristbands were used to record electrodermal activity (EDA) and accelerometer (ACM) signals, obtaining 5,928 h of data, including 55 convulsive epileptic seizures (six focal tonic-clonic seizures and 49 focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures) from 22 patients. Recordings were analyzed offline to train and test two new machine learning classifiers and a published classifier based on EDA and ACM. Moreover, wristband data were analyzed to estimate seizure-motion duration and autonomic responses. Results: The two novel classifiers consistently outperformed the previous detector. The most efficient (Classifier III) yielded sensitivity of 94.55%, and an FAR of 0.2 events/day. No nocturnal seizures were missed. Most patients had <1 false alarm every 4 days, with an FAR below their seizure frequency. When increasing the sensitivity to 100% (no missed seizures), the FAR is up to 13 times lower than with the previous detector. Furthermore, all detections occurred before the seizure ended, providing reasonable latency (median = 29.3 s, range = 14.8-151 s). Automatically estimated seizure durations were correlated with true durations, enabling reliable annotations. Finally, EDA measurements confirmed the presence of postictal autonomic dysfunction, exhibiting a significant rise in 73% of the convulsive seizures. Significance: The proposed multimodal wrist-worn convulsive seizure detectors provide seizure counts that are more accurate than previous automated detectors and typical patient self-reports, while maintaining a tolerable FAR for ambulatory monitoring. Furthermore, the multimodal system provides an objective description of motor behavior and autonomic dysfunction, aimed at enriching seizure characterization, with potential utility for SUDEP warning.

Due to neuromuscular ailments or injury, some people are unable to move their hands. Though myoelectrically controlled prostheses are widely available in the market, they require some muscle based control points which are hardly available for many. Motor Imagination (MI) controlled prostheses will surpass this shortcomings for them. However, restoring human grasping from MI is a challenging task. In this study, we have decoded two major types (Power and Precision) of grasping along with their three subtypes each from motor imagery. A comparative study of various time domain analysis combined with different classifiers is presented here to find an optimum choice of feature and corresponding classifier. It has been concluded that Hjorth parameters classified with kNN classifier have yielded the highest accuracy of 97.9% while separating different types of grasping from motor imagination.

Intervention before the onset of seizure manifestations could be envisioned with accurate seizure forecasting. Although efforts for better prediction have been made, the translation of current approaches to clinical applications is still not possible. While early findings have been optimistic, the absence of statistical validation and reproducibility has raised doubts about the existence of a preictal state. Analysis and algorithmic studies are providing evidence that transition to the ictal state is not random, with build-up leading to seizures. We have reviewed the general framework of reliable algorithmic seizure prediction studies, discussing each component of the whole block diagram. We have explored steps along the pathway, from signal acquisition to adequate performance evaluation that should be taken into account in the design of an efficient seizure advisory/intervention system. The present review has established that there is potential for improvement and optimization in the seizure prediction framework. New databases, higher sampling frequencies, adequate preprocessing, electrode selection, and machine-learning considerations are all elements of the prediction scheme that should be assessed to achieve more realistic, better-than-chance performances.

High-Throughput Analysis of in-vitro LFP Electrophysiological Signals: A validated workflow/software package	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; DISTINCT ROLES; STATES; RECEPTORS; SLOW; POTENTIALS; EEG	Synchronized brain activity in the form of alternating epochs of massive persistent network activity and periods of generalized neural silence, has been extensively studied as a fundamental form of circuit dynamics, important for many cognitive functions including short-term memory, memory consolidation, or attentional modulation. A key element in such studies is the accurate determination of the timing and duration of those network events. The local field potential (LFP) is a particularly attractive method for recording network activity, because it allows for long and stable recordings from multiple sites, allowing researchers to estimate the functional connectivity of local networks. Here, we present a computational method for the automatic detection and quantification of in-vitro LFP events, aiming to overcome the limitations of current approaches (e.g. slow analysis speed, arbitrary threshold-based detection and lack of reproducibility across and within experiments). The developed method is based on the implementation of established signal processing and machine learning approaches, is fully automated and depends solely on the data. In addition, it is fast, highly efficient and reproducible. The performance of the software is compared against semi-manual analysis and validated by verification of prior biological knowledge.

In this paper, a novel concept of fusing the current mobile app software technology, big data, sensing technology, and machine learning (in decision rule induction, reasoning, and image recognition) into the principles of TCM healthcare is proposed. TCM has developed a set of practical, universal and thorough, and systematic health care system, which is notably characterized by its relations to our daily lifestyles. Currently it lacks of some ubiquitous tools such as mobile smartphone and its sensing apps to embrace this healthcare concept as a personal assistant, monitoring and advising the user regarding his/her health and forewarning of any health risk. The challenges and potential applications are discussed in this paper.

Todd			Using connectome-based predictive modeling to predict individual behavior from brain connectivity	NATURE PROTOCOLS			English	Article							RESTING-STATE FMRI; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CLASSIFICATION; ORGANIZATION; MOTION	N euroimaging is a fast-developing research area in which anatomical and functional images of human brains are collected using techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and electroencephalography (EEEEG). Technical advances and large-scale data sets have allowed for the development of models capable of predicting individual differences in traits and behavior using brain connectivity measures derived from neuroimaging data. Here, we present connectome-based predictive modeling (CPCPM), a data-driven protocol for developing predictive models of brain-behavior relationships from connectivity data using cross-validation. This protocol includes the following steps: (i) feature selection, (ii) feature summarization, (iii) model building, and (iv) assessment of prediction significance. We also include suggestions for visualizing the most predictive features (i. e., brain connections). The final result should be a generalizable model that takes brain connectivity data as input and generates predictions of behavioral measures in novel subjects, accounting for a considerable amount of the variance in these measures. It has been demonstrated that the CPCPM protocol performs as well as or better than many of the existing approaches in brain-behavior prediction. As CPCPM focuses on linear modeling and a purely data-driven approach, neuroscientists with limited or no experience in machine learning or optimization will find it easy to implement these protocols. Depending on the volume of data to be processed, the protocol can take 10-100 min for model building, 1-48 h for permutation testing, and 10-20 min for visualization of results.

Beta-band activity represents the recent past during episodic encoding	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Episodic memory; Memory search; Clustering; Computational model	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FREE-RECALL; WORKING-MEMORY; TEMPORAL CONTEXT; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SUBSEQUENT MEMORY; MODEL; RETRIEVAL; SEARCH; GAMMA	While much research has focused on understanding how individual stimuli are encoded in episodic memory, less is known about how a series of events is bound into a coherent episode. Cognitive models of episodic memory propose that information about presented stimuli is integrated into a composite representation reflecting one's past experience, allowing events separated in time to become associated. Recent evidence suggests that neural oscillatory activity may be critically involved in this process. To examine how oscillatory activity contributes to binding of information across events, we measured scalp EEG as participants studied categorized lists of people, places, and objects. We assessed their memory for the lists using free recall, allowing us to characterize the temporal and semantic organization of the studied items in memory. Using pattern classification, we identified EEG activity during encoding at a range of frequencies and scalp locations that was sensitive to the category of presented stimuli. In the beta band (1625 Hz) at right posterior electrodes, we observed activity that was also sensitive to the category of recently presented stimuli. This neural activity showed two characteristics consistent with a representation of the recent past: It became stronger when multiple items from the same category were presented in succession, and it contained a fading trace of the previous category after a category shift. When items were separated by an inter-item distraction task, this integrative beta-band activity was disrupted. Distraction also led to decreased semantic organization of the studied materials without affecting their temporal organization; this suggests that distraction disrupts the integration of semantic information over time, preventing encoding of items in terms of the semantic context of earlier items. Our results provide evidence that beta-band activity is involved in maintaining information about recent events, allowing construction of a coherent representation of a temporally extended episode in memory.

Altered visual contrast gain control is sensitive for idiopathic generalized epilepsies	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Biomarker; Hyperexcitability; Machine learning; Visual-evoked potentials	CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; SODIUM VALPROATE; RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; CAT; NEURONS; NORMALIZATION; NETWORKS; EEG; PHOTOSENSITIVITY; CLASSIFICATION	Objective: Visual hyperexcitability in the form of abnormal contrast gain control has been shown in photosensitive epilepsy and idiopathic generalized epilepsies. We assessed the accuracy and reliability of measures of visual contrast gain control in discerning individuals with idiopathic generalized epilepsies from healthy controls. Methods: Twenty-four adult patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy and 32 neurotypical control subjects from two study sites participated in a prospective, cross-sectional study. We recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials to a wide range of contrasts of a flickering grating stimulus. The resultant response magnitude vs. contrast curves were fitted to a standard model of contrast response function, and the model parameters were used as input features to a linear classifier to separate patients from controls. Additionally we compared the relative contribution of model parameters towards the classification using a sparse feature-selection approach. Results: Classification accuracy was 80% or better. Sensitivity and specificity both were 80-85%. Cross validation confirmed robust classifier performance generalizable across the data from the two samples. Patients' relative lack of gain control at high contrasts was the most important information distinguishing patients from controls. Conclusions: Individuals with idiopathic generalized epilepsy were distinguishable from the neurotypical with a high degree of accuracy and reliability by a reduction in gain control at high contrasts.

Heart rate variability feature selection in the presence of sleep apnea: An expert system for the characterization and detection of the disorder	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Sleep apnea; Single-lead ECG; Heart rate variability; Cepstrum; Filter bank; Detrended Fluctuation Analysis; Feature selection	DETRENDED FLUCTUATION ANALYSIS; ELECTROCARDIOGRAM; QUANTIFICATION; ALGORITHM; ENTROPY; MODELS; TIME; EEG	We introduce a sleep apnea characterization and classification approach based on a Heart Rate Variability (HRV) feature selection process, thus focusing on the characterization of the underlying process from a cardiac rate point of view. Therefore, we introduce linear and nonlinear variables, namely Cepstrum Coefficients (CC), Filterbanks (Fbank) and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis were used for classification purposes. The experiments were carried out using two databases. We achieved a per-segment accuracy of 84.76% (sensitivity = 81.45%, specificity = 86.82%, AUC = 0.92) in the Apnea-ECG Physionet database, whereas in the HuGCDN2014 database, provided by the Dr. Negrin University Hospital (Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain), the best results were: accuracy = 81.96%, sensitivity = 70.95%, specificity = 85.47%, AUC = 0.87. The former results were comparable or better than those obtained by other methods for the same database in the recent literature. We have concluded that the selected features that best characterize the underlying process are common to both databases. This supports the fact that the conclusions reached are potentially generalizable. The best results were obtained when the three kinds of features were jointly used. Another notable fact is the small number of features needed to describe the phenomenon. Results suggest that the two first Fbanks, the first CC and the first DFA coefficient are the variables that best describe the RR pattern in OSA and, therefore, are especially relevant to extract discriminative information for apnea screening purposes.

Most BMI systems sample activity from restricted brain regions, typically the motor and premotor cortex, with limited spatial resolution. Despite the growing number of applications, the cortical and subcortical systems involved in BMI control are currently unknown at the whole-brain level. Here, we provide a comprehensive and detailed report of the areas active during on-line BMI control. We recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while participants controlled an EEG-based BMI inside the scanner. We identified the regions activated during BMI control and how they overlap with those involved in motor imagery (without any BMI control). In addition, we investigated which regions reflect the subjective sense of controlling a BMI, the sense of agency for BMI-actions. Our data revealed an extended cortical-subcortical network involved in operating a motor-imagery BMI. This includes not only sensorimotor regions but also the posterior parietal cortex, the insula and the lateral occipital cortex. Interestingly, the basal ganglia and the anterior cingulate cortex were involved in the subjective sense of controlling the BMI. These results inform basic neuroscience by showing that the mechanisms of BMI control extend beyond sensorimotor cortices. This knowledge may be useful for the development of BMIs that offer a more natural and embodied feeling of control for the user. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Novel behavioral indicator of explicit awareness reveals temporal course of frontoparietal neural network facilitation during motor learning	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PERCEPTION; ATTENTION; IMPLICIT; MEMORY; ACTIVATION; KNOWLEDGE; DYNAMICS; BENEFITS; INSIGHTS; TASK	Deficits in sequential motor learning have been observed in many patient populations. Having an understanding of the individual neural progression associated with sequential learning in healthy individuals may provide valuable insights for effective interventions with these patients. Due to individual variability in motor skill acquisition, the temporal course of such learning will be vary, suggesting a need for a more individualized approach. Knowing when a subject becomes aware of movement patterns may provide a marker with which to identify each individual's learning time course. To avoid interfering with the incidental nature of discovery during learning, such an indicator requires an indirect, behaviorally-based approach. In Part I, our study aimed to identify a reliable behavioral indicator predictive of the presence of incidental explicit awareness in a sequential motor learning task. Part II, utilized the predictive indicator and EEG to provide neural validation of perceptual processing changes temporally correlated with the indicator. Results of Part I provide a reliable predictive indicator for the timing of explicit awareness development. Results from Part II demonstrates strong classification reliability, as well as a significant neural correlation with behavior for subjects developing awareness (EXP), not observed with subjects without awareness (NOEXP). Additionally, a temporal correlation of peak activation between neural regions was noted over frontoparietal regions, suggesting that the incidental discovery of motor patterns may involve a facilitative network during awareness development. The proposed indicator provides a tool in which to further examine potential impacts of awareness associated with incidental, or exploratory, motor learning, while the individual nature of the indicator provides a tool for monitoring progress in rehabilitative, exploratory motor learning paradigms.

Low Latency Estimation of Motor Intentions to Assist Reaching Movements along Multiple Sessions in Chronic Stroke Patients: A Feasibility Study	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						electroencephalography; motor-related cortical potentials; event-related desynchronization; functional electrical stimulation; stroke; neurorehabilitation	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MACHINE INTERFACE; IMPACT SCALE-16; REHABILITATION; RECOVERY; STIMULATION; PEOPLE; EXOSKELETON; PLASTICITY; HAND	Background: The association between motor-related cortical activity and peripheral stimulation with temporal precision has been proposed as a possible intervention to facilitate cortico-muscular pathways and thereby improve motor rehabilitation after stroke. Previous studies with patients have provided evidence of the possibility to implement brain-machine interface platforms able to decode motor intentions and use this information to trigger afferent stimulation and movement assistance. This study tests the use a low-latency movement intention detector to drive functional electrical stimulation assisting upper-limb reaching movements of patients with stroke. Methods: An eight-sessions intervention on the paretic arm was tested on four chronic stroke patients along 1 month. Patients' intentions to initiate reaching movements were decoded from electroencephalographic signals and used to trigger functional electrical stimulation that in turn assisted patients to do the task. The analysis of the patients' ability to interact with the intervention platform, the assessment of changes in patients' clinical scales and of the system usability and the kinematic analysis of the reaching movements before and after the intervention period were carried to study the potential impact of the intervention. Results: On average 66.3 +/- 15.7% of trials (resting intervals followed by self-initiated movements) were correctly classified with the decoder of motor intentions. The average detection latency (with respect to the movement onsets estimated with gyroscopes) was 112 +/- 278ms. The Fugl-Meyer index upper extremity increased 11.5 +/- 5.5 points with the intervention. The stroke impact scale also increased. In line with changes in clinical scales, kinematics of reaching movements showed a trend toward lower compensatory mechanisms. Patients' assessment of the therapy reflected their acceptance of the proposed intervention protocol. Conclusions: According to results obtained here with a small sample of patients, Brain-Machine Interfaces providing low-latency support to upper-limb reaching movements in patients with stroke are a reliable and usable solution formotor rehabilitation interventions with potential functional benefits.

Real-time EEG-based brain-computer interface to a virtual avatar enhances cortical involvement in human treadmill walking	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ELECTROCORTICAL ACTIVITY; STROKE REHABILITATION; MOTOR; OSCILLATIONS; THETA; BETA; LIMB; SYNCHRONIZATION; ADJUSTMENTS	Recent advances in non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies have shown the feasibility of neural decoding for both users' gait intent and continuous kinematics. However, the dynamics of cortical involvement in human upright walking with a closed-loop BCI has not been investigated. This study aims to investigate the changes of cortical involvement in human treadmill walking with and without BCI control of a walking avatar. Source localization revealed significant differences in cortical network activity between walking with and without closed-loop BCI control. Our results showed sustained alpha/mu suppression in the Posterior Parietal Cortex and Inferior Parietal Lobe, indicating increases of cortical involvement during walking with BCI control. We also observed significant increased activity of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) in the low frequency band suggesting the presence of a cortical network involved in error monitoring and motor learning. Additionally, the presence of low. modulations in the ACC and Superior Temporal Gyrus may associate with increases of voluntary control of human gait. This work is a further step toward the development of a novel training paradigm for improving the efficacy of rehabilitation in a top-down approach.

Identifying psychogenic seizures through comorbidities and medication history	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Screening; Psychogenic nonepileptic attack disorder; Machine learning; Asthma; Migraines	NONEPILEPTIC SEIZURES; DIAGNOSTIC DELAY; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; TASK-FORCE; EPILEPSY; DISORDER; PREDICT; COST	Objective: Low-cost evidence-based tools are needed to facilitate the early identification of patients with possible psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Prior to accurate diagnosis, patients with PNES do not receive interventions that address the cause of their seizures and therefore incur high medical costs and disability due to an uncontrolled seizure disorder. Both seizures and comorbidities may contribute to this high cost. Methods: Based on data from 1,365 adult patients with video-electroencephalography-confirmed diagnoses from a single center, we used logistic and Poisson regression to compare the total number of comorbidities, number of medications, and presence of specific comorbidities in five mutually exclusive groups of diagnoses: epileptic seizures (ES) only, PNES only, mixed PNES and ES, physiologic nonepileptic seizurelike events, and inconclusive monitoring. To determine the diagnostic utility of comorbid diagnoses and medication history to differentiate PNES only from ES only, we used multivariate logistic regression, controlling for sex and age, trained using a retrospective database and validated using a prospective database. Results: Our model differentiated PNES only from ES only with a prospective accuracy of 78% (95% confidence interval =72-84%) and area under the curve of 79%. With a few exceptions, the number of comorbidities and medications was more predictive than a specific comorbidity. Comorbidities associated with PNES were asthma, chronic pain, and migraines (p < 0.01). Comorbidities associated with ES were diabetes mellitus and nonmetastatic neoplasm (p < 0.01). The population-level analysis suggested that patients with mixed PNES and ES may be a population distinct from patients with either condition alone. Significance: An accurate patient-reported medical history and medication history can be useful when screening for possible PNES. Our prospectively validated and objective score may assist in the interpretation of the medication and medical history in the context of the seizure description and history.

J	Xia, MR; He, Y				Xia, Mingrui; He, Yong			Functional connectomics from a "big data" perspective	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Brain networks; Connectome; Dynamics; Graph theory; Fingerprint; Big data	TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; COMPLEX BRAIN NETWORKS; DISCRIMINATIVE ANALYSIS; CONNECTIVITY PATTERNS; INTRACRANIAL EEG; DEFAULT MODE; FMRI; ARCHITECTURE	In the last decade, explosive growth regarding functional connectome studies has been observed. Accumulating knowledge has significantly contributed to our understanding of the brain's functional network architectures in health and disease. With the development of innovative neuroimaging techniques, the establishment of large brain datasets and the increasing accumulation of published findings, functional connectomic research has begun to move into the era of "big data", which generates unprecedented opportunities for discovery in brain science and simultaneously encounters various challenging issues, such as data acquisition, management and analyses. Big data on the functional connectome exhibits several critical features: high spatial and/or temporal precision, large sample sizes, long-term recording of brain activity, multidimensional biological variables (e.g., imaging, genetic, demographic, cognitive and clinic) and/or vast quantities of existing findings. We review studies regarding functional connectomics from a big data perspective, with a focus on recent methodological advances in state-of-the-art image acquisition (e.g., multiband imaging), analysis approaches and statistical strategies (e.g., graph theoretical analysis, dynamic network analysis, independent component analysis, multivariate pattern analysis and machine learning), as well as reliability and reproducibility validations. We highlight the novel findings in the application of functional connectomic big data to the exploration of the biological mechanisms of cognitive functions, normal development and aging and of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We advocate the urgent need to expand efforts directed at the methodological challenges and discuss the direction of applications in this field.

The central serotonergic system is closely involved in the regulation of impulsivity, but how the serotonergic firing rate and release, best investigated by the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP), interact with orbitofrontal activity is still unknown. Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers (11 males, 9 females, 31.3 +/- 10.6 years old) were studied in a 3T MRI scanner (Philips, Hamburg, Germany) during a delay discounting task, after their LDAEP was recorded using a 32 electrodes EEG machine (Brain Products, Munich, Germany). Results: Significant positive correlations were only found between the LDAEP and the medial orbitofrontal part of the superior frontal gyrus (SFG/MO) [Delta immediate reward - delayed reward] for the right (r=0.519; P=0.019) and left side (r=0.478; P=0.033). This relationship was stronger for females compared with males. Orbitofrontal activity was also related to the Barratt Impulsivity Scale. Conclusions: This study revealed that low serotonergic activity as measured by a strong LDAEP was related to a high fMRI signal intensity of SFG/MO during immediate reward behavior which is related to impulsivity. Since this relationship was only found for the infralimbic medial and not for the middle or lateral part of the orbitofrontal cortex, an exclusive projection tract of the serotonergic system to this cortical region can be assumed to regulate impulsive reward-orientated decision making.

Physiological signals such as electrocardiogram, galvanic skin response and respiration were record from fourteen drives executed in a prescribed route at real drive environments. Features were widely extracted from time, spectral and wavelet multi-domains. In order to search for the optimal feature sets, Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were combined and adopted. Kernel-based classifiers were employed to improve the accuracy of stress detection task. Analysis I used features from 10 s intervals of data which were recorded during well-defined rest, highway and city driving conditions to discriminate three levels of diving stress achieving an averaging accuracy over 99% at per-drive level and 89% in cross-drive validation. Analysis II made continuous stress evaluation throughout a complete driving test attaining a high coincidence with the true road situation especially at the switching interval of traffic conditions. Experimental results reveal that different levels of driving stress can be characterized by specific set of physiological measures. These physiological measures could be applied to in-vehicle intelligent systems in various approaches to help the drivers better manage their negative driving status. Our design scheme for driving stress detection could also facilitate the development of similar in-vehicle expert systems, such as driver's emotion management, driver's sleeping onset monitoring, and human-computer interaction (HCI).

A seminal finding in monkey research is that neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) retain stimulus-specific information when vibrotactile frequencies were memorized. A direct mapping between monkey studies and human research is still controversial. Although oscillatory signatures, in terms of frequency-dependent parametric beta-band modulation, have been observed recently in human EEG studies, the content specificity of these representations in terms of multivariate pattern analysis has not yet been shown. Here, we used fMRI in combination with multivariate classification techniques to determine which brain regions retain information during WM. In a retro-cue delayed-match-to-sample task, human subjects memorized the frequency of vibrotactile stimulation over a 12 s delay phase. Using an assumption-free whole-brain searchlight approach, we tested with support vector regression which brain regions exhibited multivariate parametric WM codes of the maintained frequencies during the WM delay. Interestingly, our analysis revealed an overlap with regions previously identified in monkeys composed of bilateral premotor cortices, supplementary motor area, and the right inferior frontal gyrus as part of the PFC. Therefore, our results establish a link between the WM codes found in monkeys and those in humans and emphasize the importance of the PFC for information maintenance during WM also in humans.

J	Dhindsa, K; Carcone, D; Becker, S				Dhindsa, Kiret; Carcone, Dean; Becker, Suzanna			Toward an Open-Ended BCI: A User-Centered Coadaptive Design	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; ASYNCHRONOUS BCI; SPATIAL FILTERS; MOTOR IMAGERY; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; COMMUNICATION; MODELS	Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow users to control a device by interpreting their brain activity. For simplicity, these devices are designed to be operated by purposefully modulating specific predetermined neurophysiological signals, such as the sensorimotor rhythm. However, the ability to modulate a given neurophysiological signal is highly variable across individuals, contributing to the inconsistent performance of BCIs for different users. These differences suggest that individuals who experience poor BCI performance with one class of brain signals might have good results with another. In order to take advantage of individual abilities as they relate to BCI control, we need to move beyond the current approaches. In this letter, we explore a new BCI design aimed at a more individualized and user-focused experience, which we call open-ended BCI. Individual users were given the freedom to discover their own mental strategies as opposed to being trained to modulate a given brain signal. They then underwent multiple coadaptive training sessions with the BCI. Our first open-ended BCI performed similarly to comparable BCIs while accommodating a wider variety of mental strategies without a priori knowledge of the specific brain signals any individual might use. Post hoc analysis revealed individual differences in terms of which sensory modality yielded optimal performance. We found a large and significant effect of individual differences in background training and expertise, such as in musical training, on BCI performance. Future research should be focused on finding more generalized solutions to user training and brain state decoding methods to fully utilize the abilities of different individuals in an open-ended BCI. Accounting for each individual's areas of expertise could have important implications on BCI training and BCI application design.

However, due to the poor BCI performance, this technique is still far from daily-life applications. One of critical issues confronting BCI research is how to enhance BCI performance. This study aimed at improving the motor imagery (MI) based BCI accuracy by integrating MI tasks with unilateral tactile stimulation (Uni-TS). The effects were tested on both healthy subjects and stroke patients in a controlled study. Twenty-two healthy subjects and four stroke patients were recruited and randomly divided into a control-group and an enhanced-group. In the control-group, subjects performed two blocks of conventional MI tasks (left hand vs. right hand), with 80 trials in each block. In the enhanced-group, subjects also performed two blocks of MI tasks, but constant tactile stimulation was applied on the non-dominant/paretic hand during MI tasks in the second block. We found the Uni-TS significantly enhanced the contralateral cortical activations during MI of the stimulated hand, whereas it had no influence on activation patterns during MI of the non-stimulated hand. The two-class BCI decoding accuracy was significantly increased from 72.5% (MI without Uni-TS) to 84.7% (MI with Uni-TS) in the enhanced-group (p < 0.001, paired t-test). Moreover, stroke patients in the enhanced-group achieved an accuracy >80% during MI with Uni-TS. This novel approach complements the conventional methods for BCI enhancement without increasing source information or complexity of signal processing. This enhancement via Uni-TS may facilitate clinical applications of MI-BCI.

An accurate understanding of human emotions is necessary for these computers to trigger proper feedback. Among multiple emotional channels, physiological signals are synchronous with emotional responses; therefore, analyzing physiological changes is a recognized way to estimate human emotions. In this paper, a three-stage decision method is proposed to recognize four emotions based on physiological signals in the multi-subject context. Emotion detection is achieved by using a stage-divided strategy in which each stage deals with a fine-grained goal. Methods: The decision method consists of three stages. During the training process, the initial stage transforms mixed training subjects to separate groups, thus eliminating the effect of individual differences. The second stage categorizes four emotions into two emotion pools in order to reduce recognition complexity. The third stage trains a classifier based on emotions in each emotion pool. During the testing process, a test case or test trial will be initially classified to a group followed by classification into an emotion pool in the second stage. An emotion will be assigned to the test trial in the final stage. In this paper we consider two different ways of allocating four emotions into two emotion pools. A comparative analysis is also carried out between the proposal and other methods. Results: An average recognition accuracy of 77.57% was achieved on the recognition of four emotions with the best accuracy of 86.67% to recognize the positive and excited emotion. Using differing ways of allocating four emotions into two emotion pools, we found there is a difference in the effectiveness of a classifier on learning each emotion. When compared to other methods, the proposed method demonstrates a significant improvement in recognizing four emotions in the multi-subject context. Conclusions: The proposed three-stage decision method solves a crucial issue which is 'individual differences' in multi-subject emotion recognition and overcomes the suboptimal performance with respect to direct classification of multiple emotions. Our study supports the observation that the proposed method represents a promising methodology for recognizing multiple emotions in the multi-subject context.

However, there are only a few clinical studies that investigate feasibility and effectiveness of such an approach. Here we report on a placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial that investigated whether stroke survivors with severe upper limb (UL) paralysis benefit from 10 BCI training sessions each lasting up to 40 min. A total of 74 patients participated: median time since stroke is 8 months, 25 and 75% quartiles [3.0; 13.0]; median severity of UL paralysis is 4.5 points [0.0; 30.0] as measured by the Action Research Arm Test, ARAT, and 19.5 points [11.0; 40.0] as measured by the Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment, FMMA. Patients in the BCI group (n = 55) performed motor imagery of opening their affected hand. Motor imagery-related brain electroencephalographic activity was translated into contingent hand exoskeleton-driven opening movements of the affected hand. In a control group (n = 19), hand exoskeleton-driven opening movements of the affected hand were independent of brain electroencephalographic activity. Evaluation of the UL clinical assessments indicated that both groups improved, but only the BCI group showed an improvement in the ARAT's grasp score from 0 [0.0; 14.0] to 3.0 [0.0; 15.0] points (p < 0.01) and pinch scores from 0.0 [0.0; 7.0] to 1.0 [0.0; 12.0] points (p < 0.01). Upon training completion, 21.8% and 36.4% of the patients in the BCI group improved their ARAT and FMMA scores respectively. The corresponding numbers for the control group were 5.1% (ARAT) and 15.8% (FMMA). These results suggests that adding BCI control to exoskeleton-assisted physical therapy can improve post-stroke rehabilitation outcomes. Both maximum and mean values of the percentage of successfully decoded imagery-related EEG activity, were higher than chance level. A correlation between the classification accuracy and the improvement in the upper extremity function was found. An improvement of motor function was found for patients with different duration, severity and location of the stroke.
