Electroencephalography - EEG - was used for acquisition of brain neural signals thought activity, hence to layout a control strategy for robotic hand and fingers movements. This is done via decoding, in real-time, the neural activity associated with fingers motions. Results are used for training robotics dexterous hands, and might allow people with spinal cord injury, brainstem stroke, and ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) to control a robotic-prosthetic by thinking about movements. The project is novel in a sense, it relies on detecting grasping features for a human grasping using Principle Component Analysis (PAC), hence to learn these features for recognitions applications.

Hence, plays a vital role in detecting neurological conditions. In this paper, we identify some unique EEG patterns pertaining to dyslexia, which is a learning disability with a neurological origin. Although EEG signals hold important insights of brain behaviours, uncovering these insights are not always straightforward due to its complexity. We tackle this using machine learning and uncover unique EEG signals generated in adults with dyslexia during writing and typing as well as optimal EEG electrodes and brain regions for classification. This study revealed that the greater level of difficulties seen in individuals with dyslexia during writing and typing compared to normal controls are reflected in the brainwave signal patterns.

Despite this promising potential, BCIs are still scarcely used outside laboratories for practical applications. The main reason preventing EEG-based BCIs from being widely used is arguably their poor usability, which is notably due to their low robustness and reliability. To operate a BCI, the user has to encode commands in his/her EEG signals, typically using mental imagery tasks, such as imagining hand movement or mental calculation. The execution of these tasks leads to specific EEG patterns, which the machine has to decode by using signal processing and machine learning. So far, to address the reliability issue of BCI, most research efforts have been focused on command decoding only. However, if the user is unable to encode commands in her EEG patterns, no signal-processing algorithm would be able to decode them. Therefore, we argue in this chapter that BCI design is not only a decoding challenge (i.e., translating EEG signals into control commands) but also a human-computer interaction challenge, which aims at ensuring the user can control the BCI. Interestingly enough, there are a number of open challenges to take the user into account, for which signal-processing and machine-learning methods could provide solutions. These challenges notably concerns (1) the modeling of the user and (2) understanding and improving how and what the user is learning. More precisely, the BCI community should first work on user modeling, i.e., modeling and updating the user's states and skills overtime from his/her EEG signals, behavior, BCI performances and possibly other sensors. The community should also identify new performance metrics-beyond classification accuracy-that could better describe users' skills at BCI control. Second, the BCI community has to understand how and what the user learns to control the BCI. This includes thoroughly identifying the features to be extracted and the classifier to be used to ensure the user's understanding of the feedback resulting from them, as well as how to present this feedback. Being able to update machine-learning parameters in a specific manner and a precise moment to favor learning without confusing the user with the ever-changeable feedback is another challenge. Finally, it is necessary to gain a clearer understanding of the reasons why mental commands are sometimes correctly decoded and sometimes not; what makes people sometimes fail at BCI control, in order to be able to guide them to do better. Overall, this chapter identifies a number of open and important challenges for the BCI community, at the user level, to which experts in machine learning and signal processing could contribute.

Here, we investigate whether and how the letters of the alphabet can be directly decoded from EEG phase and power data. In addition, we investigate how different band oscillations contribute to the classification and determine the critical time periods. An English letter recognition task was assigned, and statistical analyses were conducted to decode the EEG signal corresponding to each letter visualized on a computer screen. We applied support vector machine (SVM) with gradient descent method to learn the potential features for classification. It was observed that the EEG phase signals have a higher decoding accuracy than the oscillation power information. Low-frequency theta and alpha oscillations have phase information with higher accuracy than do other bands. The decoding performance was best when the analysis period began from 180 to 380 ms after stimulus presentation, especially in the lateral occipital and posterior temporal scalp regions (PO7 and PO8). These results may provide a new approach for brain-computer interface techniques (BCI) and may deepen our understanding of EEG oscillations in cognition.

However, these methods were so far only rarely evaluated for use in intracranial EEG. We employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify and characterize the error-related brain response as measured in 24 intracranial EEG recordings. Decoding accuracies of CNNs were significantly higher than those of a regularized linear discriminant analysis. Using time-resolved deep decoding, it was possible to classify errors in various regions in the human brain, and further to decode errors over 200 ms before the actual erroneous button press, e.g., in the precentral gyrus. Moreover, deeper networks performed better than shallower networks in distinguishing correct from error trials in all-channel decoding. In single recordings, up to 100 % decoding accuracy was achieved. Visualization of the networks' learned features indicated that multivariate decoding on an ensemble of channels yields related, albeit non-redundant information compared to single-channel decoding. In summary, here we show the usefulness of deep learning for both intracranial error decoding and mapping of the spatio-temporal structure of the human error processing network.

Someone's intention can be decoded from their brainwaves during motor imagery action. This can be used to help them control their environment without making any physical movement. To decode someone's intention from brainwaves during motor imagery activities, machine learning models trained on features extracted from the acquired EEG signals have been used. Although the technique has been successful, it has encountered several limitations and difficulties especially during feature extraction. Moreover, many current BCI systems rely on a large number of channels (e.g. 64) to capture spatial information which are necessary during training a machine learning model. In this study, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to decode five motor imagery intentions from EEG signals obtained from four subjects using 64 channels EEG device. A CNN model trained on raw EEG data managed to achieve a mean classification accuracy of 99.7%. Channel selection based on learned weights extracted from a trained CNN model has been performed with subsequent models trained on only two selected channels with higher weights attained a high accuracy (average of 98%) among three participants out of four.

Most current electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are based on machine learning algorithms. There is a large diversity of classifier types that are used in this field, as described in our 2007 review paper. Now, approximately ten years after this review publication, many new algorithms have been developed and tested to classify EEG signals in BCIs. The time is therefore ripe for an updated review of EEG classification algorithms for BCIs. Approach. We surveyed the BCI and machine learning literature from 2007 to 2017 to identify the new classification approaches that have been investigated to design BCIs. We synthesize these studies in order to present such algorithms, to report how they were used for BCIs, what were the outcomes, and to identify their pros and cons. Main results. We found that the recently designed classification algorithms for EEG-based BCIs can be divided into four main categories: adaptive classifiers, matrix and tensor classifiers, transfer learning and deep learning, plus a few other miscellaneous classifiers. Among these, adaptive classifiers were demonstrated to be generally superior to static ones, even with unsupervised adaptation. Transfer learning can also prove useful although the benefits of transfer learning remain unpredictable. Riemannian geometry-based methods have reached state-of-the-art performances on multiple BCI problems and deserve to be explored more thoroughly, along with tensor-based methods. Shrinkage linear discriminant analysis and random forests also appear particularly useful for small training samples settings. On the other hand, deep learning methods have not yet shown convincing improvement over state-of-the-art BCI methods. Significance. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the modern classification algorithms used in EEG-based BCIs, presents the principles of these methods and guidelines on when and how to use them. It also identifies a number of challenges to further advance EEG classification in BCI.

The present paper is devoted to pattern recognition, machine learning, and the analysis of sleep stages in the detection of sleep disorders using polysomnography (PSG) data, including electroencephalography (EEG), breathing (Flow), and electro-oculogram (EOG) signals. The proposed method is based on the classification of selected features by a neural network system with sigmoidal and softmax transfer functions using Bayesian methods for the evaluation of the probabilities of the separate classes. The application is devoted to the analysis of the sleep stages of 184 individuals with different diagnoses, using EEG and further PSG signals. Data analysis points to an average increase of the length of the Wake stage by 2.7% per 10 years and a decrease of the length of the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) stages by 0.8% per 10 years. The mean classification accuracy for given sets of records and single EEG and multimodal features is 88.7% ( standard deviation, STD: 2.1) and 89.6% (STD:1.9), respectively. The proposed methods enable the use of adaptive learning processes for the detection and classification of health disorders based on prior specialist experience and man-machine interaction.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is considered as the most reliable and accurate technique to decode the human brain activity, on the other hand electroencephalography (EEG) is a portable and low cost solution in brain research. The purpose of this study is to find whether EEG can be used to decode the brain activity patterns like fMRI. In fMRI, data from a very specific brain region is enough to decode the brain activity patterns due to the quality of data. On the other hand, EEG can measure the rapid changes in neuronal activity patterns due to its higher temporal resolution i.e., in msec. These rapid changes mostly occur in different brain regions. In this study, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is used both for EEG and fMRI data analysis and the information is extracted from distributed activation patterns of the brain. The significant information among different classes is extracted using two sample t test in both data sets. Finally, the classification analysis is done using the support vector machine. A fair comparison of both data sets is done using the same analysis techniques, moreover simultaneously collected data of EEG and fMRI is used for this comparison. The final analysis is done with the data of eight participants; the average result of all conditions are found which is 65.7% for EEG data set and 64.1% for fMRI data set. It concludes that EEG is capable of doing brain decoding with the data from multiple brain regions. In other words, decoding accuracy with EEG MVPA is as good as fMRI MVPA and is above chance level.

The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer disease plays important role in patients care. In some cases, it is difficult for a physician to analyse disorder at early stages. The Electroencephalography are useful tools to detect brain activities in normal and aged person to find abnormalities in the brain. The analysis of the EEG signals need to obtainefficient and effective methods to extract relevant information. The machine learning algorithms are efficient to predict Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in patients. In this work, various EEG signal pattern studied in order to detect MCI. EEG data set is analysed and different classification algorithms are applied to the data set such as Linear Regression, Multi-layered perceptron, Sequential minimal optimization and Random forest.

Emotional State Classification in Virtual Reality Using Wearable Electroencephalography	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLIED ELECTRONIC AND ENGINEERING 2017 (ICAEE2017)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Applied Electronic and Engineering (ICAEE)	AUG 07-08, 2017	Kuching, MALAYSIA	Univ Teknologi MARA, Fac Elect Engn, Ctr Elect Engn Studies			EEG	This paper presents the classification of emotions on EEG signals. One of the key issues in this research is the lack of mental classification using VR as the medium to stimulate emotion. The approach towards this research is by using K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Firstly, each of the participant will be required to wear the EEG headset and recording their brainwaves when they are immersed inside the VR. The data points are then marked if they showed any physical signs of emotion or by observing the brainwave pattern. Secondly, the data will then be tested and trained with KNN and SVM algorithms. The accuracy achieved from both methods were approximately 82% throughout the brainwave spectrum (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, theta). These methods showed promising results and will be further enhanced using other machine learning approaches in VR stimulus.	[Suhaimi, N.

Anytime multipurpose emotion recognition from EEG data using a Liquid State Machine based framework	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Emotion recognition; EEG; Liquid State Machine; Machine learning; Pattern recognition; Feature extraction	SPIKING NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES	Recent technological advances in machine learning offer the possibility of decoding complex datasets and discern latent patterns. In this study, we adopt Liquid State Machines (LSM) to recognize the emotional state of an individual based on EEG data. LSM were applied to a previously validated EEG dataset where subjects view a battery of emotional film clips and then rate their degree of emotion during each film based on valence, arousal, and liking levels. We introduce LSM as a model for an automatic feature extraction and prediction from raw EEG with potential extension to a wider range of applications. We also elaborate on how to exploit the separation property in LSM to build a multipurpose and anytime recognition framework, where we used one trained model to predict valence, arousal and liking levels at different durations of the input. Our simulations showed that the LSM-based framework achieve outstanding results in comparison with other works using different emotion prediction scenarios with cross validation.

In this paper, we studied the performance of stacked autoencoders in decoding asynchronous reaching movements in the dominant upper limb using EEG. Five individuals without any motor disabilities performed three self-paced reaching tasks while the endpoints of the arm movements were recorded with a motion tracker. Power spectral densities of the relevant cortical signals were extracted among eight bandwidths in the range of 1-45Hz to train a stacked autoencoder. For comparison, convolutional neural network (CNN) and traditional linear decoding using principal component analysis (PCA) for feature selection and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for classification were also used. An average classification accuracy of 79 +/- 5.5% (best up to 88 +/- 6%) was achieved from all subjects on wide frequency band (1-45Hz) in offline analysis with stacked autoencoders while average classification accuracies of 68 +/- 9.1% (best up to 74 +/- 9.1%) with PCA-LDA and 49 +/- 13.8% (best up to 56 +/- 7.2%) with CNN were achieved. The simultaneous dimensionality reduction and feature extraction capabilities of stacked autoencoders can have significant advantages in BCI applications.

In this study, an EEG-based system of perfect performance and good stability for evaluating driver's fatigue with only one electrode by ensemble learning method is proposed. Given that EEG signals are unstable and non-linear that using several common entropy measurements to analyse EEG signals is more appropriate including spectral entropy, approximate entropy, sample entropy and fuzzy entropy. In this study, unlike other methods using a single classifier, three ensemble approaches (bagging, random forest and boosting) based on three base classifiers were employed and compared. A driving simulator in this study was used for 12 healthy and adult subjects to perform a continuous simulated driving experiment for 1-2h. The experimental results show that the proposed method can make use of only one electrode (T6) by gradient boosted DT for driver's fatigue detection, while the average classification accuracy is >94%. The findings of this study indicated that a single EEG channel with optimal ensemble classifier may be a good candidate for usage in the portable system for driver's fatigue detection.

To do that, we have designed and implemented an experimental environment that can acquire non-invasive brain signals about multi-directional arm reaching movement. Five subjects participated in our experiments and the subjects performed four directional reaching tasks (Left, right, forward, and backward) with actual movement and movement imagery. The filter-bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) was applied to extract spatio-frequency features from the acquired EEG signals. The regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) was also applied as a classifier. As a result, the averaged classification accuracies of the actual movement and movement imagery were represented 67.04% and 59.19%, respectively.

Most prevailing studies have used subjective questionnaire data and objective driving data to classify driving behaviors, while few studies have used physiological signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) to gather data. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a two-layer learning method for driving behavior recognition using EEG data. A simulated car-following driving experiment was designed and conducted to simultaneously collect data on the driving behaviors and EEG data of drivers. The proposed learning method consists of two layers. In Layer I, two-dimensional driving behavior features representing driving style and stability were selected and extracted from raw driving behavior data using K-means and support vector machine recursive feature elimination. Five groups of driving behaviors were classified based on these two-dimensional driving behavior features. In Layer II, the classification results from Layer I were utilized as inputs to generate a k-Nearest-Neighbor classifier identifying driving behavior groups using EEG data. Using independent component analysis, a fast Fourier transformation, and linear discriminant analysis sequentially, the raw EEG signals were processed to extract two core EEG features. Classifier performance was enhanced using the adaptive synthetic sampling approach. A leave-one-subject-out cross validation was conducted. The results showed that the average classification accuracy for all tested traffic states was 69.5% and the highest accuracy reached 83.5%, suggesting a significant correlation between EEG patterns and car-following behavior.

J	Vrbancic, G; Podgorelec, V				Vrbancic, Grega; Podgorelec, Vili			Automatic Classification of Motor Impairment Neural Disorders from EEG Signals Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks	ELEKTRONIKA IR ELEKTROTECHNIKA			English	Article						Artificial neural networks; Biomedical signal processing; Electroencephalography; Image classification; Machine learning		The analysis of biomedical signals, such as the EEGs for measuring brain activity, provides means for the diagnosis of various cognitive tasks and neural disorders. These signals are frequently transformed into visual representations such as spectrograms, which can reveal characteristic patterns and serve as a basis for classification, when extracting specific features from them. We designed a new method that uses spectrogram images to feed them without any feature selection/extraction procedure directly into a deep convolutional neural network architecture and train it for the classification of motor impairment neural disorder in a person. The proposed method was tested on a set of (un) impaired subjects, where it outperformed the traditional machine learning methods. The results, obtained without any human intervention and by using all the default parameter values, turned out not to lag much behind an established state-of-the-art method, that takes advantage of using domain knowledge for the analysis of EEG recordings. Based on the experimental results we believe that the proposed method can be considered as a sound basis for further optimization towards a competitive, fully automated method for classification of EEG signals.

If analyzed and patterns are recognized properly this has a high potential application in medicine, psychology, rehabilitation, and many other areas. However, EEG signals are inherently noise-prone, and it is not possible for human to see patterns in raw signals most of the time. Application of appropriate computational intelligence is must to make sense of the raw EEG signals. Moreover, if the signals are collected by a consumer grade wireless EEG acquisition device, the amount of interference is ever more complex to avoid, and it becomes impossible to see any sorts of pattern without proper use of computational intelligence to discover patterns. The objective of EEG based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems is to extract specific signature of the brain activity and to translate them into command signals to control external devices or understand human brains action mechanism to stimuli. A typical BCI system is comprised of a Signal Processing module which can be further broken down into four submodules namely, Pre-processing, Feature Extraction, Feature Selection and Classification. Computational intelligence is the key to identify and extract features also to classify or discover discriminating characteristics in signals. In this chapter we present an overview how computational intelligence is used to discover patterns in brain signals. From our research we conclude that, since EEG signals are the outcome of a highly complex non-linear and non-stationary stochastic biological process which contain a wide variety of noises both from internal and external sources; thus, the use of computational intelligence is required at every step of an EEG-based BCI system starting from removing noises (using advanced signal processing techniques such as SWTSD, ICA, EMD, other than traditional filtering by identifying/exploiting different artifact/noise characteristics/patterns) through feature extraction and selection (by using unsupervised learning like PCA, SVD, etc.) and finally to classification (either supervised learning based classifier like SVM, probabilistic classifier like NB or unsupervised learning based classifiers like neural networks namely RBF, MLP, DBN, k-NN, etc.). And the usage of appropriate computational intelligence significantly improves the end results.	[Mutasim, Aunnoy K.; Tipu, Rayhan Sardar; Bashar, M. Raihanul; Amin, M.

The key technology of BCI systems is feature extraction and pattern recognition algorithm. Many of the BCI research show that nonlinear classification algorithms perform better than the linear, but they are usually far slower than required. Besides, many of these methods employ less significant features and could make the classification process less efficient. In this paper, a method is provided to identify different patterns of EEG signals. A fast nonlinear classification algorithm extreme learning machine (ELM) is provided to identify two different EEG signals. After feature extraction, we adopt a nonlinear feature selection algorithm partial mutual information-based feature selection (PMIS) to eliminate the less significant features. The experimental result shows that (1) ELM can discriminate the two patterns of EEG signals with a relatively satisfactory accuracy and (2) PMIS feature selection can find out the important features effectively and improve the classification accuracy. The final accuracy is 91.5 % against the best existed result of 88.7 % for the tested data set. The classification performance may be further improved by adding complementary features from EEG. This approach may eventually lead to a reliable EEG-based BCI studies.

However, the relation between spontaneous brain activities and visual saliency in natural stimuli has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we developed an optimized machine learning-based decoding model to explore the possible relationships between the electroencephalography (EEG) characteristics and visual saliency. The optimal features were extracted from the EEG signals and saliency map which was computed according to an unsupervised saliency model (Tavakoli and Laaksonen, 2017). Subsequently, various unsupervised feature selection/extraction techniques were examined using different supervised regression models. The robustness of the presented model was fully verified by means of ten-fold or nested cross validation procedure, and promising results were achieved in the reconstruction of saliency features based on the selected EEG characteristics. Through the successful demonstration of using EEG characteristics to predict the real-time saliency distribution in natural videos, we suggest the feasibility of quantifying visual content through measuring brain activities (EEG signals) in real environments, which would facilitate the understanding of cortical involvement in the processing of natural visual stimuli and application developments motivated by human visual processing.

The task-generic model is particularly important since the time cost for preparing the task-specific training EEG dataset is avoid. This study develops a novel mental fatigue classifier, dynamical deep extreme learning machine (DD-ELM), to adapt the variation of the EEG feature distributions across two mental tasks. Different from the static deep learning approaches, DD-ELM iteratively updates the shallow weights at multiple time steps during the testing stage. The proposed method incorporates the both of the merits from the deep network for EEG feature abstraction and the ELM autoencoder for fast weight recompuation. The feasibility of the DD-ELM is validated by investigating EEG datasets recorded under two paradigms of AutoCAMS human-machine tasks. The accuracy comparison indicates the new classifier significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art mental fatigue estimators. By examining the CPU time, the computational burden of the DD-ELM is also acceptable for high-dimensional EEG features. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This can help to understand the limits of the model and how it may be improved, in addition to possibly provide insight about the data itself. Schirrmeister et al. (2017) have recently reported promising results for EEG decoding with deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) trained in an end-to-end manner and, with a causal visualization approach, showed that they learn to use spectral amplitude changes in the input. In this study, we investigate how ConvNets represent spectral features through the sequence of intermediate stages of the network. We show higher sensitivity to EEG phase features at earlier stages and higher sensitivity to EEG amplitude features at later stages. Intriguingly, we observed a specialization of individual stages of the network to the classical EEG frequency bands alpha, beta, and high gamma. Furthermore, we find first evidence that particularly in the last convolutional layer, the network learns to detect more complex oscillatory patterns beyond spectral phase and amplitude, reminiscent of the representation of complex visual features in later layers of ConvNets in computer vision tasks. Our findings thus provide insights into how ConvNets hierarchically represent spectral EEG features in their intermediate layers and suggest that ConvNets can exploit and might help to better understand the compositional structure of EEG time series.

GT2 FSs are applied to BMI for the first time in this study. We also account for several constraints commonly associated with BMI in real practice: 1) the maximum number of EEG channels is limited and fixed; 2) no possibility of performing repeated user training sessions; and 3) desirable use of unsupervised and low-complexity feature extraction methods. The novel online learning method presented in this paper consists of a self-adaptive GT2 FS that can autonomously self-adapt both its parameters and structure via creation, fusion, and scaling of the fuzzy system rules in an online BMI experiment with a real robot. The structure identification is based on an online GT2 Gath-Geva algorithm where every MI decoding class can be represented by multiple fuzzy rules (models), which are learnt in a continous (trial-by-trial) non-iterative basis. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in a detailed BMI experiment, in which 15 untrained users were able to accurately interface with a humanoid robot, in a single session, using signals from six EEG electrodes only.

It can move in complex ways with very little fatigue. Many studies on assistive technologies operated by tongue are called tongue-human computer interface or tongue-machine interface (TMI) for paralyzed individuals. However, many of them are obtrusive systems consisting of hardware such as sensors and magnetic tracer placed in the mouth and on the tongue. Hence these approaches could be annoying, aesthetically unappealing and unhygienic. In this study, we aimed to develop a natural and reliable tongue-machine interface using solely glossokinetic potentials via investigation of the success of machine learning algorithms for 1-D tongue-based control or communication on assistive technologies. Glossokinetic potential responses are generated by touching the buccal walls with the tip of the tongue. In this study, eight male and two female naive healthy subjects, aged 22-34 years, participated. Linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and the k-nearest neighbor were used as machine learning algorithms. Then the greatest success rate was achieved an accuracy of 99% for the best participant in support vector machine. This study may serve disabled people to control assistive devices in natural, unobtrusive, speedy and reliable manner. Moreover, it is expected that GKP-based TMI could be alternative control and communication channel for traditional electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces which have significant inadequacies arisen from the EEG signals.

Dynamical patterns are of particular interest, as evidenced by the proliferation and success of frequency domain methods that reveal structured spatiotemporal rhythmic brain activity. One drawback of such approaches, however, is the need to estimate spectral power, which limits the temporal resolution of classification. New method: We propose an alternative method that enables classification of dynamical patterns with high temporal fidelity. The key feature of the method is a conversion of time-series data into temporal derivatives. By doing so, dynamically-coded information may be revealed in terms of geometric patterns in the phase space of the derivative signal. Results: We derive a geometric classifier for this problem which simplifies into a straightforward calculation in terms of covariances. We demonstrate the relative advantages and disadvantages of the technique with simulated data and benchmark its performance with an EEG dataset of covert spatial attention. We reveal the time course of covert spatial attention and, by mapping the classifier weights anatomically, its retinotopic organization. Comparison with existing method: We especially highlight the ability of the method to provide strong group-level classification performance compared to existing benchmarks, while providing information that is complementary with classical spectral-based techniques. The robustness and sensitivity of the method to noise is also examined relative to spectral-based techniques. Conclusion: The proposed classification technique enables decoding of dynamic patterns with high temporal resolution, performs favorably to benchmark methods, and facilitates anatomical inference.

However, the number of studies that employ deep learning on brain-computer interface (BCI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) is very limited. In this paper, we present a deep learning approach for motor imagery (MI) EEG signal classification. We perform spatial projection using common spatial pattern (CSP) for the EEG signal and then temporal projection is applied to the spatially filtered signal. The signal is next fed to a single-layer neural network for classification. We apply backpropagation (BP) algorithm to fine-tune the parameters of the approach. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been evaluated using datasets of BCI competition III and BCI competition IV.

Electroencephalograms (EEGs), which capture brain neural activity, can detect epilepsy. Traditional methods for analyzing an EEG signal for epileptic seizure detection are time-consuming. Recently, several automated seizure detection frameworks using machine learning technique have been proposed to replace these traditional methods. The two basic steps involved in machine learning are feature extraction and classification. Feature extraction reduces the input pattern space by keeping informative features and the classifier assigns the appropriate class label. In this paper, we propose two effective approaches involving subpattern based PCA (SpPCA) and cross-subpattern correlation-based PCA (SubXPCA) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) for automated seizure detection in EEG signals. Feature extraction was performed using SpPCA and SubXPCA. Both techniques explore the subpattern correlation of EEG signals, which helps in decision-making process. SVM is used for classification of seizure and non-seizure EEG signals. The SVM was trained with radial basis kernel. All the experiments have been carried out on the benchmark epilepsy EEG dataset. The entire dataset consists of 500 EEG signals recorded under different scenarios. Seven different experimental cases for classification have been conducted. The classification accuracy was evaluated using tenfold cross validation. The classification results of the proposed approaches have been compared with the results of some of existing techniques proposed in the literature to establish the claim.

The EEG brainwaves are resulting from specific human hand fingers movements, for a defined task. The adopted technique involved four main computational stages. First, EEG dataset collection for a defined grasping task, Luciw et. al. [1]. Secondly, it was a filtration and multi-signals signals conditioning of such multi-dimensional EEG wave sets. Thirdly, dimensionality reduction of the EEG patterns, hence capturing main EEG waves features. Finally, last stage involved using of pattern recognition and classification algorithms for classification of diverse grasping events. Events classification was based on analysis of set of EEG related patterns, then to correlate such patterns with real word experiment fingers movements. The adopted technique is useful in terms of understanding EEG related and hidden patterns, that are useful for a number of robotics direct or indirect learning applications.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are generally employed in diagnosing epilepsy. Therefore, extracting relevant features from EEG signals is one of the major tasks in an accurate diagnosis. In this study, the local ternary patterns, which is an image processing method, was improved in order to extract robust features from epileptic EEG signals. The EEG signals that were recorded by the Department of Etymology in the Bonn University were employed in the evaluation and validation of the proposed approach. Low and up features, which were extracted by the proposed one-dimensional ternary patterns, were classified by some machine learning methods such that support vector machine, functional trees, random forest (RF), Bayes networks (BayesNet), and artificial neural network, while the highest accuracies were obtained by RF. Achieved accuracies were found successful according to the current literature.

Automated detection of electroencephalography artifacts in human, rodent and canine subjects using machine learning	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Machine learning; SVM; Artifact detection	NEUROPATHIC PAIN; EEG-SIGNALS; RAT MODEL; REMOVAL; CLASSIFICATION; SYNCHRONY; NETWORKS	Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) invariably contains extra-cranial artifacts that are commonly dealt with based on qualitative and subjective criteria. Failure to account for EEG artifacts compromises data interpretation. New Method: We have developed a quantitative and automated support vector machine (SVM)-based algorithm to accurately classify artifactual EEG epochs in awake rodent, canine and humans subjects. An embodiment of this method also enables the determination of 'eyes open/closed' states in human subjects. Results: The levels of SVM accuracy for artifact classification in humans, Sprague Dawley rats and beagle dogs were 94.17%, 83.68%, and 85.37%, respectively, whereas 'eyes open/closed' states in humans were labeled with 88.60% accuracy. Each of these results was significantly higher than chance. Comparison with Existing Methods: Other existing methods, like those dependent on Independent Component Analysis, have not been tested in non-human subjects, and require full EEG montages, instead of only single channels, as this method does. Conclusions: We conclude that our EEG artifact detection algorithm provides a valid and practical solution to a common problem in the quantitative analysis and assessment of EEG in pre-clinical research settings across evolutionary spectra.

Decoding Motor Imagery through Common Spatial Pattern Filters at the EEG Source Space	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; CLASSIFICATION; ENSEMBLE; AGREEMENT; FIELDS; GRASP; REACH	Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a rapidly developing technology that aims to support individuals suffering from various disabilities and, ultimately, improve everyday quality of life. Sensorimotor rhythm-based BCIs have demonstrated remarkable results in controlling virtual or physical external devices but they still face a number of challenges and limitations. Main challenges include multiple degrees-of-freedom control, accuracy, and robustness. In this work, we develop a multiclass BCI decoding algorithm that uses electroencephalography (EEG) source imaging, a technique that maps scalp potentials to cortical activations, to compensate for low spatial resolution of EEG. Spatial features were extracted using Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) filters in the cortical source space from a number of selected Regions of Interest (ROIs). Classification was performed through an ensemble model, based on individual ROI classification models. The evaluation was performed on the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a, which features 4 motor imagery classes from 9 participants. Our results revealed a mean accuracy increase of 5.6% with respect to the conventional application method of CSP on sensors. Neuroanatomical constraints and prior neurophysiological knowledge play an important role in developing source space-based BCI algorithms. Feature selection and classifier characteristics of our implementation will be explored to raise performance to current state-of-the-art.

In this paper, we investigate the offline recognition of three classes of driving actions (turning left, turning right and braking), based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals. A simulated experiment was conducted to collect EEG data of participants. The proposed algorithm includes Wavelet Analysis and Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), to extract the discriminative features. The classification results were obtained using the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The results yielded an average single trial classification accuracy of 70.25% for all subjects, showing the discrimination of different actions and the correlation between driving actions and EEG signals.

Electroencephalography (EEG) and the analysis of eye movement are two of the commonly proposed methods for enhancing the user experiences of the motor-impaired. In this paper, we propose an electrooculography (EOG)/EEG-based hybrid BCI that combines the strengths of EOG and EEG by using them simultaneously. We have shown the effectiveness of EOG/EEG-based hybrid BCIs by implementing the proposed interface and applying it to a chess game. Through this paper, we hope to provide improved interface systems for patients who have physical disabilities.

In this study, we analyzed the decoding of five different hand executions and imageries from EEG signals, for a robot hand control. Five healthy subjects participated in this experiment. They executed and imagined five sustained hand motions. In this motor execution (ME) and motor imagery (MI) experiment, we proposed a subject-specific time interval selection method, and we used common spatial patterns (CSP) and the regularized linear discriminant analysis (RLDA) for the data analysis. As a result, we classified the five different hand motions offline and obtained average classification accuracies of 56.83% for ME, and 51.01% for MI, respectively. Both results were higher than the obtained accuracies from a comparison method that used a standard fixed time interval method. This result is encouraging, and the proposed method could potentially be used in future applications, such as a BCI-driven robot hand control.

We tested such an induction effect by using frequency information of electroencephalography (EEG) data and further explored how the induction training affected EEG pattern itself in relation to behavioral changes. We found that repeated self-induction of an EEG power spectral pattern corresponding to motor preparation for gaining monetary reward caused shortening of reaction times to the motor task. Decoding of EEG data during the motor task after the induction training showed higher probability of appearance of the trained EEG spectral pattern during any task trials. These data reveal behavioral effectiveness of the EEG self-induction training, in parallel with overall enhancement effect of the trained brain activity state.

In this work, publicly available online BCI2003 competition data set was used which contains MI based Electroencephalography (EEG) data of a single subject. The raw MI based EEG signals were extracted from C3 and C4 channels and band pass filtered to mu (8-12 Hz) frequency band. The mean, inter trial variance and ERD/ERS patterns were calculated in both the channels for both MI tasks of the subject. The patterns were used as feature vector and input to the different machine learning classifiers. The logistic regression and Naive Bayesian classifiers were used for the classification of both MI tasks of the subject. For logistic regression classifier, the accuracy, precision and sensitivity were found to be 92.40%, 92.00% and 92.00%, respectively. Meanwhile, 92.19% accuracy, 92.00% precision and 92.00% sensitivity were obtained for the Naive Bayesian classifier. The logistic regression classifier provides maximum classification accuracy (92.40%) in comparison with the existing methods (87.90-90.20%). Result shows that, the proposed method can quantify ERD/ERS patterns effectively in both the channels and also classifies both MI tasks of the subject successfully.	[Shahlaei, Fatemeh; Shaligram, A.

Extreme learning machine (ELM) has recently proven to be comparable or more efficient than support vector machine for many pattern recognition problems. In this study, we propose a multi-kernel ELM (MKELM)-based method for motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) classification. The kernel extension of ELM provides an elegant way to circumvent calculation of the hidden layer outputs and inherently encode it in a kernel matrix. We investigate effects of two different kernel functions (i.e., Gaussian kernel and polynomial kernel) on the performance of kernel ELM. The MKELM method is subsequently developed by integrating these two types of kernels with a multi-kernel learning strategy, which can effectively explore the supplementary information from multiple nonlinear feature spaces for more robust classification of EEG. An extensive experimental comparison with two public EEG datasets indicates that the MKELM method gives higher classification accuracy than those of the other competing algorithms. The experimental results confirm that superiority of the proposed MKELM-based method for accurate classification of EEG associated with motor imagery in BCI applications. Our method also provides a promising and generalized solution to investigate the complex and nonlinear information for various applications in the fields of expert and intelligent systems.

Robust EEG-based cross-site and cross-protocol classification of states of consciousness	BRAIN			English	Article						electroencephalography; disorders of consciousness; biomarker; machine learning; diagnosis	VEGETATIVE STATE; BRAIN-INJURY; DISORDERS; RECOVERY; AWARENESS; CONNECTIVITY; NEUROSCIENCE; SIGNATURES; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS	Determining the state of consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness is a challenging practical and theoretical problem. Recent findings suggest that multiple markers of brain activity extracted from the EEG may index the state of consciousness in the human brain. Furthermore, machine learning has been found to optimize their capacity to discriminate different states of consciousness in clinical practice. However, it is unknown how dependable these EEG markers are in the face of signal variability because of different EEG configurations, EEG protocols and subpopulations from different centres encountered in practice. In this study we analysed 327 recordings of patients with disorders of consciousness (148 unresponsive wakefulness syndrome and 179 minimally conscious state) and 66 healthy controls obtained in two independent research centres (Paris Pitie-Salpetriere and Liege). We first show that a non-parametric classifier based on ensembles of decision trees provides robust out-of-sample performance on unseen data with a predictive area under the curve (AUC) of similar to 0.77 that was only marginally affected when using alternative EEG configurations (different numbers and positions of sensors, numbers of epochs, average AUC = 0.750 +/- 0.014). In a second step, we observed that classifiers based on multiple as well as single EEG features generalize to recordings obtained from different patient cohorts, EEG protocols and different centres. However, the multivariate model always performed best with a predictive AUC of 0.73 for generalization from Paris 1 to Paris 2 datasets, and an AUC of 0.78 from Paris to Liege datasets. Using simulations, we subsequently demonstrate that multivariate pattern classification has a decisive performance advantage over univariate classification as the stability of EEG features decreases, as different EEG configurations are used for feature-extraction or as noise is added. Moreover, we show that the generalization performance from Paris to Liege remains stable even if up to 20% of the diagnostic labels are randomly flipped. Finally, consistent with recent literature, analysis of the learned decision rules of our classifier suggested that markers related to dynamic fluctuations in theta and alpha frequency bands carried independent information and were most influential. Our findings demonstrate that EEG markers of consciousness can be reliably, economically and automatically identified with machine learning in various clinical and acquisition contexts.

This study aims to discover and represents a new approach on MCI using left/right motions of voluntary jaw movements stored in electroencephalogram (EEG). It extracts brain electrical activities on EEG produced by voluntary jaw movements and converts these activities to machine control commands. Jaw-operated machine computer interface is a new way of MCI entitled as jaw machine interface (JMI) provides new functionality for paralyzed people to assist available environmental devices using their jaw motions. In this article, root mean square (RMS) and standard deviation (STD) features of signals are extracted and hemispherical pattern changes are computed and compared as offline analysis approach. A statistical algorithm, principle component analysis (PCA), is used to reduce high dimensional data and two types of machine learning algorithms which are linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) incorporating k-fold cross validation technique are employed to identify pattern changes by utilizing the features of horizontal jaw movements stored in EEG.

However, the existing cognitive load estimation techniques are based on machine learning algorithms, which follow signal denoising and hand-crafted feature extraction to classify different loads. There is a need to find a better alternative to the machine learning approach. Of late, deep learning approach has been successfully applied to many applications namely, computer vision, pattern recognition, speech processing, etc. However, deep learning has not been extensively studied for the classification of cognitive load data captured by an EEG. In this work, two deep learning models are studied, namely stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) followed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and long short term memory (LSTM) followed by an MLP to classify cognitive load data. SDAE and LSTM are used for feature extraction and MLP for classification. It is observed that deep learning models perform significantly better than the conventional machine learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

However, current EEG-based workload estimation may not be robust enough for some practical applications. Indeed, the currently obtained workload classification accuracies are relatively low, making the resulting estimations not fully trustable. This paper thus studies promising modern machine learning algorithms, including Riemannian geometry-based methods and Deep Learning, to estimate workload from EEG signals. We study them with both user-specific and user-independent calibration, to go towards calibration-free systems. Our results suggested that a shallow Convolutional Neural Network obtained the best performance in both conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the used data sets. This suggests that Deep Learning can bring new possibilities in HCI.

EEG signal classification using universum support vector machine	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Universum; Interictal; Support vector machine; Twin support vector machine	PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; WAVELET TRANSFORM; CLASSIFIERS; INFERENCE; ROBUST	Support vector machine (SVM) has been used widely for classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for the diagnosis of neurological disorders such as epilepsy and sleep disorders. SVM shows good generalization performance for high dimensional data due to its convex optimization problem. The incorporation of prior knowledge about the data leads to a better optimized classifier. Different types of EEG signals provide information about the distribution of EEG data. To include prior information in the classification of EEG signals, we propose a novel machine learning approach based on universum support vector machine (USVM) for classification. In our approach, the universum data points are generated by selecting universum from the EEG dataset itself which are the interictal EEG signals. This removes the effect of outliers on the generation of universum data. Further, to reduce the computation time, we use our approach of universum selection with universum twin support vector machine (UTSVM) which has less computational cost in comparison to traditional SVM. For checking the validity of our proposed methods, we use various feature extraction techniques for different datasets consisting of healthy and seizure signals. Several numerical experiments are performed on the generated datasets and the results of our proposed approach are compared with other baseline methods. Our proposed USVM and proposed UTSVM show better generalization performance compared to SVM, USVM, Twin SVM (TWSVM) and UTSVM. The proposed UTSVM has achieved highest classification accuracy of 99% for the healthy and seizure EEG signals. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The learners are distinguished analysing their brain patterns. EEG data were recorded during learning and memory tasks using 128 channels machine from a sample of thirty - four healthy university students. The students were shown the animated learning content in video format for eight minutes. The brain waves were measured during learning task. The study characterizes and distinguishes between the visual learners and non-visual learners considering the extracted brain patterns. The wavelet features are computed for the recorded EEG and are filtered into alpha and beta sub bands. These features are then given as an input to the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent neural network (RNN). Feature classification using LSTM Recurrent neural network has attained training accuracy of 89% and 85% for beta and alpha bands for Learning session 1(Learning 1), 86% and 87% for Learning session 2(Learning 2).

In this research, ankle flexion and extension tasks at two force levels in both legs, were classified from cortical current sources estimated by a hierarchical variational Bayesian method, using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings. The hierarchical prior for the current source estimation from EEG was obtained from activated brain areas and their intensities from an fMRI group (second-level) analysis. The fMRI group analysis was performed on regions of interest defined over the primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor area, and the somatosensory area, which are well-known to contribute to movement control. A sparse logistic regression method was applied for a nine-class classification (eight active tasks and a resting control task) obtaining a mean accuracy of 65.64% for time series of current sources, estimated from the EEG and the fMRI signals using a variational Bayesian method, and a mean accuracy of 22.19% for the classification of the pre-processed of EEG sensor signals, with a chance level of 11.11%. The higher classification accuracy of current sources, when compared to EEG classification accuracy, was attributed to the high number of sources and the different signal patterns obtained in the same vertex for different motor tasks. Since the inverse filter estimation for current sources can be done offline with the present method, the present method is applicable to real-time BCIs. Finally, due to the highly enhanced spatial distribution of current sources over the brain cortex, this method has the potential to identify activation patterns to design BCIs for the control of an affected limb in patients with stroke, or BCIs from motor imagery in patients with spinal cord injury.

Patients often report visual impairments and exhibit deficits of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and color vision, suggesting abnormal processing of visual information. Although electrophysiological studies indicate amplitude and latency differences in patients, one of the major challenges is the lack of a conclusive, accurate, non-invasive biomarker for diagnosis and monitoring of therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we used machine learning to model and identify the most relevant signs from the EEG spectra over the span of visual stimulation. First, we used human electroencephalography (EEG) to measure visual evoked responses during steady state (ssVEP) in a visual surround suppression paradigm, in which measures of gain control and temporal aspects of the visual response are simultaneously tracked. We found an excessive response gain profile of the contrast response function, and an abnormally greater background noise level in PD patients compared to healthy controls. Second, performance of three learning models was tested: logistic regression, decision tree and extra tree. Together, these provide powerful insights about the most relevant features that allow classifying patients from controls. These models contribute with new hints on the interpretation of functional abnormalities in PD based on spectral EEG during visual stimulation. Machine learning provides a promising tool for accurate and robust prediction in PD diagnosis, based on EEG signatures during visual information processing.	[Vanegas, M.

The blessing of Dimensionality: Feature Selection outperforms functional connectivity-based feature transformation to classify ADHD subjects from EEG patterns of phase synchronisation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BAYESIAN BELIEF NETWORKS; PROBABILISTIC INFERENCE; BRAIN NETWORKS; STATES; MEG; INTERDEPENDENCIES; SURROGATES; RELEVANCE; SIGNALS; GRAPHS	Functional connectivity (FC) characterizes brain activity from a multivariate set of N brain signals by means of an NxN matrix A, whose elements estimate the dependence within each possible pair of signals. Such matrix can be used as a feature vector for (un) supervised subject classification. Yet if N is large, A is highly dimensional. Little is known on the effect that different strategies to reduce its dimensionality may have on its classification ability. Here, we apply different machine learning algorithms to classify 33 children (age [6-14 years]) into two groups (healthy controls and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder patients) using EEG FC patterns obtained from two phase synchronisation indices. We found that the classification is highly successful (around 95%) if the whole matrix A is taken into account, and the relevant features are selected using machine learning methods. However, if FC algorithms are applied instead to transform A into a lower dimensionality matrix, the classification rate drops to less than 80%. We conclude that, for the purpose of pattern classification, the relevant features should be selected among the elements of A by using appropriate machine learning algorithms.

Of particular interest, neural decoding methods have rapidly developed over the last decade in neuroscience, allowing us to estimate the contents of human perception and subjective mental states by capturing brain activity patterns. However, the development of neural decoding will generate significant concern about privacy violation. In this manuscript, we propose a secure network BMI decoding method based on sparse coding for a covert spatial attention task. It is shown that secure sparse coding enables us to not only protect observed EEG signals, but also achieve the same estimation performance as that offered by sparse coding with unprotected observed signals.

Modern computer technology shows that different stages of epileptic seizure can be classified by machine learning and pattern recognition. The main work of this paper proposed an automatic seizure detection approach methodically. First the EEG signals were decomposed into respective brain rhythms waves, then the Hurst index were used as features to design discriminative classifiers to classify inter-ictal and ictal EEG segments. The performance of the model was evaluated on the public and private datasets. The results revealed the good accuracy. Thus, this paper may serve as a benchmark in seizure detection procedure and advance the classification accuracy of a seizure.

The proposed technique uses independent component analysis to extract independent components (ICs) from the EEG signal and each extracted IC is transformed into an image termed as brain maps. Two feature extraction techniques namely closed neighbourhood gradient pattern (CNGP) and combined texture pattern (CTP) are propounded for automatic elimination of artefact brain maps. The extracted features are fed into the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) for automatic detection of epileptic brain maps. Extensive experimental result over the existing image processing techniques in literature demonstrates that the texture pattern representations of CNGP and CTP are improved to obtain better features to enhance the performance of texture classification. The obtained result shows that the LSSVM classifier with Gaussian RBF kernel is able to detect the epileptic brain map with a high accuracy rate. The results are reliable and it assists the neurologist to diagnose epileptic signals effortlessly by visually locating the brain area being affected by seizure activities.

For brain decoding, electroencephalography (EEG), which allows the observation of the electrophysiological activities of neurons, is widely used to observe brain activity. In particular, an EEG read from electrodes installed on a scalp, which has some advantages when it comes to cost, size, and ease of measurement, is a promising recording method for producing noninvasive BMIs against magnetoencephalograms, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and so on. However, an EEG signal has low spatial resolution and is highly affected by noise. Moreover, the recoding of an EEG is time-consuming and tires BMI users. Therefore, signal processing techniques that can robustly extract brain activity patterns from EEG signals with a low signal-to-noise ratio and a small sample size are necessary. One approach to achieve such techniques is to incorporate additional information retrieved separately from an EEG in signal processing. This chapter describes some techniques that can accomplish this. The signal structures include physical structures, such as the location of the electrodes, and functional structures, such as synchronizing brain regions. The discussion on the importance of the signal structures in a source analysis of EEG signals that can improve the BMI performance will be discussed in this chapter. In contrast to a source analysis, which finds the brain patterns in a source domain, regularization incorporating the signal structures in a sensor domain will be discussed. Moreover, we will show the signal processing in a graph spectral domain that is a vector space derived from the signal structure.

EEG signals are decomposed into the gamma, beta, alpha and theta frequency bands using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and spectral features are extracted from each frequency band. Principle component analysis (PCA) is applied to the extracted features by preserving the same dimensionality, as a transform, to make the features mutually uncorrelated. Support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and artificial neural network (ANN) are used to classify emotional states. The cross-validated SVM with radial basis function (RBF) kernel using extracted features of 10 EEG channels, performs with 91.3% accuracy for arousal and 91.1% accuracy for valence, both in the beta frequency band. Our approach shows better performance compared to existing algorithms applied to the "DEAP" dataset.

J	Shin, J; Kwon, J; Im, CH				Shin, Jaeyoung; Kwon, Jinuk; Im, Chang-Hwan			A Ternary Hybrid EEG-NIRS Brain-Computer Interface for the Classification of Brain Activation Patterns during Mental Arithmetic, Motor Imagery, and Idle State	FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS			English	Article						brain-computer interface; mental arithmetic; motor imagery; electroencephalography (EEG); near infrared spectroscopy(NIRS); pattern recognition	SPATIAL FILTERS; BCI; PERFORMANCE; COMMUNICATION; SPECTROSCOPY; SYSTEM	The performance of a brain-computer interface (BCI) can be enhanced by simultaneously using two or more modalities to record brain activity, which is generally referred to as a hybrid BCI. To date, many BCI researchers have tried to implement a hybrid BCI system by combining electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to improve the overall accuracy of binary classification. However, since hybrid EEG-NIRS BCI, which will be denoted by hBCI in this paper, has not been applied to ternary classification problems, paradigms and classification strategies appropriate for ternary classification using hBCI are not well investigated. Here we propose the use of an hBCI for the classification of three brain activation patterns elicited by mental arithmetic, motor imagery, and idle state, with the aim to elevate the information transfer rate (ITR) of hBCI by increasing the number of classes while minimizing the loss of accuracy. EEG electrodes were placed over the prefrontal cortex and the central cortex, and NIRS optodes were placed only on the forehead. The ternary classification problem was decomposed into three binary classification problems using the "one-versus-one" (OVO) classification strategy to apply the filter-bank common spatial patterns filter to EEG data. A 10 x 10-fold cross validation was performed using shrinkage linear discriminant analysis (sLDA) to evaluate the average classification accuracies for EEG-BCI, NIRS-BCI, and hBCI when the meta-classification method was adopted to enhance classification accuracy. The ternary classification accuracies for EEG-BCI, NIRS-BCI, and hBCI were 76.1 +/- 12.8, 64.1 +/- 9.7, and 82.2 +/- 10.2%, respectively. The classification accuracy of the proposed hBCI was thus significantly higher than those of the other BCIs (p < 0.005). The average ITR for the proposed hBCI was calculated to be 4.70 +/- 1.92 bits/minute, which was 34.3% higher than that reported for a previous binary hBCI study.

By using the Muse headband with four EEG sensors (TP9, AF7, AF8, TP10), we categorised three possible states such as relaxing, neutral and concentrating based on a few states of mind defined by cognitive behavioural studies. We have created a dataset with five individuals and sessions lasting one minute for each class of mental state in order to train and test different methods. Given the proposed set of features extracted from the EEG headband five signals (alpha, beta, theta, delta, gamma), we have tested a combination of different features selection algorithms and classifier models to compare their performance in terms of recognition accuracy and number of features needed. Different tests such as 10-fold cross validation were performed. Results show that only 44 features from a set of over 2100 features are necessary when used with classical classifiers such as Bayesian Networks, Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, attaining an overall accuracy over 87%.

In this paper, we analyzed evoked potentials as neurophysiological indicators and developed a model based on signal processing and machine learning techniques to find descriptive patterns that allow the differentiation of familiar and unfamiliar faces. We considered wave components such as P1, N170, N250, P300, and N400 to describe the events. Morphological analysis and wavelet transform were used for the feature extraction stage, and support vector machines and binomial logistic regression were evaluated for the classification stage. The best classification results were obtained with the morphological characteristics, where the highest classification accuracy was 80% on average.

While existing MDA methods use heuristic optimisation procedures based on an ambiguous Tucker structure, we propose a rigorous approach via optimisation on the cross-product of Stiefel manifolds. We also introduce MDA methods with the PARAFAC structure. We compare the proposed approaches to existing MDA methods and unsupervised multilinear decompositions. Results: We find that manifold optimisation substantially improves MDA objective functions relative to existing methods and on simulated data in general improve classification performance. However, we find similar classification performance when applied to the electroencephalography data. Furthermore, supervised approaches substantially outperform unsupervised mulitilinear methods whereas methods with the PARAFAC structure perform similarly to those with Tucker structures. Notably, despite applying the MDA procedures to raw Brain-Computer Interface data, their performances are on par with results employing ample pre-processing and they extract discriminatory patterns similar to the brain activity known to be elicited in the investigated EEG paradigms. Conclusion: The proposed usage of manifold optimisation constitutes the first rigorous and monotonous optimisation approach for MDA methods and allows for MDA with the PARAFAC structure. Our results show that MDA methods applied to raw EEG data can extract discriminatory patterns when compared to traditional unsupervised multilinear feature extraction approaches, whereas the proposed PARAFAC structured MDA models provide meaningful patterns of activity.

Although significant progress has been made in emotion recognition for music, image and video stimuli, it remains largely unexplored for immersive virtual stimuli. Our main objective for this line of investigation is to enable consistently reliable emotion recognition for virtual reality stimuli using only cheap, commercial-off-the-shelf electroencephalography (EEG) headsets which have significantly less recording channels and far lower signal resolution commonly called "Wearable EEG" as opposed to medical-grade EEG headsets with the ultimate goal of applying EEG-based emotion prediction to procedurally-generated affective content such as immersive computer games and virtual learning environments through machine learning. Our prior preliminary study has found that the use of a 4-channel, 256-Hz was indeed able to perform the required emotion recognition tasks from VR stimuli albeit at classification rates of between 65-89% classification accuracy only using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers. For this particular study, we attempt to improve the classification rates to above 95% by conducting a comprehensive investigation into the use of various deep neural-based learning architectures for this domain. By tuning the deep neural classifiers in terms of the number of hidden layers, number of hidden nodes and the nodal dropout ratio, the emotion prediction accuracy was able to be improved to over 96%. This shows the continued promise of the application of wearable EEG for emotion prediction as a cost-effective and user-friendly approach for consistent and reliable prediction deployment in virtual reality-related content and environments through deep learning approaches.

An effective approach to classify epileptic EEG signal using local neighbor gradient pattern transformation methods	AUSTRALASIAN PHYSICAL & ENGINEERING SCIENCES IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Local neighbor gradient pattern (LNGP); Symmetrically weighted local neighbor gradient pattern (SWLNGP); Electroencephalographic (EEG); Epileptic detection; Artificial neural network (ANN)	SEIZURE DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; BINARY PATTERN; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; DOMAIN	Electroencephalographic (EEG) signal records the neuronal activity in the brain and it is used in the diagnosis of epileptic seizure activities. Human inspection of non-stationary EEG signal for diagnosing epilepsy is cumbersome, time-consuming and inaccurate. In this paper an effective automatic approach to detect epilepsy using two feature extraction techniques namely local neighbor gradient pattern (LNGP) and symmetrically weighted local neighbor gradient pattern (SWLNGP) are proposed. Extracted features are fed into machine learning algorithms like k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), quadratic linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, ensemble classifier and artificial neural network (ANN) to classify the EEG signals. In this study, the classification performance for 17 different cases using 10-fold cross validation with the following classification problems are executed (i) healthy-ictal, (ii) interictal-ictal, (iii) healthy-interictal, (iv) seizure free-ictal and (v) healthy-interictal-ictal. The experimental result shows that in all the cases LNGP and SWLNGP attained higher classification accuracy using ANN. Further, the computational performance and the classification accuracy of the proposed methods are compared with the recently proposed techniques for epileptic detection. It shows that the performance of LNGP and SWLNGP method with ANN classifier are superior over other recently proposed techniques for the aforesaid problems. Hence, the proposed methods are simple, fast, reliable and easily implementable for real-time epileptic detection.	[Sairamya, N. J.; George, S. Thomas; Subathra, M. S.

However, the successful application of these methods in motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), in order to boost classification performance, is still limited. In this paper, we propose a classification framework for MI data by introducing a new temporal representation of the data and also utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for classification. The new representation is generated from modifying the filter-bank common spatial patterns method, and the CNN is designed and optimized accordingly for the representation. Our framework outperforms the best classification method in the literature on the BCI competition IV-2a 4-class MI data set by 7% increase in average subject accuracy.

J	Mishuhina, V; Jiang, XD				Mishuhina, Vasilisa; Jiang, Xudong			Feature Weighting and Regularization of Common Spatial Patterns in EEG-Based Motor Imagery BCI	IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); common spatial patterns (CSP); electroencephalography (EEG); motor imagery (MI)	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; FACE RECOGNITION; SPECTRAL PATTERNS; CLASSIFICATION; FILTERS; DIMENSIONALITY; EXTRACTION	Electroencephalography signals have very low spatial resolution and electrodes capture signals that are overlapping each other. To extract the discriminative features and alleviate overfitting problem for motor imagery brain-computer interface (BCI), spatial filtering is widely applied but often only very few common spatial patterns (CSP) are selected as features while ignoring all others. However, using only few CSP features, though alleviates overfitting problem, loses the discriminating information, which limits the BCI performance. This letter proposes a novel feature weighting and regularization (FWR) method that utilizes all CSP features to avoid information loss. The proposed method can be applied in all CSP-based approaches. Experiments of this letter show the effect of the proposed method applied in the standard CSP and its two extensions, common spatio-spectral patterns and regularized CSP. Results on BCI Competition III Dataset IIIa and IV Dataset IIa demonstrate that the proposed FWR method enhances the classification accuracy comparing to the conventional feature selection approaches.

J	He, Q; Wang, YW; Du, S; Chen, XL; Xie, P				He Qun; Wang Yu-Wen; Du Shuo; Chen Xiao-Ling; Xie Ping			Motor imagery based on adaptive parameterless empirical wavelet transform and selective integrated classification	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						adaptive parameterless empirical wavelet transform; selective integrated classification model; motor imagery; brain-computer interface	EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; BRAIN	Improving recognition rate of motor imagery (MI) -related electroencephalography (EEG) is of great importance for numerous brain computer interface (BCI) applications. However, the performance of a typical BCI system greatly relies on the effectiveness of the extracted features from raw EEG signals and the ability of the classifier to correctly identify different MI patterns. Therefore, in this paper, a new recognition method based on adaptive parameterless empirical wavelet transform (APEWT) and selective integrated classification model is proposed to enhance the classification accuracy of MI-related EEG signal. First, the APEWT is used to decompose EEG signals from different MI patterns into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), each of which contains different rhythm information over different frequency bands. Then several related modes are optimally selected based on the correlation coefficients calculated between each IMF component and the original signal to reconstruct EEG signals. Next, in order to further extract useful pattern information from both the time domain and frequency domain, the energy spectrum features of multiple time segments from the reconstructed signals and marginal spectrum features of different frequency bands corresponding to those selected modes are investigated, respectively. Finally, the extracted multiple features from time domain and frequency domain are input into the selective integrated classification model to build an MI recognition system. The selective integrated classification model consists of several extreme learning machines (ELMs) as the basic classifiers, different weights are assigned, respectively, to ELM basic classifiers based on their corresponding classification performances, and several basic ELM classifiers with good performances are selected to construct the final integrated model. The proposed method is evaluated on two public datasets, including BCI Competition II dataset III and BCI Competition IV dataset 2 b, and is compared with four different combination methods where different features in time domain or frequency domain in the feature extraction stage and different ELMs based classification models are considered. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperformed four combination methods and the existing methods recently reported in the literature using the same datasets in terms of classification accuracy and area under the ROC curve receiver operating characteristic metric. Specifically, our proposed method achieves the highest average classification accuracy (89.95%) in the compared methods, which indicates its better classification performance and generalization capability. In addition, the proposed method exhibits high computational efficiency, thus providing a new solution for online recognition of MI-related BCI and having the potential to be embedded in a practical system for controlling an external device.

This article reports a novel method for detecting such reactivation in standard sleep recordings. During learning, participants produced a complex sequence of finger presses, with each finger cued by a distinct audio-visual stimulus. Auditory cues were then re-played during subsequent sleep to trigger neural reactivation through a method known as targeted memory reactivation (TMR). Next, we used electroencephalography data from the learning session to train a machine learning classifier, and then applied this classifier to sleep data to determine how successfully each tone had elicited memory reactivation. Neural reactivation was classified above chance in all participants when TMR was applied in SWS, and in 5 of the 14 participants to whom TMR was applied in N2. Classification success reduced across numerous repetitions of the tone cue, suggesting either a gradually reducing responsiveness to such cues or a plasticity-related change in the neural signature as a result of cueing. We believe this method will be valuable for future investigations of memory consolidation.

Such variations limit the amount of data that can be used to train machine learning models, rendering BCIs highly subject specific and requiring tedious calibration and retraining before each usage in order to achieve optimal performance. This chapter presents state-of-the-art approaches to calibration-free and improved decoding through transfer learning techniques from multiple subjects and sessions. Within the feature space, a generalized framework for the popular common spatial patterns is described in terms of covariance regularization with multiple subjects. Recent methods using Riemannian features offer invariance to spatial characteristics between subjects and sessions. Finally, a probabilistic Bayesian multitask learning framework is presented that works on top of feature spaces and learns prior distribution over decision rules of different subjects and sessions. The mathematical details are left in for more technically inclined readers, but intuitions and (when applicable) code bases are referenced for the more pragmatic developer.

Due to the wide spectrum of video games, the success of a particular game depends on how efficiently it is able to capture the end users' attention. This leads to the need to analyse the cognitive aspects of the end user, that is the game player, during game play. A direct window to see how an end user responds to a stimuli is to look at their brain activity. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) is used to record human brain activity during game play. A commercially available EEG headset is used for this purpose giving fourteen channels of recorded EEG brain activity. The aim is to classify a player as expert or novice using the brain activity as the player indulges in the game play. Three different machine learning classifiers have been used to train and test the system. Among the classifiers, naive Bayes has outperformed others with an accuracy of 88%, when data from all fourteen EEG channels are used. Furthermore, the activity observed on electrodes is statistically analysed and mapped for brain visualizations. The analysis has shown that out of the available fourteen channels, only four channels in the frontal and occipital brain regions show significant activity. Features of these four channels are then used, and the performance parameters of the four-channel classification are compared to the results of the fourteen-channel classification. It has been observed that support vector machine and the naive Bayes give good classification accuracy and processing time, well suited for real-time applications.

Decoding Neural Correlates of Cognitive States to Enhance Driving Experience	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TOPICS IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Brain-machine interface; EEG; error-related potentials; anticipation; movement related potentials; slow cortical potentials; classification; car simulator	DRIVER BEHAVIOR; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; DROWSINESS; ALERTNESS; FUSION; TIME	Modern ears can support their drivers by assessing and autonomously performing different driving maneuvers based on information gathered by in-car sensors. We propose that brain- machine interfaces (BMIs) can provide complementary information that can ease the interaction with intelligent cars in order to enhance the driving experience. In our approach, the human remains in control, while a BMI is used to monitor the driver's cognitive state and use that information to modulate the assistance provided by the intelligent car. In this paper, we gather our proof-of-concept studies demonstrating the feasibility of decoding electroencephalography correlates of upcoming actions and those reflecting whether the decisions of driving assistant systems are in-line with the drivers' intentions. Experimental results while driving both simulated and real cars consistently showed neural signatures of anticipation, movement preparation, and error processing. Remarkably, despite the increased noise inherent to real scenarios, these signals can he decoded on a single-trial basis, reflecting some of the cognitive processes that take place while driving. However, moderate decoding performance compared to the controlled experimental BMI paradigms indicate there exists room for improvement of the machine learning methods typically used in the state-of-the-art BMIs. We foresee that neural fusion correlates with information extracted from other physiological measures, e.g., eye movements or electromyography as well as contextual information gathered by in-car sensors will allow intelligent cars to provide timely and tailored assistance only if it is required; thus, keeping the user in the loop and allowing him to fully enjoy the driving experience.

The aim of this novel study was to investigate the identification of peoples' attention to a specific auditory object from single-trial EEG signals via entropy measures and machine learning. Approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SampEn), composite multiscale entropy (CmpMSE) and fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn) were used to extract the informative features of EEG signals under three kinds of auditory object-specific attention (Rest, Auditory Object1 Attention (AOA1) and Auditory Object2 Attention (AOA2)). The linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine (SVM), were used to construct two auditory attention classifiers. The statistical results of entropy measures indicated that there were significant differences in the values of ApEn, SampEn, CmpMSE and FuzzyEn between Rest, AOA1 and AOA2. For the SVM-based auditory attention classifier, the auditory object-specific attention of Rest, AOA1 and AOA2 could be identified from EEG signals using ApEn, SampEn, CmpMSE and FuzzyEn as features and the identification rates were significantly different from chance level. The optimal identification was achieved by the SVM-based auditory attention classifier using CmpMSE with the scale factor tau = 10. This study demonstrated a novel solution to identify the auditory object-specific attention from single-trial EEG signals without the need to access the auditory stimulus.

Due to the sudden and unexpected electrical discharges occurring in the brain, epilepsy occurs and is a most commonly occurring neurological disorder next to stroke. For the easy monitoring of the activities of the brain, Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used. For the primary purpose of assessment of brain activities, EEG serves as a valuable treasure and an indispensable tool. The various information related to the physiological state of the brain can be bought out by EEG. For the analysis of the EEG records in a visual manner, expert neurologists consume more time and to detect the epileptic seizures, only EEG signals are used widely as it contains vital information. The EEG recording contains a lot of noise and so it is difficult to isolate the seizures from other artifacts with resembles more or less similar time-frequency patterns. Various automatic detection and machine learning algorithms have been used to predict the risk of epileptic seizures in raw EEG signals. In this study, the dimensions of the EEG signals are reduced initially with the help of two approaches, namely, Expectation Maximization Based Principal Component Analysis (EM-PCA) approach and Hessian Local Linear Embedding (HLLE) approach. The dimensionally reduced values are then classified to predict the risk of epilepsy from EEG signals with the help of two post classifiers namely Weighted K Nearest Neighbour (WKNN) and Linear Support Vector Machine (L-SVM). The performance metrics are analyzed in terms of various measures like Performance Index, Accuracy, Time Delay, Specificity and Sensitivity. The study shows that the best result is obtained when HLLE is used as a dimensionality reduction technique and classified with WKNN as it gives the highest perfect classification rate with an average accuracy of 97.743%.

We evaluated the performance of machine learning algorithms for predicting mortality in a database of 414 critically ill children undergoing cEEG in the ICU. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the test subset was highest for stepwise selection/elimination models (AUC = 0.82) followed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and support vector machine with linear kernel (AUC = 0.79), and random forest (AUC = 0.71). The explanatory models had the poorest discriminative performance (AUC = 0.63 for the model without considering etiology and AUC = 0.45 for the model considering etiology). Using few variables and a relatively small number of patients, machine learning techniques added information to explanatory models for prediction of in-hospital mortality.

To date, many attempts have been made to reveal the underlying mechanisms of humans' gait. However, decoding cortical processes associated with different walking conditions using EEG signals for gait-pattern classification is a less-explored research area. In this paper, we design an EEG-based experiment with four walking conditions (i.e., free walking, and exoskeleton-assisted walking at zero, low, and high assistive forces by the use of a unilateral exoskeleton to right lower limb). We proposed spatio-spectral representation learning (SSRL), a deep neural network topology with shared weights to learn the spatial and spectral representations of multi-channel EEG signals during walking. Adoption of weight sharing reduces the number of free parameters, while learning spatial and spectral equivariant features. SSRL outperformed state-of-the-art methods in decoding gait patterns, achieving a classification accuracy of 77.8%. Moreover, the features extracted in the intermediate layer of SSRL were observed to be more discriminative than the hand-crafted features. When analyzing the weights of the proposed model, we found an intriguing spatial distribution that is consistent with the distribution found in well-known motor-activated cortical regions. Our results show that SSRL advances the ability to decode human locomotion and it could have important implications for exoskeleton design, rehabilitation processes, and clinical diagnosis.

The exoskeleton follows the wearer's motion intention through decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) signals and multi-modal cognition. Motion patterns as standing up, sitting down, and walking forward can be performed. We implemented two types of BCIs, one based on steady-state visual evoked potentials, which used canonical correlation analysis to extract the frequency the subject focused on. The other BCI is based on motor imagery, where the common spatial patterns method was employed to extract the features from the EEG signal. Then, the features were classified by support vector machine to recognize the intention of the subject. We invited four healthy subjects to participate in the experiments, including off-line and online. The off-line experiments trained the classifier and then were used online to test the performance of the BCI controlled exoskeleton system. The results showed high accuracy rate in motion intention classification tasks for both BCIs.

The ability to detect excitement has many potential applications such as in affective entertainment, neuromarketing and particularly in virtual reality computer gaming Users arc exposed to a roller -coaster experience as the emotional stimuli, which is expected to evoke the emotion of excitement, while simultaneously wearing virtual reality goggles, which delivers the virtual reality experience of excitement, and an EEG headset, which acquires the raw brain signals detected when exposed to this excitement stimuli. In this study, a deep learning approach is used to improve the excitement detection rate to well above the 90% accuracy level. In a prior similar study, the use of conventional machine learning approaches involving k -Nearest Neighbour (kNN) classifiers and Support Vector Machines (SVM) only achieved prediction accuracy rates of between 65-89%. Using a deep learning approach here, rates of 78-96% were achieved. This demonstrates the superiority of adopting a deep learning approach over other machine learning approaches for detecting human excitement when immersed in an immersive virtual reality environment.

Extreme Learning Machine for Distinction of EEG Signal Pattern of Dyslexic Children in Writing	2018 IEEE-EMBS CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND SCIENCES (IECBES)	IEEE EMBS Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE-EMBS Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Sciences (IECBES)	DEC 03-06, 2018	Kuching, MALAYSIA	SARAWAK Convent Bur, Physiolog Measurement		EEG; Dyslexia; Wavelet Transform; ELM; RBF	CLASSIFICATION	Dyslexia is neurological disorder that affects the brain ability to process symbols such as letters and numbers. The process of writing involves learning pathway that can be monitored non-invasively using electroencephalogram (EEG). Majority EEG based studies on dyslexia have been on reading. Here, in this paper, an extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier with radial basis function (RBF) kernel is employed to distinguish between normal, poor and capable dyslexic subjects, from EEG signals of their writing. The RBF kernel allows its center and width randomly to be generated, such that the output weights of RBF networks can be calculated analytically instead of being iteratively tuned, resulting in faster learning speed. Power band coefficients of beta and beta/theta ratio are extracted using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with Daubechies family order 2, 4, 6 and 8 to serve as inputs to the classifier. From the experimental results, it is found that Db2 yields the highest accuracy at 89% and the best ROC performance for the three cohorts.	[Zainuddin, A. Z.

The physiological signals for classification by machine learning were measured during the sustained attention task of simulated driving. The features were sorted by their degree of importance using three types of ranking filters and the combined information. The effect of the feature size of the biological signals on machine learning was evaluated by determining the mean squared error. The classifications were conducted with various datasets and dataset lengths that were obtained from the same biological signals considering the transitional traits of drowsiness. The statistical measures of the performance of the classifications using machine learning indicated that the system based on the ear canal EEG data and the physiological attribute data was excellent. The feature selection process with the composite ranking algorithm using multiple ranking methods improved the classification performance. The nonlinear features were highly selective among the physiological attributes for the intelligent recognition of drowsiness. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Deep learning with artificial neural networks has recently seen increasing attention as a new approach in brain signal decoding. Here, we apply a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks to mu ECoG data obtained with a wireless, chronically implanted system in an ovine animal model. Regularized linear discriminant analysis (rLDA), a filter bank component spatial pattern (FBCSP) algorithm and convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) were applied to auditory evoked responses captured by mu ECoG. We show that compared with rLDA and FBCSP, significantly higher decoding accuracy can be obtained by ConvNets trained in an end-to-end manner, i.e., without any predefined signal features. Deep learning thus proves a promising technique for mu ECoG-based brain-machine interfacing applications.	[Wang, X.; Gkogkidis, C. A.; Schirrmeister, R. T.; Heilmeyer, F.

To overcome the limitations, this study introduced the electroencephalography (EEG)-measured error-related potentials (ErrPs) to train a robotic RL system based on a brain-computer interface (BCI). We decoded ErrP signals by selecting human preferences in real-time to train robotic behavior by deep RL during a binary object selection task. Twelve healthy subjects participated in the ErrP experiments, in which they were asked to select and adjust self-favored behavior after a machine's random selections. The decoded ErrP signals classified by a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to achieve an average classification accuracy and an area under the ROC curve of 67.49% and 0.639, respectively. By using the well-trained ErrP signals classifier to train the deep RL system, our final results for training robotic behavior through ErrP-based preferences showed an average of 15.21% improvement in efficiency while obtaining acceptable rewards in RL. Thus, the work used brain signals instead of pressing or clicking buttons as the rewards of RL, and constructed a real-time and free from interaction interference intuitive RL system.

A fingertip force prediction model for grasp patterns characterised from the chaotic behaviour of EEG	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Motor imagery; Grasp pattern; Chaos; Fingertip force; NAR; Slippage detection	TARGETED MUSCLE REINNERVATION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CONTROLLED ROBOTIC ARM; NETWORK; RECOGNITION; TETRAPLEGIA; MOVEMENTS; HUMANS	A stable grasp is attained through appropriate hand preshaping and precise fingertip forces. Here, we have proposed a method to decode grasp patterns from motor imagery and subsequent fingertip force estimation model with a slippage avoidance strategy. We have developed a feature-based classification of electroencephalography (EEG) associated with imagination of the grasping postures. Chaotic behaviour of EEG for different grasping patterns has been utilised to capture the dynamics of associated motor activities. We have computed correlation dimension (CD) as the feature and classified with one against one multiclass support vector machine (SVM) to discriminate between different grasping patterns. The result of the analysis showed varying classification accuracies at different subband levels. Broad categories of grasping patterns, namely, power grasp and precision grasp, were classified at a 96.0% accuracy rate in the alpha subband. Furthermore, power grasp subtypes were classified with an accuracy of 97.2% in the upper beta subband, whereas precision grasp subtypes showed relatively lower 75.0% accuracy in the alpha subband. Following assessment of fingertip force distributions while grasping, a nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) model with proper prediction of fingertip forces was proposed for each grasp pattern. A slippage detection strategy has been incorporated with automatic recalibration of the regripping force. Intention of each grasp pattern associated with corresponding fingertip force model was virtualised in this work. This integrated system can be utilised as the control strategy for prosthetic hand in the future.

The selection of control signals, e.g., the channel configuration and decoding algorithm, plays a vital role in the online performance and progressing of BCI control. While several offline analyses report the effect of these factors on BCI accuracy for a single session-performance increases asymptotically by increasing the number of channels, saturates, and then decreases-no online study, to the best of our knowledge, has yet been performed to compare for a single session or across training. The purpose of the current study is to assess, in a group of forty-five subjects, the effect of channel number and decoding method on the progression of BCI performance across multiple training sessions and the corresponding neurophysiological changes. The 45 subjects were divided into three groups using Laplacian Filtering (LAP/S) with nine channels, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP/L) with 40 channels and CSP (CSP/S)with nine channels for online decoding. At the first training session, subjects using CSP/L displayed no significant difference compared to CSP/S but a higher average BCI performance over those using LAP/S. Despite the average performance when using the LAP/S method was initially lower, but LAP/S displayed improvement over first three sessions, whereas the other two groups did not. Additionally, analysis of the recorded EEG during BCI control indicates that the LAP/S produces control signals that are more strongly correlated with the target location and a higher R-square value was shown at the fifth session. In the present study, we found that subjects' average online BCI performance using a large EEG montage does not show significantly better performance after the first session than a smallermontage comprised of a common subset of these electrodes. The LAP/S method with a small EEG montage allowed the subjects to improve their skills across sessions, but no improvement was shown for the CSP method.

These disorders can be diagnosed by automatic classification of normal and alcohol electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, because it provides neurophysiology of alcoholic human brain. In this study, EEG rhythms based features are proposed for automatic identification and analysis of alcohol EEG signals. The instantaneous-frequency computed by analytic representation of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) is used for separation of different frequency ranges known as EEG rhythms. IMFs are obtained by applying empirical mode decomposition on an EEG signal. The variability and complexity of separated EEG rhythms are measured by features namely: mean absolute deviation, inter quartile range, coefficient of variation, entropy, and neg-entropy. The p-value analysis of these features shows that low-frequency (LF)-rhythms based features are statistically significant for identification and neurological analysis of alcohol EEG signals. The LF-rhythms based features are applied as input to an extreme learning machine (ELM) and least squares support vector machine classifiers for classification of normal and alcohol EEG signals. The proposed method with an ELM classifier provides better classification accuracy (97.92%) as compared with other existing methods.

If there is lack of pattern in the data sets, it will affect the classification accuracy of the results. Consistency in extracted data-epoch requires precise markers to be embedded along the continuous Electroencephalography (EEG) data collection process. This study suggests placing the markers on actual movement through Electromyography (EMG) data classifications during isometric finger flexion and extension. An EMG-based marker system is applied to generate marker in EEG signal during data measurement in real time. EEGLAB software is used for pre-processing. The data loaded into the BCILAB interface for chosen feature extraction and classification. Spectrally weighted Common Spatial Pattern (Spec-CSP) used as feature extraction method and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is implemented for classification process. Results show that EMG-based marker approach shows higher potential success rate, at 73.6% compared to visual cue-based marker at 71.1%. It is suggested that EMG-based marker approach is applicable in finding pattern recognition of EEG data in isometric finger flexion and extension. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Brain signals can be used to extract relevant features to decode various limb movement parameters such as the direction of upper limb movements. Amplitude based feature extraction techniques have been used to study such motor activity of upper limbs whereas phase synchrony, used to estimate functional relationship between signals, has rarely been used to study single hand movements in different directions. Approach. In this paper, a novel phase-locking-based feature extraction method, called wavelet phase-locking value (W-PLV) is proposed to analyse synchronous EEG channel-pairs and classify hand movement directions. EEG data collected from seven subjects performing right hand movements in four orthogonal directions in the horizontal plane is used for this analysis. Main results. Our proposed W-PLV based method achieves a mean binary classification accuracy of 76.85% over seven subjects using wavelet levels corresponding to <= 12 Hz EEG. The results also show direction-dependent information in various wavelet levels and indicate the presence of relevant information in slow cortical potentials (<1 Hz) as well as higher wavelet levels (<= 12 Hz). Significance. This study presents a thorough analysis of the phase-locking patterns extracted from EEG corresponding to hand movements in different directions using W-PLV across various wavelet levels and verifies their discriminative ability in the single trial binary classification of hand movement directions.

The combined approach of S-Transform and Common Spatial Pattern is established as an efficient technique for binary class Brain Computer Interface implementation. The method is carried out in four methodological steps. In the first step, Electroencephalogram signals are decomposed into time-frequency sub-bands using S Transform based decomposition technique. The S-Transform coefficients are grouped to represent distinct frequency sub-bands of Electroencephalogram activity in the second step. In the third step, the Common Spatial Pattern method is applied on fundamental sub-bands to prepare discriminative feature vector. The classification of motor imagery signals is performed using three soft computing techniques viz. Least Square-Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network in the fourth step. Classification results illustrate the efficacy of proposed technique in motor imagery signal classification task.	[Sethi, S.; Upadhyay, R.; Singh, H.

As EEG recordings contain a vast amount of data, which is heterogeneous with respect to a time-period, we intend to introduce a clustering technique to discover different groups of data according to similarities or dissimilarities among the patterns. In the proposed methodology, we use K-means clustering for partitioning each category EEG data set (e.g. healthy; epileptic seizure) into several clusters and then extract some representative characteristics from each cluster. Subsequently, we integrate all the features from all the clusters in one feature set and then evaluate that feature set by three well-known machine learning methods: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive bayes and Logistic regression. The proposed method is tested by a publicly available benchmark database: 'Epileptic EEG database'. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme with SVM classifier yields overall accuracy of 100% for classifying healthy vs epileptic seizure signals and outperforms all the recent reported existing methods in the literature. The major finding of this research is that the proposed K-means clustering based approach has an ability to efficiently handle EEG data for the detection of epileptic seizure.

Recent research has shown that nonlinear classification algorithms perform better than their linear counterparts, but most of them cannot extract sufficient significant information which leads to a less efficient classification. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called FDDL-ELM, which combines the discriminative power of extreme learning machine (ELM) with the reconstruction capability of sparse representation. Firstly, the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is adopted to perform spatial filtering on raw EEG data to enhance the task-related neural activity. Secondly, the Fisher discrimination criterion is employed to learn a structured dictionary and obtain sparse coding coefficients from the filtered data, and these discriminative coefficients are then used to acquire the reconstructed feature representations. Finally, a nonlinear classifier ELM is used to identify these features in different MI tasks. The proposed method is evaluated on 2-class Datasets IVa and IIIa of BCI Competition III and 4-class Dataset Ha of BCI Competition IV. Experimental results show that our method achieved superior performance than the other existing algorithms and yielded the accuracies of 80.68%, 87.54%, and 63.76% across all subjects in the above-mentioned three datasets, respectively.

This study employs the OA to determine representative sample points from the original EEG data and then applies periodogram (PD), autoregressive (AR), and the mixture of PD and AR to extract the discriminative features from each OA sample group. The obtained feature sets are evaluated by three popular machine learning methods: support vector machine (SVM), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and k-nearest neighbour (k-NN). Several output coding approaches of the SVM classifier are tested for selecting the best feature sets. This scheme was implemented on a benchmark epileptic EEG database for evaluation and also compared with existing methods. The experimental results show that the OA_AR feature set yields better performances by the SVM with an overall accuracy of 100%, and outperforms the state-of-the-art works with a 14.1% improvement. Thus, the findings of this study prove that the proposed OA-based AR scheme has significant potential to extract features from EEG signals. The proposed method will assist experts to automatically analyse a large volume of EEG data and benefit epilepsy research.

The models state that EFs highly correlate with each other but also have some individual variance which makes them separable processes. Since this theory has mostly been substantiated with behavioral data like reaction time and the ability to execute a task correctly, the aim of this paper is to find evidence for diversity (unique properties) of the EFs updating and inhibition in neural correlates of EEG data by means of using brain-computer interface (BCI) methods as a research tool. To highlight the benefit of this approach we compare this new methodology to classical analysis approaches. Methods: An existing study has been reinvestigated by applying neurophysiological analysis in combination with support vector machine (SVM) classification on recorded electroencephalography (EEG) data to determine the separability and variety of the two EFs updating and inhibition on a single trial basis. Results: The SVM weights reveal a set of distinct features as well as a set of shared features for the two EFs updating and inhibition in the theta and the alpha band power. Significance: In this paper we find evidence that correlates for unity and diversity of EFs can be found in neurophysiological data. Machine learning approaches reveal shared but also distinct properties for the EFs. This study shows that using methods from brain-computer interface (BCI) research, like machine learning, as a tool for the validation of psychological models and theoretical constructs is a new approach that is highly versatile and could lead to many new insights.

In this paper, we combine convolutional neural network and Long Short-Term Memory (CNN+LSTM) with center loss function to classify EEG signals. The 1 x 3 kernels as convolutional filters in 2D CNNs will be used, which is different from other models. Deep metric learning is usually used for image classification such as face recognition. In this paper, we use center loss function to learn more discriminative features to improve classification accuracy. Meanwhile, we experiment our methods on multiple EEG datasets. We have achieved a classification accuracy of about 94% on cognitive load recognition and 86.52% on emotion recognition. On EEG dataset for visual object analysis, our method produces a comparable result compared with who publicly release this dataset. The good performance indicates that our model with the center loss function is widely suitable on EEG signal classification.

In this regard, electroencephalogram (EEG) signal associated with their limb movements could be used to provide alternative control input to multiple degrees of freedom prosthesis for such individuals. The feature extraction method and analysis window parameters (window size and window increment) used to characterize the EEG signal patterns plays an important role in determining the accuracy and stability of the entire prosthetics. Therefore, we studied the effect of different analysis windowing parameters on classification accuracy and stability of frequency-domain features using 64-channel EEG recordings obtained from three amputees. Experimental results shows that the motor imagery patterns associated with the five classes of upper limb movement were decoded with an average accuracy of 99.79% when a window length of 100ms and increment of 25ms was utilized. Regardless of the window increment used, the classification accuracy of the decoded limb movements increased steadily with a decrease in the window length, indicating an inverse relationship between accuracy and window length. Thus, the outcome of this study may provide valuable information for the development of accurate and robust control mechanism for multifunctional neuroprosthesis.

J	Zhang, JH; Wang, BZ; Li, T; Hong, J				Zhang, Jinhua; Wang, Baozeng; Li, Ting; Hong, Jun			Non-invasive decoding of hand movements from electroencephalography based on a hierarchical linear regression model	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS			English	Article							BRAIN; CLASSIFICATION	A non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) is an assistive technology with basic communication and control capabilities that decodes continuous electroencephalography (EEG) signals generated by the human brain and converts them into commands to control external devices naturally. However, the decoding efficiency is limited at present because it is unclear which decoding parameters can be used to effectively improve the overall decoding performance. In this paper, five subjects performed experiments involving self-initiated upper-limb movements during three experimental phases. The decoding method based on a hierarchical linear regression (HLR) model was devised to investigate the influence of decoding efficiency according to the characteristic parameters of brain functional networks. Then the optimal set of channels and most sensitive frequency bands were selected using the p value from a Kruskal-Wallis test in the experimental phases. Eventually, the trajectories of free movement and conical helix movement could be decoded using HLR. The experimental result showed that the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) between the measured and decoded paths is 0.66 with HLR, which was higher than the value of 0.46 obtained with the multiple linear regression model. The HLR from a decoding efficiency perspective holds promise for the development of EEG-based BCI to aid in the restoration of hand movements in post-stroke rehabilitation.

The learners are distinguished analysing their brain patterns. EEG data were recorded during learning and memory tasks using 128 channels machine from a sample of thirty-four healthy university students in two sessions. The students were shown the animated learning content in video format for eight minutes. The brain waves were measured during leaning task. The study characterizes and distinguish between the visual learners and non-visual learners considering the extracted brain patterns. The power spectral entropy features are computed for the recorded EEG and is filtered into alpha and beta sub bands. The most suitable features are selected using principal component analysis (PCA). These features are than given as an input to the k-nearest neighbour(k-NN) classifier. Feature classification using k-nearest neighbour has attained testing accuracy of 96% accuracy for alpha and 95% beta bands for first learning session and 97% and 94% for second learning session. The results show's that the alpha and beta power spectral entropy represent distinct and stable EEG signatures for visual learners and non-visual learners while performing the learning tasks.

Further considering that the covariance matrices of electroencephalogram (EEG) signal lie on Riemannian manifold, in this paper, we construct a Riemannian graph to incorporate the information of training and test data into processing. The adjacency and weight in Riemannian graph are determined by the geodesic distance of Riemannian manifold. Then, a new graph embedding algorithm, called bilinear regularized locality preserving (BRLP), is derived upon the Riemannian graph for addressing the problems of high dimensionality frequently arising in BCIs. With a proposed regularization term encoding prior information of EEG channels, the BRLP could obtain more robust performance. Finally, an efficient classification algorithm based on extreme learning machine is proposed to perform on the tangent space of learned embedding. Experimental evaluations on the BCI competition and in-house data sets reveal that the proposed algorithms could obtain significantly higher performance than many competition algorithms after using same filter process.

Repetition suppression (RS), a learning phenomenon in which stimulus repetitions result in diminished brain activity, has been found to be impaired in FXS. Alterations in RS have been associated with behavioural problems in FXS; however, relations between RS and intellectual functioning have not yet been elucidated. Methods: EEG was recorded in 14 FXS participants and 25 neurotypical controls during an auditory habituation paradigm using repeatedly presented pseudowords. Non-phased locked signal energy was compared across presentations and between groups using linear mixed models (LMMs) in order to investigate RS effects across repetitions and brain areas and a possible relation to non-verbal IQ (NVIQ) in FXS. In addition, we explored group differences according to NVIQ and we probed the feasibility of training a support vector machine to predict cognitive functioning levels across FXS participants based on single-trial RS features. Results: LMM analyses showed that repetition effects differ between groups (FXS vs. controls) as well as with respect to NVIQ in FXS. When exploring group differences in RS patterns, we found that neurotypical controls revealed the expected pattern of RS between the first and second presentations of a pseudoword. More importantly, while FXS participants in the <= 42 NVIQ group showed no RS, the > 42 NVIQ group showed a delayed RS response after several presentations. Concordantly, single-trial estimates of repetition effects over the first four repetitions provided the highest decoding accuracies in the classification between the FXS participant groups. Conclusion: Electrophysiological measures of repetition effects provide a non-invasive and unbiased measure of brain responses sensitive to cognitive functioning levels, which may be useful for clinical trials in FXS.

However, the ability to distinguish adults with MDD from healthy individuals using resting-state EEG features has reached a bottleneck. To address this limitation, we collected EEG data as participants engaged with positive pictures from the International Affective Picture System. Because MDD is associated with blunted positive emotions, we reasoned that this approach would yield highly dissimilar EEG features in healthy versus depressed adults. We extracted three types of relative EEG power features from different frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma) during the emotion task and resting state. We also applied a novel classifier, called a conformal kernel support vector machine (CK-SVM), to try to improve the generalization performance of conventional SVMs. We then compared CK-SVM performance with three machine learning classifiers: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), conventional SVM, and quadratic discriminant analysis. The results from the initial analyses using the LDA classifier on 55 participants (24 MDD, 31 healthy controls) showed that the participant-independent classification accuracy obtained by leave-one-participant-out cross-validation (LOPO-CV) was higher for the EEG recorded during the positive emotion induction versus the resting state for all types of relative EEG power. Furthermore, the CK-SVM classifier achieved higher LOPO-CV accuracy than the other classifiers. The best accuracy (83.64%; sensitivity = 87.50%, specificity = 80.65%) was achieved by the CK-SVM, using seven relative power features extracted from seven electrodes. Overall, combining positive emotion induction with the CK-SVM classifier proved useful for detecting MDD on the basis of EEG signals. In the future, this approach might be used to develop a brain-computer interface system to assist with the detection of MDD in the clinic. Importantly, such a system could be implemented with a low-density electrode montage (seven electrodes), highlighting its practical utility.

If other subjects' data were used for training the classifier, BCI-based neurofeedback practice could start without the initial calibration. Here, we compare methods for inter-subject decoding of left-vs. right-hand motor imagery (MI) from MEG and EEG. Six methods were tested on data involving MEG and EEG measurements of healthy participants. Inter-subject decoders were trained on subjects showing good within-subject accuracy, and tested on all subjects, including poor performers. Three methods were based on Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), and three others on logistic regression with l(1) - or l(2,1) - norm regularization. The decoding accuracy was evaluated using (1) MI and (2) passive movements (PM) for training, separately for MEG and EEG. With MI training, the best accuracies across subjects (mean 70.6% for MEG, 67.7% for EEG) were obtained using multi-task learning (MTL) with logistic regression and l(2,1)-norm regularization. MEG yielded slightly better average accuracies than EEG. With PM training, none of the inter-subject methods yielded above chance level (58.7%) accuracy. In conclusion, MTL and training with other subject's MI is efficient for inter-subject decoding of MI. Passive movements of other subjects are likely suboptimal for training the MI classifiers.

In recent, use of Ear-EEG measured around the ears has been proposed to enhance the practicality of conventional EEG-based BCI systems. Most of BCI systems based on Ear-EEG have used exogenous BCI paradigms employing external stimuli. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using Ear-EEG in developing an endogenous BCI system that uses self-modulated brain signals. EEG data was measured while subjects performed mental arithmetic (MA) and baseline (BL) task. EEG data analysis was performed after dividing the whole brain area into four regions of interest (frontal, central, occipital, and ear area) to compare their EEG characteristics and classification performance. Similar event-related (de) synchronization (ERD/ERS) patterns were observed between the four ROIs, and classification performance was insignificant between them, except occipital area (frontal: 72.6 %, central: 76.7 %, occipital: 82.6 % and ear: 75.6 %). From the results, we could confirm the possibility of using Ear-EEG for developing an endogenous BCI system.

Objective: The study was designed to evaluate the frequency and pattern of EEG abnormality as well as assess the utility of clinical variables in predicting the likelihood of an abnormal EEG in GE. Methods: It was a cross-sectional study involving the analysis of EEGs of consecutive patients with clinical diagnosis of idiopathic GE from three centers over a 7-year period. Information on sociodemographic and seizure variables was obtained. The International Federation of Societies for Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology definition of interictal epileptiform discharges (interictal epileptiform activity [IEA]) was adopted in the study. Results: A total of 403 patients comprising 242 (60%) males and 161 (40%) females with clinical diagnosis of GE had EEG. Their age ranged between 2 weeks and 70 years, with a median age of 21 years and an interquartile age of 26 years. Two hundred and thirty-seven (58.8%) and 213 (52.9%) patients had abnormal EEG and IEA, respectively. Before adjustment for confounders, female gender (P = 0.0001), pediatric age group (P = 0.0388), duration of epilepsy of 1-4 years (P = 0.01387), uncontrolled seizure (P = 0.0060), and seizure frequency (P = 0.0001) were significantly associated with the presence of abnormal EEG. However, age, female gender, poor seizure control, and seizure frequencies were the independent predictors of EEG abnormality. Conclusion: The study showed that about 58% of patients with GE patients had abnormal EEG. Age, poor seizure control, and high frequency of seizure were independent predictors of the presence of EEG abnormality.

Electroencephalograms (EEGs) record electrical activity in the brain and are used to detect epilepsy. Traditional EEG analysis methods for epileptic seizure detection are time-consuming, which has led to the recent proposal of several automated seizure detection frameworks. Feature extraction and classification are two important steps in this procedure. Feature extraction focuses on finding the informative features that could be used in the classification step for correct decision making; therefore, proposing some effective feature extraction techniques for seizure detection is of great significance. This paper introduces two novel feature extraction techniques: local centroid pattern (LCP) and one-dimensional local ternary pattern (1D-LTP) for seizure detection in EEG signal. Both the techniques are computationally simple and easy to implement. In both the techniques, the histograms are formed in the first step using the transformation code and then these histogram-based feature vectors are fed into a classifier in the second step. The performance of the proposed techniques was evaluated through 10-fold cross-validation tested on the benchmark dataset. Different machine learning classifiers were used for the classification. The experimental results show that LCP and 1D-LTP achieved the highest accuracy of 100% for the classification between normal and seizure EEG signals with the artificial neural network classifier. Nine different experimental cases have been tested. The results achieved for different experimental cases were higher than the results of some existing techniques in the literature. The experimental results indicate that LCP and 1D-LTP could be effective feature extraction techniques for seizure detection.

EEG-Based Lower-Limb Movement Onset Decoding: Continuous Classification and Asynchronous Detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-machine interface (BMI); electroencephalography (EEG); movement-related cortical potential (MRCP); asynchronous detection	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; REHABILITATION; EXOSKELETON; PLASTICITY; ORTHOSIS	Brain-machine interfaces have been used to incorporate the user intention to trigger robotic devices by decoding movement onset from electroencephalography. Active neural participation is crucial to promote brain plasticity thus to enhance the opportunity of motor recovery. This paper presents the decoding of lower-limb movement-related cortical potentials with continuous classification and asynchronous detection. We executed experiments in a customized gait trainer, where 10 healthy subjects performed self-initiated ankle plantar flexion. We further analyzed the features, evaluated the impact of the limb side, and compared the proposed framework with other typical decoding methods. No significant differences were observed between the left and right legs in terms of neural signatures of movement and classification performance. We obtained a higher true positive rate, lower false positives, and comparable latencies with respect to the existing online detection methods. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed framework to build a closed-loop gait trainer. Potential applications include gait training neurorehabilitation in clinical trials.

Sleep stage scoring relies heavily on visual pattern recognition by a human expert and is time consuming and subjective. Thus, there is a need for automatic classification. In this work we developed machine learning algorithms for sleep classification: random forest (RF) classification based on features and artificial neural networks (ANNs) working both with features and raw data. We tested our methods in healthy subjects and in patients. Most algorithms yielded good results comparable to human interrater agreement. Our study revealed that deep neural networks (DNNs) working with raw data performed better than feature-based methods. We also demonstrated that taking the local temporal structure of sleep into account a priori is important. Our results demonstrate the utility of neural network architectures for the classification of sleep.

Such an expert-in-the-loop system interacts with the annotating expert by suggesting him EEG segments that should be annotated. After a sufficient number of labeled segments is reached, a pattern classification model is trained and used for automatic annotation of the rest of the signal. It is shown that this can save 85% of the labeling effort and consequently improve the annotation quality due to the prevention of errors caused by expert's fatigue. The selection of the data for labeling is based on confidence based active learning approach. It is shown that such a strategy is statistically significantly better in terms of mean class error than baseline random sampling strategy. Moreover, it is argued that transitional instances that correspond to transitions between sleep stages are often erroneously labeled and their elimination can improve especially the active learning process. This hypothesis is examined and surprisingly such elimination significantly improved the random sampling strategy which became comparable to the active learning without removal of transitions. Although the active learning strategy with transitions removal performed better in terms of mean, there were not sufficient data that would prove this statistically.

Because workers' stress is a critical factor that adversely affects workers' productivity, safety, well-being, and work quality, understanding workers' stress should take precedence in the management of excessive stress. Various instruments for subjective measurement towards one's perceived stress have been used, but such methods rely on imprecise memory and reconstruction of feelings in the past. Recent advancements in wearable Electroencephalography (EEG) devices possess a potential for quantitative measurement of human stress by directly capturing central nervous system activities from stress. However, its capability of measuring field workers' stress under real occupational stressors remains questionable. This research thus proposes a framework to recognize construction workers' stress at the field based on their brain activity recorded from a wearable EEG. Specifically, this framework applies a supervised learning algorithm-support vector machine-in detecting workers' stress while working in different conditions. Workers salivary cortisol levels, which is a stressrelated hormone, were used to label the tasks as low or high-stress level. Relevant time and frequency domain features in EEG signals were calculated. Results yielded a high of 71.1% accuracy using SVM in recognizing workers' stress, which is a very promising result given that stress recognition with an exquisite EEG device in the clinical domain has at most the similar level of accuracy. The results show the potential for recognizing construction workers' stress at the field by applying machine learning algorithms using workers' brain waves recorded from a wearable EEG device. This EEG based stress detection approach will help to enhance workplace environment and conditions as well as to improve workers' health by early detection and mitigation of the factors that cause stress.

The proposal consisted of three main stages: organization of EEG signals, feature extraction and execution of classification algorithms. The EEG signals were recorded from eighteen healthy subjects performing self-paced reaching movements. Three classification scenarios were evaluated in each participant: Relax versus Intention, Relax versus Execution and Intention versus Execution. The feature extraction stage was carried out by applying an algorithm known as Common Spatial Pattern, in addition to the statistical methods called Root Mean Square, Variance, Standard Deviation and Mean. The results showed that the models of neural networks provided decoding accuracies above chance level, whereby, it is able to detect a movement prior its execution. On the basis of these results, the neural networks are a powerful promising classification technique that can be used to enhance performance in the recognition of motor tasks for BCI systems based on electroencephalographic signals.

The ability to correctly identify likes and dislikes as well as excitement and boredom would facilitate novel applications in neuromarketing, affective entertainment, virtual rehabilitation and forensic neuroscience that leverage on sub-conscious human affective states. In this neuroinformatics investigation, we seek to recognize human preferences and excitement passively through the use of electroencephalography (EEG) when a subject is presented with some 3D visual stimuli. Our approach employs the use of machine learning in the form of deep neural networks to classify brain signals acquired using a brain-computer interface (BCI). In the first part of our study, we attempt to improve upon our previous work, which has shown that EEG preference classification is possible although accuracy rates remain relatively low at 61%-67% using conventional deep learning neural architectures, where the challenge mainly lies in the accurate classification of unseen data from a cohort-wide sample that introduces inter-subject variability on top of the existing intra-subject variability. Such an approach is significantly more challenging and is known as subjectindependent EEG classification as opposed to the more commonly adopted but more time-consuming and less general approach of subject-dependent EEG classification. In this new study, we employ deep networks that allow dropouts to occur in the architecture of the neural network. The results obtained through this simple feature modification achieved a classification accuracy of up to 79%. Therefore, this study has shown that the use of a deep learning classifier was able to achieve an increase in emotion classification accuracy of between 13% and 18% through the simple adoption of the use of dropouts compared to a conventional deep learner for EEG preference classification. In the second part of our study, users are exposed to a roller-coaster experience as the emotional stimuli which are expected to evoke the emotion of excitement, while simultaneously wearing virtual reality goggles, which delivers the virtual reality experience of excitement, and an EEG headset, acquires the raw brain signals detected when exposed to this excitement stimuli. Here, a deep learning approach is used to improve the excitement detection rate to well above the 90% accuracy level. In a prior similar study, the use of conventional machine learning approaches involving k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) classifiers and Support Vector Machines (SVM) only achieved prediction accuracy rates of between 65% and 89%. Using a deep learning approach here, rates of 78%-96% were achieved. This demonstrates the superiority of adopting a deep learning approach over other machine learning approaches for detecting human excitement when immersed in an immersive virtual reality environment.

Different connectivity patterns are identified by the partial directed coherence (PDC) which is a frequency-domain metric that provides information about directionality in the interaction between signals recorded at different sensors. The basis of our selection is a statistical analysis of the directed connectivities revealed by their repeated appearance and larger PDC magnitudes in sets of electroencephalography (EEG) sensors treated as networks. Hence, our proposed method identifies significant differences between directed connectivities on EEG-sensor networks that arc specific to the mental tasks involved. A combinatory analysis of different possible networks allows us to find those that characterize and discriminate the tasks and, as proof-of-concept, we analyze the connectivities of movement imageries (MIs) used in the operation of a brain-computer interface. The directed interconnections revealed by our proposed method are in agreement with brain functional connectivities already reported for MIs, and good classification rates are achieved when such interconnections are used as features in a Mahalanobis-distance-based classifier.

It has become the de-facto mobile, portable, non-invasive brain imaging sensor to harness brain information in real time. It is now being used to translate or decode brain signals, to diagnose diseases or to implement Brain Computer Interface (BCI) devices. The automatic decoding is mainly implemented by using quantitative algorithms to detect the cloaked information buried in the signal. However, clinical EEG is based intensively on waveforms and the structure of signal plots. Hence, the purpose of this work is to establish a bridge to fill this gap by reviewing and describing the procedures that have been used to detect patterns in the electroencephalographic waveforms, benchmarking them on a controlled pseudo-real dataset of a P300-Based BCI Speller and verifying their performance on a public dataset of a BCI Competition.

The main task here is to classify the EEG data recorded for lie detection, into innocent and guilty. Although various methods have been developed in past to classify EEG data, deep belief nets are rarely used. This paper uses a deep learning technique using the restricted Boltzmann machine with wavelet to obtain the time and frequency domain information of signals. A deep belief network is developed with four RBMs stacked together. Softmax regression is utilized at output layer to classify EEG data into guilty and innocent. An experiment has been performed on EEG data recorded by performing a "Concealed Information Test". The test consists of a mock crime scenario where some relevant and irrelevant images are presented in front of subjects. The EEG signals generated after flashing these images are recorded and analyzed.

Neural tracking of auditory motion is reflected by delta phase and alpha power of EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Auditory motion; Electroencephalography; Decoding; Sound localization; ITD; ILD	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; SOUND LOCATION; HUMAN BRAIN; PLANUM TEMPORALE; INTERAURAL TIME; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; LEVEL DIFFERENCES; COCKTAIL PARTY; CORTEX	It is of increasing practical interest to be able to decode the spatial characteristics of an auditory scene from electrophysiological signals. However, the cortical representation of auditory space is not well characterized, and it is unclear how cortical activity reflects the time-varying location of a moving sound. Recently, we demonstrated that cortical response measures to discrete noise bursts can be decoded to determine their origin in space. Here we build on these findings to investigate the cortical representation of a continuously moving auditory stimulus using scalp recorded electroencephalography (EEG). In a first experiment, subjects listened to pink noise over headphones which was spectro-temporally modified to be perceived as randomly moving on a semi-circular trajectory in the horizontal plane. While subjects listened to the stimuli, we recorded their EEG using a 128-channel acquisition system. The data were analysed by 1) building a linear regression model (decoder) mapping the relationship between the stimulus location and a training set of EEG data, and 2) using the decoder to reconstruct an estimate of the time-varying sound source azimuth from the EEG data. The results showed that we can decode sound trajectory with a reconstruction accuracy significantly above chance level. Specifically, we found that the phase of delta (<2 Hz) and power of alpha (8-12 Hz) EEG track the dynamics of a moving auditory object. In a follow-up experiment, we replaced the noise with pulse train stimuli containing only interaural level and time differences (ILDs and ITDs respectively). This allowed us to investigate whether our trajectory decoding is sensitive to both acoustic cues. We found that the sound trajectory can be decoded for both ILD and ITD stimuli. Moreover, their neural signatures were similar and even allowed successful cross-cue classification. This supports the notion of integrated processing of ILD and ITD at the cortical level. These results are particularly relevant for application in devices such as cognitively controlled hearing aids and for the evaluation of virtual acoustic environments.

Spatial filters have been widely used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of EEG for BCI classification problems, but their applications in BCI regression problems have been very limited. This paper proposes two common spatial pattern (CSP) filters for EEG-based regression problems in BCI, which are extended from the CSP filter for classification, by using fuzzy sets. Experimental results on EEG-based response speed estimation from a large-scale study, which collected 143 sessions of sustained-attention psychomotor vigilance task data from 17 subjects during a 5-month period, demonstrate that the two proposed spatial filters can significantly increase the EEG signal quality. When used in LASSO and k-nearest neighbors regression for user response speed estimation, the spatial filters can reduce the root-mean-square estimation error by 10.02-19.77%, and at the same time increase the correlation to the true response speed by 19.39-86.47%.

The technique is based on a machine learning (ML) algorithm, which exploits a spatio-temporal characterization of the P300, analyses all the discrimination scenarios through a multiclass classification problem. The BCI is composed of the acquisition unit, the processing unit and the navigation unit. The acquisition unit is a wireless 32-channel electroencephalography headset collecting data from six electrodes. The processing unit is a dedicated mu PC performing stimuli delivery, ML and classification, leading to the user intention interpretation. The ML stage is based on a custom algorithm (tuned residue iteration decomposition) which trains the classifier on the user-tuned P300 features. The extracted features undergo a dimensionality reduction and are used to define decision boundaries for the real-time classification. The real-time classification performs a functional approach for the features extraction, reducing the amount of data to be analyzed.

In recent years, researchers have tried to decode the kinetic information of motor imagery. In this paper, we analyzed and discriminated the EEG patterns of different force levels motor imagery using MRCPs. In the experiment, nine healthy subjects were required to perform the hand force motor imagery tasks (30% MVC and 10% MVC). From the view of MRCPs, the most significant discrimination between the two levels of mental tasks was the manifestation of motor planning. The average classification accuracy for features involving both MRCP and CSP was 78.3%, which was 8.5% higher than the CSP-based features (p<0.001) and 2% higher than the MRCP-based features. The results demonstrated the feasibility of using MRCPs for hand force motor imagery classification.

We processed two archetypal EEG databases, Freiburg (intracranial EEG) and CHB-MIT (scalp EEG), to find if our model could outperform the state-of-the art models. Four key components define our model: (1) multiscale principal component analysis for EEG de-noising, (2) EEG signal decomposition using either empirical mode decomposition, discrete wavelet transform or wavelet packet decomposition, (3) statistical measures to extract relevant features, (4) machine learning algorithms. Our model achieved overall accuracy of 100% in ictal vs. inter-ictal EEG for both databases. In seizure onset prediction, it could discriminate between inter-ictal, pre-ictal, and ictal EEG with the accuracy of 99.77%, and between inter-ictal and pre-ictal EEG states with the accuracy of 99.70%. The proposed model is general and should prove applicable to other classification tasks including detection and prediction regarding bio-signals such as EMG and ECG. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Electroencephalograms (EEG) help in capturing brain's electrical activity and provide aid to the clinicians for detecting and predicting seizures. EEG is quite complex and predicting seizures by visual inspection is quite challenging, time consuming and sometimes much expensive as every time a trained specialists is required for inspection. Due to these issues various expert and automated seizure detection systems have been developed for accurate and fast detection of seizures. Preliminary seizure detection and prediction algorithms were patient-specific, where the classifier's training and testing were done on the same person. The current work provides a study of generalized automated seizure detection system which can classify seizures and non-seizures signals. EEG data from CHB-MIT database is considered for analyzing and validating the proposed detection system. The signals arc decomposed using wavelet decomposition tree and wavelet-coefficients are used to calculate different non-linear features viz. approximate and sample entropy, energy, standard deviation. These features are classified by different supervised machine learning classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Linear Discriminant Classifier (LDC). The classifiers performance is compared using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy. The PNN classifier provided reasonably good results as compared to the other classifiers. The studied detection system will help in fast, cheap and accurate diagnosis of seizures from brain signals.

Electroencephalography Amplitude Modulation Analysis for Automated Affective Tagging of Music Video Clips	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						emotion classification; affective computing; multimedia content; electroencephalography; physiological signals; signal processing; pattern classification	FRONTAL EEG ASYMMETRY; EMOTION RECOGNITION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; STATE; AROUSAL; SELECTION; PHASE; INFORMATION; RELEVANCE	The quantity of music content is rapidly increasing and automated affective tagging of music video clips can enable the development of intelligent retrieval, music recommendation, automatic playlist generators, and music browsing interfaces tuned to the users' current desires, preferences, or affective states. To achieve this goal, the field of affective computing has emerged, in particular the development of so-called affective brain-computer interfaces, which measure the user's affective state directly from measured brain waves using non-invasive tools, such as electroencephalography (EEG). Typically, conventional features extracted from the EEG signal have been used, such as frequency subband powers and/or inter-hemispheric power asymmetry indices. More recently, the coupling between EEG and peripheral physiological signals, such as the galvanic skin response (GSR), have also been proposed. Here, we show the importance of EEG amplitude modulations and propose several new features that measure the amplitude-amplitude cross-frequency coupling per EEG electrode, as well as linear and non-linear connections between multiple electrode pairs. When tested on a publicly available dataset of music video clips tagged with subjective affective ratings, support vector classifiers trained on the proposed features were shown to outperform those trained on conventional benchmark EEG features by as much as 6, 20, 8, and 7% for arousal, valence, dominance and liking, respectively. Moreover, fusion of the proposed features with EEG-GSR coupling features showed to be particularly useful for arousal (feature-level fusion) and liking (decision-level fusion) prediction. Together, these findings show the importance of the proposed features to characterize human affective states during music clip watching.

However, this type of BCI depends heavily on effective signal processing to discriminate EEG patterns corresponding to various MI tasks, especially feature extraction procedures. In this study, a comparison of different feature extraction methods was conducted for EEG classification of imaginary movements within the same upper extremity. Unlike traditional MI tasks (left/right hand), six imaginary movements from the same unilateral upper extremity were proposed and evaluated, including elbow extension/flexion, wrist pronation/supination, and hand open/grasp. To tackle the classification challenge of MI tasks within the same limb, four types of feature extraction methods were implemented and compared in combination with support vector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers, such as wavelet transformation, power spectrum, autoregressive model, common spatial patterns (CSP) and variants of filter-hank CSP (FBCSP), regularized CSP (RCSP). The overall accuracies of the CSP were significant higher than other three types of feature extraction on a dataset collected from 8 individuals, particularly the SVM with FBCSP had the best performance with an average accuracy of 71.78%. These decoding results of MI tasks during single upper extremity are encouraging and promising in the context of more natural Nil-BCI for controlling assisted devices, such as a neuroprosthetic or robotic arm for motor disabled individuals with highly impaired upper extremity.

This infirmity presents four kinds of events: pre-ictal, ictal, post-ictal, and interictal. Epilepsy can be diagnosed through electroencephalogram (EEG). The interictal activity, for example, on an EEG, is widely accepted as an epilepsy symptom. However, the differentiation between normal and interictal EEG segments is difficult because they can have similar patterns. Also, EEG from patients with epilepsy can contain normal events. In this work, we built classifiers to differentiate between normal and interictal EEG. Our proposed process was applied in a set of 200 EEG segments. For this, power spectrum (PS) was computed for each signal, and 18 measures were extracted from PS considering five frequency bands: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and entire frequency range (between lower delta and higher beta frequency range). Thus, from each PS, 90 features were extracted. The following machine learning methods were applied to build the classifiers: random forest, 1NN, naive Bayes (NB), MLP, and SVM. In the evaluation by cross-validation approach, a statistically significant difference was not found among classifiers, whose error values resulted in the p-value of 0.1089 by Friedman test. On the other hand, by confusion matrices and their parameters, it was found that the NB classifier reached the best performance to detect normal EEG segments. For detection of interictal activity, the MLP and SVM classifiers achieved the best results. All classifiers built in this work reached promising results for differentiation between normal and interictal EEG patterns.

Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for amputees allow them to use their remaining functionalities as control possibilities by turning brain signals into commands for external devices. However, BCIs that use the EEG signals alone are not yet fully acceptable in bio-robotic applications. Myoelectric control systems use EMG signals recorded on the residual muscles of amputated limbs to control prosthesis, but the residual muscles cannot often provide enough signal to control a multiple degrees of freedom prosthetics. This paper introduces a new hybrid BCI model that integrates EEG and EMG signal processing with machine learning models to efficiently improve classification accuracy and increase the control performance of different upper limb movements for above elbow amputees. Experiments have been carried out on a large dataset of 64 channel EEG signals, combined with 32 channel surface EMG (sEMG) signals, acquired simultaneously from above-elbow amputees to decode five hand and wrist motions. Classification accuracy is used for evaluating the classification performance with 5-fold cross validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a high classification accuracy, exceeding 98.8%, using 6th order Autoregressive (AR) model coefficients with three proposed combined set of features from time domain, frequency domain and entropies. This suggested model outperforms previously proposed models in the literature with up to 8.9% improvement ratio; this implies that Hybrid-BCI can be reliably used to improve the control performance of upper limb movements. Furthermore, the model may be easily applied into real-time hybrid BCI application.

The neurophysiology of subjective EA, among other mind-brain-body phenomena, can best be tested when subjects are stimulated in a natural fashion. Immersive virtual reality (VR) enables naturalistic experimental stimulation and thus promises to increase the ecological validity of research findings i.e., how well they generalize to real-life settings. In this study, 45 participants experienced virtual rollercoaster rides while their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) was then trained on the alpha-frequency (8-12 Hz) component of the EEG signal (input) and the retrospectively acquired continuous reports of subjective EA (target). With the LSTM-based model, subjective EA could be predicted significantly above chance level. This demonstrates a novel EEG-based decoding approach for subjective states of experience in naturalistic research designs using VR.

However, the performance of most frameworks is limited by their improper channel selection methods and too specifical design, leading to high computational complexity, non-convergent procedure and narrow expansibility. In this paper, to remedy these drawbacks, we propose a fast, open EEG classification framework centralized by EEG feature compression, low-dimensional representation, and convergent iterative channel ranking. First, to reduce the complexity, we use data clustering to compress the EEG features channel-wise, packing the high-dimensional EEG signal, and endowing them with numerical signatures. Second, to provide easy access to alternative superior methods, we structurally represent each EEG trial in a feature vector with its corresponding numerical signature. Thus, the recorded signals of many trials shrink to a low-dimensional structural matrix compatible with most pattern recognition methods. Third, a series of effective iterative feature selection approaches with theoretical convergence is introduced to rank the EEG channels and remove redundant ones, further accelerating the EEG classification process and ensuring its stability. Finally, a classical linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model is employed to classify a single EEG trial with selected channels. Experimental results on two real world brain-computer interface (BCI) competition datasets demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed framework over state-of-the-art methods.

The main difficulties are in the classification of signals and the determination of patterns of nerve impulses that actuate the limbs of the human body. If these problems are successfully solved, the classified patterns can be used to control biomechanical systems, for example, such as bionic prostheses. Modern methods of artificial neural networks open up the prospect for realizing an effective classification of the received impulses. However, the effectiveness depends on the chosen model of the artificial neuron and its computational complexity. This article will consider the most popular hybrid neural networks, and it will be shown that they have such advantages as resource intensity, energy efficiency and high level of accuracy of calculations and at the same time are biorealistically enough.

However, the ear-EEG studies have researched mostly targeting on a visual/auditory stimuli-based BCI system or a drowsiness detection system. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study on a motor-imagery (MI) detection system based on ear-EEG. MI is one of the mostly used paradigms in BCI because it does not need any external stimuli. MI that associated with ear-EEG could facilitate useful BCI applications in real-world. Hence, in this study, we aim to investigate a feasibility of the MI classification using ear-around EEG signals. We proposed a common spatial pattern (CSP)-based frequency-band optimization algorithm and compared it with three existing methods. The best classification results for two datasets are 71.8% and 68.07%, respectively, using the ear-around EEG signals (cf. 92.40% and 91.64% using motor-area EEG signals).

We improved classification performance by combining electroencephalogram (EEG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) signals. GSR signals are preprocessed using by the zero-crossing rate. Sufficient EEG feature extraction can be obtained through CNN. Therefore, we propose a suitable CNN model for feature extraction by tuning hyper parameters in convolution filters. The EEG signal is preprocessed prior to convolution by a wavelet transform while considering time and frequency simultaneously. We use a database for emotion analysis using the physiological signals open dataset to verify the proposed process, achieving 73.4% accuracy, showing significant performance improvement over the current best practice models.

Spontaneous and noninvasive, Brain-Computer Interface based on motor imagery EEG signal can be applied more widely. This paper focuses on pattern recognition of EEG signal in Brain-Computer Interface based on the left-right hand motor imagery. Mental task among 5 subjects was processed to acquire motor imagery EEG signal. In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, filters in time domain, frequency domain and special domain are applied in signal preprocess. Additionally, power spectral density (PSD) was extracted with sliding windows from processed signal as features for pattern recognition. Then the discriminate labels of motor imagery are trained by linear discriminate analysis (LDA) and random forest algorithm to decode the imagine pattern. The results show an average recognition accuracy of 0.65 +/- 0.07 for LDA and 0.70 +/- 0.05 for random forest can be obtained, which has significant difference with random level. From the results, it can be concluded that pattern of motor imagery can be decoded. In addition, a signal trial online pattern recognition task can be further implement to achieve human-computer interaction based on EEG signals.

The implementation of a BCI system requires complex electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing including filtering, feature extraction and classification algorithms. Most of current BCI systems are implemented on personal computers. Therefore, there is a great interest in implementing BCI on embedded platforms to meet system specifications in terms of time response, cost effectiveness, power consumption, and accuracy. New-method: This article presents an embedded-BCI (EBCI) system based on a Stratix-IV field programmable gate array. The proposed system relays on the weighted overlap-add (WOLA) algorithm to perform dynamic filtering of EEG-signals by analyzing the event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS). The EEG-signals are classified, using the linear discriminant analysis algorithm, based on their spatial features. Results: The proposed system performs fast classification within a time delay of 0.430 s/trial, achieving an average accuracy of 76.80% according to an offline approach and 80.25% using our own recording. The estimated power consumption of the prototype is approximately 0.7 W. Comparison-with-existing-method: Results show that the proposed EBCI system reduces the overall classification error rate for the three datasets of the BCI-competition by 5% compared to other similar implementations. Moreover, experiment shows that the proposed system maintains a high accuracy rate with a short processing time, a low power consumption, and a low cost. Conclusions: Performing dynamic filtering of EEG-signals using WOLA increases the recognition rate of ERD/ERS patterns of motor imagery brain activity. This approach allows to develop a complete prototype of a EBCI system that achieves excellent accuracy rates. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, optimal channels, frequency band and time interval are of great significance for MI electroencephalography feature extraction. In this paper, channel selection method based on linear discriminant criteria is used to automatically select the channels with high discriminative powers. In addition, the concept of artificial bee colony algorithm is first introduced to find the global optimal combination of frequency band and time interval simultaneously without prior knowledge for common spatial pattern features extraction and classification. Experimental results demonstrate that this scheme can adapt to user-specific patterns and find the relatively optimal channels, frequency band and time interval for feature extraction. The classification results on the BCI Competition III Dataset IVa and BCI Competition IV Dataset IIa clearly present the effectiveness of the proposed method outperforming most of the other competing methods in the literature.

The current state-of-the-art approaches for decoding the attentional selection of listeners are based on linear mappings between features of sound streams and EEG responses (forward model), or vice versa (backward model). It has been shown that when the envelope of attended speech and EEG responses are used to derive such mapping functions, the model estimates can be used to discriminate between attended and unattended talkers. However, the predictive/reconstructive performance of the models is dependent on how the model parameters are estimated. There exist a number of model estimation methods that have been published, along with a variety of datasets. It is currently unclear if any of these methods perform better than others, as they have not yet been compared side by side on a single standardized dataset in a controlled fashion. Here, we present a comparative study of the ability of different estimation methods to classify attended speakers from multi-channel EEG data. The performance of the model estimation methods is evaluated using different performance metrics on a set of labeled EEG data from 18 subjects listening to mixtures of two speech streams. We find that when forward models predict the EEG from the attended audio, regularized models do not improve regression or classification accuracies. When backward models decode the attended speech from the EEG, regularization provides higher regression and classification accuracies.	[Wong, Daniel D.

Most MTP studies involve decoding 2D and 3D arm movements i.e., executed arm movements. Decoding of observed or imagined 3D movements has been demonstrated with limited success and only reported in a few studies. MTP studies normally use EEG potentials filtered in the low delta (similar to 1 Hz) band for reconstructing the trajectory of an executed or an imagined/observed movement. In contrast to MTP, multiclass classification based sensorimotor rhythm brain-computer interfaces aim to classify movements using the power spectral density of mu (8-12 Hz) and beta (12-28 Hz) bands. Approach: We investigated if replacing the standard potentials time-series input with a power spectral density based bandpower time-series improves trajectory decoding accuracy of kinesthetically imagined 3D hand movement tasks (i.e., imagined 3D trajectory of the hand joint) and whether imagined 3D hand movements kinematics are encoded also in mu and beta bands. Twelve naive subjects were asked to generate or imagine generating pointing movements with their right dominant arm to four targets distributed in 3D space in synchrony with an auditory cue (beep). Main results: Using the bandpower time-series based model, the highest decoding accuracy for motor execution was observed in mu and beta bands whilst for imagined movements the low gamma (28-40 Hz) band was also observed to improve decoding accuracy for some subjects. Moreover, for both (executed and imagined) movements, the bandpower time-series model with mu, beta, and low gamma bands produced significantly higher reconstruction accuracy than the commonly used potential time-series model and delta oscillations.

EEG signals are nonstationary in nature and show abnormal neural activity during the ictal period. Seizures can be identified by analyzing and obtaining features of EEG signal that can detect these abnormal activities. The present work proposes a novel morphological feature extraction technique based on the local binary pattern (LBP) operator. LBP provides a unique decimal value to a sample point by weighing the binary outcomes after thresholding the neighboring samples with the present sample point. These LBP values assist in capturing the rising and falling edges of the EEG signal, thus providing a morphologically featured discriminating pattern for epilepsy detection. In the present work, the variability in the LBP values is measured by calculating the sum of absolute difference of the consecutive LBP values. Interquartile range is calculated over the preprocessed EEG signal to provide dispersion measure in the signal. For classification purpose, K-nearest neighbor classifier is used, and the performance is evaluated on 896.9 hours of data from CHB-MIT continuous EEG database. Mean accuracy of 99.7% and mean specificity of 99.8% is obtained with average false detection rate of 0.47/h and sensitivity of 99.2% for 136 seizures.	[Shanir, P. P.

Brain-Computer Interfaces decode brain activity measured by EEG to send commands to external devices. The most well-known BCI systems are based on Motor Imagery paradigm that corresponds to the imagination of a motor action without execution. Event-Related Desynchronization and Synchronization shows the channel-wise temporal dynamics related to the motor activity. However, ERD/S demands the application of a large bank of narrowband filters to find dynamic changes and the assumption of temporal alignment ignores the between-trial temporal variations of neuronal activity. Taking to account the temporal variations, this work introduces a signal filtering analysis based on the estimation of Supervised Temporal Patterns that decode brain dynamics in MI paradigm which result from the solution of a generalized eigenvalues problem. The signal filtering analysis detects temporal dynamics related to MI tasks within each trial. The method highlights MI activity along channels and trials and shows differences between subjects performing these kinds of tasks.	[Velasquez-Martinez, Luisa F.; Zapata-Castano, F.

Efficient decoding of subjects' motor intentions is essential in BCI-based rehabilitation systems to manipulate a neural prosthesis or other devices for motor relearning. However, due to cortical reorganization, the desynchronization potential evoked by the motor imagery of patients with brain lesions is quite different from that evoked by the motor imagery of normal subjects. These differences can be attributed to active cortex regions, frequency bands and amplitude. In this paper, we use a deep learning method to explore the EEG patterns of key channels and the frequency band for stroke patients. The EEG data is bandpass filtered into multiple sub-bands split by a sliding window strategy. Under these sub-bands, diverse spatial-spectral features are extracted and fed into a deep neural network for classification, uncovering the spectral patterns (bandpass filters) and spatial patterns (spatial weights). Experimental results from five stroke patients show that our method has higher classification accuracy than several state-of-the-art approaches. By tracking gradual changes in EEG patterns during rehabilitation, we try to uncover the neurophysiological plasticity mechanism in the impaired cortexes of stroke patients.

The objective of this work is to present gumpy, a new free and open source Python toolbox designed for hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI). Approach. Gumpy provides state-of-the-art algorithms and includes a rich selection of signal processing methods that have been employed by the BCI community over the last 20 years. In addition, a wide range of classification methods that span from classical machine learning algorithms to deep neural network models are provided. Gumpy can be used for both EEG and EMG biosignal analysis, visualization, real-time streaming and decoding. Results. The usage of the toolbox was demonstrated through two different offline example studies, namely movement prediction from EEG motor imagery, and the decoding of natural grasp movements with the applied finger forces from surface EMG (sEMG) signals. Additionally, gumpy was used for real-time control of a robot arm using steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) as well as for real-time prosthetic hand control using sEMG. Overall, obtained results with the gumpy toolbox are comparable or better than previously reported results on the same datasets. Significance. Gumpy is a free and open source software, which allows end-users to perform online hybrid BCIs and provides different techniques for processing and decoding of EEG and EMG signals. More importantly, the achieved results reveal that gumpy's deep learning toolbox can match or outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy. This can therefore enable BCI researchers to develop more robust decoding algorithms using novel techniques and hence chart a route ahead for new BCI improvements.

In this paper, we make an overview of recent DL architectures for recognizing cognitive brain activities from Electroencephalogram (EEG) data with particular emphasis on Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technologies and Affective Neurocomputing. We discuss the use of convolutional, recurrent neural nets, as well as deep belief networks, echo-state networks, reservoir computing, and denoising auto encoder models. A major challenge in modeling brain cognitive activity from EEG data is finding representations that are invariant to inter- and intra-subject differences, as well as the inherent noise in the EEG recordings. The reviewed studies reveal the great potential of DL to decode human intentions in BCI applications and to find the invariant descriptors of human emotions across subjects in Affective Neurocomputing applications. Many of the DL models prove to be more accurate and efficient than traditional machine learning models.

EEG signal is widely used for detecting different categories of emotions. The EEG signal is captured through multiple electrode channels, very few of them are useful for emotion detection. In our paper, a "Correlation-based subset selection" technique is introduced for dimension reduction. Then we proceed with classification process using "Higher Order Statistics" features of the reduced set of channels. However, we have classified four classes of emotions (positive, negative, angry and harmony) in our paper. The execution time of our proposed algorithm is O(n(2) + 2n). The classification accuracy of this model with the reduced set of channels is 82%. Finally, we compare our proposed model with some popular emotion classification models and the result shows that our model substantially outperforms all the previous models. However, the proposed model helps physically disabled people to express their feelings with minimum time and cost-effectively.

However, these clinical assessments are limited due to the disruption with patients' sleep and the noise of observing behaviors instead of the brain activity directly. Here we train a Gated Recurrent Unit using the spectrogram of electroencephalography (EEG) based on 166 mechanically ventilated patients to predict the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Score, scored as ordinal levels of -5, -4, ... up to 0. The model is able to predict 50% accurate with an error not larger than 1 level; and 80% accurate with an error not larger than 2 levels on hold-out testing patients. We show typical spectrograms in each sedation level and interpret the results based on the visualization of the gradient with respect to the spectrogram. Future improvements include utilizing the EEG waveforms since waveform patterns are clinically thought to be associated with sedation levels, as well as training patient specific models.

Analysing Vibrotactually Stimulated EEG Signals to Comprehend Object Shapes	2018 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (IEEE SSCI)			English	Proceedings Paper	8th IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)	NOV 18-21, 2018	Bengaluru, INDIA	IEEE		Haptic Perception; Vibrotactile Feedback; Electroencephalography; Human Computer Interface		Tactile feedback has the capability of reducing the workload on the visual channel, during visual feedback in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). It is requisite to analyse the brain signals corresponding to the tactile stimulations. This work is aimed at analysing the brain signals while the users are vibrotactually stimulated. The brain signals are acquired non-invasively by electroencephalography (EEG), while brushless coin-type vibration motors are actuated in particular patterns to convey the object shape information on subjects' skin surface in form of vibrations. The acquired EEG signals are pre-processed to eliminate the effect of various types of noises and to extract the EEG signals corresponding to relevant frequency bands. Adaptive autoregressive (AAR) parameters are extracted from the pre-processed EEG signals and are finally classified by Naive Bayesian (NB) approach, in order to recognize the vibratotactually stimulated object shapes from brain signals. In addition to the classifier output, subjects' verbal responses about the object shape they perceived are also noted for validation. Three successive sessions of shape recognition from vibrotactile pattern show an improvement in EEG classification accuracy from 63.75% to 74.37%, and also depicted learning of the stimulus from subjects' psychological response which is observed to increase from 75% to 95%. This observation substantiates the learning of vibrotactile stimulation in user over the sessions which in turn increases the system efficacy.

Methods: Successfully resuscitated CA patients were transferred to the Catherization Lab followed by percutaneous coronary intervention when indicated. On arrival at the coronary care unit, bilateral BIS monitoring was started and continued up to 72 h. Raw simplified EEG tracings were extracted from the BIS monitor at a time point coinciding with the registration of standard EEG monitoring. BIS EEG tracings were reviewed by two neurophysiologists, who were asked to indicate the presence of following patterns: diffuse slowing rhythm, burst suppression pattern, cerebral inactivity, periodic epileptiform discharges and status epilepticus (SE). Additionally, these simplified BIS EEG tracings were analysed by two inexperienced investigators, who were asked to indicate the presence of SE only. Results: Thirty-two simplified BIS EEG samples were analysed. Compared to standard EEG, neurophysiologists interpreted all simplified EEG samples with a sensitivity of 86%, a specificity of 100% and an interobserver variability of 0.843. Furthermore, SE was identified with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 94% by two unexperienced physicians. Conclusion: Using a simple classification system, raw simplified EEG derived from a BIS monitoring device is comparable to standard EEG monitoring. Moreover, investigators without EEG experience were capable to identify SE in post-CA patients. Future studies will be warranted to confirm our results and to determine the added value of using simplified BIS EEG in terms of prognostic and therapeutic implications.

Typical retinotopic locations impact the time course of object coding	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Visual perception; Object recognition; Real-world regularities; Location priors; EEG decoding; Multivariate pattern analysis	VISUAL FEATURES; EYE-MOVEMENTS; HUMAN BRAIN; SCENE; WORLD; REPRESENTATIONS; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; DYNAMICS; CATEGORY	In everyday visual environments, objects are non-uniformly distributed across visual space. Many objects preferentially occupy particular retinotopic locations: for example, lamps more often fall into the upper visual field, whereas carpets more often fall into the lower visual field. The long-term experience with natural environments prompts the hypothesis that the visual system is tuned to such retinotopic object locations. A key prediction is that typically positioned objects should be coded more efficiently. To test this prediction, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) while participants viewed briefly presented objects appearing in their typical locations (e.g., an airplane in the upper visual field) or in atypical locations (e.g., an airplane in the lower visual field). Multivariate pattern analysis applied to the EEG data revealed that object classification depended on positional regularities: Objects were classified more accurately when positioned typically, rather than atypically, already at 140 ms, suggesting that relatively early stages of object processing are tuned to typical retinotopic locations. Our results confirm the prediction that long-term experience with objects occurring at specific locations leads to enhanced perceptual processing when these objects appear in their typical locations. This may indicate a neural mechanism for efficient natural scene processing, where a large number of typically positioned objects needs processed.

During experiment, "easy" and "difficult" English words were visually presented and the participant responded whether he understood the meaning of the presented English word. We found that the most characteristic brain activity was a power decrease in the 10-20 Hz frequency band at 400-800 ms after stimulus presentation, which seemed to reflect the differences in the difficulty of the words. Future studies will focus on applying machine-learning techniques so as to classify brain activities for each word. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial filtering pipeline evaluation of cortically coupled computer vision system for rapid serial visual presentation	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES			English	Article						Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP); cortically coupled computer vision; electroencephalography (EEG); event-related potentials (ERPs); spatial filtering; brain-computer interface (BCI)	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MOTOR IMAGERY; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; INTERFACE; PATTERN; SEARCH; ERP	Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) is a paradigm that supports the application of cortically coupled computer vision to image search. In RSVP, images are presented to participants which can evoke Event-related Potentials (ERPs) in their Electroencephalogram (EEG). Supervised spatial filtering techniques are often applied to enhance the discriminative information in the EEG. In this paper, we make two primary contributions: 1) We propose a novel spatial filtering method called Multiple Time Window LDA Beamformer (MTWLB); 2) We provide a comprehensive comparison of nine spatial filtering pipelines using three spatial filtering schemes, namely, MTWLB, xDAWN, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and three linear classification methods Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR) and Logistic Regression (LR). The results reveal that MTWLB and xDAWN enhance the classification performance but CSP does not. The results also support the conclusion that LR can be effective for a RSVP-based BCI if discriminative features are available.

We introduced a feature extraction approach based on frequency domain analysis to improve the classification performance on different mental tasks using single-channel EEG. This biologically inspired method extracts the most discriminative spectral features from power spectral densities (PSDs) of the EEG signals. We applied our method on a dataset of six subjects who performed five different imagination tasks: (i) resting state, (ii) mental arithmetic, (iii) imagination of left hand movement, (iv) imagination of right hand movement, and (v) imagination of letter "A." Pairwise and multiclass classifications were performed in single EEG channel using Linear Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machines. Our method produced results (mean classification accuracy of 83.06% for binary classification and 91.85% for multiclassification) that are on par with the state-of-the-art methods, using single-channel EEG with low computational cost. Among all task pairs, mental arithmetic versus letter imagination yielded the best result (mean classification accuracy of 90.29%), indicating that this task pair could be the most suitable pair for a binary class BCI. This study contributes to the development of single-channel BCI, as well as finding the best task pair for user defined applications.

Gert			EEG may serve as a biomarker in Huntington's disease using machine learning automatic classification	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							OSCILLATIONS; NEURODEGENERATION; MECHANISMS; NETWORKS; THETA	Reliable markers measuring disease progression in Huntington's disease (HD), before and after disease manifestation, may guide a therapy aimed at slowing or halting disease progression. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) may provide a quantification method for possible (sub) cortical dysfunction occurring prior to or concomitant with motor or cognitive disturbances observed in HD. In this pilot study we construct an automatic classifier distinguishing healthy controls from HD gene carriers using qEEG and derive qEEG features that correlate with clinical markers known to change with disease progression in HD, with the aim of exploring biomarker potential. We included twenty-six HD gene carriers (49.7 +/- 8.5 years) and 25 healthy controls (52.7 +/- 8.7 years). EEG was recorded for three minutes with subjects at rest. An EEG index was created by applying statistical pattern recognition to a large set of EEG features, which was subsequently tested using 10-fold cross-validation. The index resulted in a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 1: a low value indicating a state close to normal and a high value pointing to HD. qEEG features that correlate specifically with commonly used clinical markers in HD research were derived. The classification index had a specificity of 83%, a sensitivity of 83% and an accuracy of 83%. The area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.9. qEEG analysis on subsets of electrophysiological features resulted in two highly significant correlations with clinical scores. The results of this pilot study suggest that qEEG may serve as a biomarker in HD. The indices correlating with modalities changing with the progression of the disease may lead to tools based on qEEG that help monitor efficacy in intervention studies.	[Odish, Omar F.

Recent studies have provided promising algorithms to decode the attentional state of a listener in a competingspeaker environment from non-invasive brain recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG). These algorithms require substantial training datasets and often exhibit poor performance at temporal resolutions suitable for real-time implementation, which hinders their utilization in emerging applications such as smart hearing aids. In this work, we propose a realtime attention decoding framework by integrating techniques from Bayesian filtering, l(1)-regularization, state-space modeling, and Expectation Maximization, which is capable of producing robust and statistically interpretable measures of auditory attention at high temporal resolution. Application of our proposed algorithm to synthetic and real EEG data yields a performance close to the state-of-the-art offline methods, while operating in near real-time with a minimal amount of training data.

Brain Computer Interfacing (BCI) is a communication system which uses these commands to interact with outside world. BCI's have extensive applications such as to classify motor imagery tasks, and to detect abnormalities and loss of functions of brain. Selection and optimization of the efficient processing technique to extract discriminative features from the EEG signals is a key to develop high performance and robust system. The main purpose of the feature selection and reduction process is threefold: by extracting relevant features computational complexity can be reduced, it improve performance by avoiding over fitting which may be caused due to irrelevant features, selected features will take less time to process. Some novel methods such as time-domain analysis, power spectral estimation, and wavelet transform have been widely used for the evaluation of the selected subset of features. In this paper first, we survey comparative evaluation of various recent techniques for feature selection and classification applied for BCI at each stage. Second, the use of deep learning techniques for brain signal classification is explored.

A number of experiments were done in terms of visual stimuli based EEG signals. The purpose of this paper is to improvise the existing methods in the classification of familiar and unfamiliar faces which can be used as a basic model in deception detection. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning based classification of EEG signals for the given visual stimuli. In this experiment, the subjects were shown by familiar and unfamiliar faces. After processing using Independent Component Analysis (ICA), the signal was fed to an autoencoder for classification. By training the model properly we got a mean accuracy of 82.21% which is far better than the models using conventional machine learning methods. Our model achieved the state of the art results for classification of familiar and unfamiliar EEG signals.

To this end, here, we record human electroencephalography (EEG) data associated with viewing face stimuli; then, we exploit spatiotemporal EEG information to determine the neural correlates of facial identity representations and to reconstruct the appearance of the corresponding stimuli. Our findings indicate that multiple temporal intervals support: facial identity classification, face space estimation, visual feature extraction and image reconstruction. In particular, we note that both classification and reconstruction accuracy peak in the proximity of the N170 component. Further, aggregate data from a larger interval (50-650 ms after stimulus onset) support robust reconstruction results, consistent with the availability of distinct visual information over time. Thus, theoretically, our findings shed light on the time course of face processing while, methodologically, they demonstrate the feasibility of EEG-based image reconstruction.

We defined three categories of conscious experience based on subjective reports: dream experience, dream experience without recall of content, and no conscious experience. The filter-bank common spatial pattern and shrinkage linear discriminant analysis were used to classify sleep consciousness. We also evaluated conscious experience using 10-fold cross-validation. Classification accuracy was 88.8% for the three classes. In particular, the sensitivity for no conscious experience was 0.99, and the sensitivity for dream experience with and without recall of content was 0.86 and 0.73, respectively. These results suggest that it is easy to predict the brain dynamics between conscious and no conscious experience, but to distinguish dream experiences with and without the recall of content is difficult. These findings could help predict the levels of consciousness during sleep and may help in developing a passive biomarker of the levels of consciousness in humans.

Quantifying Cognitive Workload in Simulated Flight Using Passive, Dry EEG Measurements	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COGNITIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Cognitive workload; electroencephalography (EEG); machine learning; pilots	PILOT MENTAL WORKLOAD; FEATURE-SELECTION; ECG-CHANGES; TASK; CLASSIFICATION; TRANSFORM; DIMENSION; SYSTEMS; SPEECH	A reliable method for quantifying cognitive workload in pilots could find uses in flight training and scheduling, cockpit design, and improving flight safety. Many proposed methods for monitoring cognitive workload in this population rely on measuring physiological responses to externally delivered probe stimuli and/or use traditional gel-based electroencephalography (EEG) sensors. Here we develop passive, probe-independent algorithms for classifying three levels of flight task complexity based on 4-channel, gel-free EEG during simulated flight. Using a library of 168 input features drawn from different data science application domains, we evaluated 13 different classifiers, using a nested tenfold cross-validation procedure to estimate generalization performance. The best subsets of features yielded a median classification accuracy of 90.17% across subjects, with perfect accuracy in one subject and greater than 75% in 16 of 21 subjects. Though EEG line length and linear discriminant analysis were generally among the most effective features and classifiers, respectively, we find that to maximize prediction accuracy, feature set-classifier combinations should be individualized. No single channel proved more valuable than another in predicting flight task complexity, but combining EEG features across channels maintained or improved performance in 81% of subjects.

Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) has been a promising feature extraction approach to deal with subject-specific behavior in Motor Imagery classification. Though its computational complexity has been on the lower side, the approach has not yet matched the classification accuracy of non-FBCSP approaches. By introducing a combined feature set of Band Power (BP) features and Time Domain (TDP) features in FBCSP approach we have succeeded in proposing an approach of high classification accuracy while out competing the computational complexity of the best reported non-FBCSP approaches. We have also analyzed the impact of parameter variations on classification accuracy and achieved 0:59 mean kappa value for Dataset 2a BCI competition IV on four class problem. This is the highest reported for FBCSP approaches along with the lowest inter-subject variation.

Covariance matrices are extracted as the EEG signal descriptors, and different dissimilarity metrics on the manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices are investigated to classify these covariance descriptors. Specifically, we compare the performance of the Log Euclidean distance, Stein divergence, Kullback-Leibler divergence and Von Neumann divergence. Furthermore, inspired from the conventional Common Spatial Pattern, discriminant analysis performed directly on the SPD manifold using different mentioned metrics are proposed to improve the classification accuracy. We also propose a new feature, namely Heterogeneous Orders Relevance Composition (HORC), by combining different relevance matrices, such as Covariance, Mutual Information or Kernel Matrix under the Tensor Framework and Multiple Kernel fusion. Multi-Class Multi-Kernel Relevance Vector Machine is adopted to provide a sparse classifier and Bayesian confidence prediction. Finally, we compare the performance of total 16 methods on the dataset IIa of the BCI Competition IV. The results shows that the mentioned dissimilarity metrics perform quite equally on the original manifold, whereas the proposed discrimination methods can improve the accuracy by 3-5% on the reduced dimension manifold.

Extracting these patterns from a set of EEG records provides a dataset to be used in machine learning in order to implement an intelligent classification system that predict prognosis of the baby. In a previous work we proved that inter-burst intervals (IBI) found in the EEG records predicts abnormal outcomes of the premature. A bibliographic study on the amplitude of an EEG signal, with the annotations of the neuro-pediatricians, showed that low amplitudes in EEG signal are strongly correlated with an abnormal prognosis of the premature, similar to that of IBI. According to these hypotheses, we present in this paper, a segmentation methodology on the amplitude of bursts intervals of EEG signal into 3 segments: low, medium and high, in addition to the inter-burst intervals. We create a new algorithm that detects 6 important parameters in each interval of these 4 segments. After applying this new methodology, we obtain a new classified dataset that contains 24 parameters extracted from these 4 segments to obtain with gestational age of the preterm and the day of recording 26 input attributes and one output which is the class (normal, sick or risky). Finally we validate the pertinence of these attributes using artificial neural network.

It has also increased the need for secure access to personal information in the cloud. Biometrics is one approach to person recognition, which can be used in identification as well as authentication. Among the various modalities that have been developed, electroencephalography (EEG)-based biometrics features unparalleled universality, distinctiveness and collectability, while minimizing the risk of circumvention. However, commercializing EEG-based person recognition poses a number of challenges. This article reviews the various systems proposed over the past few years with a focus on the shortcomings that have prevented wide-scale implementation, including issues pertaining to temporal stability, psychological and physiological changes, protocol design, equipment and performance evaluation. We also examine several directions for the further development of usable EEG-based recognition systems as well as the niche markets to which they could be applied. It is expected that rapid advancements in EEG instrumentation, on-device processing and machine learning techniques will lead to the emergence of commercialized person recognition systems in the near future.

Some examples are the structure of the first perceptron, inspired in the retina, neuroprosthetics based on ganglion cell recordings or Hopfield networks. In addition, machine learning provides a powerful set of tools to analyze neural data, which has already proved its efficacy in so distant fields of research as speech recognition, behavioral states classification, or LFP recordings. However, despite the huge technological advances in neural data reduction of dimensionality, pattern selection, and clustering during the last years, there has not been a proportional development of the analytical tools used for Time-Frequency (T-F) analysis in neuroscience. Bearing this in mind, we introduce the convenience of using non-linear, non-stationary tools, EMD algorithms in particular, for the transformation of the oscillatory neural data (EEG, EMG, spike oscillations.) into the T-F domain prior to its analysis with machine learning tools. We support that to achieve meaningful conclusions, the transformed data we analyze has to be as faithful as possible to the original recording, so that the transformations forced into the data due to restrictions in the T-F computation are not extended to the results of the machine learning analysis. Moreover, bioinspired computation such as brain-machine interface may be enriched from a more precise definition of neuronal coding where non-linearities of the neuronal dynamics are considered.

Methods: Resting-state high-density EEG recording data from 20 left TLE patients, 20 right TLE patients and 35 healthy controls was used. Epochs without interictal spikes were selected. The cortical source activity was obtained for 82 regions of interest and whole-brain directed functional connectivity was estimated in the theta, alpha and beta frequency bands. These connectivity values were then used to build a classification system based on two two-class Random Forests classifiers: TLE vs healthy controls and left vs right TLE. Feature selection and classifier training were done in a leave-one-out procedure to compute the mean classification accuracy. Results: The diagnosis and lateralization classifiers achieved a high accuracy (90.7% and 90.0% respectively), sensitivity (95.0% and 90.0% respectively) and specificity (85.7% and 90.0% respectively). The most important features for diagnosis were the outflows from left and right medial temporal lobe, and for lateralization the right anterior cingulate cortex. The interaction between features was important to achieve correct classification.

Data was collected from experiments focused on the study of cognitive processes that might evoke different specific strategies in the resolution of math problems. A binary classification problem was constructed using correlations and phase synchronization between different electroencephalographic channels as characteristics and, as labels or classes, the math performances of individuals participating in specially designed experiments. The proposed methodology is based on using well-established procedures of feature selection, which were used to determine a suitable brain functional network size related to math problem solving strategies and also to discover the most relevant links in this network without including noisy connections or excluding significant connections.

And most ear-EEG studies have focused on auditory or visual stimuli-based BCI. However, despite advantages of motor imagery (MI), the feasibility of MI-based ear-EEG BCI has not been investigated yet. Hence, in this paper, we examine the usability of MI-based ear-EEG BCI in two folds; 1) observing MI patterns around the ear and 2) classifying MI tasks with satisfactory decoding performance. We propose a sequential backward spatio-spectral filter optimization (SBSSFO) to find a subject-specific optimal frequency band in ear-around EEG signals. And, we evaluate the performance of two datasets including a public dataset (i.e., BCI competition III dataset IVa). In an analysis, event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) patterns in the ear-around EEG signals showed the smaller intensity than motor-area EEG signals. But the similar patterns were inspected in time and frequency domain. As a result, the proposed method showed an average accuracy of 70.54% with approximately 10.5% and 3.6% performance enhancement compared to the standard common spatial pattern (CSP) and common spatio-spectral pattern (CSSP), respectively. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the ear-EEG for MI-BCI systems.

J	Khosrowabadi, R				Khosrowabadi, Resa			Stress and Perception of Emotional Stimuli: Long-term Stress Rewiring the Brain	BASIC AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Long-term Stress; Effective connectivity; Electroencephalography (EEG); Emotion	INFORMATION-FLOW; FEEDBACK; VALENCE	Introduction: Long-term Stressful situations can drastically influence one's mental life. However, the effect of mental Stress on recognition of emotional Stimuli needs to be explored. In this Study, recognition of emotional Stimuli in a Stressful situation was investigated. Four emotional conditions, including positive and 'native states in both low and high levels of arousal were analyzed. Methods: Twenty-six healthy right-handed university Students were recruited within or after examination period. Participants' Stress conditions were measured using the Perceived Stress Scale-14 (PSS-14). All participants were exposed to some audio-visual emotional Stimuli while their brains responses' were measured using the Electroencephalography (EEG) technique. During the experiment, the subject's perception of emotional Stimuli is evaluated using the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) questionnaire. After recording, EEG signatures of emotional States were estimated from connectivity patterns among 8 brain regions. Connectivity patterns were calculated using Phase Slope Index (PSI), Directed Transfer Function (DTF), and Generalized Partial Direct Coherence (GPDC) methods. The EEG-based connectivity features were then labeled with SAM responses. Subsequently, the labeled features were categorized using two different classifiers. Classification accuracy of the system was validated by leave-one-out method. Results: As expected, performance of the system is significantly improved by grouping the subjects to Stressed and Stress-free groups. EEG-based connectivity pattern was influenced by mental Stress level. Conclusion: Changes in connectivity patterns related to long-term mental stress have overlapped with changes caused by emotional stimuli. Interestingly, these changes are detectable from EEG data in eyes-closed condition.

ZuCo includes high-density EEG and eye-tracking data of 12 healthy adult native English speakers, each reading natural English text for 4-6 hours. The recordings span two normal reading tasks and one task-specific reading task, resulting in a dataset that encompasses EEG and eye-tracking data of 21,629 words in 1107 sentences and 154,173 fixations. We believe that this dataset represents a valuable resource for natural language processing (NLP). The EEG and eye-tracking signals lend themselves to train improved machine-learning models for various tasks, in particular for information extraction tasks such as entity and relation extraction and sentiment analysis. Moreover, this dataset is useful for advancing research into the human reading and language understanding process at the level of brain activity and eye-movement.

This methodology is motivated by the well-documented ability of the brain to predict sensory outcomes of self-generated and imagined actions using so-called forward models. We propose to subliminally stimulate the sensory modality corresponding to a user's intended movement, and decode a user's movement intention from his electroencephalography (EEG), by decoding for prediction errors-whether the sensory prediction corresponding to a user's intended movement matches the subliminal sensory stimulation we induce. We tested our proposal in a binary wheelchair turning task in which users thought of turning their wheelchair either left or right. We stimulated their vestibular system subliminally, toward either the left or the right direction, using a galvanic vestibular stimulator and show that the decoding for prediction errors from the EEG can radically improve movement intention decoding performance. We observed an 87.2% median single-trial decoding accuracy across tested participants, with zero user training, within 96 ms of the stimulation, and with no additional cognitive load on the users because the stimulation was subliminal.

In sleep medicine, it is relevant to detect macro-events (>= 10 s) such as sleep stages, and micro-events (<= 2 s) such as spindles and K-complexes. Annotations of such events require a trained sleep expert, a time consuming and tedious process with a large inter-scorer variability. Automatic algorithms have been developed to detect various types of events but these are event-specific. We propose a deep learning method that jointly predicts locations, durations and types of events in EEG time series. It relies on a convolutional neural network that builds a feature representation from raw EEG signals. Numerical experiments demonstrate efficiency of this new approach on various event detection tasks compared to current state-of-the-art, event specific, algorithms.

SEREEGA: Simulating event-related EEG activity	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Simulation; Evaluation; Event-related; Classification; Brain-computer interface; Ground truth	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; CONNECTIVITY MEASURES; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; OCULAR ARTIFACTS; BRAIN; DYNAMICS; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE	Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular method to monitor brain activity, but it is difficult to evaluate EEG-based analysis methods because no ground-truth brain activity is available for comparison. Therefore, in order to test and evaluate such methods, researchers often use simulated EEG data instead of actual EEG recordings. Simulated data can be used, among other things, to assess or compare signal processing and machine learning algorithms, to model EEG variabilities, and to design source reconstruction methods. New method: We present SEREEGA, Simulating Event-Related EEG Activity. SEREEGA is a free and open-source MATLAB-based toolbox dedicated to the generation of simulated epochs of EEG data. It is modular and extensible, at initial release supporting five different publicly available head models and capable of simulating multiple different types of signals mimicking brain activity. This paper presents the architecture and general workflow of this toolbox, as well as a simulated data set demonstrating some of its functions. The toolbox is available at https://github.com/lrkrol/SEREEGA. Results: The simulated data allows established analysis pipelines and classification methods to be applied and is capable of producing realistic results. Comparison with existing methods: Most simulated EEG is coded from scratch. The few open-source methods in existence focus on specific applications or signal types, such as connectivity.

Human-building interaction under various indoor temperatures through neural-signal electroencephalogram (EEG) methods	BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Machine learning; Human-building interaction; Thermal comfort; Performance	PERCEIVED AIR-QUALITY; PERSONALIZED VENTILATION; THERMAL COMFORT; OFFICE WORKERS; HUMID CLIMATE; SBS SYMPTOMS; PERFORMANCE; PRODUCTIVITY; HOT; RECOGNITION	In this study, potential of neural-signal electroencephalogram (EEG)-based methods for enhancing human building interaction under various indoor temperatures were explored. Correlations between EEG and subjective perceptions/tasks performance were experimentally investigated. Machine learning-based EEG pattern recognition was further studied. Results showed that the EEG frontal asymmetrical activity related well to the subjective questionnaire and objective tasks performance, which can be used as a more objective metric to corroborate traditional subjective questionnaire-based methods and task-based methods. Machine learning based EEG pattern recognition with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers can well classify the different mental states under different thermal conditions. Utilization of the EEG frontal asymmetrical activities and the machine learning-based EEG pattern recognition method as a feedback mechanism of occupants, which can be implemented on a routine basis, has a great potential to enhance the human-building interaction in a more objective and holistic way.

Here we took advantage of the information available in temporal oscillatory patterns evoked by simple perceptual decisions to investigate whether stimulus dependent oscillatory signatures can be used as potential biomarkers in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Methods: We studied an extensive set of stimuli (9 categories of faces) and performed data driven classification (Support vector machine, SVM) of ASD vs. Controls with features based on the EEG power responses. We carried out an extensive time-frequency and synchrony analysis of distinct face categories requiring different processing mechanisms in terms of non-holistic vs. holistic processing. Results: We found that the neuronal oscillatory responses of low gamma frequency band, locked to photographic and abstract two-tone (Mooney) face stimulus presentation are decreased in ASD vs. the control group. We also found decreased time-frequency (TF) responses in the beta band in ASD after 350 ms, possibly related to motor preparation. On the other hand, synchrony in the 30-45 Hz band showed a distinct spatial pattern in ASD. These power changes enabled accurate classification of ASD with an SVM approach. SVM accuracy was approximately 85%. ROC curves showed about 94% AUC (area under the curve). Combination of Mooney and Photographic face stimuli evoked features enabled a better separation between groups, reaching an AUC of 98.6%. Conclusion: We identified a relative decrease in EEG responses to face stimuli in ASD in the beta (15-30 Hz; > 350 ms) and gamma (30-45 Hz; 55-80 Hz; 50-350 ms) frequency ranges. These can be used as input of a machine learning approach to separate between groups with high accuracy. Significance: Future studies can use EEG time-frequency patterns evoked by particular types of faces as a diagnostic biomarker and potentially as outcome measures in therapeutic trials.

EEG signals are used to monitor and diagnose epileptic behavior. Because pattern classification for EEG has certain uncertainty, this paper presents a novel classification technique based the synthetic of wavelet analysis and support vector machine (SVM). The normal EEG signal and epileptic EEG signal are compared in the sense of classification accuracy and training time. Our experimental results show the proposed method of combing wavelet analysis and SVM can achieve sound classification performance for EEG signals. The proposed method can distinguish easily the epileptic EEG and the normal EEG. That is to say, our experimental results also demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed classification method.

Traditional machine learning approaches require to design and extract various features from single or multiple channels based on comprehensive domain knowledge. Consequently, these approaches may be an obstacle for non-domain experts. On the contrast, deep learning approaches have been used successfully in many recent literatures to learn features and classify different types of data. In this paper, baseline signals are considered and a simple but effective pre-processing method has been proposed to improve the recognition accuracy. Meanwhile, a hybrid neural network which combines 'Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)' and 'Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)' has been applied to classify human emotion states by effectively learning compositional spatial-temporal representation of raw EEG streams. The CNN module is used to mine the inter-channel correlation among physically adjacent EEG signals by converting the chain-like EEG sequence into 2D-like frame sequence. The LSTM module is adopted to mine contextual information. Experiments are carried out in a segment-level emotion identification task, on the DEAP benchmarking dataset. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed pre-processing method can increase emotion recognition accuracy by 32% approximately and the model achieves a high performance with a mean accuracy of 90.80% and 91.03% on valence and arousal classification task respectively.

A typical example is to identify evolving synchronization patterns from multivariate electroencephalography (EEG) routinely superimposed with intensive noise in epilepsy research and practice. Under the circumstance of insufficient a priori knowledge of subject dependency on domain problem, it becomes even more important to adaptively classify the synchronization dynamics to accurately characterize the intrinsic nature of seizure activities represented by the EEG. This paper first measures the global maximal information coefficient (MIC) of all EEG data channels to form a time sequence of correlation matrices. A lightweight VGGNet (Visual Geometry Group) is designed to adapt to the need to prune massive EEG datasets. The VGGNet characterizes the synchronization dynamics captured in the correlation matrices and then automatically identifies the seizure states of the EEG. Experiments are performed over the Children's Hospital Boston-Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CHB-MIT) scalp EEG dataset to evaluate the proposed approach. Seizure states can be identified with an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of [98.13% +/- 0.24%], [98.85% +/- 0.51%], and [97.47% +/- 0.36%], respectively; the resulting performance is superior to those of most existing methods over the same dataset. The approach directly applies to raw EEG analysis, which holds great potential for handling brain big data.

Yet, electroencephalography (EEG)-based assistive and rehabilitative brain-computer interface (BCI) systems typically rely on motor imagination (MI) of one limb at the time. In this paper, we present a classifier which discriminates between uni-and bi-manual MI. Ten able-bodied participants took part in cue-based motor execution (ME) and MI tasks of the left (L), right (R) and both (B) hands. A 32-channel EEG was recorded. Three linear discriminant analysis classifiers, based on MI of L-B, B-R, and B-L hands were created, with features based on wide band common spatial patterns (CSP) 8-30 Hz, and band specifics common spatial patterns (CSPb). Event-related desynchronization (ERD) was significantly stronger during bimanual compared to unimanual ME on both hemispheres. Bimanual MI resulted in bilateral parietally shifted ERD of similar intensity to unimanual MI. The average classification accuracy for CSP and CSPb was comparable for the L-R task (73% +/- 9% and 75% +/- 10%, respectively) and for the L-B task (73% +/- 11% and 70% +/- 9%, respectively). However, for the R-B task (67% +/- 3% and 72% +/- 6%, respectively), it was significantly higher for CSPb (p = 0.0351). Six participants whose L-R classification accuracy exceeded 70% were included in an online task a week later, using the unmodified offline CSPb classifier, achieving 69% +/- 3% and 66% +/- 3% accuracy for L-R and R-B tasks, respectively. Combined uni-and bi-manual BCI could be used for restoration of motor function of highly disabled patents and for motor rehabilitation of patients with motor deficits.

Automatic slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) are two known phases of sleep. However, the level by which those changes contribute to brain interactions has not been well characterized. In recent years, it has been shown that brain connectivity measuring can be helpful in investigation of behavioral states of the brain. By considering the fact that brains have different states in different stages of sleep, the present work employs effective connectivity and machine-learning analysis to quantify and classify SWS and REM stages of sleep. We examine low-density 12-channel EEG data from 8 healthy participants during a full night of sleep. Data were epoched into 30-s windows and SWS and REM stages were labeled by a sleep consultant. Effective connectivity was quantified using a directed metric, generalized partial directed coherence, and measures were used as input features for a machine-learning system. A support vector machine classifier was used to solve 2 binary problems of REM vs. nREM and SWS vs. nSWS.

J	Shahtalebi, S; Mohammadi, A				Shahtalebi, Soroosh; Mohammadi, Arash			Bayesian Optimized Spectral Filters Coupled With Ternary ECOC for Single-Trial EEG Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces (BCI); electroencephalography (EEG); spatio-spectral filter optimization; biomedical signal processing; motor imagery; discriminative feature extraction	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MOTOR IMAGERY; BCI; PATTERNS; FUTURE	Motivated by the promising emergence of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) within assistive/rehabilitative systems for therapeutic applications, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian framework that simultaneously optimizes a number of subject-specific filter banks and spatial filters. Optimized double-band spectro-spatial filters are derived based on common spatial patterns coupled with the error-correcting output coding (ECOC) classifiers. The proposed framework constructs optimized subject-specific spectral filters in an intuitive fashion resulting in creation of significantly discriminant features, which is a crucial requirement for any EEG-based BCI system. Through incorporation of the ECOC approach, the classification problem is then modeled as communication over a noisy channel where the misclassification error is corrected by error correction techniques borrowed from an information theory. This paper also proposes a modified version of the ECOC adopted to EEG classification problems by deploying ternary class codewords to increase the Hamming distance between the codewords and introduce more robustness to misclassification error. The proposed framework is evaluated over two different datasets from the BCI Competition (i.e., BCIC-IV2a and BCIC-IV2b). The results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms its counterparts and validate the essential role of optimized spectral filters on the overall classification accuracy.

In Brain Computer Interface (BCI) research, for example, changes of brain signals in relation to specific tasks (e.g., thinking something) are detected and used to control machines. While extracting spatio-temporal cues from brain signals for classifying state of human mind is an explored path, decoding and visualizing brain states is new and futuristic. Following this latter direction, in this paper, we propose an approach that is able not only to read the mind, but also to decode and visualize human thoughts. More specifically, we analyze brain activity, recorded by an ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG), of a subject while thinking about a digit, character or an object and synthesize visually the thought item. To accomplish this, we leverage the recent progress of adversarial learning by devising a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which takes, as input, encoded EEG signals and generates corresponding images. In addition, since collecting large EEG signals in not trivial, our GAN model allows for learning distributions with limited training data. Performance analysis carried out on three different datasets - brain signals of multiple subjects thinking digits, characters, and objects - show that our approach is able to effectively generate images from thoughts of a person. They also demonstrate that EEG signals encode explicitly cues from thoughts which can be effectively used for generating semantically relevant visualizations.

However, current detection approaches mainly rely on limited features manually designed by domain experts, which are inflexible for the detection of a variety of patterns in a large amount of patients' EEG data. Moreover, conventional machine learning algorithms for seizure detection cannot accommodate multi-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) data effectively, which contains both temporal and spatial information. Recently, deep learning technology has been widely applied to perform image processing tasks, which could learns useful features from data and process multi-channel data automatically. To provide an effective system for automatic seizure detection, we proposed a new three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (CNN) structure, whose inputs are multi-channel EEG signals.MethodsEEG data of 13 patients were collected from one center hospital, which has already been inspected by experts. To represent EEG data in CNN, firstly time series of each channel of EEG data was converted into the two-dimensional image. Then all channel images were combined into 3D images according to the mutual correlation intensity between different electrodes. Finally, a CNN was constructed using 3D kernels to predict different stages of EEG data, including inter-ictal, pre-ictal, and ictal stages. The system performance was evaluated and compared with the traditional feature-based classifier and the two-dimensional (2D) deep learning method.ResultsIt demonstrated that multi-channel EEG data could provide more information for increasing the specificity and sensitivity in cpmparison result between the single and multi-channel. And the 3D CNN based on multi-channel outperformed the 2D CNN and traditional signal processing methods with an accuracy of more than 90%, an sensitivity of 88.90% and an specificity of 93.78%.ConclusionsThis is the first effort to apply 3D CNN in detecting seizures from EEG. It provides a new way of learning patterns simultaneously from multi-channel EEG signals, and demonstrates that deep neural networks in combination with 3D kernels can establish an effective system for seizure detection.

An increasing number of studies have provided evidence for neural substrates underlying respective strategies, suggesting that a single RL algorithm cannot make accurate predictions about individual choices. Despite rapid progress in predicting humans intentions such as movements or choices, there has been no attempt to read out human learning strategies. We proposed a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) framework for decoding human learning strategies from electroencephalography (EEG) data. To circumvent the issue that there is no gold standard for labeling learning strategies, we trained the proposed framework classifier to best match predictions of the computational model of the neural process underlying human learning strategies. The simulation used a 1D, 2D, and 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) on 18 subjects; the EEG data demonstrated that the proposed framework successfully read out human learning strategies with very high accuracy (98.4%). Subsequently, we examined whether those learning strategies labeled from the computational model exhibited distinctive EEG patterns. We used class activation mapping (CAM) for visualization, and we identified distinctive strategy-dependent patterns in the EEG feature space. We argue that the proposed framework has great potential for decoding high-level cognitive states.

Furthermore, diverse data sets, e.g., recorded from various subjects or tasks, can even exhibit distinct feature spaces. The fact that data that have to be classified are often only available in small amounts reinforces the need for techniques to generalize learned information, as performances of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are enhanced by increasing quantity of available data. In this paper, we apply transfer learning to a framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (deep ConvNets) to prove the transferability of learned patterns in error-related brain signals across different tasks. The experiments described in this paper demonstrate the usefulness of transfer learning, especially improving performances when only little data can be used to distinguish between erroneous and correct realization of a task. This effect could be delimited from a transfer of merely general brain signal characteristics, underlining the transfer of error-specific information. Furthermore, we could extract similar patterns in time-frequency analyses in identical channels, leading to selective high signal correlations between the two different paradigms. Classification on the intracranial data yields in median accuracies up to (81.50 +/- 9.49) %. Decoding on only 10% of the data without pre-training reaches performances of (54.76 +/- 3.56) %, compared to (64.95 +/- 0.79) % with pre-training.

Yet, these two spatial transformations are conceptually, visually, and mathematically equivalent. Thus, an active debate in the field is whether these two types of spatial transformations are cognitively and neurally distinct or whether they represent different manifestation of the same underlying core mental process. In this study, we utilize a machine learning approach to extract neural activity from electroencephalography (EEG) measures and identify neural differences between mental rotation and perspective taking tasks. Our results provide novel empirical evidence in support of the view that these two types of spatial transformation correspond to district cognitive processes at the neural level. Importantly, the proposed framework provides a novel approach that can facilitate the study of the neural correlates of spatial cognition.

In particular, we investigated global and nodal graph features of normal hearing (NH) and hearing impaired (HI) participants' brain networks via functional connectivity while they responded to clear and noise-degraded speech stimuli. We found that HI listeners had higher eccentricity, diameter and characteristic path length than the NH listeners for clear speech sounds, and larger radii for noisy speech signal. Moreover, we classified groups based on these graph theoretic features using support vector machine (SVM). Maximum classifier accuracy was 85.71% for clear speech (F1-score=86.00%) and 71.42% (F1=67%) for degraded speech signals, respectively. Group classification based on nodal connectivity measures was more accurate in the left brain hemisphere, consistent with the leftward laterality of auditory-linguistic processing. Our data suggest HI listeners have more extended communication pathways and less efficient information exchange among brain regions than NH, establishing new biomarkers of hearing loss based on full-brain connectivity.

Given that many channels are collected for each single-trial, the multichannel EEG classification problem can be treated as multivariate time series classification problem. For multichannel EEG data to be more accurately classified, we propose an algorithm, called the fuzzy multichannel EEG classifier (FMCEC). This algorithm can take into consideration the interaction among different signals collected at different time instants and locations on the skull when constructing a classifier. The FMCEC first preprocess raw EEG data by eliminating noise by discretization of the data. It then performs fuzzification of the resulting discretized data to capture imprecision and vagueness in the data. Given the fuzzified data, FMCEC then discovers intrachannel patterns within each channel and then interchannel patterns between different channels of EEGs. The discovered patterns, which are represented as fuzzy temporal patterns, are then used to characterize and differentiate between different classes of multichannel EEG data. To evaluate the effectiveness of FMCEC, we tested it with several sets of real EEG datasets. The results show that the algorithm can be a promising tool for the classification of multichannel EEG data.	[Zhou, Pei-Yuan; Chan, Keith C.

We propose enhancements to different feature extractors, along with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, to simultaneously improve classification accuracy and execution time during training and testing. We focus on the well-known common spatial pattern (CSP) and Riemannian covariance methods, and significantly extend these two feature extractors to multiscale temporal and spectral cases. The multiscale CSP features achieve 73.70 15.90% (mean standard deviation across 9 subjects) classification accuracy that surpasses the state-of-the-art method In 70.6 14.70%, on the 4-class BCI competition IV-2a dataset. The Riemannian covariance features outperform the CSP by achieving 74.27 15.5% accuracy and executing 9x faster in training and 4x faster in testing. Using more temporal windows for Riemannian features results in 75.47 12.8% accuracy with 1.6 x faster testing than CSP.

Epileptic Electroencephalograms signals (EEG signals) depict the electrical activities of neurons and consist of some physiological and pathological information. EEG is one of the non-invasive methods for monitoring and diagnosing epileptic behavior. Classification of epileptic electroencephalograms signal has important medical diagnostic significance. In this study, a novel method is proposed to extract features from P300 component. A method of optimizing parameters on classing EEG signals is presented. In this study, the proposed method is compared with the empirical parameters and the grid search in the sense of training accuracy and training time. The proposed classifier has more advantage than the empirical parameters and the grid search for training this got sample in the sense of the average training accuracy and training time. Our experimental results also demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed classification method.

The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of ear-EEGs for development of an endogenous BCI system that uses self-modulated brain activity. We performed preliminary and main experiments where EEGs were measured on the scalp and behind the ears to check the reliability of ear-EEGs as compared to scalp-EEGs. In the preliminary and main experiments, subjects performed eyes-open and eyes-closed tasks, and they performed mental arithmetic (MA) and light cognitive (LC) tasks, respectively. For data analysis, the brain area was divided into four regions of interest (ROIs) (i.e., frontal, central, occipital, and ear area). The preliminary experiment showed that the degree of alpha activity increase of the ear area with eyes closed is comparable to those of other ROIs (occipital > ear > central > frontal). In the main experiment, similar event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) patterns were observed between the four ROIs during MA and LC, and all ROIs showed the mean classification accuracies above 70% required for effective binary communication (MA vs. LC) (occipital = ear = central = frontal). From the results, we demonstrated that ear-EEG can be used to develop an endogenous BCI system based on cognitive tasks without external stimuli, which allows the usability of ear-EEGs to be extended.

The proposed DL approach is a cascade of one-dimensional convolutional neural networks and fully-connected neural networks (CNN-FC). The focus is mainly on three types of brain responses: non-imagery EEG (background EEG), (pure imagery) EEG, and EEG during the transitional period between background EEG and pure imagery (transitional imagery). The study of transitional imagery signals should provide greater insight into real-world scenarios. It may be inferred that pure imagery and transitional EEG are high and low power EEG imagery, respectively. Moreover, the results from the CNN-FC are compared to the conventional approach for motor imagery-BCI, namely the common spatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction and support vector machine (SVM) for classification (CSP-SVM). Under a joint training scheme, pure and transitional imagery are treated as the same class, while background EEG is another class. Ten-fold cross-validation is used to evaluate whether the joint training scheme significantly improves the performance task of classifying pure and transitional imagery signals from background EEG. Using sparse of just a few electrode channels (C-z, C-3 and C-4), mean accuracy reaches 71.52% and 70.27% for CNN-FC and CSP-SVM, respectively. On the other hand, mean accuracy without the joint training scheme achieve only 62.68% and 52.41% for CNN-FC and CSP-SVM, respectively.

From ERPs to MVPA Using the Amsterdam Decoding and Modeling Toolbox (ADAM)	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						MVPA; temporal generalization; decoding; EEG signal processing; time-frequency analysis; ERPs	HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; MULTIVARIATE PATTERN-ANALYSIS; ATTENTIONAL SELECTION; OBJECT RECOGNITION; TEMPORAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; ROC CURVE; EEG-DATA; BRAIN; REPRESENTATIONS	In recent years, time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has gained much popularity in the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. However, MVPA may appear daunting to those who have been applying traditional analyses using event-related potentials (ERPs) or event-related fields (ERFs). To ease this transition, we recently developed the Amsterdam Decoding and Modeling (ADAM) toolbox in MATLAB. ADAM is an entry-level toolbox that allows a direct comparison of ERP/ERF results to MVPA results using any dataset in standard EEGLAB or Fieldtrip format. The toolbox performs and visualizes multiple-comparison corrected group decoding and forward encoding results in a variety of ways, such as classifier performance across time, temporal generalization (time-by-time) matrices of classifier performance, channel tuning functions (CTFs) and topographical maps of (forward-transformed) classifier weights. All analyses can be performed directly on raw data or can be preceded by a time-frequency decomposition of the data in which case the analyses are performed separately on different frequency bands. The figures ADAM produces are publication-ready. In the current manuscript, we provide a cookbook in which we apply a decoding analysis to a publicly available MEG/EEG dataset involving the perception of famous, non-famous and scrambled faces. The manuscript covers the steps involved in single subject analysis and shows how to perform and visualize a subsequent group-level statistical analysis. The processing pipeline covers computation and visualization of group ERPs, ERP difference waves, as well as MVPA decoding results. It ends with a comparison of the differences and similarities between EEG and MEG decoding results. The manuscript has a level of description that allows application of these analyses to any dataset in EEGLAB or Fieldtrip format.	[Fahrenfort, Johannes J.; van Driel, Joram; Olivers, Christian N.

Analyses of multi-class MI data are challenging because feature extraction and classification of these data are more difficult as compared with those applied to binary-class data. This paper introduces a new model for multi-class MI-BCI data classification. The approach encompasses two main stages: feature extraction and fuzzy classification. In the feature extraction phase, a common spatial pattern algorithm is employed to extract significant discriminant features from the multi-class data. The obtained features serve as inputs to a fuzzy classifier that is designed by fusing the fuzzy standard additive model and particle swarm optimization method. The proposed fuzzy model aims to handle uncertainty, noise, and outliers existed in MI-BCI data. Experimental studies are carried out using two benchmark BCI competition data sets. Our results show the effectiveness of the fuzzy classifier against its competing techniques. The proposed model paths the way for paralysed or disordered patients to use movement imagery to control different assistive devices in their daily activities.

Conventionally, a time-consuming and laborious training procedure is performed on each new user to collect sufficient individualized data, hindering the applications of BCIs on monitoring brain states (e.g. drowsiness) in real-world settings. This study proposes applying hierarchical clustering to assess the inter- and intra-subject variability within a large-scale dataset of EEG collected in a simulated driving task, and validates the feasibility of transferring EEG-based drowsiness-detection models across subjects. A subject-transfer framework is thus developed for detecting drowsiness based on a large-scale model pool from other subjects and a small amount of alert baseline calibration data from a new user. The model pool ensures the availability of positive model transferring, whereas the alert baseline data serve as a selector of decoding models in the pool. Compared with the conventional within-subject approach, the proposed framework remarkably reduced the required calibration time for a new user by 90% (18.00 min-1.72 +/- 0.36 min) without compromising performance (p = 0.0910) when sufficient existing data are available. These findings suggest a practical pathway toward plug-and-play drowsiness detection and can ignite numerous real-world BCI applications.

There are a few studies concerning the implications in the context of BCIs, but its potential for establishing a communication channel in patients suffering from neuromuscular disorders remains totally unexplored. We investigate, here, this possibility by estimating the time-resolved phase connectivity patterns induced during a motor imagery (MI) task and adopting a supervised learning scheme to recover the subject's intention from the streaming data.MethodsElectroencephalographic activity from six patients suffering from neuromuscular disease (NMD) and six healthy individuals was recorded during two randomly alternating, externally cued, MI tasks (clenching either left or right fist) and a rest condition. The metric of Phase locking value (PLV) was used to describe the functional coupling between all recording sites. The functional connectivity patterns and the associate network organization was first compared between the two cohorts. Next, working at the level of individual patients, we trained support vector machines (SVMs) to discriminate between left and right based on different instantiations of connectivity patterns (depending on the encountered brain rhythm and the temporal interval). Finally, we designed and realized a novel brain decoding scheme that could interpret the intention from streaming connectivity patterns, based on an ensemble of SVMs.ResultsThe group-level analysis revealed increased phase synchrony and richer network organization in patients. This trend was also seen in the performance of the employed classifiers. Time-resolved connectivity led to superior performance, with distinct SVMs acting as local experts, specialized in the patterning emerged within specific temporal windows (defined with respect to the external trigger). This empirical finding was further exploited in implementing a decoding scheme that can be activated without the need of the precise timing of a trigger.ConclusionThe increased phase synchrony in NMD patients can turn to a valuable tool for MI decoding. Considering the fast implementation for the PLV pattern computation in multichannel signals, we can envision the development of efficient personalized BCI systems in assistance of these patients.

A Common Spatial Pattern Approach for Classification of Mental Counting and Motor Execution EEG	INTELLIGENT HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Intelligent Human Computer Interaction (IHCI)	DEC 07-09, 2018	Allahabad, INDIA	Indian Inst Informat Technol Allahabad		Brain computer interface; Electroencephalography; Motor execution; Mental counting; Common spatial pattern; Gaussian mixture model; Support vector machine	IMAGERY; TASK	A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) as a medium of communication is convenient for people with severe motor disabilities. Although there are a number of different BCIs, the focus of this paper is on Electroencephalography (EEG) as a means of human computer interaction. Motor imagery and mental arithmetic are the most popular techniques used to modulate brain waves that can be used to control devices. We show that it is possible to define different mental states using real fist rotation and imagined reverse counting. While people have already investigated left fist rotation and right fist rotation for dual state BCI, we intend to define a new state using mental reverse counting. We use Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) approach for feature extraction to distinguish between these states. CSP has been prominently used in the context of motor imagery task, we define its applicability for the distinction between motor execution and mental counting. CSP features are evaluated using classifiers like GMM, SVM, and GMM-UBM. GMM-UBM using data filtered through the beta band (13-30 Hz) gives the best performance.

As the current BMI technology has several obstacles to overcome, additional sources of brain activity need to be explored. It seems plausible that the brain activity associated with top-down cognitive functions could open a new prospect in the field of BMIs. As top down cognitive BMIs could exploit neural signals from more diverse networks, a deep-learning approach with complex hidden layers may provide a more optimal decoding performance. In this study, using our top-down steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) paradigm (N = 20), we observed that the decoding accuracy (48.42%) of a deep-learning algorithm with a sigmoid activation function was significantly higher than that of regularized linear discriminant analysis (rLDA) with shrinkage (42.52%; t(19) =-3.183, p < 0.01), used in our previous study. Therefore, a deep-learning approach seems to be more optimized for classification in the top-down cognitive BMI paradigm.

However, the visual stimuli are of no interest to the users as they just serve as the hidden codes behind the characters. Furthermore, using stronger visual stimuli could cause visual fatigue and other adverse symptoms to users. Therefore, it's imperative for visual BCIs to use small and inconspicuous visual stimuli to code characters. Methods: This study developed a new BCI speller based on miniature asymmetric visual evoked potentials (aVEPs), which encodes 32 characters with a space-code division multiple access scheme and decodes EEG features with a discriminative canonical pattern matching algorithm. Notably, the visual stimulus used in this study only subtended 0.5 degrees of visual angle and was placed outside the fovea vision on the lateral side, which could only induce a miniature potential about 0.5 mu V in amplitude and about 16.5 dB in signal-to-noise rate. A total of 12 subjects were recruited to use the miniature aVEP speller in both offline and online tests. Results: Information transfer rates up to 63.33 b/min could be achieved from online tests (online demo URL: https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=kC7btB3mvGY). Conclusion: Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of using very small and inconspicuous visual stimuli to implement an efficient BCI system, even though the elicited EEG features are very weak. Significance: The proposed innovative technique can broaden the category of BCIs and strengthen the brain-computer communication.

This means that a user has to perform rather tedious and time-consuming mental tasks before starting to use a BCI. Moreover, amount of train data that can be recorded from a single user is strongly limited, thus limiting quality of classifier training. The range of brain signal variations between the users, however, is not infinite: background and task-related signal patterns can be similar within certain groups of the users. In this work we propose a method for finding users whose data look similar from the classifier's "point of view". It allows for concatenating data from the users demonstrating similarity between their signals, so that larger training sets can be formed, or a classifier trained on one user can be applied in training of a classifier for another user.

However, mental workload (MWL) cannot be perceived directly as it is a complex and abstract property of human physiology. The techniques available in the literature for its assessment usually depend on subjective analysis, performance analysis and psycho-physiological measurements. But, these approaches despite being followed often prove to be inadequate due to high inter-personal variations and inconvenient procedures and subjective to the bias of evaluators. With the recent advancements of proliferation of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) devices and machine learning algorithms, it is possible to estimate MWL automatically. Nevertheless, there is a need to address issue like managing a high dimension and high volume data in real time. In this work, we propose an approach to estimate the mental workload using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of an operator while in operation. A thorough investigation of different features, optimization of features and selecting an optimal number of channels are the some of the crucial steps have been addressed in this work. We propose a novel feature engineering method to extract a reduced set of features and utilize only a sub-set of channels for the purpose of classification of workload into different levels with the help of supervised machine learning techniques. Further, we investigate the performance of different classifiers and compare their results. It can be inferred from the observed results that mental workload estimation using machine learning algorithms is a better solution compared to the existing approaches.

In this study, we investigate different electroencephalography (EEG) feature extraction and classification techniques to assist in the diagnosis of both epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). First, the EEG signal is pre-processed to remove major artifacts before being decomposed into several EEG sub-bands using a discrete-wavelet-transform (DWT). Two nonlinear methods were studied, namely, Shannon entropy and largest Lyapunov exponent, which measure complexity and chaoticity in the EEG recording, in addition to the two conventional methods (namely, standard deviation and band power). We also study the use of a cross-correlation approach to measure synchronization between EEG channels, which may reveal abnormality in communication between brain regions. The extracted features are then classified using several classification methods. Different EEG datasets are used to verify the proposed design exploration techniques: the University of Bonn dataset, the MIT dataset, the King Abdulaziz University dataset, and our own EEG recordings (46 subjects). The combination of DWT, Shannon entropy, and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) techniques produces the most promising classification result, with an overall accuracy of up to 94.6% for the three-class (multi-channel) classification problem. The proposed method obtained better classification accuracy compared to the existing methods and tested using larger and more comprehensive EEG dataset. The proposed method could potentially be used to assist epilepsy and ASD diagnosis therefore improving the speed and the accuracy.

Prognostic value of EEG in West syndrome	VOJNOSANITETSKI PREGLED			English	Article						electroencephalography; prognosis; treatment outcome; spasm; infant; newborn; epilepsy	INFANTILE SPASMS; MEDICAL-TREATMENT; AMERICAN-ACADEMY; CLASSIFICATION; NEUROLOGY; ACTH	Background/Aim. West syndrome (WS) is an epileptic encephalopathy which is characterized by the trias: infantile spasms, psychomotor delay and specific electroencephalography (EEG) pattern. The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of EEG in the therapy of West syndrome. Methods. This study group comprised 68 patients (40 boys and 28 girls) with the diagnosis of WS. Criteria for inclusion of patients in this study were the disease onset in the first or the second year of life, specific seizure type and a characteristic EEG pattern. All patients were divided into 2 groups: symptomatic (37 patients) and cryptogenic (31 patients) WS. The outcome was assessed through the response to the therapy (seizure control and EEG findings). Follow-up was at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after the diagnosis was established. Results. Three months after starting the treatment 80.6% of patients with improved EEG were seizure free (p < 0.01); 85.7% of patients with EEG improvement at 3 months check-up were seizure free after 6 months (p < 0.01); 82.8% of patients with better EEG findings after 3 months had no seizures after 12 months (p < 0.05). Also, the majority of patients with improvement in EEG at 6 month follow-up (95.8%) had no seizures at one year follow-up (p < 0.01). The presence of seizures during this period did not depend on EEG after 6 months of treatment (p > 0.05). Most of the patients with improved (89.7%) and unchanged (70.6%) EEG after 12 months had no seizures after two years, whereas the patients with worsened EEG were with seizures. Conclusion. Seizure control after 6, 12 and 24 months depended on EEG finding at 3 months follow up. Seizure control after 12 months correlated with EEG after 6 months. The correlation between EEG after 12 months and seizure control after 24 months was not clear. EEG at 6 months follow-up did not affect seizure control after 2 years.

Eight subjects were recruited for the recording of imagination with five different words, namely; "go," "back," "left," "right," and "stop." Methods: One hundred trials for each word were recorded for both imagination and perception, although this study utilized only imagination data. Two different connectivity methods were applied, namely; a covariance-based and a maximum linear cross-correlation-based connectivity measure. These connectivity measures were further computed to extract the phase-only data as an additional method of feature extraction. In addition, four different channel selections were used. The final connectivity matrix from each of the four methods was vectorized and used as the feature vector for the classifier. To classify EEG data, a sigmoid activation function-based linear extreme learning machine was used. Result and Significance: We achieved a maximum classification rate of 40.30% (p < 0.007) and 87.90% (p < 0.003) in multiclass (five classes) and binary settings, respectively. Thus, our results suggested that EEG responses to imagined speech could be successfully classified using an extreme learning machine. Conclusion: This study involving the classification of imagined words can be a milestone contribution toward the development of practical brain-computer interface systems using silent speech.

These biomedical signals are currently being actively used in many research fields and have a wide range of potential uses in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The main aim of the present work is to improve the classification of EEG patterns for EEG-based BCI systems. Methods: In this paper, we presented a classification approach for EEG-based BCIs. For this purpose, in the training stage, 2-D representations of signals were extracted and a quasi-probabilistic learning model was built for binary classification. In the testing stage, the estimation of class membership probability was performed with an untrained sub-data set. To confirm the validity of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on the BCI Competition 2003 Data Sets (Ia and Ib). The classification performances were evaluated for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F-measure measurements using the five-fold leave-oneout cross-validation technique ten times. Results: The proposed method yielded an average classification accuracy of 95.54% (with sensitivity and specificity of 100.00% and 91.80% respectively) for Data Set Ia and accuracy of 72.37% (with sensitivity and specificity of 75.76% and 69.77% respectively) for Data Set Ib, which are the highest rates ever reported for both data sets. Conclusions: It is apparent from the results that the proposed method has potential and can assist in the development of effective EEG-based BCIs. The advantage of this method lies in its relatively simple algorithm and easy computational implementation. The experimental results also showed that the selection of relevant channels is an important step in developing efficient EEG-based BCI systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This increasingly available tool has become more than an instrument to detect nonconvulsive seizures (its primary use), and clinical indications span from ischemia detection in acute brain injuries, neuroprognostication of comatose patients, to monitoring the degree of encephalopathy. In this context, abnormal findings such as periodic discharges and rhythmic delta activity were increasingly recognized; however, significant subjectivity remained in the interpretation of these findings pertaining to key features regarding their spatial involvement, prevalence of occurrence, duration, associated morphologic features, and behavior. In 2005, the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society proposed standardized definitions and classification of electroencephalographic rhythmic and periodic patterns. This was subsequently revised in 2011 and in 2012 and is now being used by centers worldwide, with the final version published in early 2013 as an official guideline of the ACNS. The resulting uniform terminology has allowed for significant advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology, epileptogenic potential, and overall clinical implication of these patterns. Investigators across multiple institutions are now able to collaborate while exploring diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms to these patterns, an effort that may soon provide definitive evidence guiding treating clinicians on the management of these patients.

Association between death and loss of stage N2 sleep features among critically Ill patients with delirium	JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE			English	Article						Sleep; Critical illness; Electroencephalography; Polysomnography; Encephalopathy; Delirium	INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; ACUTE NONHYPOXIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; ICU ATYPICAL SLEEP; CONTINUOUS EEG; VENTILATED PATIENTS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; COHORT; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTOR; PATTERNS	Purpose: Critically ill patients experience significant sleep disruption. In this study of ICU patients with delirium. we evaluated associations between the loss of stage N2 features (K-complexes, sleep spindles), grade of encephalopathy based on electroencephalography (EEG), and intensive care unit (ICU) outcomes. We hypothesized that loss of stage N2 features is associated with more severe grades of encephalopathy and worse ICU outcomes including death. Materials and methods: This was an observational cohort study of 93 medical ICU patients without primary acute brain injury who underwent continuous EEG. Type and severity of critical illness, sedative-hypnotic use, length of stay, modified Rankin Scale at hospital discharge, and death during hospitalization were abstracted from the medical record. EEG was evaluated for grade of encephalopathy and sleep features. Results: Patients without K-complexes or without sleep spindles had more severe encephalopathy and higher odds of death. The odds ratio for patients without K-complexes was 18.8 (p = .046). The odds ratio for patients without sleep spindles was 6.3 (p = .036). Conclusions: Loss of stage N2 features is common and associated with more severe encephalopathy and higher odds of death. The absence of either Stage N2 feature, K complexes or sleep spindles. may have important prognostic value. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The aim of the study was to examine if ERPs recorded during an oddball task would predict cognitive functioning and information processing speed in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients and controls at the individual level. Seventy-eight participants (35 MS patients, 43 healthy age-matched controls) completed visual and auditory 2- and 3-stimulus oddball tasks with 128-channel EEG, and a neuropsychological battery, at baseline (month 0) and at Months 13 and 26. ERPs from 0 to 700 ms and across the whole scalp were transformed into 1728 individual spatio-temporal datapoints per participant. A machine learning method that included penalized linear regression used the entire spatio-temporal ERP to predict composite scores of both cognitive functioning and processing speed at baseline (month 0), and months 13 and 26. The results showed ERPs during the visual oddball tasks could predict cognitive functioning and information processing speed at baseline and a year later in a sample of MS patients and healthy controls. In contrast, ERPs during auditory tasks were not predictive of cognitive performance. These objective neurophysiological indicators of cognitive functioning and processing speed, and machine learning methods that can interrogate high-dimensional data, show promise in outcome prediction.

J	Lotte, F; Jeunet, C				Lotte, Fabien; Jeunet, Camille			Defining and quantifying users' mental imagery-based BCI skills: a first step	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interfaces; performance metrics; BCI user training; mental imagery; learning; Riemannian geometry; BCI skills	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; MOTOR IMAGERY; EEG; FEEDBACK	Objective. While promising for many applications, electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are still scarcely used outside laboratories, due to a poor reliability. It is thus necessary to study and fix this reliability issue. Doing so requires the use of appropriate reliability metrics to quantify both the classification algorithm and the BCI user's performances. So far, classification accuracy (CA) is the typical metric used for both aspects. However, we argue in this paper that CA is a poor metric to study BCI users' skills. Here, we propose a definition and new metrics to quantify such BCI skills for mental imagery (MI) BCIs, independently of any classification algorithm. Approach. We first show in this paper that CA is notably unspecific, discrete, training data and classifier dependent, and as such may not always reflect successful self-modulation of EEG patterns by the user. We then propose a definition of MI-BCI skills that reflects how well the user can self-modulate EEG patterns, and thus how well he could control an MI-BCI. Finally, we propose new performance metrics, classDis, restDist and classStab that specifically measure how distinct and stable the EEG patterns produced by the user are, independently of any classifier. Main results. By re-analyzing EEG data sets with such new metrics, we indeed confirmed that CA may hide some increase in MI-BCI skills or hide the user inability to self-modulate a given EEG pattern. On the other hand, our new metrics could reveal such skill improvements as well as identify when a mental task performed by a user was no different than rest EEG. Significance. Our results showed that when studying MI-BCI users' skills, CA should be used with care, and complemented with metrics such as the new ones proposed. Our results also stressed the need to redefine BCI user training by considering the different BCI subskills and their measures. To promote the complementary use of our new metrics, we provide the Matlab code to compute them for free and open-source.

J	Xie, ZQ; Schwartz, O; Prasad, A				Xie, Ziqian; Schwartz, Odelia; Prasad, Abhishek			Decoding of finger trajectory from ECoG using deep learning	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						ECoG; deep learning; convolutional neural network; brain machine interface; long short term memory; decoding	COMPUTER-INTERFACE BCI; ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHIC SIGNALS; NEURAL-NETWORK; VARIABLE SELECTION; MOTOR CONTROL; EEG; MOVEMENTS; CLASSIFICATION; DESYNCHRONIZATION; OPTIMIZATION	Objective. Conventional decoding pipeline for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) consists of chained different stages of feature extraction, time-frequency analysis and statistical learning models. Each of these stages uses a different algorithm trained in a sequential manner, which makes it difficult to make the whole system adaptive. The goal was to create an adaptive online system with a single objective function and a single learning algorithm so that the whole system can be trained in parallel to increase the decoding performance. Here, we used deep neural networks consisting of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and a special kind of recurrent neural network (RNN) called long short term memory (LSTM) to address these needs. Approach. We used electrocorticography (ECoG) data collected by Kubanek et al. The task consisted of individual finger flexions upon a visual cue. Our model combined a hierarchical feature extractor CNN and a RNN that was able to process sequential data and recognize temporal dynamics in the neural data. CNN was used as the feature extractor and LSTM was used as the regression algorithm to capture the temporal dynamics of the signal. Main results. We predicted the finger trajectory using ECoG signals and compared results for the least angle regression (LARS), CNN-LSTM, random forest, LSTM model (LSTM_HC, for using hard-coded features) and a decoding pipeline consisting of band-pass filtering, energy extraction, feature selection and linear regression. The results showed that the deep learning models performed better than the commonly used linear model. The deep learning models not only gave smoother and more realistic trajectories but also learned the transition between movement and rest state. Significance. This study demonstrated a decoding network for BMI that involved a convolutional and recurrent neural network model. It integrated the feature extraction pipeline into the convolution and pooling layer and used LSTM layer to capture the state transitions. The discussed network eliminated the need to separately train the model at each step in the decoding pipeline. The whole system can be jointly optimized using stochastic gradient descent and is capable of online learning.

However, human interpretation of brain signals is subjective and prone to misdiagnosis. Automating this process, especially seizure detection relying on scalp-based Electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG, has been the focus of research over recent decades. Nevertheless, its numerous challenges have inhibited a definitive solution. Inspired by recent advances in deep learning, here we describe a new classification approach for EEG time series based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) via the use of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The proposed deep network effectively learns and models discriminative temporal patterns from EEG sequential data. Especially, the features are automatically discovered from the raw EEG data without any pre-processing step, eliminating humans from laborious feature design task. Our light-weight system has a low computational complexity and reduced memory requirement for large training datasets. On a public dataset, a multi-fold cross-validation scheme of the proposed architecture exhibited an average validation accuracy of 95.54% and an average AUC of 0.9582 of the ROC curve among all sets defined in the experiment. This work reinforces the benefits of deep learning to be further attended in clinical applications and neuroscientific research.

However, these EEG patterns cannot be quantitatively identified using commercially available depth of anesthesia (DoA) monitors. This study proposes an effective classification method and indices to classify these patterns among patients. Approach: Four types of emergence EEG patterns were identified based on the EEG data set from 52 patients undergoing sevoflurane general anesthesia from two hospitals. Then, the relative power spectrum density (RPSD) of five frequency sub-bands of clinical interest (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma) were selected for emergence state analysis. Finally, a genetic algorithm support vector machine (GA-SVM) was used to identify the emergence EEG patterns. The performance was reported in terms of sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP) and accuracy (AC). Main results: The combination of the mean and mode of RPSD in the delta and alpha band (P (delta)/P (alpha) performed the best in the GA-SVM classification. The AC indices obtained by GA-SVM across the four patterns were 90.64 +/- 7.61, 81.79 +/- 5.84, 82.14 +/- 7.99 and 72.86 +/- 11.11 respectively. Furthermore, the emergence time of the patients with EEG emergence patterns I and III increased as the patients' age increased. However, for patients with EEG emergence pattern IV, the emergence time positively correlates with the patients' age when they are under 50, and negatively correlates with it when they are over 50. Significance: The mean and mode of P (delta)/P (alpha) is a useful index to classify the different emergence EEG patterns. In addition, these patterns may correlate with an underlying neural substrate which is related to the patients' age.

One early application of such systems is the attention-based spellers utilizing the P300 visually evoked potential in a framework known as the oddball paradigm. In this paper, we propose novel variants of machine learning model ensembles in addressing the task of P300 detection and attended target recognition in attention-based speller systems. Proposed ensembles adopted Bootstrap aggregation (Bagging) of calibrated Support Vector Machines (SVM) as well as data-driven learners. The latter is dominantly represented by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with several variants, including what is referred to as Inception, Xception, and Interleaved Group Convolutions (IGC) modules. The proposed models are evaluated on a publicly available EEG dataset developed specifically for BCI applications and published in public contests, namely the 2rd dataset of the 3rd BCI competitions. The proposed models consistently outperform all previous works on the same dataset and show the highest 5- and 15-trial recognition rates of 76.5% and 98.5%, respectively, for both subjects in the dataset jointly. Additionally, we introduce in this work the first study on inter-subject evaluation under similar training protocols, reaching between 30 %-40 % recognition rates for either subject. We further investigate the effect of reducing the training data on the performance of the proposed models showing possibilities of reduced training time for a target recognition rate.

We investigate the feasibility of decoding walking from brain activity in stroke survivors during therapy using a powered exoskeleton integrated with an electroencephalography-based brain-machine interface. Design The H2 powered exoskeleton was designed for overground gait training with actuated hip, knee, and ankle joints. It was integrated with active-electrode electroencephalography and evaluated in hemiparetic stroke survivors for 12 sessions per 4 wks. A continuous-time Kalman decoder operating on delta-band electroencephalography was designed to estimate gait kinematics. Results Five chronic stroke patients completed the study with improvements in walking distance and speed training for 4 wks, correlating with increased offline decoding accuracy. Accuracies of predicted joint angles improved with session and gait speed, suggesting an improved neural representation for gait, and the feasibility to design an electroencephalography-based brain-machine interface to monitor brain activity or control a rehabilitative exoskeleton. Conclusions The Kalman decoder showed increased accuracies as the longitudinal training intervention progressed in the stroke participants. These results demonstrate the feasibility of studying changes in patterns of neuroelectric cortical activity during poststroke rehabilitation and represent the first step in developing a brain-machine interface for controlling powered exoskeletons.

For each subject, 5 sessions of signals from three electrodes (C3, Cz, and C4) were recorded with sampling rate 250112. The training data, which consisted of the first 3 sessions, included 400 trials. The evaluation data, which consisted of the last 2 sessions, included 320 trials. Each trial started with gazing at fix cross on screen for 3 seconds followed by a one-second visual cue pointing either to the left or right to instruct the subject for left or right motor imagery over a period of 4 seconds, and then followed by a short break of at least 1.5 seconds. Features were extracted from the 0.5 to 2.5 second signals after the cue for each trial from C3 and C4. Each EEG trial was band pass filtered into different frequency bands, namely, delta (0 5-3Hz), theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-12Hz), beta hands (13-30Hz), gamma bands (31-60Hz). Those filtered signals were then used as the input data for training the linear SVM In addition, we generated a 2 by 500 matrix by down sampling the training data from each trial There are 5760 such matrices in total generated from all subjects and serve as the input data for training CNN and the trained model was evaluated by another 340 matrices from each subject. Our CNN architecture consisted of 2 convolution layer and 2 fully connect layers, and there was a batch normalization layer before the activated layer and a dropout layer with a probability of 50% after the activated layer. The classification accuracies evaluated by averaged kappa values obtained from linear SUM and CNN are 0.5 and 0.621, respectively, suggesting the deep learning CNN method is superior to the classical linear SVM on the EEG classification.

J	Goksu, H				Goksu, Huseyin			EEG based epileptiform pattern recognition inside and outside the seizure states	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Automatic diagnosis; Epilepsy; EEG; Wavelet packet decomposition; Entropy; MLP	WAVELET PACKET TRANSFORM; LINEAR DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; SIGNALS; PERCEPTRON	Automatic diagnosis of epilepsy by computers based on Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is a beneficial practice which increases recognition rate, speeds up diagnosis and saves physicians from long hours of EEG inspection. Most studies on this subject report results on detecting seizures; but seizures, which appear during the ictal states are very rare to catch. Therefore, an efficient algorithm must be able to detect epilepsy during nonseizure periods, or in other words interictal states as well. We present a novel algorithm to detect epileptiform patterns during both states: ictal and interictal. For this purpose, we use wavelet packet analysis (WPA) rather than traditional time and frequency domain methods. WPA, by providing arbitrary time-frequency resolution, enables analyzing signals of stationary and non-stationary nature. It has better time representation than Fourier analysis and better high frequency resolution than Wavelet analysis. WPA subimages are analyzed further to obtain feature vectors of Log Energy Entropy, Norm Entropy and Energy. These features are fed into a classifier, multilayer perceptron (MLP). We test our method on a well-known and widely studied database which includes healthy, ictal and interictal EEG recordings. Normal vs. Ictal and Interictal vs. Ictal zone classifications are realized at 100% accuracy by using any of the three features. Nonseizure vs. Seizure state classification is realized with 100% accuracy using Norm entropy. Normal vs. Interictal zone classification is achieved with 100% accuracy using Log Energy Entropy. Normal vs. Interictal vs. lctal Zone classifications are considered as two-step binary classifications of Nonseizure vs. Seizure state followed by Normal vs. Interictal zone both of which are realized at 100% accuracy. Therefore, jointly use of Log Energy Entropy and Norm entropy is able to realize all possible classifications with 100% accuracy. We make the most comprehensive comparison of results belonging to all possible classification categories reported on the same datasets. The proposed method outperforms all the other results in all possible classifications by achieving 100% accuracy in all possible classifications. The method presented is the only single method that achieves this. Overall, the method provides us with a promising tool for the detection of epileptiform patterns during and outside the seizure states. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We demonstrate the results in a pilot study, which highlights the benefits of the personalized, adaptive reaction time estimation in collision warning alert performance. A 40-50% improvement in alert precision is observed with the adaptive approach. We conclude with improvements to further strengthen the quality of the reaction time estimation and improve alert performance.

Therefore, robust and reliable classification techniques should be developed and evaluated to recognize the user's mental task with high accuracy. This paper proposes the use of the novel dendrite morphological neural networks (DMNN) for the recognition of voluntary movements from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. This technique was evaluated with two studies. The first aimed to evaluate the performance of DMNN in the recognition of motor execution and motor imagery tasks and to carry out a systematic comparison with support vector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) which are the two classifiers mostly used in BCI systems. EEG signals from twelve healthy students were recorded during a cue-based hand motor execution and imagery experiment. The results showed that DMNN provided decoding accuracies of 80% for motor execution and 77% for motor imagery, which were significantly different than the chance level (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and higher when compared with classifiers commonly used in BCI. The second study aimed to employ the DMNN to recognize the intention of movement. To this end, EEG signals were recorded from eighteen healthy subjects performing self-paced reaching movements and several classification scenarios were evaluated. The results showed that DMNN provided decoding accuracies above chance level, whereby, it is able to detect a movement prior its execution. On the basis of these results, DMNN is a powerful promising classification technique that can be used to enhance performance in the recognition of motor tasks for BCI systems based on electroencephalographic signals.

Furthermore, high dimensional EEG montages introduce huge computational burden due to excessive number of channels involved. Two experimental, i.e., inter-session and inter-subject, variabilities of EEG dynamics during motor imagery (MI) tasks are investigated in this paper. In particular, the effect on the performance of the BCIs due to day-to-day variability in EEG dynamics during the alterations in cognitive stages is explored. In addition, the inter-subject BCIs feasibility between cortically synchronized and desynchronized subject pairs on pairwise performance associativity is further examined. Moreover, the consequences of integrating spatial brain dynamics of varying the number of channels - from specific regions of the brain - are also discussed in case of both the contexts. The proposed approach is validated on real BCI data set containing EEG data from four classes of MI tasks, i.e., left/right hand, both feet, and tongue, subjected prior to a preprocessing of three different spatial filtering techniques. Experimental results have shown that a maximum classification accuracy a generic and efficient framework for plug and play use.

However, the game with high level of challenges will induce more frustration and tiredness causing players to take more short breaks than usual. While mental fatigue has been studied widely, there are not many game studies and applications related to mental fatigue. One of the possible applications that we want to explore is artificial insertion of an interval serving as a break for players before they get fatigue and take a break from playing games. We plan to use Electroencephalogram (EEG) for fatigue monitoring and machine learning approaches to help predict the right time for intervention. Currently, we have created a prototype game to be used in the experiment and collect sample data for the machine learning.

However, it can be easily contaminated by various artifacts and noise, e.g., eye blink, muscle activities, powerline noise, etc. Therefore, the EEC signals are often filtered both spatially and temporally to increase the signal-to-noise ratio before they are fed into a machine learning algorithm for recognition. This paper considers spatial filtering, particularly, the common spatial pattern (CSP) filters for EEC classification. In binary classification, CSP seeks a set of filters to maximize the variance for one class while minimizing it for the other. We first introduce the traditional solution, and then a new solution based on a slightly different objective function. We performed comprehensive experiments on motor imagery to compare the two approaches, and found that generally the traditional CSP solution still gives better results. We also showed that adding regularization to the covariance matrices can improve the final classification performance, no matter which objective function is used.

For this purpose, an adaptive spatial filter based on similarity indices is proposed to preserve the useful information on electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Additionally, a method for feature selection based on the Maximal Information Compression Index (MICI), and the representation entropy (RE) is used, increasing its robustness for uncertain patterns, such as gait planning. Good values of accuracy (ACC >= 75%) and false positive rate (FPR <= 10%) were obtained for four subjects. Thus, this BCI based on unsupervised method may be suitable to recognize uncertainty pattern, such as gait planning.

Time-generalized multivariate analysis of EEG responses reveals a cascading architecture of semantic mismatch processing	BRAIN AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						EEG; ERP; Semantic mismatch; N400; P600; Multivariate pattern analysis; Generalization across time decoding	LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION EVIDENCE; ANTERIOR NEGATIVITY LAN; MORPHOSYNTACTIC AGREEMENT; NEUROCOMPUTATIONAL MODEL; EYE-MOVEMENTS; BRAIN; P600; N400; ERP; SENTENCE	Event-related brain potentials have a strong impact on neurocognitive models, as they inform about the temporal sequence of cognitive processes. Nevertheless, their value for deciding among alternative cognitive architectures is partly limited by component overlap and the possibility of ambiguity regarding component identity. Here, we apply temporally-generalized multivariate pattern analysis - a recently-proposed machine learning method capable of tracking the evolution of neurocognitive processes over time - to constrain possible alternative architectures underlying the processing of semantic incongruency in sentences. In a spoken sentence paradigm, we replicate established N400/P600 correlates of semantic mismatch. Time-generalized decoding indicates that early vs. late mismatch-sensitive processes are (i) distinct in their neural substrate, arguing against recurrent or latency-shifted single process architectures, and (ii) partially overlapping in time, inconsistent with predictions of strictly serial models.

CLASSIFICATION OF VERBAL AND MATHEMATICAL MENTAL OPERATIONS BASED ON THE POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY OF EEG	PSYCHOLOGY-JOURNAL OF THE HIGHER SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS			English	Article						EEG; power spectral density; mental operations; artificial neural network; classification accuracy	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE	A classification of spectral patterns of EEG underlies several cognitive neurotechnologies including passive and active brain-computer interfaces. Despite arithmetic tasks often being used in studies of cognitive workload, there is a lack of findings describing a possibility to recognize EEG patterns related to different types of math operations. In the present work, we have shown that the power spectral density of EEG can be used to classify types of mental operations including a classification of verbal and different mathematical tasks for simple arithmetic operations or logical tasks with arithmetic progressions. The verbal tasks were separated from arithmetic ones significantly better than arithmetic from logical tasks, and verbal from logical tasks. Better discrimination of verbal tasks from arithmetic but not from logical tasks supports the hypothesis of unique EEG patterns associated with verbal activity that apparently differ from mental operations in arithmetic. Additionally, we compared the behavioral performance in problem solving and accuracy of EEG classification in two groups of subjects with education in math or humanities (N = 8 + 8). We obtained the predicted differences related to better performance of the math group in solving math tasks than the humanitarian group. However, the classification accuracy of tasks based on EEG did not differ significantly between groups and was essentially higher than random. Considered together, our results support the hypothesis that EEG patterns reflect individual cognitive states corresponding to mental operations and can be used in classification of different cognitive activity.

EEG is one of the non-invasive methods for monitoring and diagnosing epileptic behavior. Classification of epileptic electroencephalograms signal has important medical diagnostic significance. In this study, we first extract the training sample set from the EEG signals in order to train extreme learning machine (ELM). Then the trained ELM classifies the unknown EEG signals. Since single classifier has instability of performance, we propose an ensemble ELM learning algorithm based on cellular automata. Cellular automates offers a powerful modeling framework in describing and studying these physical systems. These physical systems consist of interacting components. This method is discribed as the application of various fields of physics. Training subsets are constructed by cellular automata. These training subsets can be trained parallel with multiple classifiers. Finally, the experimental results indicate the proposed ELM classifier (E-ELM-C) owns remark advantage and has better than BP and SVM for carrying out EEG signals dataset in the sense of the average training/testing accuracy and training/testing time. Our experimental results also show the proposed classifier E-ELM-C has sound generalization performance.

Limited value of temporo-parietal hemodynamic signals in an optical-electric auditory brain-computer interface	BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS			English	Article						brain-computer interface; locked in syndrome; electroencephalography; near-infrared spectroscopy; hybrid BCI; auditoryBCI	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; NIRS; ATTENTION; P300; FMRI; CLASSIFICATION; ACTIVATION; SYSTEM	Objective. Auditory brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have gained attention recently due to their potential applicability to severely disabled individuals without functional vision. However, auditory BCIs currently achieve lower accuracies than their visual counterparts, and most have exploited only one type of brain measurement. Recent evidence suggests that the combination of electrical and optical measurements can enhance classification accuracies in motor imagery-based BCIs. The potential of this bimodal combination for auditory BCIs remains unexplored. Approach. We investigated the complementarity of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) in discriminating between attentive and non-attentive behaviours to auditory stimuli. Simultaneous NIRS and EEG signals were recorded from 11 typically developed participants while performing an auditory oddball streaming task. Main Results. Considering neural responses to oddballs during the entire span of a trial, average classification accuracies of 77.43+/-9.6% and 80.7+/-9.5% were achieved using combined EEG and NIRS signal and the EEG-only signal respectively. The combined EEG-NIRS classification accuracy was significantly lower than the EEG-only accuracy in five participants. However, when considering EEG responses to the first oddball within each trial, we found that the inclusion of NIRS activities from the complete task period significantly improved classification accuracies for 2 participants. Significance. Our findings suggest that the consolidation of EEG (midline) and NIRS (temporo-parietal) signals offers limited value beyond an EEG-exclusive approach when decoding prolonged auditory attention-demanding tasks. Future efforts should focus on identifying the optimal time window for the analysis of EEG and NIRS signals to delineate conditions under which the BCI may afford a practical advantage over the EEG-exclusive approach.

Due to rising interest in nicotinic agonists, we aimed to establish a method to monitor neurophysiological effects of modulating the nicotinic cholinergic system. Methods: In a four-way cross-over study, eyes-closed rest EEG was recorded in 28 healthy subjects receiving mecamylamine-a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist, which induces temporary cognitive dysfunction in healthy subjects-with co-administration of placebo, nicotine or galantamine. Results: Using machine learning to optimally contrast the effects of 30 mg of mecamylamine and placebo on the brain, we developed a nAChR index that consists of 10 EEG biomarkers and shows high classification accuracy (-95% non-cross-validated, similar to 70% cross-validated). Importantly, using the nAChR index, we demonstrate reversal of mecamylamine-induced neurophysiological effects due to 16 mg of galantamine as well as administering 21 mg of nicotine transdermally. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the mecamylamine challenge model jointly with the nAChR index-a measure of the nicotinic EEG profile-could aid future proof-of-pharmacology studies to demonstrate effects of nicotinic cholinergic compounds. Significance: This novel measure for quantifying nicotinic cholinergic effects on the EEG could serve as a useful tool in drug development of pro-cognitive compounds.

The Cybathlon BCI race: Successful longitudinal mutual learning with two tetraplegic users	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MOTOR IMAGERY; COMMUNICATION; PEOPLE; ADAPTATION; PATIENT; COMPONENTS; OPERATE; GRASP; ALS	This work aims at corroborating the importance and efficacy of mutual learning in motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interface (BCI) by leveraging the insights obtained through our participation in the BCI race of the Cybathlon event. We hypothesized that, contrary to the popular trend of focusing mostly on the machine learning aspects of MI BCI training, a comprehensive mutual learning methodology that reinstates the three learning pillars (at the machine, subject, and application level) as equally significant could lead to a BCI-user symbiotic system able to succeed in real-world scenarios such as the Cybathlon event. Two severely impaired participants with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), were trained following our mutual learning approach to control their avatar in a virtual BCI race game. The competition outcomes substantiate the effectiveness of this type of training. Most importantly, the present study is one among very few to provide multifaceted evidence on the efficacy of subject learning during BCI training. Learning correlates could be derived at all levels of the interfaceapplication, BCI output, and electroencephalography (EEG) neuroimagingwith two end-users, sufficiently longitudinal evaluation, and, importantly, under real-world and even adverse conditions.

Minimizing the number of electroencephalography (EEG) channels is a key technological advantage for the application of BCI, which would make the system more mobile, easier to setup and long-time use in the real life. In this paper, to decrease the number of channels, multi-channel common spatial pattern (MCSP) algorithm is used to extract the features with two mental tasks (i.e., mental arithmetic and spatial imagery), and support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify the tasks performed. In detail, the separability value of each individual channel is computed based on between/within-group variance and a modified entropy criterion to evaluate its contribution to classification performance. The optimal channels are chosen based on the separability ranking. The performance of proposed methods is compared with recursive channel elimination and genetic algorithm. The results demonstrate that the EEG signals have different trends between the two mental tasks with highest brain activity in left central-parietal and parietal lobes, and the separability values allow reduction of number of electrodes from 15 to 4 and 10 while the classification accuracy reaches 80% and 90% respectively. Therefore, the optimal-channel algorithms can reduce the number of channels and improve the performance of the mental tasks based BCI.

Research on arousal and valence analysis, which uses images, texts, and physiological signals that employ deep learning, is actively underway; research investigating how to improve the recognition rate is needed. The goal of this research was to design a deep learning framework and model to classify arousal and valence, indicating positive and negative degrees of emotion as high or low. Methods: The proposed arousal and valence classification model to analyze the affective state was tested using data from 40 channels provided by a dataset for emotion analysis using electrocardiography (EEG), physiological, and video signals (the DEAP dataset). Experiments were based on 10 selected featured central and peripheral nervous system data points, using long short-term memory (LSTM) as a deep learning method. Results: The arousal and valence were classified and visualized on a two-dimensional coordinate plane. Profiles were designed depending on the number of hidden layers, nodes, and hyperparameters according to the error rate. The experimental results show an arousal and valence classification model accuracy of 74.65 and 78%, respectively. The proposed model performed better than previous other models. Conclusions: The proposed model appears to be effective in analyzing arousal and valence; specifically, it is expected that affective analysis using physiological signals based on ISTM will be possible without manual feature extraction. In a future study, the classification model will be adopted in mental healthcare management systems.

J	Kumar, S; Sharma, A				Kumar, Shiu; Sharma, Alok			A new parameter tuning approach for enhanced motor imagery EEG signal classification	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); Filter tuning; Genetic algorithm (GA); Motor imagery (MI); Temporal filters	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERN; FEATURE-SELECTION ALGORITHM; FILTER; DECOMPOSITION; OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE; EXTRACTION; FRAMEWORK; FEATURES	A brain-computer interface (BCI) system allows direct communication between the brain and the external world. Common spatial pattern (CSP) has been used effectively for feature extraction of data used in BCI systems. However, many studies show that the performance of a BCI system using CSP largely depends on the filter parameters. The filter parameters that yield most discriminating information vary from subject to subject and manually tuning of the filter parameters is a difficult and time-consuming exercise. In this paper, we propose a new automated filter tuning approach for motor imagery electroencephalography (EEG) signal classification, which automatically and flexibly finds the filter parameters for optimal performance. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed method on two public benchmark datasets. Compared to the existing conventional CSP approach, our method reduces the average classification error rate by 2.89% and 3.61% for BCI Competition III dataset IVa and BCI Competition IV dataset I, respectively. Moreover, our proposed approach also achieved lowest average classification error rate compared to state-of-the-art methods studied in this paper. Thus, our proposed method can be potentially used for developing improved BCI systems, which can assist people with disabilities to recover their environmental control. It can also be used for enhanced disease recognition such as epileptic seizure detection using EEG signals.

Methods: Multichannel EEG was recorded in the relaxed eyes opened and eyes closed states in 10 able bodied participants and 31 subacute SCI participants (11 with CNP, 10 without NP and 10 who later developed pain within 6 months of the EEG recording). Up to nine EEG band power features were classified using linear and non-linear classifiers. Results: Three classifiers (artificial neural networks ANN, support vector machine SVM and linear discriminant analysis LDA) achieved similar average performances, higher than 85% on a full set of features identifying patients at risk of developing pain and achieved comparably high performance classifying between other groups. With only 10 channels, LDA and ANN achieved 86% and 83% accuracy respectively, identifying patients at risk of developing CNP. Conclusion: Transferable learning classifier can detect patients at risk of developing CNP. EEG markers of pain appear before its physical symptoms. Simple and complex classifiers have comparable performance. Significance: Identify patients to receive prophylaxic treatment of CNP. (C) 2018 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Methods: Among 248 patients with TLE who underwent scalp video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, 24 patients with 'switch of lateralization' or 'bilateral asynchrony' in at least one of their seizures (93%) were analyzed retrospectively. The postoperative outcome was determined in 16 patients who had undergone epilepsy surgery. Results: All but 5 of the included patients had hippocampal sclerosis (HS) as their magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Twelve out of 16 patients (75%) who had surgery were seizure-free for at least 1 year. Nine out of 12 patients (75%) with good outcome had unilateral interictal EEG discharges in temporal regions whereas 3 out of 4 patients with poor outcome had bilateral temporal interictal spiking (p = 0.018). Conclusion: Unusual ictal propagation patterns are not always related to poor prognosis after surgery in patients with TLE. Patients with unilateral interictal spiking in the temporal region tend to have good outcome despite these unusual patterns. These patterns can also be seen in patients with TLE with other etiologies besides the well-known HS in MRI. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

BCI applications based on Electroencephalography commonly rely on Motor Imagery paradigm. However, the estimation of motor brain patterns is affected by both variations in the signal properties over time (i.e. non-stationarity) and differences between frequency bands activations. Generally, Common Spatial Patterns is used as feature extraction. Nevertheless, its performance depends on the filter band selection and the time when the brain activity is associated with the task. A new method of time-frequency segmentation based on multi-instance learning is proposed. The spatial filters are built taking to account the obtained frequency-temporal segments where an instance selection based on Sparse Representation Classification method is developed together with a feature selection stage. The experiments are developed using a well-known dataset BCI competition IV dataset IIa that contains EEG records of nine subjects recorded from 22-electrodes mesh. The results evidencing that significant features appear at the end of MI interval and the found spatial patterns are consistent with MI neurophysiology. Furthermore, the proposed method outperforms the average classification accuracy of both CSP and SFTOFCRC for 8.21% and 1.23% respectively without deteriorating classification accuracy with statistical significance for subjects that present high accuracy with the compared methods.

The revised Cerebral Recovery Index improves predictions of neurological outcome after cardiac arrest	CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Quantitative EEG; Cardiac arrest; Post anoxic Coma; Machine learning; Medical informatics	BISPECTRAL INDEX; THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA; COMATOSE SURVIVORS; SUPPRESSION RATIO; ENTROPY MEASURES; EEG; PROGNOSTICATION; RESUSCITATION; BRAIN; PATTERNS	Objective: Analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) background pattern helps predicting neurological outcome of comatose patients after cardiac arrest (CA). Visual analysis may not extract all discriminative information. We present predictive values of the revised Cerebral Recovery Index (rCRI), based on continuous extraction and combination of a large set of evolving quantitative EEG (qEEG) features and machine learning techniques. Methods: We included 551 subsequent patients from a prospective cohort study on continuous EEG after CA in two hospitals. Outcome at six months was classified as good (Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1-2) or poor (CPC 3-5). Forty-four qEEG features (from time, frequency and entropy domain) were selected by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method and used in a Random Forests classification system. We trained and evaluated the system with 10-fold cross validation. For poor outcome prediction, the sensitivity at 100% specificity (Se-100) and the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) were used as performance of the prediction model. For good outcome, we used the sensitivity at 95% specificity (Se-95). Results: Two hundred fifty-six (47%) patients had a good outcome. The rCRI predicted poor outcome with AUC = 0.94 (95% CI: 0.83-0.91), Se-100 = 0.66 (0.65-0.78), and AUC = 0.88 (0.78-0.93), Se-100 = 0.60 (0.510.75) at 12 and 24 h after CA, respectively. The rCRI predicted good outcome with Se-95 = 0.72 (0.61-0.85) and 0.40 (0.30-0.51) at 12 and 24 h after CA, respectively. Conclusions: Results obtained in this study suggest that with machine learning algorithms and large set of qEEG features, it is possible to efficiently monitor patient outcome after CA. We also demonstrate the importance of selection of optimal performance metric to train a classifier model for outcome prediction. Significance: The rCRI is a sensitive, reliable predictor of neurological outcome of comatose patients after CA. (C) 2018 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Automated fatigue detection using Electroencephalogram (EEG) due to helping us decline the occurrence probability of related accidents has gained more and more attention in recent years. Hence, designing a suitable feature extraction approach and choosing an efficient classification methodology are considered as the key to successful implementation. We first propose a new minimum spanning tree (MST) feature extraction approach on the basis of the phase coherence (PC) and a power spectrum density (PSD) method, respectively. Then to further improve the detection performance, we perform feature fusion (FBN-PSD-FF), where the functional brain network (FBN)-based feature characterizing the relationship between brain network organization and fatigue and PSD-based feature characterizing the relationship between power variation and fatigue. Furthermore, an automated fatigue detection system has been developed, which is integrated between the novel fusion feature (FBN-PSD-FF) and extreme learning machine (ELM). Finally, a driving simulation experiment is designed and conducted to demonstrate the proposed detection system, and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) are employed to validate the results. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method gives a sensitivity of 95.71%, a specificity of 94.29%, an accuracy of 95.00%, and a highest value of area under the receiver operating curve (AUC-ROC = 0.98). The ELM is employed for fatigue detection, reducing the time consuming greatly. Our proposed system can be a viable solution for detecting operators' fatigue and has great potential to reduce fatigue-related crashes in many circumstances such as navigation, driving, aviation, construction industry, etc. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Results from several decades of studying this phenomenon have culminated in recent years in various promising attempts to decode the attentional state of a listener in a competing speaker environment from non-invasive neuroimaging recordings such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). To this end, most existing approaches compute correlation-based measures by either regressing the features of each speech stream to the M/EEG channels (the decoding approach) or vice versa (the encoding approach). To produce robust results, these procedures require multiple trials for training purposes. Also, their decoding accuracy drops significantly when operating at high temporal resolutions. Thus, they are not well-suited for emerging real-time applications such as smart hearing aid devices or brain-computer interface systems, where training data might be limited and high temporal resolutions are desired. In this paper, we close this gap by developing an algorithmic pipeline for real-time decoding of the attentional state. Our proposed framework consists of three main modules: (1) Real-time and robust estimation of encoding or decoding coefficients, achieved by sparse adaptive filtering, (2) Extracting reliable markers of the attentional state, and thereby generalizing the widely-used correlation-based measures thereof, and (3) Devising a near real-time state-space estimator that translates the noisy and variable attention markers to robust and statistically interpretable estimates of the attentional state with minimal delay. Our proposed algorithms integrate various techniques including forgetting factor-based adaptive filtering, l(1)-regularization, forward-backward splitting algorithms, fixed-lag smoothing, and Expectation Maximization. We validate the performance of our proposed framework using comprehensive simulations as well as application to experimentally acquired M/EEG data. Our results reveal that the proposed real-time algorithms perform nearly as accurately as the existing state-of-the-art offline techniques, while providing a significant degree of adaptivity, statistical robustness, and computational savings.

Recent technological progress has allowed the development of new generations of brain imaging systems such as dry electrodes electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate cortical activity in a variety of human tasks out of the laboratory. These highly portable brain imaging devices offer interesting prospects to implement passive brain computer interfaces (pBCI) and neuroadaptive technology. We developed a INIRS-EEG based pBCI to monitor cognitive fatigue using engagement related features (EEG engagement ratio and wavelet coherence fNIRS based metrics). This mental state is known to impair cognitive performance and can jeopardize flight safety. In this preliminary study. four participants were asked to perform four identical traffic patterns along with a secondary auditory task in a flight simulator and in an actual light aircraft. The two first traffic patterns were considered as the low cognitive fatigue class, whereas the two last traffic patterns were considered as the high cognitive fatigue class. As expected, the pilots missed more auditory targets in the second part than in the first part of the experiment. Classification accuracy reached 87.2% in the flight simulator condition and 87.6% in the actual flight conditions when combining the two modalities. This study demonstrates that fNIRS and EEG-based pBCIs can monitor mental states in operational and noisy environments.

Bioelectrical such as Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) for biometric applications. These signals are produced by biological beings and can be detected by measuring voltage, current and resistance. The present work emphasizes on EEG eye state classification. Classification is a one of the Data Mining task, for which channel selection (preprocessing step) is required. Large number of channels present in bioelectric signals is increasing the cost of classification. Accordingly, Rough Set Theory and Association Rule Mining are used in this research work for channel ranking and channel selection for better classification. Rough Set Mathematics, which is considered to be one of the powerful theories for feature selection and used to select optimal features on small data set but not preferable for large instance data base. To overcome data size limitation, data segmentation is applied. After data segmentation real valued data is converted in to discrete value for optimal feature selection using discretization. Discretization process is essential for Rough Set Theory (RST) on segmented data which is achieved using Minimum Description Length Principle (MDLP). MDLP is a local discretization method; this will make impact upon the classification accuracy. Discretization is a concept abstraction and generalization process. This process will make data easier to interpret. Later on, Rough Set theory and Association Rule Mining are applied to find out the relevant channels. Association Rule mining generates frequent patterns which is used for deciding ranks of channels. If frequencies of channels are same then information gain is used here to decide the rank of channels. Thus, our research work proposes the novel method that combines Rough Set Theory, Association Rule Mining and Information Gain for channel as feature ranking that is essential for classification problems. Proposed work is implemented on Electroencephalograph (EEG) eye state data base, the performance of proposed work is compared with many conventional feature ranking algorithms and found that this model is working better than conventional methods. Instance Based (K star) classifier is used here because it already found in literatures that is most fitted classifier algorithm for Eye state data base. The accuracy of classifier is found using proposed is 95.689 which are higher than popular conventional methods.	[Sahu, Mridu; Nagwani, N.

This paper focuses on detecting those words which are unfamiliar to the users while reading using Electroencephalography (EEG). In particular, a word-familiarity prediction approach based on EEG signals from the user's brain waves has been developed. Word-familiarity refers whether a user is familiar with the word or not while reading the text. The recorded signals have been processed using Wavelet decomposition technique and four features, namely mean, standard deviation, Root Mean Square (RMS) and power have been computed from beta and gamma frequency bands. The prediction of word-familiarity has been performed using Random Forest (RF) classifier. Next, a decision fusion approach has also been used to boost the prediction performance. A dictionary based pop-up window has been developed to provide the meaning of the word when a user is found to be unfamiliar with the text. EEG dataset of 12 users has been developed while they are reading 25 words. The results show that the characteristics of brain waves at the time of unknown word perception can be detected, i.e., when the user comes across an unknown word then the pattern of his brain waves comes out to be totally different from the pattern when he is familiar with the word. Similarly, the pattern of brain waves has been found to be different for the word for which the user has confusion in his mind. An accuracy of 82% has been recorded using the proposed classifier combination approach. Finally, a comparative study with other popular classification technique is also discussed.

However, a reliable characterization of sleep patterns in this clinical population continues to be challenging given severely altered brain oscillations, frequent and extended artifacts in clinical recordings and the absence of established staging criteria. In the present study, we try to address these issues and investigate the usefulness of a multivariate machine learning technique based on permutation entropy, a complexity measure. Specifically, we used long-term polysomnography (PSG), along with video recordings in day and night periods in a sample of 23 DOC; 12 patients were diagnosed as Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS) and 11 were diagnosed as Minimally Conscious State (MCS). Eight hour PSG recordings of healthy sleepers (N = 26) were additionally used for training and setting parameters of supervised and unsupervised model, respectively. In DOC, the supervised classification (wake, N1, N2, N3 or REM) was validated using simultaneous videos which identified periods with prolonged eye opening or eye closure. The supervised classification revealed that out of the 23 subjects, 11 patients (5 MCS and 6 UWS) yielded highly accurate classification with an average F1-score of 0.87 representing high overlap between the classifier predicting sleep (i.e. one of the 4 sleep stages) and closed eyes. Furthermore, the unsupervised approach revealed a more complex pattern of sleep-wake stages during the night period in the MCS group, as evidenced by the presence of several distinct clusters. In contrast, in UWS patients no such clustering was found. Altogether, we present a novel data-driven method, based on machine learning that can be used to gain new and unambiguous insights into sleep organization and residual brain functioning of patients with DOC.

To capture chaotic nature and abrupt changes, considering the nonlinear as well as nonstationary behaviour of EEG, a novel nonlinear approach of MultiFractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) has been proposed in this paper to address the multifractal behaviour of healthy (Group B), interictal (Group D) and ictal (Group E) patterns. Following wavelet based decomposition of EEG into its frequency subbands, multifracatal formalism has been applied to extract four features, namely, spectrum width (Da), spectrum peak (ozo), spectrum skewness (B) and Hurst's exponent (H). The effectiveness of the parameters has been also tested through statistical significance across the subbands. It has been found that no parameters in alpha subband exhibit significant differences across all the Groups, whereas, all the parameters for band-limited EEG significantly distinguish the Groups. However, at least one Group was found to be significantly isolated from the parameters across all the subbands. Furthermore, support vector machine (SVM) has been trained to classify the Groups with the multifractal features for different EEG subbands. An accuracy of 99.6% has been observed for the band limited EEG. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper presents a classification system based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the extreme learning machine (ELM) for epileptic seizure detection by distinguishing ictal and interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The original EEG signal is first decomposed by Daubechies order 4 wavelet into several cub bands. Then, standard deviation, log of amplitude, and quartiles are calculated for the original and decomposed signals to construct feature vectors. Different combination of these features are fed into ELM and support vector machine (SVM). After comparing different combination strategies. we find that. using ELM, even with a single feature (standard deviation) from a single sub band signal (4-8Hz), one can obtain a satisfactory classification result which remarkably reduce the computational complexity and make the detection system more practical.

An accurate and early diagnosis for depression could become challenging. This paper proposed a machine learning framework involving EEG-derived synchronization likelihood (SL) features as input data for automatic diagnosis of MDD. It was hypothesized that EEG-based SL features could discriminate MDD patients and healthy controls with an acceptable accuracy better than measures such as interhemispheric coherence and mutual information. In this work, classification models such as support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR) and Na < ve Bayesian (NB) were employed to model relationship between the EEG features and the study groups (MDD patient and healthy controls) and ultimately achieved discrimination of study participants. The results indicated that the classification rates were better than chance. More specifically, the study resulted into SVM classification accuracy = 98%, sensitivity = 99.9%, specificity = 95% and f-measure = 0.97; LR classification accuracy = 91.7%, sensitivity = 86.66%, specificity = 96.6% and f-measure = 0.90; NB classification accuracy = 93.6%, sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 87.9% and f-measure = 0.95. In conclusion, SL could be a promising method for diagnosing depression. The findings could be generalized to develop a robust CAD-based tool that may help for clinical purposes.

In this regard, an electroencephalogram (EEG) has been widely applied to assess individuals' stress by analyzing brain waves in the clinical domains. With recent advancements in wearable EEG devices, EEG's ability can be extended to field workers, particularly by non-invasively assessing construction workers' stress. This study proposes a procedure to automatically recognize workers' stress in construction sites using EEG signals. Specifically, the authors collected construction field workers' EEG signals and preprocessed them to capture high-quality signals. Workers' salivary cortisol, a stress hormone, was also collected to label low or high-stress levels when they work at sites. Time and frequency domain features from EEG signals were calculated using fixed and sliding windowing approaches. Finally, the authors applied several supervised learning algorithms to recognize workers' stress while they are working at sites. The results showed that the fixed windowing approach and the Gaussian Support Vector Machine (SVM) yielded the highest classification accuracy of 80.32%, which is very promising given the similar accuracy of stress recognition in clinical domains where extricate and wired EEG devices were used and the subjects engage in minimal body movement. The results demonstrate that the proposed field stress recognition procedure can be used for the early detection of workers' stress, which can contribute to improving workers' safety, health, wellbeing, and productivity.

Brain-computer interface (BCI) algorithm development has long been hampered by two major issues: small sample sets and a lack of reproducibility. We offer a solution to both of these problems via a software suite that streamlines both the issues of finding and preprocessing data in a reliable manner, as well as that of using a consistent interface for machine learning methods. Approach. By building on recent advances in software for signal analysis implemented in the MNE toolkit, and the unified framework for machine learning offered by the scikit-learn project, we offer a system that can improve BCI algorithm development. This system is fully open-source under the BSD licence and available at https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb. Main results. We analyze a set of state-of-the-art decoding algorithms across 12 open access datasets, including over 250 subjects. Our results show that even for the best methods, there are datasets which do not show significant improvements, and further that many previously validated methods do not generalize well outside the datasets they were tested on. Significance. Our analysis confirms that BCI algorithms validated on single datasets are not representative, highlighting the need for more robust validation in the machine learning for BCIs community.

We studied the use of spectral entropy as a measure of focal attention in order to develop a motor-independent, portable, and objective diagnostic tool for patients with locked-in syndrome (LIS), answering the issues of accuracy and training requirement. Data from 20 healthy volunteers, 6 LIS patients, and 10 patients with a vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS) were included. Spectral entropy was computed during a gaze-independent 2-class (attention vs rest) paradigm, and compared with EEG rhythms (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) classification. Spectral entropy classification during the attention-rest paradigm showed 93% and 91% accuracy in healthy volunteers and LIS patients respectively. VS/UWS patients were at chance level. EEG rhythms classification reached a lower accuracy than spectral entropy. Resting-state EEG spectral entropy could not distinguish individual VS/UWS patients from LIS patients. The present study provides evidence that an EEG-based measure of attention could detect command-following in patients with severe motor disabilities. The entropy system could detect a response to command in all healthy subjects and LIS patients, while none of the VS/UWS patients showed a response to command using this system.

Recent studies have shown the potentials of machine learning algorithms to identify biomarkers and functional brain activity patterns across various AD stages using electroencephalography (EEG). In this study, we aim to discover the altered spatio-temporal patterns of EEG complexity associated with AD pathology in different severity levels. We employed the multiscale entropy (MSE), a complexity measure of time series signals, as the biomarkers to characterize the nonlinear complexity at multiple temporal scales. Two regularized logistic regression methods were applied to extracted MSE features to capture the topographic pattern of MSEs of AD cohorts compared to healthy baseline. Furthermore, canonical correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the multivariate correlation between EEG complexity and cognitive dysfunction measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores. 123 participants were recruited and each participant was examined in three sessions (length = 10 seconds) to collect resting-state EEG signals. MSE features were extracted across 20 time scale factors with pre-determined parameters (m = 2, r = 0.15). The results showed that comparing to logistic regression model, the regularized learning methods performed better for discriminating severe AD cohort from normal control, very mild and mild cohorts (test accuracy similar to 80%), as well as for selecting significant biomarkers arcoss the brain regions. It was found that temporal and occipitoparietal brain regions were more discriminative in regard to classifying severe AD cohort vs. normal controls, but more diverse and distributed patterns of EEG complexity in the brain were exhibited across individuals in early stages of AD.

J	Wang, J; Feng, ZR; Lu, N; Luo, J				Wang, Jie; Feng, Zuren; Lu, Na; Luo, Jing			Toward optimal feature and time segment selection by divergence method for EEG signals classification	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						EEG signals; Kullback-Leibler divergence; Feature selection; Time segment selection; Classification	SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; PATTERNS	Feature selection plays an important role in the field of EEG signals based motor imagery pattern classification. It is a process that aims to select an optimal feature subset from the original set. Two significant advantages involved are: lowering the computational burden so as to speed up the learning procedure and removing redundant and irrelevant features so as to improve the classification performance. Therefore, feature selection is widely employed in the classification of EEG signals in practical brain-computer interface systems. In this paper, we present a novel statistical model to select the optimal feature subset based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure, and automatically select the optimal subject-specific time segment. The proposed method comprises four successive stages: a broad frequency band filtering and common spatial pattern enhancement as preprocessing, features extraction by autoregressive model and log-variance, the Kullback-Leibler divergence based optimal feature and time segment selection and linear discriminate analysis classification. More importantly, this paper provides a potential framework for combining other feature extraction models and classification algorithms with the proposed method for EEG signals classification. Experiments on single-trial EEG signals from two public competition datasets not only demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in selecting discriminative features and time segment, but also show that the proposed method yields relatively better classification results in comparison with other competitive methods.

Automated EEG-based screening of depression using deep convolutional neural network	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Depression; EEG; Electroencephalogram	NONLINEAR FEATURES; DAMAGE DETECTION; DIAGNOSIS; MACHINE; BRAIN	In recent years, advanced neurocomputing and machine learning techniques have been used for Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based diagnosis of various neurological disorders. In this paper, a novel computer model is presented for EEG-based screening of depression using a deep neural network machine learning approach, known as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed technique does not require a semi-manually-selected set of features to be fed into a classifier for classification. It learns automatically and adaptively from the input EEG signals to differentiate EEGs obtained from depressive and normal subjects. The model was tested using EEGs obtained from 15 normal and 15 depressed patients. The algorithm attained accuracies of 93.5% and 96.0% using EEG signals from the left and right hemisphere, respectively. It was discovered in this research that the EEG signals from the right hemisphere are more distinctive in depression than those from the left hemisphere. This discovery is consistent with recent research and revelation that the depression is associated with a hyperactive right hemisphere. An exciting extension of this research would be diagnosis of different stages and severity of depression and development of a Depression Severity Index (DSI). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

As EEG contains multi-channel EEG recordings with huge amount of data, it is sometimes very challenging to extract more representative information from original EEG data for efficient classification of motor imagery (MI) tasks. Thus, it is necessary to diminish the redundant information from the original EEG signal selecting appropriate channels and also to reduce computational cost. Addressing this problem, we intend to develop a methodology based on channel selection for classification of MI tasks in the BCI applications. In this study, we introduce a new way of channel selection considering anatomical and functional structural of the human brain and also investigate its impact in the classification performance. In this proposed method, at first we select the channels from motor cortex area, and then decompose EEG signals using wavelet energy function into several bands of real and imaginary coefficients. The relevant band's coefficient energy has been used as feature vector in this research. After that, the extracted features are tested by three popular machine learning method: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN).

This approach has the potential to be implemented as a computer input device for users to express choices (e.g., left and right, yes and no). The attentional allocation of participants among boxes that each flicker at a different frequency (e.g., 8.6 Hz and 12 Hz) can be distinguished based on EEG alone. Traditionally, steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are studied using multi-channel EEG systems, which greatly hinders the user's mobility. Although SSVEPs are mostly examined in the frequency domain and from the occipital region of the brain, we tested five classifiers with 44 features extracted from the EEG, recorded using an electrode at the frontopolar area (FP1). Apart from using frequency-domain features, such as fast Fourier transform (FFT) coefficients and power spectral density (PSD) features, we also included time-domain features from the pre-frontal region and achieved an average classification accuracy of 74.58% using a random forest ( RF) classifier.

An important form of biomedical data is electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which are generally strongly affected by noise and there exists notable individual, environmental and device differences. In this paper, we focus on learning discriminative features from short time EEG signals. Inspired by traditional image compression techniques to learn a robust representation of an image, we introduce and compare two strategies for learning features from EEG using two specifically designed autoencoders. Channel-wise autoencoders focus on features in each channel, while Image-wise autoencoders instead learn features from the whole trial. Our results on a UCI EEG dataset show that using both Channel-wise and Image-wise autoencoders achieve good performance for a classification problem with state of art accuracy in both within-subject and cross-subject tests. A further experiment using shared weights shows that the shared weights technique only slightly influenced learning but it reduced training time significantly.

Response to cognitive activity (mental task) grounded BCI system is one of the dominate areas of research interest. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are utilized to characterize the brain activities in the BCI domain. Efficient feature extraction from EEG signal is the most important aspect of good performance of classification model. Two known feature extraction methods for non-linear and non-stationary signals are Wavelet Transform and Empirical Mode Decomposition. By exploiting both techniques, an adaptive-filter based approach was proposed earlier famous as Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) to decompose such dynamic signals. But EWT failed to provide useful features for dynamic signals which has overlapping in frequency domain and time domain. To overcome this problem, we utilized fuzzy c-means algorithm along with EWT in our experiment. A well-known multivariate feature selection technique named Linear Regression is used to avoid the problem of the small ratio of samples to features. Further, the Quadratic discriminant classifier (QDC) has been utilized to develop the classification model. The experiments have been done on a publicly available task-based EEG data for comparing the proposed approach with EWT based cognitive activity (mental task) classification. The experimental results show that the proposed fuzzy-based EWT approach for EEG classification gives superior performance over the original EWT.

Hence, building a virtuous cycle system is necessary to improve work efficiency and safety by monitoring instantaneous drowsiness that can be used in any environment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to detect extreme drowsiness using a short time segment (similar to 2 s) of EEG which well represents immediate activity changes depending on a person's arousal, drowsiness, and sleep state. To develop the framework, we use multitaper power spectral density (MPSD) for feature extraction along with extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) as a machine learning classifier. In addition, we suggest a novel drowsiness labeling method by combining the advantages of the psychomotor vigilance task and the electrooculography technique. By experimental evaluation, we show that the adopted MPSD and XGB techniques outperform other techniques used in previous studies. Finally, we identify that spectral components (theta, alpha, and gamma) and channels (Fp1, Fp2, T3, T4, O1, and O2) play an important role in our drowsiness detection framework, which could be extended to mobile devices.

It is composed of multifaceted signals that reflect the localized activity and intensity of neurological processes opening the possibilities for brain to machine interaction. This research explores the use of Machine Learning to analyze EEG data collected from a custom-designed NeuroRacer virtual interactive cognitive training software. The method utilizes Machine Learning classification based on channel level feature performance to significantly reduce complexity while maintaining tolerable loss in performance prediction. The EEG data were collected using a Model "Active-Two" sensor cap (from Cortech Solutions) in conjunction with a BioSemiActiveTwo 64-channel EEG acquisition system. Our findings indicate that classification of the signal feature, derived from the full array of 64 channels during a 6-month follow-up, yielded a prediction rate of 82.2% when assessing the intervention induced differentiation between a Multi-Task Training (MTT) and Non-contact Control groups. Furthermore, we reveal that using a smaller number of channels where the success rate of prediction is optimized would lead to practical benefit for the EEG device design. Our results show that we reach the optimal level with channel reduction down to a selective 12 out of 64 channels with a penalty of 10.04% error rate.

Sensory threshold neuromuscular electrical stimulation fosters motor imagery performance	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Motor imagery; Kinesthetic imagery; Sensory electrical stimulation; EEG imaging; Brain-machine interface	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; MACHINE INTERFACE; EXECUTION; EXCITABILITY; FEEDBACK; NETWORK; DESYNCHRONIZATION; REPRESENTATIONS; MODULATION	Motor imagery (MI) has been largely studied as a way to enhance motor learning and to restore motor functions. Although it is agreed that users should emphasize kinesthetic imagery during MI, recordings of MI brain patterns are not sufficiently reliable for many subjects. It has been suggested that the usage of somatosensory feedback would be more suitable than standardly used visual feedback to enhance MI brain patterns. However, somatosensory feedback should not interfere with the recorded MI brain pattern. In this study we propose a novel feedback modality to guide subjects during MI based on sensory threshold neuromuscular electrical stimulation (St-NMES). St-NMES depolarizes sensory and motor axons without eliciting any muscular contraction. We hypothesize that St-NMES does not induce detectable ERD brain patterns and fosters MI performance. Twelve novice subjects were included in a cross-over design study. We recorded their EEG, comparing St-NMES with visual feedback during MI or resting tasks. We found that St-NMES not only induced significantly larger desynchronization over sensorimotor areas (p<0.05) but also significantly enhanced MI brain connectivity patterns. Moreover, classification accuracy and stability were significantly higher with St-NMES. Importantly, St-NMES alone did not induce detectable artifacts, but rather the changes in the detected patterns were due to an increased MI performance. Our findings indicate that St-NMES is a promising feedback in order to foster MI performance and cold be used for BMI online applications.

Neurophysiological predictors and spectro-spatial discriminative features for enhancing SMR-BCI	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interfaces; electroencephalography; discriminative spectro-spatial patterns; neurophysiological predictors	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; FRONTAL MIDLINE THETA; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MOTOR IMAGERY; ALPHA BAND; OSCILLATIONS; ATTENTION; PATTERNS; CORTEX; RHYTHMS	Neural engineering research is actively engaged in optimizing the robustness of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR)-brain-computer interface (BCI) to boost its potential real-world use. Objective. This paper investigates two vital factors in efficient and robust SMR-BCI design-algorithms that address subject-variability of optimal features and neurophysiological factors that correlate with BCI performance. Existing SMR-BCI research using electroencephalogram (EEG) to classify bilateral motor imagery (MI) focus on identifying subject-specific frequency bands with most discriminative motor patterns localized to sensorimotor region. Approach. A novel strategy to further optimize BCI performance by taking into account the variability of discriminative spectral regions across various EEG channels is proposed in this paper. Main results. The proposed technique results in a significant (p < 0.007) increase in average (N = 10) classification accuracy by 5.96% accompanied by a considerable reduction in number of channels and bands. The session-to-session transfer variation in spectro-spatial patterns using proposed algorithm is investigated offline and classification performance of the optimized BCI model is successfully evaluated in an online SMR-BCI. Further, the effective prediction of SMR-BCI performance with physiological indicators derived from multi-channel resting-state EEG is demonstrated. The results indicate that the resting state activation patterns such as entropy and gamma power from pre-motor (fronto-central) and posterior (parietal and centro-parietal) areas, and beta power from posterior (centro-parietal) areas estimate BCI performance with minimum error. These patterns, strongly related to BCI performance, may represent certain cognitive states during rest. Significance. Findings reported in this paper imply the need for subject-specific modelling of BCI and the prediction of BCI performance using multi-channel rest-state parameters, to ensure enhanced BCI performance.

In some applications, the features arise from multiple sources and it is not so important to select the individual features as to select the important sources. This leads to a group feature selection problem. In this paper, we consider the group feature selection in the multiclass classification setting based on the framework of support vector machines. We reformulate it as a sparse problem by prescribing the maximum number of active groups and propose a novel method based on the ADMM algorithm. We proposed the method in such a way that the main computational load is performed in the first iteration and the remaining iterations can be computed fast. This allows us to handle large problems. We demonstrate the good performance of our method on several real-world datasets. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, FQ; Ke, HJ				Wang, Fengqin; Ke, Hengjin			Global Epileptic Seizure Identification With Affinity Propagation Clustering Partition Mutual Information Using Cross-Layer Fully Connected Neural Network	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						affinity propagation clustering; MI; EEG; epilepsy; synchronization; pattern classification	SYNCHRONIZATION; ALGORITHM; SIGNALS	A longstanding challenge in epilepsy research and practice is the need to classify synchronization patterns hidden in multivariate electroencephalography (EEG) data that is routinely superimposed with intensive noise. It is essential to select a suitable feature extraction method to achieve high recognition performance. A typical approach is to extract the mutual information (MI) between pairs of channels. This calculation, which considers the differences between the sequence pairs to build a reasonable partition, can improve the classification performance. On this basis, however, it is even more difficult to adaptively classify the synchronization patterns hidden in multivariate EEG data under circumstances of insufficient a priori knowledge of domain dependency, such as denoising, feature extraction on a special patient, etc. To address these problems by (1) effectively calculating the MI matrix (synchronization pattern) and (2) accurately classifying the seizure or non-seizure state, this study first accurately measures the synchronization between channel pairs in terms of affinity propagation clustering partition MI (APCPMI). The global synchronization measurement is then obtained by organizing APCPMIs of all channel pairs into a correlation matrix. Finally, a cross-layer fully connected net is designed to characterize the synchronization dynamics correlation matrices adaptively and identify seizure or non-seizure states automatically. Experiments are performed using the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset to evaluate the proposed approach. Seizure states are identified with an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.9793 +/- 0.002, 0.9942 +/- 0.0005, and 0.9676 +/- 0.003, respectively; the resulting performance is superior to those achieved by most existing methods over the same dataset. Furthermore, the approach alleviates the necessity for strictly preprocessing (denoising, removing interferences and artifacts) the EEG data using prior knowledge, which is usually required by existing approaches.

This technology will ultimately be used in real-world environments which include the presence of distractors. The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of visual distractors on BCI performance. Methods: Sixteen able-bodied participants underwent neurofeedback training to achieve motor imagery-guided BCI control in an online paradigm using electroencephalography (EEG) to measure neural signals. Participants then completed two sessions of the motor imagery EEG-BCI protocol in the presence of infrequent, small visual distractors. BCI performance was determined based on classification accuracy. Results: The presence of distractors was found to affect motor imagery-specific patterns in mu and beta power. However, the distractors did not significantly affect the BCI classification accuracy; across participants, the mean classification accuracy was 81.5 +/- 14% for non-distractor trials, and 78.3 +/- 17% for distractor trials. Conclusion: This minimal consequence suggests that the BCI was robust to distractor effects, despite motor imagery-related brain activity being attenuated amid distractors. Significance: A BCI system that mitigates distraction-related effects may improve the ease of its use and ultimately facilitate the effective translation of the technology from the lab to the home.

Due to high variability of the Electroencephalogram (EEG) data, multiple trails are recorded for a particular task. The present work aims to improve the accuracy for motor imagery task classification by selecting the most prominent trail from the multiple trails recorded during motor imagery. In this paper, we propose a novel weight optimization algorithm for common spatial filtering (CSP) using evolutionary algorithms (i.e. cuckoo search algorithm (CSA), firefly algorithm (FA) and gravitational search algorithm (GSA)) to select the most prominent trial from the multiple trails recorded for feature extraction. The features extracted from the selected trials were thus used for motor imagery task classification. The performance was evaluated on the extracted features from the selected trials using two classifiers namely linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machines (SVM). It is observed that FA with band power as a feature gives the best performance in comparison to the earlier reported methods i.e. average, error based and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

However, little is known about the relative performance and characteristics of the specific dissimilarity measures used to describe differences between evoked activation patterns. Here we used a multisession MEG data set to qualitatively characterize a range of dissimilarity measures and to quantitatively compare them with respect to decoding accuracy (for decoding) and between-session reliability of representational dissimilarity matrices (for RSA). We tested dissimilarity measures from a range of classifiers (Linear Discriminant Analysis - LDA, Support Vector Machine - SVM, Weighted Robust Distance - WeiRD, Gaussian Naive Bayes - GNB) and distances (Euclidean distance, Pearson correlation). In addition, we evaluated three key processing choices: 1) preprocessing (noise normalisation, removal of the pattern mean), 2) weighting decoding accuracies by decision values, and 3) computing distances in three different partitioning schemes (non-cross-validated, cross-validated, within-class-corrected). Four main conclusions emerged from our results. First, appropriate multivariate noise normalization substantially improved decoding accuracies and the reliability of dissimilarity measures. Second, LDA, SVM and WeiRD yielded high peak decoding accuracies and nearly identical time courses. Third, while using decoding accuracies for RSA was markedly less reliable than continuous distances, this disadvantage was ameliorated by decision-value-weighting of decoding accuracies. Fourth, the cross- validated Euclidean distance provided unbiased distance estimates and highly replicable representational dissimilarity matrices. Overall, we strongly advise the use of multivariate noise normalisation as a general preprocessing step, recommend LDA, SVM and WeiRD as classifiers for decoding and highlight the cross- validated Euclidean distance as a reliable and unbiased default choice for RSA.

The infected area in the brain region generates the irregular pattern signals as focal signals and the other healthy region in the brain generates the regular pattern signals as non-focal signals. Hence, the detection of focal signals from the non-focal signals is important for epileptic surgery in epilepsy patients. This paper proposes a simple and efficient methodology for EEG signals' classifications using ANFIS classifier. The performance of the proposed EEG signals classification system is evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.

To analyze electroencephalographic (EEG) signal, three techniques, namely one-dimensional local neighbor descriptive count, one-dimensional local gradient count and one-dimensional local binary count, are proposed in this work. Further, a signature point-based improved LPT approach is introduced for effectual classification of EEG signals. The features are computed at the signature points of the EEG signals, which are detected by using the difference of Gaussian pyramid. The features extracted from the signature points of the EEG signals are fed into artificial neural network (ANN) classifier for the discrimination of EEG signals. In this paper, seventeen different classification cases based on six different experimental cases are evaluated using the University of Bonn EEG database. Experimental results show that high classification accuracy for all the cases is achieved using the proposed approach and it also compares favorably to other state-of-the-art methods.	[Sairamya, N.

The efficacy of rTMS treatment can be predicted using pre-treatment cordance, a quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) method extracting information from absolute and relative power of EEG spectra, that will prevent trial-and error treatment sequences, subject suffering and increase in health-care costs. In this study, pre-treatment QEEG data were collected from 6 frontal electrodes (Fp1, Fp2, F3, F4, F7 and F8) in slow bands (delta and theta) for 147 MDD subjects. In order to classify MDD subjects as responder or non-responder, four different machine learning techniques, which are Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Tree (DT), were used and their performances were evaluated. The results show that it is possible to predict rTMS treatment responders with a sensitivity of 95.6%, accuracy of 86.4% and area under Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) value of 0.92 using SVM.

Conventional BCI systems use electroencephalographic signals due to its high temporal resolution, portability, and easiness to implement, for which the filter-banked analysis works as the characterization baseline. Due to such analysis yields to highly dimensional representation spaces leading to overtrained systems, we propose to combine the multiple spectral bands into a single representation space through the maximization of the centered kernel alignment criterion. As a result, the similarity between the measured EEG data and the available label sets is maximized, with the additional benefit of enhancing the spectral interpretation of the subject performance. The proposed kappa-FB is evaluated in the dataset IIa of the BCI competition IV for a binary classification task. Attained accuracy proves that kappa-FB outperforms other filter-banked representations without compromising the system confidence.

The paradigm is popular in EEG-based Brain Computer Interfacing where selectable targets are encoded by different frequency-and/or phase-tagged stimuli. We compare the performance of two state-of-the-art SSVEP decoders on both ECoG-and scalp-recorded EEG signals, and show that ECoG-based decoding is more accurate for very short stimulation lengths (i.e., less than 1 s). Furthermore, whereas the accuracy of scalp-EEG decoding bene fi ts from a multi-electrode approach, to address interfering EEG responses and noise, ECoG decoding enjoys only a marginal improvement as even a single electrode, placed over the posterior part of the primary visual cortex, seems to suf fi ce. This study shows, for the fi rst time, that EEG-based SSVEP decoders can in principle be applied to ECoG, and can be expected to yield faster decoding speeds using less electrodes.

Since a multilayer neural network with multi-valued neurons (MLMVN) was successfully used earlier to decode EEG signals in a brain/computer interface (BCI) by analysis of their Fourier transform, it seemed very attractive to use it as a tool for EEG analysis. This work aims to further investigate how a complex-valued machine learning tool can be used to analyze EEG in the frequency domain. Our goal was to check how Fourier transform and complex wavelet transform of EEG can be analyzed using MLMVN in order to diagnose epilepsy, its remission or absence. We worked with a commonly used benchmark data set of epilepsy-related EEGs. The analysis of the transformed data was performed to determine a set of relevant statistical characteristics of DTCWT and Fourier transform components, which were then used as inputs of the MLMVN. The obtained results show a very high efficiency of the proposed approach.

Brain-computer interaction for online enhancement of visuospatial attention performance	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interfaces; visuospatial attention; performance enhancement; EEG; online	VISUAL-ATTENTION; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; SPATIAL ATTENTION; COVERT ATTENTION; TOP-DOWN; TIME; CLASSIFICATION; MECHANISMS; CORTEX; BIAS	Objective. this study on real-time decoding of visuospatial attention has two objectives: first, to reliably decode self-directed shifts of attention from electroencephalography (EEG) data, and second, to analyze whether this information can be used to enhance visuospatial performance. Visuospatial performance was measured in a target orientation discrimination task, in terms of reaction time, and error rate. Approach. Our experiment extends the Posner paradigm by introducing a new type of ambiguous cues to indicate upcoming target location. The cues are designed so that their ambiguity is imperceptible to the user. This entails endogenous shifts of attention which are truly self-directed. Two protocols were implemented to exploit the decoding of attention shifts. The first 'adaptive' protocol uses the decoded locus to display the target. In the second 'warning' protocol, the target position is defined in advance, but a warning is flashed when the target mismatches the decoded locus. Main results. Both protocols were tested in an online experiment involving ten subjects. The reaction time improved in both the adaptive and the warning protocol. The error rate was improved in the adaptive protocol only. Significance. This proof of concept study brings evidence that visuospatial brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can be used to enhance improving human-machine interaction in situations where humans must react to off-center events in the visual field.

In this paper, we propose a two-phase model, based on deep neural networks and support vector machine for automatic sleep staging using raw single channel EEG signals. Instead of hand-engineering features, the first phase of model apply the combination of convolutional neural networks (extract time-invariant features) and bidirectional long short-term memory networks (learn temporal correlation among sleep stages) to learn features automatically from raw EEG. The second phase of model use traditional support vector machine classifier to identify 5 sleep stages based on previous extracted features in the first phase. Compared to existing methods, our model can learn richer features from raw EEG signals automatically, and achieves a better accuracy of 78.34%. The model is evaluated on the Sleep-EDF database, and we use independent training and test datasets. The experiments show our model achieves an excellent result.

In addition, in various conditions and with neuropsychological disorders, the brain has special patterns in different regions. This paper presents a model to show and compare the connection patterns in different brain regions of children with autism (53 boys and 36 girls) and control children (61 boys and 33 girls). The model is designed by cellular neural networks and it uses the proper features of electroencephalography. The results show that there are significant differences and abnormalities in the left hemisphere, (p < 0.05) at the electrodes AF3, F3, P7, T7, and 01 in the children with autism compared with the control group. Also, the evaluation of the obtained connections values between brain regions demonstrated that there are more abnormalities in the connectivity of frontal and parietal lobes and the relations of the neighboring regions in children with autism. It is observed that the proposed model is able to distinguish the autistic children from the control subjects with an accuracy rate of 95.1% based on the obtained values of CNN using the SVM method.

The classification of brain patterns for each different subject requires an extensively time-consuming learning stage specific to that person, in order to reach satisfactory accuracy performance. The training session could also be infeasible for disabled patients as they may not fully understand the training instructions. In this paper, we propose a unified classification scheme based on ensemble classifier, dynamic stopping, and adaptive learning. We apply this scheme on the P300-based BCI, with the subject-independent manner, where no learning session is required for new experimental users. According to our theoretical analysis and empirical results, the harmonized integration of these three methods can significantly boost up the average accuracy from 75.00% to 91.26%, while at the same time reduce the average spelling time from 12.62 to 6.78 iterations, approximately to two-fold faster. The experiments were conducted on a large public dataset which had been used in other related studies. Direct comparisons between our work with the others' are also reported in details.

An electroencephalography (EEG)-based motor imagery task has notable characteristics of event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/ERS) in specific frequency bands, including alpha and beta rhythms in the sensorimotor area. Based on this phenomenon, motor imagery features are extracted typically using common spatial patterns (CSPs). However, some researchers have reported that ERD features have severe inter-subject variation. In this study, we investigated the correlation between various ERD features and classification accuracy during a motor imagery task. We found that ERDs may not be useful in estimating classification accuracy, although they are representative features of a motor imagery task.

The main objective of the present study is to design an accurate and robust computer-assisted sleep stage scoring system using single-channel EEG signal by proposing a novel time domain feature named Statistical Behavior of Local Extrema (SBLE). SBLE provides a profound understanding of hidden dynamics of EEG signals by quantifying and symbolizing its local extrema information, extracting and defining various patterns, and statistical analysis of extracted patterns. First, each EEG segment was decomposed into 6 frequency sub bands (i.e., low-delta, high-delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta). Next, SBLE features were separately computed from each sub-band. Then, an optimal feature set with a high rate of accuracy was selected using a supervised Multi-Cluster/Class Feature Selection (MCFS) algorithm. Finally, the selected features were fed to a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification purposes. The benchmark Sleep-EDF dataset and DREAMS Subject Database were employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The average (+/- variance) accuracy rates were 90.6 +/- 4.2%, 91.8 +/- 5.0%, 92.8 +/- 3.3%, 94.5 +/- 3.4%, 97.9 +/- 1.4% for six-stage to two-stage sleep classification on Sleep-EDF dataset, respectively. Besides, its performance on DREAMS Subjects Database was also promising in term of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen's Kappa coefficient. Experimental results suggest that the proposed methodology can precisely solve the multi-class sleep stage classification problem by presenting an innovative symbolic approach similar to physician's point of view.

The electroencephalography (EEG) technique combined with different signal analysis approaches has been especially successful in revealing the detailed dynamic properties of the neural response to exogenous stimulation. In this analysis, we evaluated the nonlinear structure of the EEG signal using fractal theory in rest and visual stimulation (checkerboard reversal at 8, 14 and 28 Hz). Our analysis showed a significant influence of stimulation on the fractal structure of EEG signal. On comparison between different conditions, 14-Hz steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs), previously shown to trigger an optimal brain response, exhibited the greatest influence on the complexity of the EEG signal. On the other hand, we observed the lowest complexity of EEG signal in the post-stimulation rest period. Statistical analysis confirmed significant differences in the fractal structure of the EEG signal between rest and different stimulation conditions. These findings demonstrate for the first time a direct relationship between the efficiency of brain processing and the complexity of the measured EEG signal, which could be employed for objective assessment and classification in various experimental paradigms.

Other factors containing mislabeling or misleading MI EEG trials might also cause more uncertainties in training datasets that lead to decline in classification performance. This paper proposes a new framework to achieve more efficient classification in multiclass MI EEG-based BCIs. An artifact rejected common spatial pattern (AR-CSP) method is proposed for feature extraction in order to cope with the interferences of artifacts. A self-regulated adaptive resonance theory based neuro-fuzzy classifier that is referred to as "self-regulated supervised Gaussian fuzzy adaptive system Art (SRSG-FasArt)" is introduced to deal with EEG nonstationarities. A metacognitive self-regulatory-based learning algorithm is also proposed to more efficiently deal with the uncertainties. The algorithm captures the training data samples by priority and automatically creates, upgrades, or prunes the fuzzy rules by scanning the knowledge content existing in the data patterns and the created rules. The mechanism improves the generalization capability of the SRSG-FasArt and prevents over-training. The performance of the proposed cooperative framework of AR-CSP and SRSG-FasArt is evaluated using the BCI competition IV dataset 2a. The results indicate more accurate and efficient BCI classification compared to the existing frameworks.

BrainAGE was studied primarily using MRI techniques. EEG signals in combination with machine learning (ML) approaches were not commonly used for the human age prediction, and BrainAGE. We investigated whether age-related changes are affecting brain EEG signals, and whether we can predict the chronological age and obtain BrainAGE estimates using a rigorous ML framework with a novel and extensive EEG features extraction. Methods: EEG data were obtained from 468 healthy, mood/anxiety, eating and substance use disorder participants (297 females) from the Tulsa-1000, a naturalistic longitudinal study based on Research Domain Criteria framework. Five sets of preprocessed EEG features across channels and frequency bands were used with different ML methods to predict age. Using a nested-cross-validation (NCV) approach and stack-ensemble learning from EEG features, the predicted age was estimated. The important features and their spatial distributions were deduced. Results: The stack-ensemble age prediction model achieved R-2 = 0.37 (0.06), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) = 6.87(0.69) and RMSE = 8.46(0.59) in years. The age and predicted age correlation was r = 0.6. The feature importance revealed that age predictors are spread out across different feature types. The NCV approach produced a reliable age estimation, with features consistent behavior across different folds. Conclusion: Our rigorous ML framework and extensive EEG signal features allow a reliable estimation of chronological age, and BrainAGE. This general framework can be extended to test EEG association with and to predict/study other physiological relevant responses.

The diagnosis of epilepsy is made possible by identification of focal EEG signals. In this article, a novel method clustering variational mode decomposition (VMD) is introduced for focal EEG signal identification. VMD is an adaptive signal decomposition technique, which shows the limitations for processing of nonhomogeneous signals, such as EEG. The clustering-VMD (CVMD) is proposed to overcome the limitations of VMD. In CVMD, first, the nonhomogeneous EEG signal is analyzed by optimum allocation sampling into homogeneous EEG-clusters and then decomposed into band-limited modes. The spectral moment based features are extracted from the modes of CVMD and applied as the input to the extreme learning machine classifier for identification of focal EEG signals. The proposed method provides the identification of focal EEG signals, and the performance measures of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are 96%, 94.69%, and 97.39%, respectively.

In particular, the problems of cross-session and cross-subject classification are considered. These problems concern the ability to use data from previous sessions or from a database of past users to calibrate and initialize the classifier, allowing a calibration-less BCI mode of operation. Methods: Data are represented using spatial covariance matrices of the EEG signals, exploiting the recent successful techniques based on the Riemannian geometry of the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. Cross-session and cross-subject classification can be difficult, due to the many changes intervening between sessions and between subjects, including physiological, environmental, as well as instrumental changes. Here, we propose to affine transform the covariance matrices of every session/subject in order to center them with respect to a reference covariance matrix, making data from different sessions/subjects comparable. Then, classification is performed both using a standard minimum distance to mean classifier, and through a probabilistic classifier recently developed in the literature, based on a density function (mixture of Riemannian Gaussian distributions) defined on the SPD manifold. Results: The improvements in terms of classification performances achieved by introducing the affine transformation are documented with the analysis of two BCI datasets. Conclusion and significance: Hence, we make, through the affine transformation proposed, data from different sessions and subject comparable, providing a significant improvement in the BCI transfer learning problem.

However, one of the common practices-using a subset of sensors in ERP analysis is hard to provide a holistic and precise dynamic results. Selecting or grouping subsets of sensors may also be subject to selection bias, multiple comparison, and further complicated by individual differences in the group-level analysis. More importantly, changes in neural generators and variations in response magnitude from the same neural sources are difficult to separate, which limit the capacity of testing different aspects of cognitive hypotheses. We introduce EasyEEG, a toolbox that includes several multivariate analysis methods to directly test cognitive hypotheses based on topographic responses that include data from all sensors. These multivariate methods can investigate effects in the dimensions of response magnitude and topographic patterns separately using data in the sensor space, therefore enable assessing neural response dynamics. The concise workflow and the modular design provide user-friendly and programmer-friendly features. Users of all levels can benefit from the open-sourced, free EasyEEG to obtain a straightforward solution for efficient processing of EEG data and a complete pipeline from raw data to final results for publication.

Classification of motor imagery electroencephalography signals using spiking neurons with different input encoding strategies	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Brain-computer Interfaces; Wavelet; Particle swarm optimization; Pattern classification	EXECUTION; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS; MODEL	Motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces decode users' intentions from the electroencephalogram; however, poor spatial resolution makes automatic recognition of these intentions a challenging task. New classification approaches with low computational costs and high classification performances need to be developed in order to increase the number of users benefitted by these systems. On the other hand, spiking neuron models, which are mathematical abstractions of real neurons, have shown good performances in several classification tasks, making these models suitable for motor imagery classification. In this work, two different encoding strategies for spiking neuron models, applied to the classification of motor imagery time-frequency features of stroke patients and healthy subjects, were evaluated. Classification performances and computational costs of spiking neuron models were compared against those of linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines and artificial neural networks. Results showed that a time-varying encoding strategy is more suitable for motor imagery classification, and its implementation computational cost is low. Therefore, a spiking neuron model with a time-varying encoding strategy could increase the number of potential users of brain-computer interfaces.

In brain-computer interfaces (BCI), measurements of the user's brain activity are classified into commands for the computer. With EEG-based BCIs, the origins of the classified phenomena are often considered to be spatially localized in the cortical volume and mixed in the EEG. We investigate if more accurate BCIs can be obtained by reconstructing the source activities in the volume. Approach. We contrast the physiology-driven source reconstruction with data-driven representations obtained by statistical machine learning. We explain these approaches in a common linear dictionary framework and review the different ways to obtain the dictionary parameters. We consider the effect of source reconstruction on some major difficulties in BCI classification, namely information loss, feature selection and nonstationarity of the EEG. Main results. Our analysis suggests that the approaches differ mainly in their parameter estimation. Physiological source reconstruction may thus be expected to improve BCI accuracy if machine learning is not used or where it produces less optimal parameters. We argue that the considered difficulties of surface EEG classification can remain in the reconstructed volume and that data-driven techniques are still necessary. Finally, we provide some suggestions for comparing approaches. Significance. The present work illustrates the relationships between source reconstruction and machine learning-based approaches for EEG data representation. The provided analysis and discussion should help in understanding, applying, comparing and improving such techniques in the future.

The proposed approach combines eye movements and facial expressions to annotate the perceived game objects with the expressed dominate emotions. Moreover, our system EMOGRAPH (Emotional Graph) gives easy access to information about user experience and predicts player's emotions. The prediction mainly uses both subjective measures through questionnaire and objective measures through brain wave activity (electroencephalography - EEG) combined with eye tracking data. EMOGRAPH' s method was experimented on 21 participants playing horror game "Outlast". Our results show the effectiveness of our method in the identification of the emotions and their triggers. We also present our emotion prediction approach using game scene's design goal (defined by OCC variables from the model of emotions' cognitive evaluation of Ortony, Clore and Collins [1]) to annotate the player's situation in a scene and machine learning algorithms. The prediction results are promising and would widen possibilities in game design.

The sensitive electrodes of EEG are susceptible to high amplitude electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, which superimpose on the recorded EEG. Minimizing this artifact effectively from a single channel EEG without a reference ECG channel is a challenge. In this paper, extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm as a regression model is implemented for ECG artifact removal from single channel EEG. The S-transform (ST) of the EEG signals are used as the feature set of for ELM training and testing. ST combines the progressive resolution and absolutely referenced phase information for the given time series uniquely. By training the ELM with pairs of contaminated and clean EEG signals both in magnitude and phase, is able to minimize the ECG artifact from contaminated EEG signal effectively in the testing phase. The average Root mean square error (RMSE) and the correlation coefficient (CC) for actual EEG signal to the estimated EEG signal from the ELM based regression model obtained are 0.32 and 0.96 respectively.

Emotion recognition for semi-autonomous vehicles framework	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING - IJIDEM			English	Article						Electroencephalography; Emotion recognition; K nearest neighbor; Autonomous vehicles; Semi autonomous		The human being in his blessed curiosity has always wondered how to make machines feel, and, at the same time how a machine can detect emotions. Perhaps some of the tasks that cannot be replaced by machines are the ability of human beings to feel emotions. In the last year, this hypothesis is increasingly questioned by scientists who have done work that seeks to understand the phenomena of brain functioning using the state of the art in instrumentation, sensors, and signal processing. Today, the world scientists have powerful machine learning methods developed to challenge this issue.The field of emotion detection is gaining significance as the technology advances, and particularly due to the current developments in machine learning, the Internet of Things, industry 4.0 and Autonomous Vehicles. Machines will need to be equipped with the capacity to monitor the state of the human user and to change their behaviour in response. Machine learning offers a route to this and should be able to make use of data collected from questionnaires, facial expression scans, and physiological signals such as electroencephalograms (EEG), electrocardiograms, and galvanic skin response. In this study, an approach was proposed to identify the emotional state of a subject from the collected data in the elicited emotion experiments. An algorithm using EEG data was developed, using the power spectral density of the frequency cerebral bands (alpha, beta, theta, and gamma) as features for classifier training. A K Nearest Neighbors algorithm using Euclidian distance was used to predict the emotional state of the subject. This article proposes a novel approach for emotion recognition that not only depends on images of the face, as in the previous literature, but also on the physiological data. The algorithm was able to recognize nine different emotions (Neutral, Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise, Amusement, and Anxiety), nine valence positions, and nine positions on arousal axes. Using the data from only 14 EEG electrodes, an accuracy of approximately 97% was achieved. An approach has been developed for evaluating the state of mind of an driver in the context of a semi-autonomous vehicle context, for example. However, the system has a much wider range of potential applications, from the design of products to the evaluation of the user experience.

Fatigue can lead to a decrease in motivation and vigilance which may result in certain accidents or injuries. It is crucial to monitor fatigue in workplace for safety reasons and well-being of the workers. In this paper, Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based evaluation of mental fatigue is investigated using the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. An experiment lasted around 2 hours and 30 minutes was designed and carried out to induce four levels of fatigue and collect EEG data from seven subjects. The results show that for subject-dependent 4-level fatigue recognition, the best average accuracy of 93.45% was achieved by using 6 statistical features with a linear SVM classifier. With subject-independent approach, the best average accuracy of 39.80% for 4 levels was achieved by using fractal dimension, 6 statistical features and a linear discriminant analysis classifier. The EEG-based fatigue recognition has the potential to be used in workplace such as cranes to monitor the fatigue of operators who are often subjected to long working hours with heavy workloads.

Calculations of consciousness: electroencephalography analyses to determine anesthetic depth	CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Review						brain monitoring; depth of anesthesia monitoring; electroencephalogram; machine learning; nonlinear dynamics	SEVOFLURANE ANESTHESIA; NETWORK; RECOVERY; ENTROPY; EEG	Purpose of reviewElectroencephalography (EEG) was introduced into anesthesia practice in the 1990s as a tool to titrate anesthetic depth. However, limitations in current analysis techniques have called into question whether these techniques improve standard of care, or instead call for improved, more ubiquitously applicable measures to assess anesthetic transitions and depth. This review highlights emerging analytical approaches and techniques from neuroscience research that have the potential to better capture anesthetic transitions to provide better measurements of anesthetic depth.Recent findingsSince the introduction of electroencephalography, neuroscientists, engineers, mathematicians, and clinicians have all been developing new ways of analyzing continuous electrical signals. Collaborations between these fields have proliferated several analytical techniques that demonstrate how anesthetics affect brain dynamics and conscious transitions. Here, we review techniques in the following categories: network science, integration and information, nonlinear dynamics, and artificial intelligence.SummaryUp-and-coming techniques have the potential to better clinically define and characterize altered consciousness time points. Such new techniques used alongside traditional measures have the potential to improve depth of anesthesia measurements and enhance an understanding of how the brain is affected by anesthetic agents. However, new measures will be needed to be tested for robustness in real-world environments and on diverse experimental protocols.

The conventional process to avoid such cases is to directly reject the entire severely contaminated EEG segments, which leads to a drawback that the BCI has no decoding results during that certain period. In this study, a novel decoding scheme based on the combination of Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP) and deep belief network (DBN) was proposed to recognize the incomplete motor imagery EEG. Particularly, instead of discarding the entire segment, two forms of data removal were adopted to eliminate the EEG portions with extreme artifacts and data loss. The LSP was utilized to steadily extract the power spectral density (PSD) features from the incomplete EEG constructed by the remaining portions. A DBN structure based on the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) was exploited and optimized to perform the classification task. Various comparative experiments were conducted and evaluated on simulated signal and real incomplete motor imagery EEG, including the comparison of three PSD extraction methods (fast Fourier transform,Welch and LSP) and two classifiers (DBN and support vector machine, SVM). The results demonstrate that the LSP can estimate relative robust PSD features and the proposed scheme can significantly improve the decoding performance for the incomplete motor imagery EEG. This scheme can provide an alternative decoding solution for the motor imagery EEG contaminated by extreme artifacts and data loss. It can be beneficial to promote the stability, smoothness and maintain consecutive outputs without interruption for a BCI system that is suitable for the online and long-term application.

The labeled EEG samples are usually scarce, while the unlabeled samples are available in large quantities and easy to collect in real applications. Semisupervised learning (SSL) methods can utilize both labeled and unlabeled data to improve performance over supervised approaches. However, it has been reported that the unlabeled data may undermine the performance of SSL in some cases. To improve the safety of SSL, we proposed a new safety-control mechanism by analyzing the differences between unlabeled data analysis in supervised and semi-supervised learning. We then develop and implement a safe classification method based on the semi-supervised extreme learning machine (SS-ELM). Following this approach, the Wasserstein distance is used to measure the similarities between the predictions obtained from ELM and SS-ELM algorithms, and a different risk degree is thereby calculated for each unlabeled data instance. A risk-based regularization term is then constructed and embedded into the objective function of the SS-ELM. Extensive experiments were conducted using benchmark and EEG datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the performance of the new algorithm is comparable to SS-ELM and superior to ELM on average. It is thereby shown that the proposed method is safe and efficient for the classification of EEG signals.

Classification of unilateral motor tasks using spectral features of EEG	2018 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (IEEE SSCI)			English	Proceedings Paper	8th IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)	NOV 18-21, 2018	Bengaluru, INDIA	IEEE		Electroencephalography; spectral features; motor imagery; motor execution; support vector machine	ACTIVATION	The research to identify the relationship between neural activity underlying motor tasks such as motor imagery, execution, planning and observation has been of significant interest, since it is an important aspect in improving our understanding of neuromotor networks. Neuroimaging literature suggests that the central mechanism in all these tasks is the activation of the primary motor areas of the brain. To study correlates of these tasks, the researchers often employ neural data recorded from the subjects as they perform motor tasks using their dominant hand. In this study, we investigate the distinction between EEG spectral features during unilateral right and unilateral left, imagined and executed hand motor tasks. The analysis is conducted for the data from each hand separately, with the objective to identify whether the EEG activity that distinguished unilateral motor tasks is distinct for each hand. Further, a novel approach of selection of multi-channel EEG spectral features is proposed and supervised classification based on support vector machines is employed to classify unilateral motor imagination and motor execution tasks using the selected features. Grand averages of spectral features, over 10 subjects, are studied and it is observed that EEG activity during unilateral motor tasks are both spatially localized and lateralized. Using the proposed pattern recognition model, accuracies of 82.4 % and 83.1 % with a reduction in 15-20 % features for right and left unilateral motor tasks respectively.

Stress was generally considered as being synonymous with distress. English language dictionaries (Oxford & Merriam-Webster) defined it as "physical, mental, or emotional strain or tension when a person perceives that demands exceed the personal and social resources the individual is able to mobilize." Stress affects over 100 million Americans and is a driver of many chronic diseases. According to American Psychological Association (APA) 2012 study, "Stress is costing organizations a Fortune" and some cases as much as $300 billion a year. The challenges, importantly, for the individuals and the organizations are lack of proactive detection of the stress and inept preventive actions to manage mental health to circumvent adverse effects of the stress. This research paper addresses the challenge by developing and deploying machine learning enabled data driven & Electroencephalogram biosensor integrated mobile application that proactively gleans User's stressful episodes, infuses collaborative intelligence derived from de-identified yet User relevant demographical, physiological, lifestyle and behavioral datasets and preventive healthcare insights to counter otherwise the long term negative effects of the stress on Users health.

Feature extraction of EEG signals determines the performance of the whole recognition system. In this paper, a novel method using the local binary pattern (LBP) based on the wavelet transform (WT) is proposed to characterize the behavior of EEG activities. First, the WT is employed for time-frequency decomposition of EEG signals. After that, the "uniform" LBP operator is carried out on the wavelet-based time-frequency representation. And the generated histogram is regarded as EEG feature vector for the quantification of the textural information of its wavelet coefficients. The LBP features coupled with the support vector machine (SVM) classifier can yield the satisfactory recognition accuracies of 98.88% for interictal and ictal EEG classification and 98.92% for normal, interictal and ictal EEG classification on the publicly available EEG dataset. Moreover, the numerical results on another large size EEG dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can also effectively detect seizure events from multi-channel raw EEG data. Compared with the standard LBP, the "uniform" LBP can obtain the much shorter histogram which greatly reduces the computational burden of classification and enables it to detect ictal EEG signals in real time.

Using machine learning techniques we explored if abnormalities in microstates can identify patients with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) in the absence of an interictal discharge (IED). Method: 4 Classes of microstates were computed from 2 min artefact free EEG epochs in 42 subjects (21 TLE and 21 controls). The percentage of time coverage, frequency of occurrence and duration for each of these micro states were computed and redundancy reduced using feature selection methods. Subsequently, Fishers Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) and logistic regression were used for classification. Result FLDA distinguished TLE with 76.1% accuracy (85.0% sensitivity, 66.6% specificity) considering frequency of occurrence and percentage of time coverage of microstate C as features. Conclusion: Microstate alterations are present in patients with TLE. This feature might be useful in the diagnosis of epilepsy even in the absence of an IED.

In this regard, the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal provides valuable information of brain physiology for detection of drowsiness. EEG signals exhibit non-stationary nature which is tough to explore by prior defined and fixed number of basis functions. In this paper, an adaptive Hermite decomposition is proposed for the detection of drowsiness EEG signals. In the proposed decomposition, Hermite functions are used as basis functions, which are adaptively selected for each EEG signal by evolutionary optimization algorithms (EOAs). The mean square error of decomposition is proposed as an objective function to EOAs. The minimum decomposition error provided artificial bee colony EOA is considered to Hermite coefficients-based feature extraction for EEG signals. The extracted features are tested with the extreme learning machine (ELM), decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, least squares support vector machine, artificial neural network, and naive Bayes for detection of alertness and drowsiness EEG signals. The proposed method with ELM classifier obtained 95.45% and 87.92% detection rates for alertness and drowsiness states, respectively, which are better as compared to other existing methods.

Cooperative scenarios involving both robots and humans require safe human-robot interaction. One important aspect here is the management of robot errors, including fast and accurate online robot-error detection and correction. Analysis of brain signals from a human interacting with a robot may help identifying robot errors, but accuracies of such analyses have still substantial space for improvement. In this paper we evaluate whether a novel framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (deep ConvNets) could improve the accuracy of decoding robot errors from the EEG of a human observer, both during an object grasping and a pouring task. We show that deep ConvNets reached significantly higher accuracies than both regularized Linear Discriminant Analysis (rLDA) and filter bank common spatial patterns (FB-CSP) combined with rLDA, both widely used EEG classifiers. Deep ConvNets reached mean accuracies of 75% +/- 9 %, rLDA 65% +/- 10% and FB-CSP + rLDA 63% +/- 6% for decoding of erroneous vs. correct trials. Visualization of the time-domain EEG features learned by the ConvNets to decode errors revealed spatiotemporal patterns that reflected differences between the two experimental paradigms. Across subjects, ConvNet decoding accuracies were significantly correlated with those obtained with rLDA, but not CSP, indicating that in the present context ConvNets behaved more "rLDA-like" (but consistently better), while in a previous decoding study with another task but the same ConvNet architecture, it was found to behave more "CSP-like". Our findings thus provide further support for the assumption that deep ConvNets are a versatile addition to the existing toolbox of EEG decoding techniques, and we discuss steps how ConvNet EEG decoding performance could be further optimized	[Behncke, Joos; Schirrmeister, Robin; Burgard, Wolfram] Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Dept Comp Sci, Freiburg, Germany; [Behncke, Joos; Schirrmeister, Robin; Ball, Tonio] Univ Med Ctr Freiburg, Translat Neurotechnol Lab, Freiburg, Germany		Behncke, J (corresponding author), Albert Ludwigs Univ Freiburg, Dept Comp Sci, Freiburg, Germany.; Behncke, J (corresponding author), Univ Med Ctr Freiburg, Translat Neurotechnol Lab, Freiburg, Germany.	joos.behncke@uniklinik-freiburg.de		Burgard, Wolfram/0000-0002-5680-6500	German Research Foundation (DFG) [EXC1086]; grant BMI-Bot by the Baden-Wuerttemberg Stiftung	German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); grant BMI-Bot by the Baden-Wuerttemberg Stiftung	This research was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG, grant number EXC1086) and grant BMI-Bot by the Baden-Wuerttemberg Stiftung.		17	13	13	0	4	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-5386-2574-3				2018							179	184						6	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Neurosciences	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering; Neurosciences & Neurology	BL9WZ					2022-08-02	WOS:000458446600046

The motive of this work was to explore the application of HOS for an automated diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Resting-state EEG signals collected from 20 PD patients with medication and 20 age-matched normal subjects were used in this study. HOS bispectrum features were extracted from the EEG signals. The obtained features were ranked using t value, and highly ranked features were used in order to develop the PD Diagnosis Index (PDDI). The PDDI is a single value, which can discriminate the two classes. Also, the ranked features were fed one by one to the various classifiers, namely decision tree (DT), fuzzy K-nearest neighbor (FKNN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), naive bayes (NB), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and support vector machine (SVM), to choose the best classifier using minimum number of features. We have obtained an optimum mean classification accuracy of 99.62%, mean sensitivity and specificity of 100.00 and 99.25%, respectively, using the SVM classifier. The proposed PDDI can aid the clinicians in their diagnosis and help to test the efficacy of drugs.

This study uses Synchronized Brainwave Recordings or Electro Encephalography (EEG) signals data available from the University of California, Berkeley, School of Information, to understand features and to classify signals into eight different classes. First, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used for feature extraction and then classifiers like Random Forest, Gradient Boost, Xgboost, Ensemble Voting and Logistic Regression are used to classify the signals. Next, the challenges in classifying using deep learning based approaches like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for multi-class classification are discussed.	[Srujan, K.

Recently, electroencephalograms (EEGs) measured in the resting state have been vastly analyzed as a means for classifying the BD and schizophrenic patients, but EEGs evoked by external audio/visual stimuli have been rarely investigated, despite their high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this study, in order to investigate whether EEGs evoked by external stimuli can be used for classifying the BD and schizophrenic patients, we used a visual stimulus modulated at a specific frequency to induce steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP). In the experiment, a photic stimulation modulated at 16 Hz was presented to two groups of the schizophrenic and BD patients for 95 s, during which the EEG data were recorded. Statistical measures of SSVEPs (mean, skewness, and kurtosis) described in SNR units were extracted as features to characterize and classify the variations of brain activity patterns in the two groups. Two brain areas, O1 and Fz, showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups for SNR mean and kurtosis, respectively. Among five applied classifiers, k-nearest neighbor provided the highest classification accuracy of 91.30% with the best feature set selected by Fisher score. An acceptable accuracy for binary classification (>70%) was retained until analysis time was reduced up to 10 s using a support vector machine classifier, and 20 s for other classifiers. Our results demonstrate the potential applicability of the proposed SSVEP-based classification approach with relatively short single-trial EEG signals.

For such applications, the EEG signal needs to be decoded and translated into appropriate actions. A recently emerging EEG decoding approach is deep learning with Convolutional or Recurrent Neural Networks (CNNs, RNNs) with many different architectures already published. Here we present a novel framework for the large-scale evaluation of different deep-learning architectures on different EEG datasets. This framework comprises (i) a collection of EEG datasets currently including 100 examples (recording sessions) from six different classification problems, (ii) a collection of different EEG decoding algorithms, and (iii) a wrapper linking the decoders to the data as well as handling structured documentation of all settings and (hyper-) parameters and statistics, designed to ensure transparency and reproducibility. As an applications example we used our framework by comparing three publicly available CNN architectures: the Braindecode Deep4 ConvNet, Braindecode Shallow ConvNet, and two versions of EEGNet. We also show how our framework can be used to study similarities and differences in the performance of different decoding methods across tasks. We argue that the deep learning EEG framework as described here could help to tap the full potential of deep learning for BCI applications.

Doctors perform different experiments to detect the epilepsy and type of' it. Most common and the hest way to epilepsy detection is analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In this paper, we present a new method for classifying the brain activities in order to detect epilepsy seizures. The proposed method is based on time-frequency analysis of EEG signals using stationary wavelet transform (SWT). At first, four level SWI' of EEG signal is obtained and then the coefficients are down-sampled with factor 2. After that, the local binary pattern (LBP) of the obtained coefficients are calculated and LBP coefficients are modeled with GARCH model. The parameters of GARCH model construct the feature vector and K-nearest neighbor and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are used for classification. Results show that our proposed method has the better classification accuracy than the recently proposed methods.

In this paper, an epileptic EEG classification method based on wavelet multi-scale analysis and particle swarm optimization is proposed. Firstly, the multi-scale is carried out to the original EEG to extract its sub-bands of different frequency. Secondly, the Hurst exponent and the sample entropy are used to extract the EEG signals and its sub-bands. Finally, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of the extreme learning machine (ELM), and the obtained eigenvector is put to PSO-ELM to realize the purpose of classification of epileptic EEG. The proposed method in this paper achieved 99.7% classification accuracy for the discrimination between epileptic ictal and inter ictal EEG, which is superior to those methods in other studies.

J	Kim, S; Kim, J; Chun, HW				Kim, Seonho; Kim, Jungjoon; Chun, Hong-Woo			Wave2Vec: Vectorizing Electroencephalography Bio-Signal for Prediction of Brain Disease	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG); bio-signal; prediction of brain disease; Wave2vec; alcoholism; dementia; sequence classification; deep learning	CLASSIFICATION	Interest in research involving health-medical information analysis based on artificial intelligence, especially for deep learning techniques, has recently been increasing. Most of the research in this field has been focused on searching for new knowledge for predicting and diagnosing disease by revealing the relation between disease and various information features of data. These features are extracted by analyzing various clinical pathology data, such as EHR (electronic health records), and academic literature using the techniques of data analysis, natural language processing, etc. However, still needed are more research and interest in applying the latest advanced artificial intelligence-based data analysis technique to bio-signal data, which are continuous physiological records, such as EEG (electroencephalography) and ECG (electrocardiogram). Unlike the other types of data, applying deep learning to bio-signal data, which is in the form of time series of real numbers, has many issues that need to be resolved in preprocessing, learning, and analysis. Such issues include leaving feature selection, learning parts that are black boxes, difficulties in recognizing and identifying effective features, high computational complexities, etc. In this paper, to solve these issues, we provide an encoding-based Wave2vec time series classifier model, which combines signal-processing and deep learning-based natural language processing techniques. To demonstrate its advantages, we provide the results of three experiments conducted with EEG data of the University of California Irvine, which are a real-world benchmark bio-signal dataset. After converting the bio-signals (in the form of waves), which are a real number time series, into a sequence of symbols or a sequence of wavelet patterns that are converted into symbols, through encoding, the proposed model vectorizes the symbols by learning the sequence using deep learning-based natural language processing. The models of each class can be constructed through learning from the vectorized wavelet patterns and training data. The implemented models can be used for prediction and diagnosis of diseases by classifying the new data. The proposed method enhanced data readability and intuition of feature selection and learning processes by converting the time series of real number data into sequences of symbols. In addition, it facilitates intuitive and easy recognition, and identification of influential patterns. Furthermore, real-time large-capacity data analysis is facilitated, which is essential in the development of real-time analysis diagnosis systems, by drastically reducing the complexity of calculation without deterioration of analysis performance by data simplification through the encoding process.

However, the performance of many algorithms depends on identifying the target speaker to be enhanced. To identify the target speaker from single-trial EEG recordings in an acoustic scenario with two competing speakers, an auditory attention decoding (AAD) method was recently proposed. This AAD method however requires the clean speech signals of both the attended and the unattended speaker as reference signals for decoding. Since in practice only microphone signals, containing several undesired acoustic components, are available, in this paper we explore the potential of using steerable binaural superdirective beamformer for generating appropriate reference signals for decoding. The experimental results show that using steerable superdirective beamformer output signals improves the decoding performance compared to using the noisy microphone signals as reference signals.

We collected 18 sets of EEG records; each set containing 150 events of stimulation. In this work we focus on feature extraction algorithms. Particularly, we highlight Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) as a method of feature extraction. Based on these latter, different classifiers were trained in order to associate a set of signals to a previously learned human answer, pertaining to two classes: semantically related, or not semantically related. The results of classification accuracy were evaluated comparing with other four methods of feature extraction, and using classification algorithms from five different families. In all cases, classification accuracy was benefited from using CSP instead of FDTW, LPC, PCA or ICA for feature extraction. Particularly with the combination CSP-Naive Bayes we obtained the best average precision of 84.63%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

EEG signal detection and recognition is an important diagnostic method for epilepsy. Therefore, the classification of epileptic EEG has important medical diagnostic significance. Because the radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) has excellent approximation ability and generalization performance, it can directly identify EEG signals of different states. In this paper, the RBF-NN training algorithm is introduced to classify EEG signals. The classic RBF-NN is easy to over-fit for small samples and noisy datasets, resulting in a poor generalization ability of the trained RBF-NN. In this paper, the epsilon-insensitive learning measure and structural risk items are introduced to improve the robustness of the RBF-NN algorithm. In addition, due to the instability of the single classifier, an integrated epsilon-RBF-NN (I-epsilon-RBF-NN) is proposed. Compared with a single RBF-NN, this model improves the classification stability and accuracy of epileptic EEG signals. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to other algorithms in the classification of EEG datasets in terms of stability, training/testing accuracy and generalization.

The brain signal has five waves alpha, beta, delta, gamma, and theta. The five waves have their frequency to describe the level of attention, alertness, character and external stimuli. The five waves can be used to analyze stimulation patterns when turning left and right. Giving weight to the five brain waves utilizes genetic algorithms to get one signal. Genetic algorithms can be used to find the best signal for classification. In this paper, the EEG signal will be classified to determine the right or left movement pattern. After combining the five brain waves with genetic algorithms is then classified using the Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Neighbors Classifier, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes Gaussian, and Support Vector Machine. From the six methods above that have the highest accuracy is 56% and SVM is a method that has better accuracy than others on this problem.

Brain-Computer Interface with Corrupted EEG Data: a Tensor Completion Approach	COGNITIVE COMPUTATION			English	Article						Brain-computer interface; EEG; Tensor completion; Tensor decomposition; Missing samples	FACTORIZATION; MATRIX; DECOMPOSITION; OPTIMIZATION; BCI	One of the current issues in brain-computer interface (BCI) is how to deal with noisy electroencephalography (EEG) measurements organized as multidimensional datasets (tensors). On the other hand, recently, significant advances have been made in multidimensional signal completion algorithms that exploit tensor decomposition models to capture the intricate relationship among entries in a multidimensional signal. We propose to use tensor completion applied to EEG data for improving the classification performance in a motor imagery BCI system with corrupted measurements. Noisy measurements (electrode misconnections, subject movements, etc.) are considered as unknowns (missing samples) that are inferred from a tensor decomposition model (tensor completion). We evaluate the performance of four recently proposed tensor completion algorithms, CP-WOPT (Acar et al. Chemom Intell Lab Syst. 106:41-56, 2011), 3DPB-TC (Caiafa et al. 2013), BCPF (Zhao et al. IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell. 37(9):1751-1763, 2015), and HaLRT (Liu et al. IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell. 35(1):208-220, 2013), plus a simple interpolation strategy, first with random missing entries and then with missing samples constrained to have a specific structure (random missing channels), which is a more realistic assumption in BCI applications. We measured the ability of these algorithms to reconstruct the tensor from observed data. Then, we tested the classification accuracy of imagined movement in a BCI experiment with missing samples. We show that for random missing entries, all tensor completion algorithms can recover missing samples increasing the classification performance compared to a simple interpolation approach. For the random missing channels case, we show that tensor completion algorithms help to reconstruct missing channels, significantly improving the accuracy in the classification of motor imagery (MI), however, not at the same level as clean data. Summarizing, compared to the interpolation case, all tensor completion algorithms succeed to increase the classification performance by 7-9% (LDA-SVD) for random missing entries and 15-8% (LDA-SVD) for random missing channels. Tensor completion algorithms are useful in real BCI applications. The proposed strategy could allow using motor imagery BCI systems even when EEG data is highly affected by missing channels and/or samples, avoiding the need of new acquisitions in the calibration stage.

Artificial Neural Network Classification of Motor-Related EEG: An Increase in Classification Accuracy by Reducing Signal Complexity	COMPLEXITY			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; GENETIC ALGORITHM; CHANNEL SELECTION; IMAGERY; PERFORMANCE; FEATURES; PATTERN; TASK; BCI	We apply artificial neural network (ANN) for recognition and classification of electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns associated with motor imagery in untrained subjects. Classification accuracy is optimized by reducing complexity of input experimental data. From multichannel EEG recorded by the set of 31 electrodes arranged according to extended international 10-10 system, we select an appropriate type of ANN which reaches 80 +/- 10% accuracy for single trial classification. Then, we reduce the number of the EEG channels and obtain an appropriate recognition quality (up to 73 +/- 15%) using only 8 electrodes located in frontal lobe. Finally, we analyze the time-frequency structure of EEG signals and find that motor-related features associated with left and right leg motor imagery are more pronounced in the mu (8-13 Hz) and delta (1-5 Hz) brainwaves than in the high-frequency beta brainwave (15-30 Hz). Based on the obtained results, we propose further ANN optimization by preprocessing the EEG signals with a low-pass filter with different cutoffs. We demonstrate that the filtration of high-frequency spectral components significantly enhances the classification performance (up to 90 +/- 5% accuracy using 8 electrodes only). The obtained results are of particular interest for the development of brain-computer interfaces for untrained subjects.

In this paper, we propose a region-level bi-directional deep learning framework for EEG-based object classification. Inspired by the hemispheric lateralization of human brain, we propose to extract additional information at regional level to strengthen and emphasize the differences between two hemispheres. The bi-directional long short-term memory is used to capture the dynamic correlations hidden from both the past and the future to the current state in EEG sequence. Extensive experiments are carried out and our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Compared with the existing work, our framework achieves outstanding performances in EEG-based object classification task.

Evidence of emotion-antecedent appraisal checks in electroencephalography and facial electromyography	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EEG; CLASSIFICATION; RELEVANCE; DYNAMICS; NOVELTY	In the present study, we applied Machine Learning (ML) methods to identify psychobiological markers of cognitive processes involved in the process of emotion elicitation as postulated by the Component Process Model (CPM). In particular, we focused on the automatic detection of five appraisal checks-novelty, intrinsic pleasantness, goal conduciveness, control, and power-in electroencephalography (EEG) and facial electromyography (EMG) signals. We also evaluated the effects on classification accuracy of averaging the raw physiological signals over different numbers of trials, and whether the use of minimal sets of EEG channels localized over specific scalp regions of interest are sufficient to discriminate between appraisal checks. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on two data sets obtained from previous studies. Our results show that novelty and power appraisal checks can be consistently detected in EEG signals above chance level (binary tasks). For novelty, the best classification performance in terms of accuracy was achieved using features extracted from the whole scalp, and by averaging across 20 individual trials in the same experimental condition (UAR = 83.5 +/- 4.2; N = 25). For power, the best performance was obtained by using the signals from four pre-selected EEG channels averaged across all trials available for each participant (UAR = 70.6 +/- 5.3; N = 24). Together, our results indicate that accurate classification can be achieved with a relatively small number of trials and channels, but that averaging across a larger number of individual trials is beneficial for the classification for both appraisal checks. We were not able to detect any evidence of the appraisal checks under study in the EMG data. The proposed methodology is a promising tool for the study of the psychophysiological mechanisms underlying emotional episodes, and their application to the development of computerized tools (e.g., Brain-Computer Interface) for the study of cognitive processes involved in emotions.

It is unclear which findings on short-term routine EEG and which clinical parameters predict NCSE during subsequent CCEEG reliably. The aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic significance of changes within the first 30min of EEG as well as of clinical parameters for the occurrence of NCSE during subsequent CCEEG.MethodsSystematic analysis of the first 30min and the remaining segments of prospective CCEEG recordings according to the ACNS Standardized Critical Care EEG Terminology and according to recently proposed NCSE criteria as well as review of clinical parameters of 85 consecutive neurological critical care patients. Logistic regression and binary classification tests were used to determine the most useful parameters within the first 30min of EEG predicting subsequent NCSE.ResultsThe presence of early sporadic epileptiform discharges (SED) and early rhythmic or periodic EEG patterns of ictal-interictal uncertainty (RPPIIIU) (OR 15.51, 95% CI 2.83-84.84, p=0.002) and clinical signs of NCS (OR 18.43, 95% CI 2.06-164.62, p=0.009) predicted NCSE on subsequent CCEEG. Various combinations of early SED, early RPPIIIU, and clinical signs of NCS showed sensitivities of 79-100%, specificities of 49-89%, and negative predictive values of 95-100% regarding the incidence of subsequent NCSE (p<0.001).ConclusionsEarly SED and early RPPIIIU within the first 30min of EEG as well as clinical signs of NCS predict the occurrence of NCSE during subsequent CCEEG with high sensitivity and high negative predictive value and may be useful to select patients who should undergo CCEEG.

Unlike traditional offline learning, the degree of attention to online learning is could be determined by the human's will to learn. In this study, we show the classification of the attention and non-attention to lecture videos, using electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded from subjects who were instructed to watch a lecture through multimedia in various conditions. The experiment session was divided into 10-minute non-attention, 3-minute rest, and 10-minute attention. The EEG signal was obtained using three channel electrodes on a scalp and was preprocessed to extract the EEG power spectral density (PSD) features in five frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma). The extracted features were fed into classifiers to separate two conditions, while varying the length of time epoch. Classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), Ensemble, and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) were used to classify the attention and non-attention conditions. As a result, the main features for the optimal classification performance were from the delta and theta band PSDs, and the best classification accuracy was 72% for a test group.

Informative feature extraction and accurate classification of EEG patterns are considerably challenging because of the poor signal-to-noise ratio caused by volume conduction effects, interferences from various noises, and intrinsic signal nonstationarity. In this chapter, we provide a tutorial of applying Bayesian learning-based algorithms to EEG feature optimization and classification in BCI applications. The algorithm principles of Bayesian learning are detailedly explained in the aspects of prior designing, posterior inference, and hyperparameter estimation. With two representative examples based on event-related potential and sensorimotor rhythm BCI paradigms, we further introduce the usage of Bayesian learning-based algorithms for EEG analysis. Extensive experimental comparisons are carried out among different competing algorithms to validate the effectiveness of Bayesian learning in BCI applications. A discussion is provided on various extensions of Bayesian learning for exploring more complex but potentially important properties of EEG, toward improved performance of BCI systems.

Despite the well-documented individual differences in pain experience and brain responses, it still remains unclear how and to what extent these individual differences affect the performance of between-individual fMRI-based pain prediction. The present study is aimed to examine the relationship between individual differences in pain prediction models and between-individual prediction error, and, further, to identify brain regions that contribute to between-individual prediction error. To this end, we collected and analyzed fMRI data and pain ratings in a laser-evoked pain experiment. By correlating different types of individual difference metrics with between-individual prediction error, we are able to quantify the influence of these individual differences on prediction performance and reveal a set of brain regions whose activities are related to prediction error. Interestingly, we found that the precuneus, which does not have predictive capability to pain, could also affect the prediction error. This study elucidates the influence of interindividual variability in pain on the between-individual prediction performance, and the results will be useful for the design of more accurate and robust fMRI-based pain prediction models.

Visual identification of seizure activity from long-term electroencephalography (EEG) is tedious, time-consuming and leads to human error. Therefore, there is a need for an automated classification system. Methods: In this paper, we introduce a tool called CADFES: computerized automated detection of focal epileptic seizures. For the study, total 41.66 hours of EEG data from the Bern-Barcelona database was used. Set of 28 features were extracted from time, frequency, and statistical domain and significant features were selected using neighborhood component analysis (NCA). In NCA, optimization of regularization parameter ensured better classification accuracy (less classification loss) with seven features. The performance of the algorithm was assessed using support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), random forest and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) classifiers. Results: Experimental results revealed sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive rate, negative predictive rate, and area under the curve of 97.6%, 94.4%, 96.1%, 92.9%, 98.8% and 0.96 respectively using the SVM classifier. Finally, MATLAB based software tool referred to as CADFES was introduced for automated classification of focal and non-focal seizures. Comparison results ensure that proposed study is superior to existing methods. Hence, it is expected to perform better at the hospitals for automated classification of focal epileptic seizures in real-time. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is important to maintain good sleep efficiency because some problems occur when sleep efficiency is low. Sleep efficiency is calculated by the ratio of sleep stages. Sleep stages can be classified using Polysomnogram (PSG), which includes information of EEG, EMG and EOG. There have been many studies to classify sleep sleep stages automatically using EEG signal They, however, have difficulty in classifying several sleep stages because of the resemblance of EEG signals, especially, REM and Non-REM1 (N1) stage. We propose to use EMG signal in addition to EEG signal to improve the accuracy of sleep stage classification. EMG signal is useful for classifying REM stage and Non-REM stages. We propose a machine learning model of Support Vector Machine (SVM) using EEG and EMG signal The proposed model shows higher classification rate for REM and N1 stage than EEG only model.

We performed brain connectivity analysis with EEG to propose a brain functional network (BFN) and used a feature extraction algorithm for decoding the voluntary hand movement of a subject. By analyzing the characteristic parameters obtained from the BFN, we extracted the most important electrode nodes and frequencies for identifying the direction of movement of a hand. The results demonstrated that the most sensitive EEG components were for frequencies delta, theta, and gamma1 from electrodes F4, F8, C3, Cz, C4, CP4, T3, and T4. Finally, we proposed a model for decoding voluntary movement of the right hand by using a hierarchical linear model (HLM). Through a voluntary hand movement experiment in a spiral trajectory, the Poisson coefficient between the measurement trajectory and the decoding trajectory was used as a test standard to compare the HLM with the traditional multiple linear regression model. It was found that the decoding model based on the HLM obtained superior results. This paper contributes a feature extraction method based on brain connectivity analysis that can mine more comprehensive feature information related to a specific mental state of a subject. The decoding model based on the HLM possesses a strong structure for data manipulation that facilitates precise decoding.

Systems with such capabilities are generally referred to as cognitive cockpits. This article provides a description of the potential that is carried by such systems, especially in terms of increasing flight safety. Additionally, a neuropsychological background of the problem is presented. Conducted research was focused mainly on the problem of discrimination between states of brain activity related to idle but focused anticipation of visual cue and reaction to it. Especially, a problem of selecting a proper classification algorithm for such problems is being examined. For that purpose an experiment involving 10 subjects was planned and conducted. Experimental electroencephalographic data was acquired using an Emotiv EPOC+ headset. Proposed methodology involved use of a popular method in biomedical signal processing, the Common Spatial Pattern, extraction of bandpower features, and an extensive test of different classification algorithms, such as Linear Discriminant Analysis, k-nearest neighbors, and Support Vector Machines with linear and radial basis function kernels, Random Forests, and Artificial Neural Networks.

Several attempt to use EMG-based pattern recognition ( PR) failed due to insufficient myoelectric signals from the residual limb to perform control functions. The EEG activity recorded from human scalp is used to control the movement of a robotic arm. This can either be achieved when the arm is attached to or separated from the amputee stump by interfacing the brain directly to the robotic arm through the brain-machine interface ( BMI). To build an intelligent robotic ( or prosthetics) system that will manipulate object seamlessly with multiple degrees of freedom ( DoF), it is required that a robust learning algorithm which is able to control the prosthetic arm while interacting with the environment should be implemented. However, the conventional machine learning approach of using handcrafted features to design a robot controller that can perform multiple task is not a feasible option. Hence, we propose a robust learning control which is based on unsupervised learning algorithm of deep autoencoder. We applied stacked autoencoder to generate our features, and softmax layer is then used to classify five different motor imagery tasks. The proposed method produced an overall accuracy of 98.9% across the four amputees recruited for the experiments. Our algorithm shows a better performance when compared with the state-of-the art classifiers. Thus, the proposed results demonstrates the possibility of providing better control performance for EEG-based prosthesis.

On the Classification of SSVEP-Based Dry-EEG Signals via Convolutional Neural Networks	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 07-10, 2018	IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc, Miyazaki, JAPAN	IEEE, Sci Council Japan	IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc		BCI	Electroencephalography (EEG) is a common signal acquisition approach employed for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) research. Nevertheless, the majority of EEG acquisition devices rely on the cumbersome application of conductive gel (so-called wet-EEG) to ensure a high quality signal is obtained. However, this process is unpleasant for the experimental participants and thus limits the practical application of BCI. In this work, we explore the use of a commercially available dry-EEG headset to obtain visual cortical ensemble signals. Whilst improving the usability of EEG within the BCI context, dry-EEG suffers from inherently reduced signal quality due to the lack of conduit gel, making the classification of such signals significantly more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach for the classification of raw dry-EEG signals without any data pre-processing. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we utilise the Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) paradigm as our use case. SSVEP can be utilised to allow people with severe physical disabilities such as Complete Locked-In Syndrome or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis to be aided via BCI applications, as it requires only the subject to fixate upon the sensory stimuli of interest. Here we utilise SSVEP flicker frequencies between 10 to 30 Hz, which we record as subject cortical waveforms via the dry-EEG headset. Our proposed end-to-end CNN allows us to automatically and accurately classify SSVEP stimulation directly from the dry-EEG waveforms. Our CNN architecture utilises a common SSVEP Convolutional Unit (SCU), comprising of a 1D convolutional layer, batch normalization and max pooling. Furthermore, we compare several deep learning neural network variants with our primary CNN architecture, in addition to traditional machine learning classification approaches. Experimental evaluation shows our CNN architecture to be significantly better than competing approaches, achieving a classification accuracy of 96% whilst demonstrating superior cross-subject performance and even being able to generalise well to unseen subjects whose data is entirely absent from the training process.

Long-term emotional problems tend to cause physical and mental problems such as depression. The photoplethysmogram(PPG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) etc are often used for emotion recognition, because the emotional state produces reactions from different biological systems of the human body. This article uses an internationally released emotional classification database called DEAP dataset that contains 32-channel standard EEG signals and 8-channel peripheral physiological signals. To achieve wearable emotion continuous recognition, this paper strives to obtain satisfactory emotion recognition through fewer EEG channels and peripheral physiological signals. Machine learning methods are used to classify arousal and valence that are often used in emotional recognition. The results show that the arousal classification accuracy can achieve 68% and the valence classification accuracy can achieve 66% with 5 channel EEG signal and one channel PPG signal, which can be monitored through a wearable headband.

Finding an effective channel composition in a BCI system is important for parsing the complexity of these systems. In this study, several statistical methods based on an energy extraction method were used to automatically detect the composition of selected channels. We introduce four techniques for automatic channel selection to optimize the energy extraction method, such as mean, high mean, box, and high in box. The performance of all of the proposed techniques was evaluated based on performance accuracy, compression ratio, and channel mapping on a brain scalp. The performance of the proposed BCI framework was compared against a BCI framework that used a manual technique as the energy extraction method. The proposed BCI framework system used a conventional common spatial pattern (CSP) to extract features from two-class motor imagery EEG signals before employing extreme learning machine (ELM) to classify the features of the EEG signal. As a result, the proposed automatic channel selection methods were found effective in finding optimal channels and provided better performance accuracy. In general, the proposed method improved the conventional BCI performance by up to 16% accuracy and 87% channel compression size. Besides that, the automatic technique also yielded better BCI performance accuracy of up to 5% compared to the BCI system that used the manual technique of energy extraction as its EEG channel selection method.

A standard dataset DEAP (Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals) Dataset is used for studying and analyzing the human emotions using EEG signals. Participants are shown various videos across multiple trials and their corresponding EEG signals are recorded. The emotional states are classified on the basis of various parameters such as arousal, valence, dominance, and liking for a particular set of video. After relevant pre-processing and noise removal a 3D Emotional model is constructed. The 3D Emotional Model comprising of 8 octants within a Valence-Arousal-Dominance space gives rises to 8 different emotional states namely relaxed, peaceful, bored, disgust, nervous, sad, surprised and excited. The resultant emotional state obtained provides useful insight into the thinking and behaviour of participants in certain scenarios. The EEG based emotional classification can aid the developers to provide relevant recommendations to the user on the basis of his emotional state. Machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) when applied to the proposed 3D Emotional model classifies the emotion aptly with an accuracy of 78.06% and 58.90% respectively.

There are over 33 000 people in the US living with complete tetraplegia due to spinal cord injury (SCI). People with complete tetraplegia rank restoration of hand and arm function as their highest priority, as it would offer greater independence and improved quality of life. In this study, we show that subjects with chronic (>1-year post-injury) C5 or C6 level, motor-complete SCI are able to control a brain computer interface-functional electrical stimulation (BCI-FES) system to enable hand opening and closing. Methods: 8 subjects with C5 or C6 motor-level SCI and 6 uninjured, control subjects participated in 6 sessions of BCI-FES sessions. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were acquired using a wireless EEG system and subjects were asked to 'imagine moving their right hand' for motor imagery. Average power was extracted in 5Hz bins (6-35 Hz) from C3, C1, Cz, C2, and C4 electrodes and input as features to a support vector machine classification algorithm. When 'movement intention' was classified correctly from the motor imagery period, a custom-designed stimulation sequence was delivered to the forearm muscles via surface electrodes to enable opening and closing of the hand. Results: Average online decoding accuracy during the closed-loop BCI-FES sessions was similar for the SCI (74.8% +/- 17.76) and the control (75.5% +/- 11.94) group. Online decoding accuracies were validated using Monte Carlo simulations that used 30%, 50%, and 70% training data to validate the decoded online accuracy and Wilcoxon rank sum test found no significant differences between the SCI and Control subjects. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that subjects with motor complete, cervical SCI were able to control a BCI-FES system with decoding accuracies similar to healthy controls after minimal BCI-training. Non-invasive BCI-FES systems may have the potential to restore hand function in people with motor-complete SCI to improve their quality of life.

This irregularity, which arises from i.i.d. measurement noise, has been partially resolved by memoryless classifiers, such as deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, there are other major sources of irregularity, including brain network modes, mental states, and various physiological factors. These internal states drift over time, in which case it would be better to use memory-based neural networks, such as long short-term memory networks (LSTM). This paper presents a novel EEG signal classification framework that resolves a trade-off between memoryless and memory-based classification. The proposed method uses deep reinforcement learning (RL) to find a trial-by-trial control strategy for the attention control system that switches between CNN (memoryless) and LSTM (memory-based)-or is a mixture of both. The simulation on the EEG dataset, which was collected while performing a complex cognitive task, shows that the proposed attention control system outperforms other EEG classification methods.

In this paper, we propose an automated method for the classification of seizure and non-seizure EEG signals using FAWT and entropy-based features such as Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE) entropy, log energy entropy, and Shannon entropy. The obtained features are given as input to robust energy-based least squares twin support vector machines (RELS-TSVM) for classification.

Our study focuses on the recognition of valence and arousal levels using such sensors. Usually, ad hoc features are extracted for such recognition tasks. In this paper, we rely on automatic feature learning techniques instead. Our main contribution is the use of Group Nonnegative Matrix Factorization in a multi-task fashion, where we exploit both valence and arousal labels to control valence-related and arousal-related feature learning. Applying this method on HCI MAHNOB and EMOEEG, two databases where emotions are elicited by means of audiovisual stimuli and performing binary inter-session classification of valence labels, we obtain significant improvement of valence classification F1 scores in comparison to baseline frequency-band power features computed on predefined frequency bands. The valence classification F1 score is improved from 0.56 to 0.69 in the case of HCI MAHNOB, and from 0.56 to 0.59 in the case of EMOEEG.

The study works to decode the content of object image from EEG recorded while the subjects are looking at images. The identification system is developed based on the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Inspired by the cognitive science, features from multiple stages in LSTM network are utilized to discriminate EEG. The proposed method reduces the dependence on the high density recording EEG and obtains an accuracy of 96.2% for 40 categories.

Single-Trial EEG Analysis Predicts Memory Retrieval and Reveals Source-Dependent Differences	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG; memory retrieval; old/new effect; multi-variate analysis; prediction	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RECOGNITION MEMORY; EXPLICIT MEMORY; FAMILIARITY; RECOLLECTION; CLASSIFICATION; STRENGTH; IMPLICIT	We used pattern classifiers to extract features related to recognition memory retrieval from the temporal information in single-trial electroencephalography (EEG) data during attempted memory retrieval. Two-class classification was conducted on correctly remembered trials with accurate context (or source) judgments vs. correctly rejected trials. The average accuracy for datasets recorded in a single session was 61% while the average accuracy for datasets recorded in two separate sessions was 56%. To further understand the basis of the classifier's performance, two other pattern classifiers were trained on different pairs of behavioral conditions. The first of these was designed to use information related to remembering the item and the second to use information related to remembering the contextual information (or source) about the item. Mollison and Curran (2012) had earlier shown that subjects' familiarity judgments contributed to improved memory of spatial contextual information but not of extrinsic associated color information. These behavioral results were similarly reflected in the event-related potential (ERP) known as the FN400 (an early frontal effect relating to familiarity) which revealed differences between correct and incorrect context memories in the spatial but not color conditions. In our analyses we show that a classifier designed to distinguish between correct and incorrect context memories, more strongly involves early activity (400-500 ms) over the frontal channels for the location distinctions, than for the extrinsic color associations. In contrast, the classifier designed to classify memory for the item (without memory for the context), had more frontal channel involvement for the color associated experiments than for the spatial experiments. Taken together these results argue that location may be bound more tightly with the item than an extrinsic color association. The multivariate classification approach also showed that trial-by-trial variation in EEG corresponding to these ERP components were predictive of subjects' behavioral responses. Additionally, the multivariate classification approach enabled analysis of error conditions that did not have sufficient trials for standard ERP analyses. These results suggested that false alarms were primarily attributable to item memory (as opposed to memory of associated context), as commonly predicted, but with little previous corroborating EEG evidence.

Deep-learning techniques are able to learn complex feature representations from raw signals and thus also have potential to improve signal processing in the context of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, they typically require large amounts of data for training - much more than what can often be provided with reasonable effort when working with brain activity recordings of any kind. In order to still leverage the power of deep-learning techniques with limited available data, special care needs to be taken when designing the BCI task, defining the structure of the deep model, and choosing the training method. This chapter presents example approaches for the specific scenario of music-based brain-computer interaction through electroencephalography - in the hope that these will prove to be valuable in different settings as well. We explain important decisions for the design of the BCI task and their impact on the models and training techniques that can be used. Furthermore, we present and compare various pre-training techniques that aim to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we discuss approaches to interpret the trained models.

Unfortunately, a few studies have fully utilized feature selection and ensemble learning. In this paper, we present an adaptive hybrid feature selection-based classifier ensemble (AHFSE) for epileptic seizure classification. The AHFSE creates new sample subsets in every bootstrap using adaptive hybrid feature selection. It combines them using rank aggregation to obtain a distinguished subset of features. These new samples subsets are then fed into a classifier. Finally, majority voting is used to complete the detection and classification tasks. The AHFSE is designed to obtain an optimized subset of features based on the different samples in every bootstrap, which have a tendency to generate different results with respect to rank aggregation. With discrete wavelet transform, the experiments based on binary and multi-class tasks show that the AHFSE performs well on the Bonn data set and improves the specificity, sensitivity, or accuracy of the selected features by combining the subsets of different feature selections to obtain new samples within the bagging process. Furthermore, the adaptive process helps the framework obtain the optimum combination of the feature selection algorithm. The AHFSE also obtains more desirable final results in several perspectives, such as: 1) compared with other feature selection methods; 2) compared with other ensemble methods; and 3) compared with other research that uses discrete wavelet transform as a preprocessing step.

The new technology of emotion recognition using physiological signal is based on pattern recognition and classification problem that is well described in this paper. A very famous dataset of EEG signals for emotion recognition known as DEAP dataset is used and three categories of features, time domain features, frequency domain features and entropy based features has been extracted. Classification through support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN) and Naive bayes (NB) has been done. Performance of system is observed by the parameters like, classification accuracy, precision and recall. After performance observation, it is found that ANN gives the best performance with all types of features. Highest classification accuracy achieved by ANN for said dataset, entropy based features and implementation is 93.75 percent.

It often requires long training session for collecting a large amount of EEG data which makes user exhausted. One of the approaches to shorten this session is utilizing the instances from past users to train the learner for the novel user. In this work, direct transferring from past users is investigated and applied to multiclass motor imagery BCI. Then, active learning (AL) driven informative instance transfer learning has been attempted for multiclass BCI. Informative instance transfer shows better performance than direct instance transfer which reaches the benchmark using a reduced amount of training data (49% less) in cases of 6 out of 9 subjects. However, none of these methods has superior performance for all subjects in general. To get a generic transfer learning framework for BCI, an optimal ensemble of informative and direct transfer methods is designed and applied. The optimized ensemble outperforms both direct and informative transfer method for all subjects except one in BCI competition IV multiclass motor imagery dataset. It achieves the benchmark performance for 8 out of 9 subjects using average 75% less training data. Thus, the requirement of large training data for the new user is reduced to a significant amount.

The multichannel EEG signal is recorded during different listening conditions such as silent, music, noise, ANC with background noise and ANC with both background noise and music. The multiscale analysis of EEG signal of each channel is performed using the discrete wavelet transform. The multivariate multiscale matrices are formulated based on the sub-band signals of each EEG channel. The singular value decomposition is applied to the multivariate matrices of multichannel EEG at significant scales. The singular value features at significant scales and the extreme learning machine classifier with three different activation functions are used for classification of multichannel EEG signal. The experimental results demonstrate that, for ANC with noise and ANC with noise and music classes, the proposed method has sensitivity values of 75.831% (p < 0.001) and 99.31% (p < 0.001), respectively. The method has an accuracy value of 83.22% for the classification of EEG signal with music and ANC with music as stimuli. The important finding of this study is that by the introduction of ANC, music can be better perceived by the human brain.

A new method is designed to detect seizure EEG signals by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and sparse representation. First of all, the EMD method is used to process EEG signals for generating IMFs. Then frequency features of IMFs are extracted as the dictionary in sparse representation based classification (SRC) scheme to realize reduction of the data dimension and calculation cost. Finally, the KSVD is exploited to optimize dictionary. It has been showed that the algorithm can well detect the seizure EEG signals and the accuracy is up to 99%. Furthermore, the quick speed makes the method practical for the treatment of epilepsy in practice.

The proposed method has three main strengths: it has low computational cost, making it suitable for real-time implementation in EEG devices; it performs detection separately for each brain rhythm or EEG spectral band, following the current medical practices; and it can be trained with small datasets, which is key in clinical problems where there is limited annotated data available. This is in sharp contrast with modern approaches based on machine learning techniques, which achieve very high sensitivity and specificity but require large training sets with expert annotations that may not be available. The proposed method proceeds by first separating EEG signals into their five brain rhythms by using a wavelet filter bank. Each brain rhythm signal is then mapped to a low-dimensional manifold by using a generalized Gaussian statistical model; this dimensionality reduction step is computationally straight-forward and greatly improves supervised classification performance in problems with little training data available. Finally, this is followed by parallel linear classifications on the statistical manifold to detect if the signals exhibit healthy or abnormal brain activity in each spectral band. The good performance of the proposed method is demonstrated with an application to paediatric neurology using 39 EEG recordings from the Children's Hospital Boston database, where it achieves an average sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 88%, and detection latency of 4 s, performing similarly to the best approaches from the literature.

Such supervised machine learning algorithms require large training sets that have been manually labelled, and are time- and resource-consuming to acquire. Here we present a semi-supervised approach that can learn to distinguish the sleep stages from a one-night data set where only a fraction has been manually labelled. We show that for fractions larger than 50%, our semi-supervised approach performs as good as a similar, fully-supervised model.	[Munk, A. M.; Olesen, K. V.; Gangstad, S. W.; Hansen, L.

Conventional connectivity analysis is usually conducted at the scalp-level and in an unsupervised manner. However, due to the volume conduction effect, EEG data suffer from lowsignal-to-noise ratio and poor spatial resolution. Thus, it is hard to effectively identify the task-related connectivity pattern at the scalp-level using unsupervised method. There exist extensive discriminative spatial filtering methods for different BCI paradigms. However, in conventional spatial filter optimization methods, signal correlations or connectivities are not taken into consideration in the objective functions. To address the issue, in this work, we propose a discriminative connectivity pattern-learning method. In the proposed framework, EEG correlations are used as the features, with which Fisher's ratio objective function is adopted to optimize spatial filters. The proposed method is evaluated with a binary motor imagery EEG dataset. Experimental results show that more connectivity information are maintained with the proposed method, and classification accuracies yielded by the proposed method are comparable to conventional discriminative spatial filtering method.

In view of the limitations of individual differences leading to reduce the accuracy of fatigue assessment, this paper proposed a method for driving fatigue assessment based on the feature fusion and transfer learning of electroencephalogram(EEG) and electromyography(EMG). The EEG and cervical EMG signals from 20 healthy subjects were recruited synchronously using the simulated driving platform. The time-frequency analysis method was used to extract the fatigue characteristics of EEG signals and EMG signals. A driver fatigue assessment model based on feature fusion and transfer learning was constructed to achieve effective identification of different drivers' fatigue state. The results showed that the recognition rate of driving fatigue based on the feature fusion and transfer learning of EEG and EMG was higher than traditional support vector machine method, and it could improve the robustness of driving fatigue assessment in different subjects. Therefore, this paper provides a new method for practical application of driving fatigue assessment based on physiological signal.

Speech Imagery concept will be useful for patients with neurological disorders for decoding their thoughts and possibly convert their thought to speech through some external medium. In this paper Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were acquired from two healthy subjects while speaking and imagining of speaking five consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words in multiple trials of different time frames. Each trial was carried out for five times during both the tasks. The acquired EEG signals wereanalyzed in frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform and the power spectral densities for each band were derived. Based on the derived absolute power, relative spectral powers were computed for each EEG frequency band during speaking and imagining of speaking. Relative powers for both inter and intra hemispheric frontal and temporal electrodes were analyzed as these electrodes are located near Broca's and Wernicke's area. From theresults it was inferred that relative power of theta band was found to be high while imagining of speaking a CVC word and similarly relative power of alpha band was found to be dominant while speaking a CVC word. It has also been observed that averaged relative power of left hemispheric frontal and temporal electrodes was increasing progressively as the resting time for the task is increased. Comparatively the averaged relative power was found to be higher than the relative power of a single trial. This work will be clinically useful for speech impaired people as it is feasible to recognize the word from these signal processing methods.

The proposed seizure prediction algorithm is patient-specific since generalization showed no satisfactory results in our previous studies. The algorithm is tested on CHB-MIT database comprised of EEG data from pediatric epileptic patients. Based on relations to number of seizures and number of files, gender and age, three patients have been chosen for this study. The special majority voting algorithm is proposed and used for raising an alarm of upcoming seizure. EEG signals are denoised using MSPCA (Multiscale PCA), the features were extracted by WPD (wavelet packet decomposition), and EEG signals were classified using Rotation Forest. The significance of the study lies in the fact that the proposed seizure prediction algorithm could be used in novel diagnostic and therapeutic applications for pediatric patients.

Hitherto, there is no clear objective markers from Polysomnography (PSG) signal to characterize insomnia. Although linear methods like spectral analysis of EEG frequency bands have been used to detect physiological arousal in patients with insomnia, these methods may not be sufficient enough to extract valuable information and detect abnormalities in the signals. The EEG signal itself originate from a complex neuronal activity in the brain, therefore the use of nonlinear measures may show some hidden information that could better explain the activation of this hyperarousal. The aim of the present study is to classify the primary insomnia patient from the healthy based on the supervised learning machine technique of SVM and the usage of nonlinear features of EEG signal.

However, existing methods lack guidelines in their manner of addressing the problem. Most of the current adaptive techniques simply handle challenges at hand by dynamically adjusting the machine to signal variability, often not entirely taking into account the human factors. To our knowledge, there has not been any work done in creating a taxonomy for adaptive BCIs, one that acknowledges and arranges known BCI components in a comprehensive and structured way. We propose a conceptual framework that encompasses adaptation approaches for both the user and the machine, that is, using instructional design observations as well as the usual machine learning techniques. This framework not only provides a coherent review of such extensive literature but also allows the readers to clearly visualize which component is being adapted and for what reason. Moreover, it enables the readers to perceive gaps in current BCIs and grasp the adaptive system in its entirety. Our proposal hopefully contributes as a guideline for a computational implementation of a fully adaptive BCI and an overall improvement.

Evaluating spiking neural models in the classification of motor imagery EEG signals using short calibration sessions	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						EEG classification; Izhikevich spiking neuron model; Pattern recognition; Coherence; Particle swarm optimization	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; CHANNEL SELECTION; NETWORK MODELS; CHALLENGES; COHERENCE; INTEGRATE; EPILEPSY; NEURONS	Since the emergence of brain computer interface (BCI), several methods have been applied to associate an electroencephalographic (EEG) recording with a specific mental task. Particularly, in the classification stage, several techniques such as linear Fisher discriminant (LD), feed-forward artificial neural networks (FNN) and radial basis function neural networks (RBF) have been applied successfully with BCI applications. However, in BCI applications, there is a challenge related to avoid long and tedious calibration session for users, this implies that the classification techniques used during the classification stage, have to be trained with a reduced number of EEG recordings. However, most of the classification techniques require several samples to learn accurately an association with a particular mental task. Since the spiking neural models (SNM) have shown their robustness in pattern recognition problems, this paper is focused on demonstrating that they are potential alternatives to classify EEG recordings when they are trained with a reduced number of data samples. To do that, we computed the coherence from a subset of three electrodes to obtain the feature vector of each EEG recording. Then, this information was classified using the SNM. In order to evaluate the robustness, the SNM was trained varying the number of samples. Furthermore, based on the performance and the confidence interval achieved in the classification, we developed two indexes to evaluate and compare the SNM against LD, FNN and RBF. The experimental results over the Ma, IVa and V data sets from BCI International Competition III, suggest that the SNM are the best option to avoid long calibration sessions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The process of arbitration between MB and MF is thought to be located in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and frontopolar cortex. These loci are near the cortex, so we expect the related information can be represented in EEG signals. However, EEG signal patterns considering the arbitration of RL has not been investigated. In this paper, we tested a EEG-based classification model to separate these two different types of trials, each of which is meant to promote MB and MF RL. We found, for the first time, firm evidence to indicate that information pertaining to learning strategies is represented in prefrontal EEG signals.

Its prognosis through modern technologies is the need of the day, which is attaining worldwide attention in research community with the use oflatest technologies like internet of things, machine learning and cloud computing. This paper presents a model of automatic epileptic seizure detection model using Stacked Autoencoders based deep learning approach, which is an advanced form of machine leaning, employed for effectively handling the problem of big data with reduced complexity and processing time and to make this process more real time compatible with least delays. This model processes the sensed EEG signals by breaking it into short duration segments. Then, these EEG segments are fed to Stacked Autoencoders for its classification into different epileptic seizure stages like normal, preictal and ictal. The performance of this model has been compared with other existing models consisting of higher order spectral analysis based feature extraction and classification using traditional machine learning algorithms like Bayes Net, Naive Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron, Radial basis function neural networks and C4.5 decision tree classifier. The analysis of performance through simulation results reveal that Stacked Autoencoders based deep learning approach is an efficient model for real time automatic epileptic seizures detection at early stage with classification accuracy 88.8%, sensitivity 89.44%, specificity 93.77% values and least value of processing time, which is approximately 23 times lesser than that of models utilizing traditional higher order statistics feature extraction and machine learning based classification approaches.

To enable a DoA to monitor the correct estimation across a range of patients, a novel feature extraction along with machine learning processor is utilized. The decisions are solely based on seven features extracted from EEG along with the EMG signal for motion artifacts rejection. To extract the features efficiently on hardware, a 128-point FFT is proposed that achieves an area reduction and energy/FFT-operation by 39% and 58%, respectively, compared to the conventional. A simple decision tree is used to perform a multiclass DoA classification. The system is synthesized using a 65nm process and experimental verification is done using FPGA based on the subset of patients from the University of Queensland Vital Signs. The proposed patient-specific DoA classification processor achieves a classification accuracy of 79%.

We sought to test the performance of three strategies for binary classification (logistic regression, support vector machines, and deep learning) for the problem of predicting successful episodic memory encoding using direct brain recordings obtained from human stereo EEG subjects. We also sought to test the impact of applying t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) for unsupervised dimensionality reduction, as well as testing the effect of reducing input features to a core set of memory relevant brain areas. This work builds upon published efforts to develop a closed-loop stimulation device to improve memory performance. Approach. We used a unique data set consisting of 30 stereo EEG patients with electrodes implanted into a core set of five common brain regions (along with other areas) who performed the free recall episodic memory task as brain activity was recorded. Using three different machine learning strategies, we trained classifiers to predict successful versus unsuccessful memory encoding and compared the difference in classifier performance (as measured by the AUC) at the subject level and in aggregate across modalities. We report the impact of feature reduction on the classifiers, including reducing the number of input brain regions, frequency bands, and the impact of tSNE. Results. Deep learning classifiers outperformed both support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regression (LR). A priori selection of core brain regions also improved classifier performance for LR and SVM models, especially when combined with tSNE. Significance. We report for the first time a direct comparison among traditional and deep learning methods of binary classification to the problem of predicting successful memory encoding using human brain electrophysiological data. Our findings will inform the design of brain machine interface devices to affect memory processing.

The research reveals that brain activity is monitored through electroencephalogram (EEG) of patients suffered from seizure to detect the epileptic seizure. The performance of EEG detection based epilepsy require feature extracting strategies. In this research, we have extracted varying features extracting strategies based on time and frequency domain characteristics, nonlinear, wavelet based entropy and few statistical features. A deeper study was undertaken using novel machine learning classifiers by considering multiple factors. The support vector machine kernels are evaluated based on multiclass kernel and box constraint level. Likewise, for K-nearest neighbors (KNN), we computed the different distance metrics, Neighbor weights and Neighbors. Similarly, the decision trees we tuned the paramours based on maximum splits and split criteria and ensemble classifiers are evaluated based on different ensemble methods and learning rate. For training/testing tenfold Cross validation was employed and performance was evaluated in form of TPR, NPR, PPV, accuracy and AUC. In this research, a deeper analysis approach was performed using diverse features extracting strategies using robust machine learning classifiers with more advanced optimal options. Support Vector Machine linear kernel and KNN with City block distance metric give the overall highest accuracy of 99.5% which was higher than using the default parameters for these classifiers. Moreover, highest separation (AUC = 0.9991, 0.9990) were obtained at different kernel scales using SVM. Additionally, the K-nearest neighbors with inverse squared distance weight give higher performance at different Neighbors. Moreover, to distinguish the postictal heart rate oscillations from epileptic ictal subjects, and highest performance of 100% was obtained using different machine learning classifiers.

However, because of the weakness and randomness of EEG signal, it is very complicated and difficult to process and identify the EEG signal recorded by the non-invasive BCI, and the decoding error often occurs. In view of the brain electrical signal decoding error, an experimental paradigm for simultaneous acquisition of spontaneous EEG and evoked EEG was designed, where the subjects generated the error-related potentials (ErrP) based on the decoded feedback of motor imagery EEG. We analyzed the EEG signal two times. The motor imagery EEG, which was the component of the EEG signal, was analyzed at the first time analysis. We classified the motor imagery EEG signal of left and right hand, then analyzed the classification method quantitatively using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC). Although the EEG signal were influenced greatly by the individual difference, the AUC values can still reach more than 0.7. Meanwhile, the frequency domain characteristics were analyzed. The activation brain regions of the left-right hand motor imagery are mainly concentrated in the area of the perceptual motor cortex where is responsible for hand motion, but they will also be influenced by the artifacts of the surrounding channels. In the second time analysis, the ErrP was extracted and discussed. Its latency, waveform and amplitude characteristics were studied in the time domain and then a suitable classifier is selected by comparing a variety of classifiers, which classification accuracy is up to 90%. Therefore, the research based on the ErrP signal played a theoretical foundation for applying to the lower limb exoskeleton rehabilitation robot in the future, and ensured the feasibility of applying the command confirmation unit based on ErrP signal to the exoskeleton rehabilitation robot.

It is elicited by visual stimuli and used by a brain-computer interface (BCI) known as the P300 speller for character input. However, EEG traces are generally very noisy and can bury the characteristic component in the noise, so various feature extraction methods have been used to extract such features from EEG results. In this paper, we investigate the discriminating P300 potentials using a convolutional neural network (CNN), a widely-used image processing tool. We also consider weighted ensemble learning combining a CNN, stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA), and a support vector machine (SVM), with the aim of improving the P300 detection accuracy.

On imagining a limb's movement, the primary motor cortex area is prominently activated. For our new paradigm, however, we do not know which positions are activated or not. In that case, a simple approach is to use as many electrodes as possible. The problemis that using many electrodes also causes other problems. When applying a common spatial pattern (CSP), which is an EEG extraction method, using many electrodes causes an overfitting problem. In addition, there is difficulty using this technique for medical analysis. To overcome these problems, we suggest an optimal electrode selection method using binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) with a channel impact factor. We examined optimal selected electrodes among all electrodes using four optimization methods and compared the classification accuracy and the number of selected electrodes between BPSO, BPSO with a channel impact factor, a genetic algorithm (GA), and a harmony search (HS) using a support vector machine (SVM). The results showed that BPSO with a channel impact factor selected five fewer electrodes and even improved accuracy by 20.4% compared with HS, GA, and BPSO. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

J	Wei, W; Jia, QX; Feng, YL; Chen, G				Wei, Wei; Jia, Qingxuan; Feng, Yongli; Chen, Gang			Emotion Recognition Based on Weighted Fusion Strategy of Multichannel Physiological Signals	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION	Emotion recognition is an important pattern recognition problem that has inspired researchers for several areas. Various data from humans for emotion recognition have been developed, including visual, audio, and physiological signals data. This paper proposes a decision-level weight fusion strategy for emotion recognition in multichannel physiological signals. Firstly, we selected four kinds of physiological signals, including Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), Respiration Amplitude (RA), and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). And various analysis domains have been used in physiological emotion features extraction. Secondly, we adopt feedback strategy for weight definition, according to recognition rate of each emotion of each physiological signal based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier independently. Finally, we introduce weight in decision level by linear fusing weight matrix with classification result of each SVM classifier. The experiments on the MAHNOB-HCI database show the highest accuracy. The results also provide evidence and suggest a way for further developing a more specialized emotion recognition system based on multichannel data using weight fusion strategy.

This pattern consists of alternations between activation and quiescent phases. An automatic cyclic alternating pattern detection method is proposed, having the advantage, over other previously proposed methods, of being featureless. Therefore, there is no need to handcraft features and employ a feature selection procedure. A Deep Auto Encoder is used for automatic feature extraction and classification of the activation phases. A shallow Artificial Neural Network is then employed for cyclic alternating pattern classification using the output of the Deep Auto Encoder. These two-cascaded networks are connected by a memory buffer. Both networks are optimized using a heuristic approach and Kolmogorov's Mapping theorem. A public database with 14 subjects is used to test the methods. For the activation phase classification, a 2 seconds raw EEG is used as an input of the Deep Auto Encoder. For the cyclic alternating pattern classifier, the whole memory buffer is used as input. The accuracy of activation phase detection is 67.2% and the accuracy of cyclic alternating pattern detection is 61.5%.

In this paper, a passive brain computer interface for monitoring mental attention state of human individuals by using electroencephalographic (EEG) brain activity imaging is developed using a machine learning data analysis method Support Vector Machine. Also a mental state detection system using EEG data is evolved as well. It has been determined that changes in EEG activity in the frontal and parietal lobes occurring in the 1-5 Hz and 1015 Hz frequency bands are associated with changes in attention state. Such changes were detected with 90% to 95% accuracy in experimental settings. The results of the work done will guide the design of future systems to monitor the status of the operators via EEG brain activity data.

Combination of Clinical Exam, MRI and EEG to Predict Outcome Following Cardiac Arrest and Targeted Temperature Management	NEUROCRITICAL CARE			English	Article						Cardiac arrest; Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) imaging; Fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging; Continuous EEG	APPARENT DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENT; THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA; COMATOSE SURVIVORS; PROGNOSTIC VALUE; TIME-COURSE; BRAIN; RESUSCITATION; SOCIETY	BackgroundDespite the widespread adoption of targeted temperature management (TTM), coma after cardiac arrest remains a common problem with a high proportion of patients suffering substantial disability. Prognostication after cardiac arrest, particularly the identification of patients with likely good outcome, remains difficult.MethodsWe performed a retrospective study of 78 patients who underwent TTM after cardiac arrest and were evaluated with both electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We hypothesized that combining malignant versus non-malignant EEG classification with clinical exam and quantitative analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging would improve prognostic ability.ResultsConsistent with prior literature, presence of a malignant EEG pattern was 100% specific for poor outcome. We found that decreased whole brain ADC signal intensity was associated with poor outcome (85314 vs. 950 +/- 17.5mm(2)/s, p<0.0001). Less than 15% total brain volume with ADC signal intensity <650mm(2)/s was predictive of good outcome with 100% sensitivity, 51% specificity and an area under the curve of 0.787. A model combining this ADC marker with non-malignant EEG and flexor-or-better motor response was 100% sensitive and 91.1% specific for good outcome following cardiac arrest and targeted temperature management.ConclusionWe conclude that in the absence of malignant EEG findings, combination of physical exam and MRI findings can be a useful to identify those patients who have potential for recovery. Variability in timing of imaging and findings in different modalities argue for the need for future prospective studies of multimodal outcome prediction after cardiac arrest.

In this paper, we propose a support vector machine-based processing pipeline to identify different cognitive phenotypes associated with atypical emotional processing, based on canonical correlation analysis of EEG network features, and cognitive and behavioral evaluations. Results show the existence of cognitive phenotypes associated with differences in the mean value of leaf fraction and diameter of EEG networks across groups. The ability of identifying phenotypes in these otherwise healthy subjects opens up the possibility to aid in the development of specific interventions aimed to reduce expression of proactive aggression in ex-combatants and assessing the efficacy of such interventions.

This work is a novel attempt to investigate the feasibility of online modulation of sound sources by probabilistic detection of auditory attention, using a noninvasive EEG based brain computer interface. Proposed online system modulates the upcoming sound sources through gain adaptation which employs probabilistic decisions (soft decisions) from a classifier trained on offline calibration data. In this work, calibration EEG data were collected in sessions where the participants listened to two sound sources (one attended and one unattended). Cross-correlation coefficients between the EEG measurements and the attended and unattended sound source envelope (estimates) are used to show differences in sharpness and delays of neural responses for attended versus unattended sound source. Salient features to distinguish attended sources from the unattended ones in the correlation patterns have been identified, and later they have been used to train an auditory attention classifier. Compared to the existing results in the literature, in this paper we have two main contributions. First, using the auditory attention classifier, we have shown high offline detection performance with single channel EEG measurements of shorter duration compared to the existing approaches in the literature which employ large number of channels with longer EEG measurements. Second, using the classifier trained offline in the calibration session, we have shown the performance of the online sound source modulation system. We observe that online sound source modulation system is able to keep the level of attended sound source higher than the unattended source. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Tests using popular intracranial Electroencephalograph (iEEG) recordings involving 18 seizure patients of different sex, age and seizure's type indicated that the algorithm performs reasonably well by three major iEEG rhythms. Methods: Three different seizure states were considered in the investigation - (i) ictal, (ii) and preictal and, (iii) interictal. A sliding window approach with data averaging was implemented in order to avoid overlapping and ensuring balanced datasets. Meanwhile the 4th order Daubechies wavelet was utilized in signal decomposition, while machine learning was established by means of 5-state HMM classifier. During training the Wilks' lambda algorithm was invoked in order to reduce correlationship between variables by selecting those with high discriminant power. Results: The algorithm took forty-seven steps to converge, producing a subset containing 44 variables from 2560 available. Results from this study reveal that the classification after Wilks' lambda analysis was more precise compared to direct classification. Prediction analysis performed on all principle components yielded a correct classification rate of 95.1%, 95.2% sensitivity, and 97.6% specificity. Results demonstrate that the proposed method were more accurate compared to the existing methods. Conclusion: It is shown in this paper that HMM with Wilks' lambda analysis were capable of escalating the correct classification decisions compared to direct approach. The difficulty in separating preictal from ictal rhythms is evident from the canonical plot and proven by classification analysis.

Recently, brain computer interface based on motor imagery (MI) has received increasing interest for its practicability and convenience. However, the short of imagery pattern makes the application of MI difficult to realize. This paper will propose a MI patterns including four novel and complex arm gestures: clockwise and anticlockwise swing of both arms. Preliminary result shows that using support vector machine classifier and deep brain network classifier, we are able to discriminate these tasks with average classification accuracy of 54.41%, and average information transmission rate of 8.05 bits/min. Meanwhile, the result shows clockwise and anticlockwise movements of same arm (error rate: 17.33%) are not as easily to discriminate as movement of left and right arms (error rate: 15.91%).

We record electroencephalographic (EEG) data of students watching online lecture videos and use it to predict engagement rated by human annotators. An evaluation of prior EEG-based engagement metrics that utilize power spectral density (PSD) features is presented. We examine the predictive power of various supervised machine learning approaches with both subject-independent and individualized models when using simple PSD feature functions. Our results show that engagement metrics with few power band variables, including those proposed in prior research, do not produce predictions consistent with human observations. We quantify the performance disparity between cross-subject and per-subject models and demonstrate that individual differences in EEG patterns necessitate a more complex metric for educational engagement assessment in natural distance learning environments.

Motor imagery (MI) based BCI detects subject motor intentions which could be further used as control signals. Due to spatial lateralization of different MI tasks, spatial filtering followed by band power extraction is the most commonly used algorithm for classification tasks in MI-based BCIs. Unfortunately, the spatial filtering approach significantly incorporates Amplitude characteristics when compared to Phase characteristics of the EEG signal. Single trial Phase locking value (sPLV) has been a popular statistics to extract phase based information for classification task in MI-based BCI. To utilize the phase characteristics for MI classification, this paper proposes a novel approach based on instantaneous phase difference (IPD) sequence to extract phase features that explicitly use the phase synchronization information between EEG sensors. We maximized the discriminability of IPD sequence using linear transformation calculated from common spatial pattern algorithm (CSP) on the IPD sequence. An evaluation of our method on BCI competition dataset led to around 15% increase in mean classification accuracies compared to sPLV approach and comparable accuracies to power feature based CSP algorithm. Furthermore, incorporating phase features from our method and power features from traditional algorithms using sparse feature selection technique increased the classification accuracy over both CSP and CSP on the IPD sequence.

In this paper, we designed a novel architecture, i.e., broad dynamical graph learning system (BDGLS), to deal with EEG signals. By integrating the advantage of dynamical graph convolution neural networks (DGCNN) and broad learning system (BLS), BDGLS has the ability of extracting features on non-Euclidean domain and randomly generating nodes to find the desired connection weights simultaneously. We evaluated our system on SJTU emotion EEG dataset (SEED), and used differential entropy (DE) features as input data. In the experiments, BDGLS achieved the best result, compared with the state-of-the-art methods, e.g., support vector machine (SVM), deep belief networks (DBN), graph convolutional neural networks (DCNN) and DGCNN. Especially the performance on all-frequency band of DE features, BDGLS reached the highest average recognition accuracy of 93.66% with the standard deviation of 6.11%. The result demonstrated the excellent classification ability of BDGLS in EEG emotion recognition.

This technology progress contributes on the integration of ALS people in the society by giving them the possibility to command machine only by the power of brain signals (EEG signals). Therefore, the BCI system can be based on deferent paradigms. Our main objective here, is to detect the blinks in the EEG signals in order to command machine. In this paper, we propose a new blink detection approach based on unsupervised clustering of the blink regression parameters using the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Our approach is mainly based on learning and prediction phases. The learning phase aims to apply GMM clustering on blink curve parameters which are approximated by polynomial regression.

J	Kim, SK; Kang, HB				Kim, Seul-Kee; Kang, Hang-Bong			An analysis of smartphone overuse recognition in terms of emotions using brainwaves and deep learning	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Deep belief network; Electroencephalography (EEG); Emotion recognition; Smartphone overuse	FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; EEG; DEPRESSION; ADDICTION; ASYMMETRY; STRESS; MODELS; SYSTEM; MUSIC	The overuse of smartphones is increasingly becoming a social problem. In this paper, we analyze smartphone overuse levels, according to emotion, by examining brainwaves and deep learning. We assessed the asymmetry power with respect to theta, alpha, beta, gamma, and total brainwave activity in 11 lobes. The deep belief network (DBN) was used as the deep learning method, along with k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and a support vector machine (SVM), to determine the smartphone addiction level. The risk group (13 subjects) and non-risk group (12 subjects) watched videos portraying the following concepts: relaxed, fear, joy, and sadness. We found that the risk group was more emotionally unstable than the non-risk group. In recognizing Fear, a clear difference appeared between the risk and non-risk group. The results showed that the gamma band was the most obviously different between the risk and non-risk groups. Moreover, we demonstrated that the measurements of activity in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes were indicators of emotion recognition. Through the DBN, we confirmed that these measurements were more accurate in the non-risk group than they were in the risk group. The risk group had higher accuracy in low valence and arousal; on the other hand, the non-risk group had higher accuracy in high valence and arousal. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Rejer, I; Twardochleb, M				Rejer, Izabela; Twardochleb, Michal			Gamers' involvement detection from EEG data with cGAAM - A method for feature selection for clustering	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature selection; Clustering; Genetic algorithm; Game player involvement recognition; Brain activity patterns; EEG signal analysis	CLASSIFICATION; SUPPORT	This paper reports the results of an experiment to identify EEG patterns specific to different levels of player involvement when playing a video game. To obtain unbiased results, we based our patterns on both raw EEG data and expert knowledge. We used a three-step procedure to identify patterns. First, we looked for clusters in the reduced feature space extracted from EEG data. Next, we assigned experts' interpretations to the clusters. Finally, we analysed relations between features used to form the clusters and the class labels provided by experts. The most challenging part of the procedure was feature selection simultaneous with unsupervised classification. To accomplish this task, we developed a new approach for simultaneous feature selection and clustering based on modified GAAM (genetic algorithm with aggressive mutation). When the cGAAM algorithm was applied to EEG data, it returned the feature subsets that (a) were highly consistent across subjects and (b) provided 50% more compact clusters than clusters built over the feature subsets returned by a forward selection search strategy. The main cognitive outcome of EEG signal analysis was a set of patterns differentiating players' involvement in a game. Conclusions included: 1. For a majority of subjects the most discriminative features were activity in the theta band in the left and right frontal areas, and activity in the delta band in the left frontal area; 2. All three features significantly differentiated between low and high, or medium and high engagement; 3. All subjects showed positive correlations between selected feature values and levels of engagement. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

EEG Theta Power Is an Early Marker of Cognitive Decline in Dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; dementia; diagnostic; EEG; mild cognitive impairment; power	STATISTICAL PATTERN-RECOGNITION; QUANTITATIVE EEG; DIAGNOSTIC-VALUE; SENILE DEMENTIA; AMYLOID LOAD; IMPAIRMENT; BRAIN; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY; FREQUENCY; COHERENCE	Background: Quantitative EEG (qEEG) power could potentially be used as a diagnostic tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may further our understanding of the pathophysiology. However, the early qEEG power changes of AD are not well understood. Objective: To investigate the early changes in qEEG power and the possible correlation with memory function and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. In addition, whether qEEG power could discriminate between AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and older healthy controls (HC) at the individual level. Methods: Standard EEGs from 138 HC, 117 MCI, and 117 AD patients were included from six Nordic memory clinics. All EEGs were recorded consecutively before the diagnosis and were not used for the consensus diagnosis. Absolute and relative power was calculated for both eyes closed and open condition. Results: At group level using relative power, we found significant increases globally in the theta band and decreases in high frequency power in the temporal regions for eyes closed for AD and, to a lesser extent, for MCI compared to HC. Relative theta power was significantly correlated with multiple neuropsychological measures and had the largest correlation coefficient with total tau. At the individual level, the classification rate for AD and HC was 72.9% for relative power with eyes closed. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the increase in relative theta power may be the first change in patients with dementia due to AD. At the individual level, we found a moderate classification rate for AD and HC when using EEGs alone.	[Musaeus, Christian Sandoe; Waldemar, Gunhild; Andersen, B.

In order to make the system on-chip trainable with high efficiency and attain high detection accuracy, this paper presents a very large scale integration (VLSI) design based on the nonlinear support vector machine (SVM). The proposed design mainly consists of a feature extraction (FE) module and an SVM module. The FE module performs the three-level Daubechies discrete wavelet transform to fit the physiological bands of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal and extracts the time-frequency domain features reflecting the nonstationary signal properties. The SVM module integrates the modified sequential minimal optimization algorithm with the table-driven-based Gaussian kernel to enable efficient on-chip learning. The presented design is verified on an Altera Cyclone II field-programmable gate array and tested using the two publicly available EEG datasets. Experiment results show that the designed VLSI system improves the detection accuracy and training efficiency.

Based on the evident advantage of S transform in feature extraction, including more obvious characteristic of time, frequency and phase, it is applied to preprocess the data for a better classification. The experiment result on the motion imagery indicates that the combined algorithm achieve an accuracy of 92.8%, far higher than the accuracy of applying CSP algorithm only. What is more, the time cost could be diminished to 0.85s after sampling, 31% less than the original method, and could still achieve the accuracy of 89.8%. in conclusion, the combination of CSP and S transform algorithm is a feasible and applicable one with data and technical support.

The proposal consisted of three main stages: organization of EEG signals, feature extraction and execution of classification algorithms. The EEG signals used, represent four motor actions: Left Hand, Right Hand, Tongue and Foot movements; in the frame of the Motor Imagery Paradigm. These EEG signals were obtained from a database provided by the Technological University of Graz. From this dataset, only the EEG signals of two healthy subjects were used to carry out the proposed work. The feature extraction stage was carried out by applying an algorithm known as Common Spatial Pattern, in addition to the statistical method called Root Mean Square. The classification algorithms used were: K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron and Dendrite Morphological Neural Networks. This algorithms was evaluated with two studies. The first one aimed to evaluate the performance in the recognition between two classes of Motor Imagery tasks; Left Hand vs. Right Hand, Left Hand vs. Tongue, Left Hand vs. Foot, Right Hand vs. Tongue, Right Hand vs. Foot and Tongue vs. Foot.

In this paper, a novel method combining the local mean decomposition (LMD) and the projective dictionary pair learning (DPL) is proposed for seizure detection. The LMD is employed to decompose the EEG signals into a set of product functions, and the first three product functions are selected to extract three features to characterize the behavior of EEG recordings. After that, the DPL model can learn a synthesis dictionary and an analysis dictionary from the training samples, and then encode the test samples over the learned dictionary. At last, the test samples are categorized by checking whose class has the minimum reconstructed residual. The proposed model is evaluated on the Freiburg database, achieving the sensitivity of 95.89% with the specificity of 95.10%. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method can become a potential approach for detecting seizures in clinic application.

J	Ehrlich, SK; Cheng, G				Ehrlich, Stefan K.; Cheng, Gordon			Human-agent co-adaptation using error-related potentials	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						electroencephalography (EEG); brain-computer interface (BCI); event-related potentials (ERP); error-related potentials (ErrP); error monitoring; human-robot interaction (HRI); co-adaptation	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; COGNITIVE CONTROL; ERP COMPONENTS; EEG; PERFORMANCE; CORTEX; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; NEGATIVITY	Objective. Error-related potentials (ErrP) have been proposed as an intuitive feedback signal decoded from the ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) of a human observer for improving human-robot interaction (HRI). While recent demonstrations of this approach have successfully studied the use of ErrPs as a teaching signal for robot skill learning, so far, no efforts have been made towards HRI scenarios where mutual adaptations between human and robot are expected or required. These are collaborative or social interactive scenarios without predefined dominancy of the human partner and robots being perceived as intentional agents. Here we explore the usability of ErrPs as a feedback signal from the human for mediating co-adaptation in human-robot interaction. Approach. We experimentally demonstrate ErrPs-based mediation of co-adaptation in a human-robot interaction study where successful interaction depended on co-adaptive convergence to a consensus between them. While subjects adapted to the robot by reflecting upon its behavior, the robot adapted its behavior based on ErrPs decoded online from the human partner's ongoing EEG. Main results. ErrPs were decoded online in single trial with an avg. accuracy of 81.8% +/- 8.0% across 13 subjects, which was sufficient for effective adaptation of robot behavior. Successful co-adaptation was demonstrated by significant improvements in human-robot interaction efficacy and efficiency, and by the robot behavior that emerged during co-adaptation. These results indicate the potential of ErrPs as a useful feedback signal for mediating co-adaptation in human-robot interaction as demonstrated in a practical example. Significance. As robots become more widely embedded in society, methods for aligning them to human expectations and conventions will become increasingly important in the future. In this quest, ErrPs may constitute a promising complementary feedback signal for guiding adaptations towards human preferences. In this paper we extended previous research to less constrained HRI scenarios where mutual adaptations between human and robot are expected or required.

In clinical care, pain degree is needed for choosing and evaluating treatments, and it is important for clinicians to quantify pain degree as objectively as possible. Pain rating scales such as the Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) are usually used to quantify pain degree, which is only capable of subjective values due to self-report. From that, a method to quantify pain degree objectively has great importance. In this paper, we propose the possibility of quantifying pain degree by only using EEG measured with single-channel. 28 Subjects' EEG is measured while in 2 states; pain-free (VAS score of 0) and pain (VAS score of 3-4). By extracting frequency features from the measured EEG, and classifying using Support Vector Machine (SVM), the subjects in 2 states were classified with the accuracy of 100%. The results show reliability and validity of classifying pain degree using EEG measured with single-channel.

On these datasets, we evaluated the use of transfer learning for error decoding with deep convolutional neural networks (deep ConvNets). In comparison with a regularized linear discriminant analysis (rLDA) classifier, ConvNets were significantly better in both intra-and inter-subject decoding, achieving an average accuracy of 84.1 % within subject and 81.7 % on unknown subjects (flanker task). Neither method was, however, able to generalize reliably between paradigms. Visualization of features the ConvNets learned from the data showed plausible patterns of brain activity, revealing both similarities and differences between the different kinds of errors. Our findings indicate that deep learning techniques are useful to infer information about the correctness of action in BCI applications, particularly for the transfer of pre-trained classifiers to new recording sessions or subjects.

We propose in this paper a classification framework based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. To achieve robust classification, a one dimension-aggregate approximation (1d-AX) is employed to extract effective signal representation for LSTM networks. Inspired by classical common spatial pattern, channel weighting technique is further deployed to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed classification framework. Public BCI competition data are used for the evaluation of the proposed feature extraction and classification network, whose performance is also compared with that of the state-of-the-arts approaches based on other deep networks.

In this study, we provide the proof-of-principle in 40 subjects that sleep stages can be consistently differentiated solely on the basis of spatial 3-channel EEG patterns based on root-mean-square (RMS) amplitudes. The polysomnographic 3-channel EEG data are pre-processed by RMS averaging over intervals of 30 s leading to spatial cortical activity patterns represented by 3-dimensional vectors. These patterns are visualized using multidimensional scaling (MDS), allowing a comparison of the spatial cortical activity patterns with the conventional visual sleep scoring system according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM). Spatial cortical activity patterns based on RMS amplitudes naturally divide into different clusters that correspond to visually scored sleep stages. Furthermore, these clusters are reproducible between different subjects. Especially the cluster associated with the REM sleep stage seems to be very different from the one associated with the wake state. This study provides a proof-of-principle that it is possible to separate sleep stages solely by analyzing spatially distributed EEG RMS amplitudes reflecting cortical activity and without classical EEG feature extractions like power spectrum analysis.

To improve the classification success rate of MI EEG classification tasks, this paper proposes a completely unique input form based on brain network connectivity measures for the datasets from BCI Competition IV. First, using connectivity patterns between brain regions during MI task, six more frequent network features were selected and their maps were generated in 2D format; then a simple yet powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer was deployed for binary classification of MI tasks (left-hand, right-hand, both feet and tongue movements). The discrimination ability of these features was compared with each other. Our results demonstrate that CNN fed with path length feature map can further improve classification performance in most binary problems. While all classification results are better than 86%, the best accuracy using brain network features is 96.69% in right-tongue separation. The present study shows that the proposed method is efficient to classify MI tasks, and provides a practical method for classification of non-invasive EEG signals in BCI applications.

The aim of this study is to make a review of the periodic EEG patterns, emphasizing the importance of their recognition and clinical significance. The clinical significance of the periodic EEG patterns is uncertain, it is related to a variety of etiologies and suggest that these patterns are unequivocally epileptogenic in some cases and these patterns associated with poor prognosis.

Sleep Spindles constitute the most known pattern and their density in the EEG signal are related to many cerebral functions as memory consolidation, sleep quality or psychiatric diseases. Unfortunately this biomarker is underutilized because human annotation and classification is time consuming and almost impossible to achieve out of the scope of research. There is a need to use a reliable automated approach in order to use this biomarker in clinic.al practice A lot of studies and algorithms already exist and are used to help in this classification, but it remains difficult to achieve a good detection performance, especially when the EEG signal quality is low. We present here a review of the main methods used for spindles patterns detection and we test those where an open-source algorithm is available, to compare precision, recall and the F1-score on our own annotated dataset.

J	Dericioglu, N; Ozdemir, P				Dericioglu, Nese; Ozdemir, Pinar			The Success Rate of Neurology Residents in EEG Interpretation After Formal Training	CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						EEG training; EEG interpretation; neurology residents	EPILEPSY; MISDIAGNOSIS; ERRORS	EEG is an important tool for neurologists in both diagnosis and classification of seizures. It is not uncommon in clinical practice to see patients who were erroneously diagnosed as epileptic. Most of the time incorrect interpretation of EEG contributes significantly to this problem. In this study, we aimed to investigate the success rate of neurology residents in EEG interpretation after formal training. Eleven neurology residents were included in the study. Duration of EEG training (3 vs 4 months) and time since completion of EEG education were determined. Residents were randomly presented 30 different slides of representative EEG screenshots. They received 1 point for each correct response. The effect of training duration and time since training were investigated statistically. Besides, we looked at the success rate of each question to see whether certain patterns were more readily recognized than others. EEG training duration (P = .93) and time since completion of training (P = .16) did not influence the results. The success rate of residents for correct responses was between 17% and 50%. On the other hand, the success rate for each question varied between 0% and 91%. Overall, benign variants and focal ictal onset patterns were the most difficult to recognize. On 13 occasions (6.5%) nonepileptiform patterns were thought to represent epileptiform abnormalities. After formal training, neurology residents could identify 50% of the EEG patterns correctly. The wide variation in success rate among residents and also between questions implies that both personal characteristics and inherent EEG features influence successful EEG interpretation.

The proposed preprocessing method considers the time-frequency analysis of EEG signal. The Short Time Fourier Transforms (STFT) based time-frequency analysis is applied to generate the Time-Frequency Series (TFS) of Electrooculogram (EOG) corrected EEG signal. Further, the generated TFS of particular frequency bin is transformed into time domain signal by Inverse Short Time Fourier Transforms (ISTFT). The generated time domain signal of particular frequency bin is passed through feature extraction method. An asymmetry coefficient based on Hjorth parameter as a feature extracted for each frequency bin and further subjected to Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for their classification. The proposed method of EEG signal pre-processing and feature extraction outperforms the conventional method of EEG signal pre-processing like Discriminative Frequency Band Common Spatial Pattern (DFBCSP).

Dissociable Decoding of Spatial Attention and Working Memory from EEG Oscillations and Sustained Potentials	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						alpha; decoding; EEG; ERP; orientation; working memory	NEURAL MEASURES REVEAL; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; HIDDEN STATES; REPRESENTATIONS; MECHANISMS; CORTEX; MODULATIONS; INFORMATION	In human scalp EEG recordings, both sustained potentials and alpha-band oscillations are present during the delay period of working memory tasks and may therefore reflect the representation of information in working memory. However, these signals may instead reflect support mechanisms rather than the actual contents of memory. In particular, alpha-band oscillations have been tightly tied to spatial attention and may not reflect location-independent memory representations per se. To determine how sustained and oscillating EEG signals are related to attention and working memory, we attempted to decode which of 16 orientations was being held in working memory by human observers (both women and men). We found that sustained EEG activity could be used to decode the remembered orientation of a stimulus, even when the orientation of the stimulus varied independently of its location. Alpha-band oscillations also carried clear information about the location of the stimulus, but they provided little or no information about orientation independently of location. Thus, sustained potentials contain information about the object properties being maintained in working memory, consistent with previous evidence of a tight link between these potentials and working memory capacity. In contrast, alpha-band oscillations primarily carry location information, consistent with their link to spatial attention.

Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) feature extraction algorithm was used and combined with Ensemble Support Vector Machine (SVM) as classifier for EEG. Besides, bagging and cross-validation ways were adopted in generation of Ensemble SVM. The experiment results showed the accuracy of Ensemble SVM was better than that of single SVM for different time collecting EEG and cross-validation way performed better than bagging method. Therefore, Ensemble SVM has stronger robustness and generalization ability compared to individual SVM, which develops a new idea for classifying EEG signals.

One possible approach is to use source estimation of magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals. Previous studies have mainly quantified accuracy of this technique according to positional deviations and dispersion of estimated sources, but it remains unclear how accurately MEG source estimation restores information content represented by spatial patterns of brain activity. In this study, using simulated MEG signals representing artificial experimental conditions, we performed MEG source estimation and multivariate pattern analysis to examine whether MEG source estimation can restore information content represented by patterns of cortical current in source brain areas. Classification analysis revealed that the corresponding artificial experimental conditions were predicted accurately from patterns of cortical current estimated in the source brain areas. However, accurate predictions were also possible from brain areas whose original sources were not defined. Searchlight decoding further revealed that this unexpected prediction was possible across wide brain areas beyond the original source locations, indicating that information contained in the original sources can spread through MEG source estimation. This phenomenon of "information spreading" may easily lead to false-positive interpretations when MEG source estimation and classification analysis are combined to identify brain areas that represent target information. Real MEG data analyses also showed that presented stimuli were able to be predicted in the higher visual cortex at the same latency as in the primary visual cortex, also suggesting that information spreading took place. These results indicate that careful inspection is necessary to avoid false-positive interpretations when MEG source estimation and multivariate pattern analysis are combined.

Several lines of research have shown that GAN is applicable to brain-machine interface technology for deciphering human brain activity, such as EEG and fMRI signals, to visualize what human observers see during recording. However, although current GAN models can synthesize photorealistic images, the quality and variety of image reconstruction from brain activity data recorded by non-invasive techniques are still limited. In this study, we recorded neural spike activities in monkey brain using microelectrode arrays implanted directly on the surface of the inferior temporal cortex, a brain area crucial for visual object recognition. The recorded data were then inputted into a state-of-the-art GAN model (Dosovitskiy & Brox, 2016 [1]) to reconstruct images viewed by the monkey during the experiments. The results showed the advantage of invasive recording methods over non-invasive methods for improving the quality of image reconstruction. The results also demonstrated that the proposed decoding approach is useful in neuroscience research to explore and visualize information represented in the recoding site.

Achieving this accuracy is still a challenge because of the low signal-to-noise ratio in electroencephalography signals and high variability of sensorimotor rhythms. To address this need, we proposed a novel scheme that combined a frequency band selection common spatial pattern algorithm and a particle swarm optimization least squares twin support vector machine classifier for recognition of motor imagery patterns. We used self-adaptive artifact removal and the common spatial pattern method to obtain the most distinguishable features. To improve the classification results, we investigated linear, polynomial, sigmoid, wavelet and gaussian kernel functions for the nonlinear least squares twin support vector machine classifier. Particle swarm optimization, chaotic particle swarm optimization, a genetic algorithm and a quantum genetic algorithm were compared and used to tune the hyper-parameters for the classifier. To evaluate our proposed method, we used BCI Competition IV data sets 2A and 2B. Experimental results showed, that for our method, the average recognition accuracy of data set 2A is increased by 6.10%, 6.71%, 3.87%, 4.01%, 2.55% and 4.86% compared with the results obtained by regularization projection twin support vector machine, twin support vector machine, support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, back propagation and probabilistic neural network, respectively. Using data set 2B, the average recognition accuracy achieved by our method was greater by 4.73%, 5.46%, 4.45%, 4.10%, 8.62% and 4.27%, respectively. The standard deviation of the accuracy values of the two data sets decreased. Furthermore, compared with the traditional support vector machines, our proposed method achieved a faster central processing unit running time for training classifiers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In the human brain, the same system is thought to monitor action outcomes regardless of whether the information originates from internal (e.g., proprioceptive) and external (e.g., visual) sensory channels. Neural signatures of processing motor errors and action outcomes communicated by external feedback have been studied extensively; however, the existence of such a general action-monitoring system has not been tested directly. Here, we use concurrent EEG-MEG measurements and a probabilistic learning task to demonstrate that event-related responses measured by electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography display spatiotemporal patterns that allow an effective transfer of a multivariate statistical model discriminating the outcomes across the following conditions: (a) erroneous versus correct motor output, (b) negative versus positive feedback, (c) high-versus low-surprise negative feedback, and (d) erroneous versus correct brain-computer-interface output. We further show that these patterns originate from highly-overlapping neural sources in the medial frontal and the medial parietal cortices. We conclude that information about action outcomes arriving from internal or external sensory channels converges to the same neural system in the human brain, that matches this information to the internal predictions.

Responders to rTMS for depression show increased fronto-midline theta and theta connectivity compared to non-responders	BRAIN STIMULATION			English	Article						Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Treatment resistant depression; Electroencephalography; Response prediction; Theta; Alpha	TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE ACTIVITY; CENTRAL EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; WORKING-MEMORY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ANTIDEPRESSANT RESPONSE; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS	Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective treatment for depression, but only some individuals respond. Predicting response could reduce patient and clinical burden. Neural activity related to working memory (WM) has been related to mood improvements, so may represent a biomarker for response prediction. Primary hypotheses: We expected higher theta and alpha activity in responders compared to non-responders to rTMS. Methods: Fifty patients with treatment resistant depression and twenty controls performed a WM task while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Patients underwent 5-8 weeks of rTMS treatment, repeating the EEG at week 1 (W1). Of the 39 participants with valid WM-related EEG data from baseline and W1, 10 were responders. Comparisons between responders and non-responders were made at baseline and W1 for measures of theta (4-8 Hz), upper alpha (10-12.5 Hz), and gamma (30-45 Hz) power, connectivity, and theta-gamma coupling. The control group's measures were compared to the depression group's baseline measures separately. Results: Responders showed higher levels of WM-related fronto-midline theta power and theta connectivity compared to non-responders at baseline and W1. Responder's fronto-midline theta power and connectivity was similar to controls. Responders also showed an increase in gamma connectivity from baseline to W1, with a concurrent improvement in mood and WM reaction times. An unbiased combination of all measures provided mean sensitivity of 0.90 at predicting responders and specificity of 0.92 in a predictive machine learning algorithm. Conclusion: Baseline and W1 fronto-midline theta power and theta connectivity show good potential for predicting response to rTMS treatment for depression. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Monitoring brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) is an established method for epilepsy diagnosis and for monitoring epilepsy patients. Yet, it is not favorable to visually inspect EEG signals to diagnose epilepsy, especially in the case of long-term recordings. This process is time consuming and tedious error-prone exercise. In recent years, the sub-field of machine learning called deep learning has achieved remarkable success in various artificial intelligence research areas. In this paper, we present a method based on the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform unsupervised feature learning framework for automated seizure onset detection. The proposed system was evaluated on 526 hours duration of scalp EEG data, including 181 seizures of 23 pediatric patients. The different parameters of CNNs were optimized through 4-fold nested cross-validation. The resulting generalized CNN seizure detection model achieved an average sensitivity of 86.29%, an average false detection rate of 0.74 h-1 and an average detection latency of 2.1 sec.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of TGC. The subjects included 90 patients with schizophrenia and 90 healthy controls. We compared the TGC results between the groups using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to adjust for age and sex and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses to examine the discrimination ability of delta to gamma frequency bands and TGC. Patients with schizophrenia showed a significant increase in the resting-state TGC at all 19 electrodes. The analysis of the ROC curves for each frequency band exhibited relatively low classification accuracies for the delta, theta, slow alpha, fast alpha, and beta power. The TGC generated the most accurate results among the electroencephalography (EEG) measures, with an overall classification accuracy of 92.5%. The resting-state TGC value was increased in patients with schizophrenia compared to that in healthy controls and had a higher discriminating ability than the other parameters. These findings may be related to the compensatory hyper-arousal patterns of the dysfunctional default-mode network (DMN) in schizophrenia. Therefore, resting-state TGC is a promising neurophysiological marker of schizophrenia.

In this chapter, we present a step-by-step tutorial on MI BCI and discuss the issues involved in each step. We describe detailed examples of our MI experiment with a general procedure from training session to testing session. In training session, we introduce and discuss recording devices and software, experimental settings, collecting MI data and questionnaires, offline analysis for inhibition of somatosensory rhythm, and training simple machine learning algorithms, including common spatial patterns and Fisher's linear discriminant analysis.

The dataset consists of fourteen channels of EEG signals data in discrete form namely Quantitative EEG. The accuracy of eye state classification sometimes less due to consideration of raw EEG signal. Hence in this work, input signals are first normalized using minmax method and then given as input to the FFBPNN network. Experimental outcomes of the FFBPNN are recorded in term of '0's or '1's for two classes of eye state EEG signals. The accuracy of the proposed FFBPNN method has been measured using cross-validation process. Accuracy of the cross validation based FFBPNN is recorded up to 99.8% with 2-fold cross-validation by giving normalized data as an input to the network whereas the accuracy of the same network is recorded up to 76.5%, due to without normalized data given as a network input. Hence the proposed method gives better accuracy of the classification which will ultimately help in designing robust BCI.

This is because of the high sensitivity of nonlinear systems to initial points. Therefore, a similarity measure for nonlinear signal analysis must be invariant to initial points and quantify the similarity by considering the main dynamics of signals. The statistical behavior of local extrema (SBLE) method was previously proposed to address this problem. The SBLE similarity index uses quantized amplitudes of local extrema to quantify the dynamical similarity of signals by considering patterns of sequential local extrema. By adding time information of local extrema as well as fuzzifying quantized values, this work proposes a new similarity index for nonlinear and long-term signal analysis, which extends the SBLE method. These new features provide more information about signals and reduce noise sensitivity by fuzzifying them. A number of practical tests were performed to demonstrate the ability of the method in nonlinear signal clustering and classification on synthetic data. In addition, epileptic seizure detection based on electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing was done by the proposed similarity to feature the potentials of the method as a real-world application tool.

The novel kernel function has evolved from a chaotic system, which is inspired by the fact that human brain signals depict some chaotic characteristics and behaviors. By introducing the chaotic dynamics to the kernel function, the RVM will be enabled for higher classification capacity. The proposed method is validated within the framework of one versus one common spatial pattern (OVO-CSP) classifier to classify motor imagination (MI) of four movements in a public accessible dataset. To illustrate the performance of the proposed kernel function, Gaussian and Polynomial kernel functions are considered for comparison. Experimental results show that the proposed kernel function achieved higher accuracy than Gaussian and Polynomial kernel functions, which shows that the chaotic behavior consideration is helpful in the EEG signal classification.

J	Lee, MH; Williamson, J; Won, DO; Fazli, S; Lee, SW				Lee, Min-Ho; Williamson, John; Won, Dong-Ok; Fazli, Siamac; Lee, Seong-Whan			A High Performance Spelling System based on EEG-EOG Signals With Visual Feedback	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interfaces (BCI); electroencephalography (EEG); electrooculogram (EOG); P300 speller; visual feedback	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EYE-MOVEMENTS; P300; COMMUNICATION; WHEELCHAIR; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; PARALYSIS; FUSION; MODEL	In this paper, we propose a highly accurate and fast spelling system that employs multi-modal electroencephalography-electrooculography (EEG-EOG) signals and visual feedback technology. Over the last 20 years, various types of speller systems have been developed in brain-computer interface and EOG/eyetracking research; however, these conventional systems have a tradeoff between the spelling accuracy (or decoding) and typing speed. Healthy users and physically challenged participants, in particular, may become exhausted quickly; thus, there is a need for a speller system with fast typing speed while retaining a high level of spelling accuracy. In this paper, we propose the first hybrid speller system that combines EEG and EOG signals with visual feedback technology so that the user and the speller system can act cooperatively for optimal decision-making. The proposed spelling system consists of a classic row-column event-related potential (ERP) speller, an EOG command detector, and visual feedback modules. First, the online ERP speller calculates classification probabilities for all candidate characters from the EEG epochs. Second, characters are sorted by their probability, and the characters with the highest probabilities are highlighted as visual feedback within the row-column spelling layout. Finally, the user can actively select the character as the target by generating an EOG command. The proposed system shows 97.6% spelling accuracy and an information transfer rate of 39.6 (+/- 13.2) [bits/min] across 20 participants. In our extended experiment, we redesigned the visual feedback and minimized the number of channels (four channels) in order to enhance the speller performance and increase usability. Most importantly, a new weighted strategy resulted in 100% accuracy and a 57.8 (+/- 23.6) [bits/min] information transfer rate across six participants. This paper demonstrates that the proposed system can provide a reliable communication channel for practical speller applications and may be used to supplement existing systems.

In this work, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are introduced in epileptic seizure prediction using EEG signals, expanding the use of deep learning algorithms with convolutional neural networks (CNN). A pre-analysisis initially performed to find the optimal architecture of the LSTM network by testing several modules and layers of memory units. Based on these results, a two-layer LSTM network is selected to evaluate seizure prediction performance using four different length of preictal windows, ranging from 15 min to 2 h. The LSTM model exploits a wide range of features extracted prior to classification, including time and frequency domain features, between EEG channels cross-correlation and graph theoretic features. The evaluation is performed using long-term EEG recordings from the open CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database, suggest that the proposed methodology is able to predict all 185 seizures, providing high rates of seizure prediction sensitivity and low false prediction rates (FPR) of 0.11-0.02 false alarms per hour, depending on the duration of the preictal window. The proposed LSTM-based methodology delivers a significant increase in seizure prediction performance compared to both traditional machine learning techniques and convolutional neural networks that have been previously evaluated in the literature.

Accurate detection and prediction of epileptic seizures will significantly improve the life quality of epileptic patients. Various feature extraction algorithms were proposed to describe the EEG signals in frequency or time domains. Both invasive intracranial and non-invasive scalp EEG signals have been screened for the epileptic seizure patterns. This study extracted a comprehensive list of 24 feature types from the scalp EEG signals and found 170 out of the 2794 features for an accurate classification of epileptic seizures. An accuracy (Acc) of 99.40% was optimized for detecting epileptic seizures from the scalp EEG signals. A balanced accuracy (bAcc) was calculated as the average of sensitivity and specificity and our seizure detection model achieved 99.61% in bAcc. The same experimental procedure was applied to predict epileptic seizures in advance, and the model achieved Acc = 99.17% for predicting epileptic seizures 10 s before happening.

Besides the effects of sleep depth we investigated how sleep-specific EEG patterns (i.e. sleep spindles and slow oscillations [SOs]) relate to stimulus processing. Using 256-channel EEG we studied processing of auditory stimuli by means of event-related oscillatory responses (de-/synchronisation, ERD/ERS) and potentials (ERPs) in N - 17 healthy sleepers. We varied stimulus salience by manipulating subjective (SON vs. unfamiliar name) and paralinguistic emotional relevance (familiar vs. unfamiliar voice, FV/UFV). Results reveal that evaluation of voice familiarity continues during all NREM sleep stages and even REM sleep suggesting a 'sentinel processing mode' of the human brain in the absence of wake-like consciousness. Especially UFV stimuli elicit larger responses in a 1-15 Hz range suggesting they continue being salient. Beyond this, we find that sleep spindles and the negative slope of SOs attenuate information processing. However, unlike previously suggested they do not uniformly inhibit information processing, but inhibition seems to be scaled to stimulus salience.

Among the different ANN architectures, the most commonly applied for BCI classifiers is the multilayer perceptron (MLP). When appropriately designed with optimal number of neuron layers and number of neurons per layer, the ANN can act as a universal approximator. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG signal data, overtraining problem may become an inherent issue, causing these universal approximators to fail in real-time applications. New method: In this study we introduce a higher order neural network, namely the functional link neural network (FLNN) as a classifier for motor imagery (MI)-based BCI systems, to remedy the drawbacks in MLP. Results: We compare the proposed method with competing classifiers such as linear decomposition analysis, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbours, support vector machine and three MLP architectures. Two multi-class benchmark datasets from the BCI competitions are used. Common spatial pattern algorithm is utilized for feature extraction to build classification models. Comparison with existing method(s): FLNN reports the highest average Kappa value over multiple subjects for both the BCI competition datasets, under similarly preprocessed data and extracted features. Further, statistical comparison results over multiple subjects show that the proposed FLNN classification method yields the best performance among the competing classifiers. Conclusions: Findings from this study imply that the proposed method, which has less computational complexity compared to the MLP, can be implemented effectively in practical MI-based BCI systems.

Artificial neural network detects human uncertainty	CHAOS			English	Article							BISTABLE PERCEPTION; DECISION-MAKING; NECKER CUBE; STRESS; MODEL; EEG	Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are known to be a powerful tool for data analysis. They are used in social science, robotics, and neurophysiology for solving tasks of classification, forecasting, pattern recognition, etc. In neuroscience, ANNs allow the recognition of specific forms of brain activity from multichannel EEG or MEG data. This makes the ANN an efficient computational core for brain-machine systems. However, despite significant achievements of artificial intelligence in recognition and classification of well-reproducible patterns of neural activity, the use of ANNs for recognition and classification of patterns in neural networks still requires additional attention, especially in ambiguous situations. According to this, in this research, we demonstrate the efficiency of application of the ANN for classification of human MEG trials corresponding to the perception of bistable visual stimuli with different degrees of ambiguity. We show that along with classification of brain states associated with multistable image interpretations, in the case of significant ambiguity, the ANN can detect an uncertain state when the observer doubts about the image interpretation. With the obtained results, we describe the possible application of ANNs for detection of bistable brain activity associated with difficulties in the decision-making process.

Neurofeedback games using EEG-based brain-computer interface technology	SIGNAL PROCESSING AND MACHINE LEARNING FOR BRAIN-MACHINE INTERFACES	IET Control Robotics and Sensors Series		English	Article; Book Chapter							COMMUNICATION	Brain-computer interface (BCI) is relatively a new approach to communication between man and machine, which translates brain activity into commands for communication and control. As BCI is capable of detecting human intentions, it is a promising communication tool for paralyzed patients for communicating with external world. Many of the current BCI systems employ electroencephalogram (EEG) which is the most widely used noninvasive brain activity recording technique. EEG signal carries potential features to identify and decode human intentions and mental tasks. Recently, many researchers have started exploiting the possibilities of BCI in entertainment and cognitive skill enhancement. BCI-based games have been identified as a unique entertainment mechanism nowadays, "controlling a 2-D, 3-D or virtual computer game solely by player's brain waves." BCI games work based on a neurofeedback paradigm which allows an individual to self-regulate his brain signal in response to the real-time visual or auditory feedback of his brain waves/features. This neurofeedback in a gaming environment motivates and trains the players to control his brain features toward the desired stage (self-regulation). This chapter explores the state-of-the-art BCI technology in neurofeedback games, employing EEG signal. It also provides a survey of the existing EEG-based neurofeedback games and evaluates their success rates, challenging factors and influence on players. In neurofeedback games, a number of features extracted from EEG accompanied with sustained attention, selective attention, visuospatial attention, motor imagery, eye movements, etc. have been employed as distinct control signals. We will briefly review and compare various signal processing methodologies and machine-learning techniques employed in those studies to extract and decode the brain features. Besides the structure and algorithms used in neurofeedback games, the therapeutic effects of neurofeedback training and its capabilities for the enhancement of cognitive skills will also be briefly discussed in this chapter. Neurofeedback training helps to rewire brain's underlying neural circuits and to improve brain functions. Therefore, it is considered as an effective tool for boosting cognitive skills of both healthy and the disabled. Specifically, neurofeedback has been considered as an efficient treatment modality for individuals with attention-deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). ADHD is characterized by three behavioral symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Along with the conventional intervention strategies such as medication, behavioral treatments, etc., neurofeedback in BCI games has also been emerging as a promising modality for treating the attention deficit. We will also discuss portable and economical EEG recording devices currently employed in BCI-based brain training modules/games. Finally, the chapter will be concluded with a brief overview of the neurofeedback developments in the context of BCI-based games until now, their potential impact on the healthy as well as on people with neurological disorders, challenges in transferring the successful protocols from laboratories into the market and hurdles in real-time BCI system design and development.

In this paper, we present a novel convolution neural networks (CNN) approach for classifying motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG). For this, we obtained timefrequency representations of EEGs in cases of left and right motor imageries using continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Through experiments using well known public benchmark dataset, it shows that the proposed method provides the improved accuracy compared to the traditional machine learning based classification methods. It confirms the usefulness of the CNN scheme for BCI research field.

In the current study, we employed multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of electroencephalography to examine the relevance of spontaneously engaged visual processing during encoding for later retrieval. Human participants encoded word-picture associations, where the picture could be a famous face, a landmark, or an object. At test, we manipulated the retrieval demands by asking participants to retrieve either visual or verbal information about the pictures. MVPA revealed classification between picture categories during early perceptual stages of encoding (similar to 170 ms). Importantly, these visual category-specific neural patterns were predictive of later episodic remembering, but the direction of the relationship was contingent on the particular retrieval demand of the memory task: a benefit for the visual and a cost for the verbal. A reinstatement of the category-specific neural patterns established during encoding was observed during retrieval, and again the relationship with behavior varied with retrieval demands. Reactivation of visual representations during retrieval was associated with better memory in the visual task, but with lower performance in the verbal task. Our findings support and extend the TAP account by demonstrating that processing of particular aspects during memory formation can also have detrimental effects on later episodic remembering when other aspects of the event are called-for and shed new light on encoding and retrieval interactions in episodic memory.

To produce generalizable results, the emotion classifier should be stable over days, in which the day-to-day variations of EEG should be appropriately handled. To improve the generalization of EEG-based emotion recognition over time by learning multiple-days information which embraces the day-to-day variations, in this paper, 17 subjects were recruited to view several video clips to experience different emotion states, and each subject was required to perform five sessions in 5 days distributed over 1 month. Support vector machine was built to perform a classification, in which the training samples may come from 1, 2, 3, or 4 days' sessions but have a same number, termed learning 1-days information (L1DI), learning 2-days information (L2DI), learning 3-days information (L3DI), and learning 4-days information (L4DI) conditions, respectively. The results revealed that the EEG variability could impair the performance of emotion classifier dramatically, and learning more days' information to construct a classifier could significantly improve the generalization of EEG-based emotion recognition over time. Mean accuracies were 62.78, 67.92, 70.75, and 72.50% at L1DI, L2DI, L3DI, and L4DI conditions, respectively. Features at L4DI condition were ranked by modified RFE, and features providing better contribution were applied to obtain the performances of all conditions, results showed that the performance of SVMs trained and tested with the feature subset were all improved for L1DI, L2DI (*p < 0.05), L3DI (**p < 0.01), and L4DI (*p < 0.05) conditions. It could be a substantial step forward in the development of emotion recognition from EEG signals because it may enable a classifier trained on one time to handle another.

Researchers have proposed many machine learning and deep learning based automatic epileptic seizure detection methods. However, these schemes, especially the deep learning based ones, suffer from labeling huge amounts of training data. Moreover, in epileptic seizure detection, physicians pay more attention to abnormal signals than normal signals, and thus the misclassification cost for them should be different. To address these issues, we propose a cost-sensitive deep active learning scheme to detect the epileptic seizure. In particular, we develop a new generic double-deep neural network (double-DNN) to obtain the cost-sensitive utility for the samples selection strategy in the labeling process. We further employ three types of fundamental neural networks, i.e., one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs), recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) units, and recurrent neural networks with gated recurrent units (GRU), in the double-DNN and evaluate their performances. Experiment results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the amount of labeled samples by up to 33% and 80% compared with uncertainty sampling and random sampling, respectively.

In this paper, we propose an electroencephalogram (EEG) feature extraction method that leverages empirical mode decomposition and Approximation Entropy. In our proposed method, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is used to process EEG signals after data processing and obtains several intrinsic eigenmode functions. The Approximation Entropy (ApEn) of the first four Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) is computed, which is used as the features from EEG signals for learning and recognition. An integration of Deep Belief Network and Support Vector Machine is devised for classification, which takes the eigenvectors from the extracted feature to identify four principal human emotions, namely happy, calm, sad, and fear. Experiments are conducted with EEG data acquired with a 16-lead device. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an improved accuracy that is highly competitive to the state-of-the-art methods. The average accuracy is 83.34%, and the best accuracy reaches 87.32%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Currently, these methods are usually developed based on one specific database, which limits the possibilities of generalizations. Here, we present a machine learning solution for detection of interictal abnormal EEG segments optimized on the publically available TUH Abnormal EEG Corpus. The classifier is further re-trained and tested on several combinations of publicly available data sets. The results achieved internally on the datasets are comparable to the known state of the art, while training and testing on different sources produced accuracy in the range of 67.51% to 99.50%. Lower accuracy is achieved when the training data set is highly preprocessed and relatively small.

Here, we developed a new method that automatically detects iEEG bad channels using machine learning of seven signal features. Methods: The features quantified signals' variance, spatial-temporal correlation and nonlinear properties. Because the number of bad channels is usually much lower than the number of good channels, we implemented an ensemble bagging classifier known to be optimal in terms of stability and predictive accuracy for datasets with imbalanced class distributions. This method was applied on stereo-electroencephalographic (SEEG) signals recording during low frequency stimulations performed in 206 patients from 5 clinical centers. Results: We found that the classification accuracy was extremely good: It increased with the number of subjects used to train the classifier and reached a plateau at 99.77% for 110 subjects. The classification performance was thus not impacted by the multicentric nature of data. Conclusions: The proposed method to automatically detect bad channels demonstrated convincing results and can be envisaged to be used on larger datasets for automatic quality control of iEEG data.

Learning relevance models for patient cohort retrieval	JAMIA OPEN			English	Article						medical informatics; information storage and retrieval; search engine; machine learning		Objective: We explored how judgements provided by physicians can be used to learn relevance models that enhance the quality of patient cohorts retrieved from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) collections. Methods: A very large number of features were extracted from patient cohort descriptions as well as EHR collections. The features were used to investigate retrieving (1) neurology-specific patient cohorts from the deidentified Temple University Hospital electroencephalography (EEG) Corpus as well as (2) the more general cohorts evaluated in the TREC Medical Records Track (TRECMed) from the de-identified hospital records provided by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. The features informed a learning relevance model (LRM) that took advantage of relevance judgements provided by physicians. The LRM implements a pairwise learning-to-rank framework, which enables our learning patient cohort retrieval (L-PCR) system to learn fromphysicians' feedback. Results and Discussion: We evaluated the L-PCR system against state-of-the-art traditional patient cohort retrieval systems, and observed a 27% improvement when operating on EEGs and a 53% improvement when operating on TRECMed EHRs, showing the promise of the L-PCR system. We also performed extensive feature analyses to reveal the most effective strategies for representing cohort descriptions as queries, encoding EHRs, and measuring cohort relevance. Conclusion: The L-PCR system has significant promise for reliably retrieving patient cohorts from EHRs in multiple settings when trained with relevance judgments. When provided with additional cohort descriptions, the L-PCR system will continue to learn, thus offering a potential solution to the performance barriers of current cohort retrieval systems.

Classification of Pre-Clinical Seizure States Using Scalp EEG Cross-Frequency Coupling Features	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Epilepsy; clinical seizure onset; early detection; cross-frequency coupling features; machine learning; EEG; random forest; multi-stage state classification	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; PHASE; PATIENT; OSCILLATIONS; ONSET; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM; DEVICES; SURGERY	Objective: This work proposes a machine-learning based system for a scalp EEG that flags an alarm in advance of a clinical seizure onset. Methods: EEG recordings from 12 patients with drug resistant epilepsy were marked by an expert neurologist for clinical seizure onset. Scalp EEG recordings consisted of 56 seizures and 9.67 h of interictal periods. Data from six patients were reserved for testing, and the rest was split into training and testing sets. A global spatial average of a cross-frequency coupling (CFC) index, (I) over bar (c)(fc), was extracted in 2 s windows, and used as the feature for the machine learning. A multistage state classifier (MSC) based on random forest algorithms was trained and tested on these data. Training was conducted to classify three states: interictal baseline, and segments prior to and following EG onset. Classifier performance was assessed using a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: The MSC produced an alarm 45 +/- 16 s in advance of a clinical seizure onset across seizures from the 12 patients. It performed with a sensitivity of 87.9%, a specificity of 82.4%, and an area-under-the-ROC of 93.4%. On patients for whom it received training, performance metrics increased. Performance metrics did not change when the MSC used reduced electrode ring configurations. Conclusion: Using the scalp (I) over bar (c)(fc), the MSC produced an alarm in advance of a clinical seizure onset for all 12 patients. Patient-specific training improved the specificity of classification. Significance: The MSC is noninvasive, and demonstrates that CFC features may be suitable for use in a home-based seizure monitoring system.

However, the CSP method easily overfits to the data of small training sets and its performance can be degraded by highly noisy and interference channels. Furthermore, more recording channels imply more processing and computation time in practical applications. To overcome these drawbacks, in this paper we propose a novel sparse CSP algorithm by introducing sparsity into spatial filters. The proposed method adopts 11 norm as sparsity metric and constrains the ratio between variances of spatially filtered EEG signals of two classes larger than a specified threshold. To improve computational efficiency, an iterative approach based on general eigenvalue decomposition is further developed. The experimental results on 9 subjects from BCI competition datasets publicly available demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve comparable classification accuracy even when the number of channels is small.

Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) algorithm is a promising feature extraction technique to deal with subject-specific behavior in Motor Imagery classification. Using FBCSP on EEG we have developed an accurate but less computationally expensive approach by making use of Time Domain Parameters (TDP) and Band Power (BP) features to form a combined feature set. The novelty of our approach is also the use of optimal time segmentation to overcome non-stationary state behavior of Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) and Event-Related Synchronization (ERS) over time. We analyzed the impact of parameter variations on classification accuracy and achieved 0.59 mean kappa value for Dataset 2a BCI competition IV, the highest reported for FBCSP approaches, along with the lowest inter-subject variation.

J	Park, SH; Lee, D; Lee, SG				Park, Sang-Hoon; Lee, David; Lee, Sang-Goog			Filter Bank Regularized Common Spatial Pattern Ensemble for Small Sample Motor Imagery Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Brain-computer interface (BCI); regularized common spatial pattern (R-CSP); filter bank; ensemble; small sample; motor imagery	EEG CLASSIFICATION; MUTUAL INFORMATION; SELECTION	For the last few years, many feature extraction methods have been proposed based on biological signals. Among these, the brain signals have the advantage that they can be obtained, even by people with peripheral nervous system damage. Motor imagery electroencephalograms (EEG) are inexpensive to measure, offer a high temporal resolution, and are intuitive. Therefore, these have received a significant amount of attention in various fields, including signal processing, cognitive science, and medicine. The common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is a useful method for feature extraction from motor imagery EEG. However, performance degradation occurs in a small-sample setting (SSS), because the CSP depends on sample-based covariance. Since the active frequency range is different for each subject, it is also inconvenient to set the frequency range to be different every time. In this paper, we propose the feature extraction method based on a filter bank to solve these problems. The proposed method consists of five steps. First, motor imagery EEG is divided by a using filter bank. Second, the regularized CSP (R-CSP) is applied to the divided EEG. Third, we select the features according to mutual information based on the individual feature algorithm. Fourth, parameter sets are selected for the ensemble. Finally, we classify using ensemble based on features. The brain-computer interface competition III data set IVa is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The proposed method improves the mean classification accuracy by 12.34%, 11.57%, 9%, 4.95%, and 4.47% compared with CSP, SR-CSP, R-CSP, filter bank CSP (FBCSP), and SR-FBCSP. Compared with the filter bank R-CSP (beta, gamma), which is a parameter selection version of the proposedmethod, the classification accuracy is improved by 3.49%. In particular, the proposed method shows a large improvement in performance in the SSS.

However, the application of neural patterns in the recognition of self-induced emotions remains uninvestigated. In this study we inferred the patterns and neural signatures of self-induced emotions from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The EEG signals of 30 participants were recorded while they watched 18 Chinese movie clips which were intended to elicit six discrete emotions, including joy, neutrality, sadness, disgust, anger and fear. After watching each movie clip the participants were asked to self-induce emotions by recalling a specific scene from each movie. We analyzed the important features, electrode distribution and average neural patterns of different self-induced emotions. Results demonstrated that features related to high-frequency rhythm of EEG signals from electrodes distributed in the bilateral temporal, prefrontal and occipital lobes have outstanding performance in the discrimination of emotions. Moreover, the six discrete categories of self-induced emotion exhibit specific neural patterns and brain topography distributions. We achieved an average accuracy of 87.36% in the discrimination of positive from negative self-induced emotions and 54.52% in the classification of emotions into six discrete categories. Our research will help promote the development of comprehensive endogenous emotion recognition methods.

As our environment becomes polluted with various gases, it is necessary to know that which gas is present in the atmosphere and in what density. Our work in this paper gives an elementary approach to solve this problem. We have utilized liquid stimuli with three different concentration levels as Low (25% aroma and 75% water), medium (50% aroma and 50% water) and High (75% aroma and 25% water). General type-2 Fuzzy Classifier is used to classify the three different density stimuli. An accuracy of 86% is obtained in this experiment. Thus, we can illustrate that different density stimuli can be separable with EEG signals. The accuracy level can be further increased with other improved classifiers.

This new generation of technologies will be able to communicate with the brain in ways that support contextual learning and adaptation to changing functional requirements. This applies to both invasive technologies aimed at restoring neurological function, as in the case of neural prosthesis, as well as non-invasive technologies enabled by signals such as electroencephalograph (EEG). Advances in computation, hardware, and algorithms that learn and adapt in a contextually dependent way will be able to leverage the capabilities that nanoengineering offers the design and functionality of BMI. We explore the enabling capabilities that these devices may exhibit, why they matter, and the state of the technologies necessary to build them. We also discuss a number of open technical challenges and problems that will need to be solved in order to achieve this.

However, the brain is a system operating on multiple time scales, and characterization of dynamics across time scales remains a challenge. One framework to study such dynamics is that of fractal geometry; and currently there exist several methods for the study of brain dynamics using fractal geometry. We aim to highlight some of the practical challenges of applying fractal geometry to brain dynamics-and as a putative feature for machine learning applications, and propose solutions to enable its wider use in neuroscience. Using intracranially recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) and simulated data, we compared monofractal and multifractal methods with regards to their sensitivity to signal variance. We found that both monofractal and multifractal properties correlate closely with signal variance, thus not being a useful feature of the signal. However, after applying an epoch-wise standardization procedure to the signal, we found that multifractal measures could offer non-redundant information compared to signal variance, power (in different frequency bands) and other established EEG signal measures. We also compared different multifractal estimation methods to each other in terms of reliability, and we found that the Chhabra-Jensen algorithm performed best. Finally, we investigated the impact of sampling frequency and epoch length on the estimation of multifractal properties. Using epileptic seizures as an example event in the EEG, we show that there may be an optimal time scale (i.e., combination of sampling frequency and epoch length) for detecting temporal changes in multifractal properties around seizures. The practical issues we highlighted and our suggested solutions should help in developing robust methods for the application of fractal geometry in EEG signals. Our analyses and observations also aid the theoretical understanding of the multifractal properties of the brain and might provide grounds for new discoveries in the study of brain signals. These could be crucial for the understanding of neurological function and for the developments of new treatments.	[Franca, Lucas G.

BBSD analytics has been recently applied towards aiding the process of care delivery and disease exploration. The main purpose of this paper is to introduce a framework for the analysis of BBSD of time series EEG in biomedical signal processing for identification of abnormalities. This paper presents a data analysis framework combining complex network and machine learning techniques for the analysis of BBSD in time series form. The proposed method is tested on an electroencephalogram (EEG) time series database as the implanted electrodes in the brain generate huge amounts of time series data in EEG. The pilot study in this paper has examined that the proposed methodology has the capability to analysis massive size of brain signals data and also can be used for handling any other biomedical signal data in time series form (e.g. electrocardiogram (ECG); Electromyogram (EMG)). The main benefit of the proposed methodology is to provide an effective way for analyzing the vast amount of BBSD generated from the brain to care patients with better outcomes and also help technicians for making intelligent decisions system.

EEG signals are one of the most important means of indirectly measuring the state of the brain. The existing stress algorithms lack efficient feature selection techniques to improve the performance of a subsequent classifier. In this paper, genetic algorithm (GA)-based feature selection and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier are used to identify stress in human beings by analyzing electro-encephalography (EEG) signals. GA is incorporated in the stress analysis pipeline to effectively select subset of features that are suitable to enhance the performance of the k-NN classifier. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using the Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals (DEAP), which is a public EEG dataset. A feature set is extracted in 32 EEG channels, which consists of statistical features, Hjorth parameters, band power, and frontal alpha asymmetry. The selected features through GA are used as input to the k-NN classifier to distinguish whether each EEG datapoint represents a stress state. To further consolidate, the effectiveness of the proposed method is compared with that of a state-of-the-art principle component analysis (PCA) method. Experimental results show that the proposed GA-based method outperforms PCA, with GA demonstrating 71.76% classification accuracy compared with 65.3% for PCA. Thus, it can be concluded that the proposed method can be effectively used for stress analysis with high classification accuracy.

Semi-Supervised Deep Blind Compressed Sensing for Analysis and Reconstruction of Biomedical Signals From Compressive Measurements	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Classification; compressed sensing; deep learning; EEG; reconstruction	CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; ECG	In this paper, the objective is to classify biomedical signals from their compressive measurements. The problem arises when compressed sensing (CS) is used for energy efficient acquisition and transmission of such signals for wireless body area network. After reconstruction, the signal is analyzed via certain machine learning techniques. This paper proposes to carry out joint reconstruction and analysis in a single framework; the reconstruction ability is obtained inherently from our formulation. We put forth a new technique called semi-supervised deep blind CS that combines the analytic power of deep learning with the reconstruction ability of CS. Experimental results on EEG classification show that the proposed technique excels over the state-of-the-art paradigm of CS reconstruction followed by deep learning classification.

J	Das, N; Bertrand, A; Francart, T				Das, Neetha; Bertrand, Alexander; Francart, Tom			EEG-based auditory attention detection: boundary conditions for background noise and speaker positions	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						auditory attention detection; EEG processing; brain-computer interface; neuro-steered hearing prostheses; cocktail party; acoustic conditions	CORTICAL ENTRAINMENT; NEURAL ENTRAINMENT; ATTENDED SPEECH; TRACKING; ENVIRONMENT; RELEASE; MASKING; BRAIN	Objective. A listener's neural responses can be decoded to identify the speaker the person is attending to in a cocktail party environment. Such auditory attention detection methods have the potential to provide noise suppression algorithms in hearing devices with information about the listener's attention. A challenge is the effect of noise and other acoustic conditions that can reduce the attention detection accuracy. Specifically, noise can impact the ability of the person to segregate the sound sources and perform selective attention, as well as the external signal processing necessary to decode the attention effectively. The aim of this work is to systematically analyze the effect of noise level and speaker position on attention decoding accuracy. Approach. 28 subjects participated in the experiment. Auditory stimuli consisted of stories narrated by different speakers from two different locations, along with surrounding multi-talker background babble. EEG signals of the subjects were recorded while they focused on one story and ignored the other. The strength of the babble noise as well as the spatial separation between the two speakers were varied between presentations. Spatio-temporal decoders were trained for each subject, and applied to decode attention of the subjects from every 30 s segment of data. Behavioral speech recognition thresholds were obtained for the different speaker separations. Main results. Both the background noise level and the angular separation between speakers affected attention decoding accuracy. Remarkably, attention decoding performance was seen to increase with the inclusion of moderate background noise (versus no noise), while across the different noise conditions performance dropped significantly with increasing noise level. We also observed that decoding accuracy improved with increasing speaker separation, exhibiting the advantage of spatial release from masking. Furthermore, the effect of speaker separation on the decoding accuracy became stronger when the background noise level increased. A significant correlation between speech intelligibility and attention decoding accuracy was found across conditions. Significance. This work shows how the background noise level and relative positions of competing talkers impact attention decoding accuracy. It indicates in which circumstances a neuro-steered noise suppression system may need to operate, in function of acoustic conditions. It also indicates the boundary conditions for the operation of EEG-based attention detection systems in neuro-steered hearing prostheses.

Stable Sparse Classifiers Identify qEEG Signatures that Predict Learning Disabilities (NOS) Severity	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						LD-NOS classification; EEG classification; stability based biomarkers; non-parametric ROC; sparse classifiers; elastic-net	DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; VARIABLE SELECTION; QUANTITATIVE EEG; GOLD STANDARD; CHILDREN; ACCURACY; MEMORY; REGULARIZATION; ADOLESCENTS; DISORDERS	In this paper, we present a novel methodology to solve the classification problem, based on sparse (data-driven) regressions, combined with techniques for ensuring stability, especially useful for high-dimensional datasets and small samples number. The sensitivity and specificity of the classifiers are assessed by a stable ROC procedure, which uses a non-parametric algorithm for estimating the area under the ROC curve. This method allows assessing the performance of the classification by the ROC technique, when more than two groups are involved in the classification problem, i.e., when the gold standard is not binary. We apply this methodology to the EEG spectral signatures to find biomarkers that allow discriminating between (and predicting pertinence to) different subgroups of children diagnosed as Not Otherwise Specified Learning Disabilities (LD-NOS) disorder. Children with LD-NOS have notable learning difficulties, which affect education but are not able to be put into some specific category as reading (Dyslexia), Mathematics (Dyscalculia), or Writing (Dysgraphia). By using the EEG spectra, we aim to identify EEG patterns that may be related to specific learning disabilities in an individual case. This could be useful to develop subject-based methods of therapy, based on information provided by the EEG. Here we study 85 LD-NOS children, divided in three subgroups previously selected by a clustering technique over the scores of cognitive tests. The classification equation produced stable marginal areas under the ROC of 0.71 for discrimination between Group 1 vs. Group 2; 0.91 for Group 1 vs. Group 3; and 0.75 for Group 2 vs. Group1. A discussion of the EEG characteristics of each group related to the cognitive scores is also presented.

This work utilized PAC and support vector machine (SVM) classifier to identify the epileptic seizures from electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The entropy based modulation index (MI) matrixes are used to express the strength of PAC, from which we extracted features as the input for classifier. Based on the Bonn database, which contains five datasets of EEG segments obtained from healthy volunteers and epileptic subjects, a 100% classification accuracy is achieved for identifying seizure ictal from healthy data, and an accuracy of 97.67% is reached in the classification of ictal EEG signals from inter-ictal EEGs. Based on the CHB-MIT database which is a group of continuously recorded epileptic EEGs by scalp electrodes, a 97.50% classification accuracy is obtained and a raising sign of MI value is found at 6 s before seizure onset. The classification performance in this work is effective, and PAC can be considered as a useful tool for detecting and predicting the epileptic seizures and providing reference for clinical diagnosis.

Since electroencephalogram (EEG) signals carry wide-ranging insights about cognition skills, the potential of using EEG signals to detect ADHD has a significant potential. EEG can be recorded utilizing wireless EEG reading devices often used by brain-computer interface researchers. In parallel-to-affordable EEG devices, serious games have been recently employed in the rehabilitation of multiple cognitive deficits. In this paper, we put the two things together, and we investigate the integration of an EEG-controlled serious game that trains and strengthens patients' attention ability while using machine learning to detect their attention level. Our pilot experiments with healthy individuals show an accuracy of up to 96% in classifying the EEG data to detect the correct game control type during gameplay, while our extended experiments with ADHD patients show an accuracy of up to 98% with a standard uncertainty of 0.16% in detecting ADHD patients.

Relevant Feature Selection from a Combination of Spectral-Temporal and Spatial Features for Classification of Motor Imagery EEG	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Brain computer interface; Stationary common spatial patterns; Motor imagery; Support vector machine; Linear discriminant analysis; Feature extraction; Feature selection	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; MUTUAL INFORMATION; FILTER; COMMUNICATION; MOVEMENT; PATTERN; OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE	This paper presents a novel algorithm (CVSTSCSP) for determining discriminative features from an optimal combination of temporal, spectral and spatial information for motor imagery brain computer interfaces. The proposed method involves four phases. In the first phase, EEG signal is segmented into overlapping time segments and bandpass filtered through frequency filter bank of variable size subbands. In the next phase, features are extracted from the segmented and filtered data using stationary common spatial pattern technique (SCSP) that can handle the non-stationarity and artifacts of EEG signal. The univariate feature selection method is used to obtain a relevant subset of features in the third phase. In the final phase, the classifier is used to build adecision model. In this paper, four univariate feature selection methods such as Euclidean distance, correlation, mutual information and Fisher discriminant ratio and two well-known classifiers (LDA and SVM) are investigated. The proposed method has been validated using the publicly available BCI competition IV dataset Ia and BCI Competition III dataset IVa. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing methods in terms of classification error.

In this paper, we use hierarchical convolutional neural network (HCNN) to classify the positive, neutral, and negative emotion states. We organize differential entropy features from different channels as two-dimensional maps to train the HCNNs. This approach maintains information in the spatial topology of electrodes. We use stacked autoencoder (SAE), SVM, and KNN as competing methods. HCNN yields the highest accuracy, and SAE is slightly inferior. Both of them show absolute advantage over traditional shallow models including SVM and KNN. We confirm that the high-frequency wave bands Beta and Gamma are the most suitable bands for emotion reading. We visualize the hidden layers of HCNNs to investigate the feature transformation flow along the hierarchical structure. Benefiting from the strong representational learning capacity in the two-dimensional space, HCNN is efficient in emotion recognition especially on Beta and Gamma waves.

Analysis of User Control Attainment in SMR-based Brain Computer Interfaces	IRBM			English	Article						Electroencephalogram (EEG); Brain Computer Interface (BCI); Sensorimotor rhythms (SMR); Control attainment	EEG; SIGNAL; EMG	Context: Sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) have been the neuronal phenomena of choice in non-invasive EEG-based endogenous brain computer interfaces (BCIs) for more than two decades and SMR-based BCIs have achieved the highest degree of freedom control so far. Nevertheless, they are subject to long periods of training prior to attaining a satisfactory level of control requiring users to learn to modulate their rhythms. The goal of this work is to analyse this problem, discuss the causes of the slow rise in performance and provide recommendations on alternative solutions to quicken control attainment. Methods: The study has been conducted by both theoretical and empirical analysis. A theoretical model has been developed that explains the principle operation of SMR-based BCIs focusing on major performance contributors respectively the user, periodic feature selection and the translation model thus contrasting user adaptation and machine learning. Five able-bodied subjects (age: 26 +/- 2.55) participated in six sessions of online computer cursor control experiments over three weeks to evaluate control attainment performances and gather data for statistical analysis (similar to 1152 trials per subject). Correlation (r(2)) between user control features and target position over sessions was assessed as an estimate of neural adaptation and the predictive power of the translation algorithm (10 x 10 fold cross-validation) was calculated over sessions as an estimate of machine adaptation. Auxiliary performance metrics were evaluated. Results: Features-target correlation increased over sessions, while at the same time the predictive accuracy (R-2) of the translation model remained averagely steady and very low (R-best(2)= 0.04) demonstrating continuous user adaptation and low model predictive accuracy. Periodic feature selection was theoretically discussed to be very instrumental and its relevance was empirically illustrated. Conclusions: The study concludes that the slow control attainment in SMR-based Bas is due to its reliance on user training (neural adaptation) which is adaptive but too slow in the context of SMR modulations and due to the weak decoding of the neuronal phenomenon utilised by the user. As a recommendation, the optimality of the feature selection algorithm could be looked at to guarantee the use of the most relevant features. However and most importantly the predictive power of the translation model should be significantly improved in order to quicken control attainment as thereafter the control attainment effort could be shifted from neural adaptation to machine learning.

To this end, an energy efficient seizure detector that can be implemented in an implantable device is of crucial importance. In this study, we first evaluated the performance of two machine learning algorithms (Random Forest classifier and support vector machine (SVM)) by using selected time and frequency domain features with a limited need of computational resources. Performance of the algorithms was further compared to a detection strategy implemented in an existing closed loop neurostimulation device for the treatment of epilepsy. The results show a superior performance of the Random Forest classifier compared to the SVM classifier and the reference approach. Next, we implemented the feature extraction and classification process of the Random Forest classifier on a microcontroller to evaluate the energy efficiency of this seizure detector. In conclusion, the feature set in combination with Random Forest classifier is an energy efficient hardware implementation that shows an improvement of detection sensitivity and specificity compared to the presently available closed-loop intervention in epilepsy while preserving a low detection delay.

A Deep Learning MI-EEG Classification Model for BCIs	2018 26TH EUROPEAN SIGNAL PROCESSING CONFERENCE (EUSIPCO)	European Signal Processing Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	SEP 03-07, 2018	Rome, ITALY	European Assoc Signal Processing, IEEE Signal Processing Soc, ROMA TRE Univ Degli Studi, MathWorks, Amazon Devices			MOTOR IMAGERY; PATTERNS	Reliable signal classification is essential for using an electroencephalogram (EEG) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) in motor imagery (MI) training. While deep learning (DL) is used in many areas with great success, only a limited number of works investigate its potential in this domain. This study presents a DL approach, which could improve or replace current stateof-the-art methods. Here, an end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN) model is presented, which can be applied to raw EEG signals. It consists of a temporal and spatial convolution layer for feature extraction and a fully connected (FC) layer for classification. The global models were trained on 3s segments of EEG data. Training a subject-independent global classifier reaches 80.10%, 69.72%, and 59.71% mean accuracy for a dataset with two, three, and four classes, respectively, validated in 5-fold crossvalidation. Retraining the global classifier with data from single individuals improves the overall mean accuracy to 86.13 %, 79.05%, and 68.93 %, respectively. The results are superior to the results reported in the literature on the same data. Generally, the reported accuracy values are comparable with related studies, which shows that the model delivers competitive results. As raw signals are used as input, no pre-processing is needed, which qualifies DL methods as a promising alternative to established EEG classification methods.

Early Diagnosis is crucial in the long term treatment of ASD, but this is challenging due to the lack of a proper objective measures. Subjective measures often take more time, resources, and have false positives or false negatives. There is a need for efficient objective measures that can help in diagnosing this disease early as possible with less effort. This paper presents EEG and Eye movement data for the diagnosis of ASD using machine learning algorithms. There are number of studies on classification of ASD using EEG or Eye tracking data. However, all of them simply use either Eye movements or EEG data for the classification. In our study we combine Eye movements and EEG data to develop an efficient methodology for diagnosis.

Functional Brain States Measure Mentor-Trainee Trust during Robot-Assisted Surgery	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							DECISION-MAKING; WORKLOAD; PERFORMANCE; ASYMMETRY; COGNITION; FUTURE; MODEL	Mutual trust is important in surgical teams, especially in robot-assisted surgery (RAS) where interaction with robot-assisted interface increases the complexity of relationships within the surgical team. However, evaluation of trust between surgeons is challenging and generally based on subjective measures. Mentor-Trainee trust was defined as assessment of mentor on trainee's performance quality and approving trainee's ability to continue performing the surgery. Here, we proposed a novel method of objectively assessing mentor-trainee trust during RAS based on patterns of brain activity of surgical mentor observing trainees. We monitored the EEG activity of a mentor surgeon while he observed procedures performed by surgical trainees and quantified the mentor's brain activity using functional and cognitive brain state features. We used methods from machine learning classification to identity key features that distinguish trustworthiness from concerning performances. Results showed that during simple surgical task, functional brain features are sufficient to classify trust. While, during more complex tasks, the addition of cognitive features could provide additional accuracy, but functional brain state features drive classification performance. These results indicate that functional brain network interactions hold information that may help objective trainee specific mentorship and aid in laying the foundation of automation in the human-robot shared control environment during RAS.

The recently validated electroencephalography (EEG) diagnostic criteria for NCSE and the proposed operational classification of status epilepticus provide tools that can allow an earlier diagnosis and better management of NCSE in this age group, possibly contributing to reduce its high mortality. Material and methods: we used these tools to identify and characterize a cohort of elderly (>60year-old) patients admitted at our institution in a 3-year period; the video-EEG and clinical files of the patients fulfilling EEG diagnostic criteria for NCSE were reviewed, being in this study described their electroclinical spectrum, etiologies, treatment, inhospital mortality, and status epilepticus severity score (STESS). Results: Fourty patients (23 women; mean age 76.6years) were identified. Although dyscognitive NCSE associated with >2.5Hz of epileptiform discharges (ED) was the most frequent electroclinical phenotype, this was quite heterogeneous, ranging from patients with aura continua to patients in coma, associated with frequent ED or rhythmic slow activities. Acute symptomatic (45%) and multifactorial (27.5%) etiologies were the most common, and associated with the worst prognosis. There was a trend to use newer antiepileptic drugs in the early steps of NCSE treatment. The inhospital mortality was high (22.5%) and predicted by STESS scores >= 3. Conclusion: In the elderly, NCSE has heterogeneous electroclinical phenotypes and etiologies. In spite of the treatment limitations conditioned by the comorbidities, more aggressive treatments could be justified to reduce mortality in patients with high STESS scores. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to characterize the electrophysiological properties and clinical features of seizures arising from the precuneus based on data from stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG). Methods: The present retrospective study included 10 patients with medically intractable epilepsy, all of whom were diagnosed with precuneal epilepsy via stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) at Yuquan Hospital and Xuan Wu Hospital between 2014 and 2016. Clinical semiology, scalp electroencephalography (EEG) findings, magnetic resonance images (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) images were analyzed during phase I preoperative evaluations. Following electrode implantation, the semiological sequence, ictal SEEG evolution, and anatomy of the relevant brain structures were analyzed for each seizure. Results: Seven of ten patients reported auras, including body image disturbance (2/7), vestibular responses (2/7), somatosensory auras (1/7), visual auras (1/7), and non-specific auras (1/7). Primary motor manifestations included bilateral asymmetric tonic seizures (BATS) (7/10) and hypermotor seizures (HMS) (3/10). In one patient, epileptiform discharge on interictal EEG occurred ipsilateral to the side of the epileptogenic zone (EZ). Discharge was non-lateralized in the remaining nine patients. In six patients, interictal EEG signals were primarily localized in the temporal-parietal- occipital area. In two patients, ictal onset occurred ipsilateral to the EZ, which was mainly located in the temporal- parietal-occipital area. Two patterns of seizure spread were observed. The first pattern was characterized by BATS activity with ictal spread to the supplementary motor area (SMA), paracentral lobule (PCL), precentral gyrus (PrCG), or postcentral gyrus (PoCG). The second pattern was characterized by HMS activity with ictal spread to middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Conclusion: Aura type (e.g., body image disturbance and vestibular response), BATS, and HMS are the main indicators of precuneal epilepsy. Scalp EEG is of little use when attempting to localize precuneal seizures. Our findings indicate that the clinical characteristics of precuneal epilepsy vary among patients, and that the final electro-clinical phenotype depends on the pattern of seizure spread.

The movement of limbs is investigated usually by analyzing the movement signals. Less efforts have been made to investigate how neural that correlate to the movements, are represented in the human brain. In this research, for the first time we decode the limb movements by fractal analysis of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We investigated how the complexity of EEG signal changes in different limb movements in motor execution (ME), and motor imagination (MI) sessions. The result of our analysis showed that the EEG signal experiences greatest level of complexity in elbow flexion and hand-close movements in ME, and MI sessions respectively. On the other hand, the lowest level of complexity of EEG signal belongs to hand-open and rest condition in ME, and MI sessions, respectively. Employing fractal theory in analysis of bio signals is not limited to EEG signal, and can be further investigated in other types of human's bio signals in different conditions. The result of these investigations can vastly been employed for the rehabilitation purpose.

Although many studies confirmed the capability of BMI systems in controlling multi degrees-of-freedom (DOF) prosthetic devices using invasive approaches, BMI research using noninvasive paradigms is still in its infancy. In this paper, a new robotic BMI platform has been developed using electroencephalography (EEG) technology to control a 6-DOF robotic arm. EEG signals were collected from the scalp using a wireless headset exploiting a new fast-training paradigm named as "imagined body kinematics". A regression model was employed to decode the kinematic parameters from the EEG signals. The subjects were instructed to voluntarily control a virtual cursor in multiple trials to hit different pre-programmed targets on a screen in an optimized sequence. The command signals generated from hitting the targets during trials were applied to control sequential movements of the robotic arm in a discrete manner to manipulate an object in a two-dimensional workspace. This approach is derived from a basic shared control strategy where the robotic arm is responsible for carrying out complex maneuvers based on the user's intention. Our proposed BMI platform yielded a high success rate of 70% in a sequence-based manipulation task after only a short time of training (10 min). The developed platform serves as a proof-of-concept for EEG-based neuro-prosthetic devices.

The real-time, accurate driver fatigue and drowsiness detection can bring down the accident rate. This paper verify the superiority of the deep learning approaches over machine learning methods for driver fatigue detection using electrocardiography (ECG). Heart rate variability (HRV) derived from ECG, and directly controlled by the autonomic nervous system is a promising indicator for real-time driver fatigue estimation. The classification system use time domain, frequency domain and nonlinear HRV features to ensure high accuracy and detection rate. This study conducted on 10 healthy individuals in simulator driving environment. The deep learning architecture based on Stacked Autoencoders achieve an accuracy above 90% to determine the perceived fatigue in drivers.

Current implementations of the SBL framework are computationally expensive and typically handle fluctuations in the measurement noise using different heuristics that are unsuitable for real-time imaging applications. We address these shortcomings by decoupling the estimation of the sensor noise covariance and the sparsity profile of the sources, thereby yielding an efficient two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, we optimize a simplified non-sparse generative model to get an estimate of the sensor noise covariance and a good initialization of the group-sparsity profile of the sources. Sources obtained at this stage are equivalent to those estimated with the popular inverse method LORETA. In the second stage, we apply a fast SBL algorithm with the noise covariance fixed to the value obtained in the first stage to efficiently shrink to zero groups of sources that are irrelevant for explaining the EEG measurements. In addition, we derive an initialization to the first stage of the algorithm that is optimal in the least squares sense, which prevents delays due to suboptimal initial conditions. We validate our method on both simulated and real EEG data. Simulations show that the method is robust to measurement noise and performs well in real-time, with faster performance than two state of the art SBL solvers. On real error-related negativity EEG data, we obtain source images in agreement with the experimental literature. The method shows promise for real-time neuro-imaging and brain-machine interface applications.

Since seizure, in general, occur very infrequently it is highly recommended for self-regulated disclosure of it during longstanding EEG measurement. The data handled in our work is publicly accessible online comprising of five classes. The segments in data set for each class were partitioned into two parts. Former comprised first 16 seconds (about 68%) of EEG which was used to train the network and rest of the signal were marked as test data. Statistical features for each class were evaluated. A supervised learning algorithm which is mostly used for classification and regression known as Support Vector Machine was used for classification of each set representing the different class. The classification results achieved taking all the five class was 91.42%.

Seizure severity and risks for patients depend on the evolution and spread of the hypersynchronous discharges. With standard visual inspection and pattern classification, this evolution could not be predicted early on. It is still unclear to what degree the seizure onset zone determines seizure severity. Such information would improve our understanding of ictal epileptic activity and the existing electroencephalogram (EEG)-based warning and intervention systems, providing specific reactions to upcoming seizure types. We investigate the possibility of predicting the future development of an epileptic seizure during the first seconds of recordings after their electrographic onset. MethodsBased on intracranial EEG recordings of 493 ictal events from 26 patients with focal epilepsy, a set of 25 time and frequency domain features was computed using nonoverlapping 1-second time windows, from the first 3, 5, and 10 seconds of ictal EEG. Three random forest classifiers were trained to predict the future evolution of the seizure, distinguishing between subclinical events, focal onset aware and impaired awareness, and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. ResultsResults show that early seizure type prediction is possible based on a single EEG channel located in the seizure onset zone with correct prediction rates of 76.2 14.5% for distinguishing subclinical electrographic events from clinically manifest seizures, 75 +/- 16.8% for distinguishing focal onset seizures that are or are not bilateral tonic-clonic, and 71.4 +/- 17.2% for distinguishing between focal onset seizures with or without impaired awareness. All predictions are above the chance level (P < .01). SignificanceThese findings provide the basis for developing systems for specific early warning of patients and health care providers, and for targeting EEG-based closed-loop intervention approaches to electrographic patterns with a high inherent risk to become clinically manifest.

One of the most avant-garde approaches in this regard is the discovery of connectivity patterns among different parts of the human brain unveiled by very diverse sources of information (e.g. magneto- or electro-encephalography - M/EEG, functional and structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging - fMRI and sMRI, or positron emission tomography - PET), coining the so-called brain connectomics discipline. Surprisingly, even though contributions related to the brain connectome abound in the literature, far too little attention has been paid to the exploitation of such complex spatial-temporal patterns to classify the task performed by the subject while brain signals are being registered. This manuscript covers this research niche by elaborating on the extraction of topological features from the graph modeling the brain connectivity under different tasks. By resorting to public information from the Human Connectome Project, the work will show that a selected subset of topological predictors from M/EEG connectomes suffices for accurately predicting (with average accuracy scores of up to 95%) the task performed by the subject at hand, further insights given on their predictive power when the M/EEG connectivity is inferred over different frequency bands.

J	Sharma, RR; Pachori, RB				Sharma, Rishi Raj; Pachori, Ram Bilas			Time-frequency representation using IEVDHM-HT with application to classification of epileptic EEG signals	IET SCIENCE MEASUREMENT & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							WIGNER-VILLE DISTRIBUTION; CROSS-TERMS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; SEIZURE; DECOMPOSITION; ENHANCEMENT; PATTERN; ROBUST; BANK	Time-frequency representation (TFR) is useful for non-stationary signal analysis as it provides information about the time-varying frequency components. This study proposes a novel TFR based on the improved eigenvalue decomposition of Hankel matrix and Hilbert transform (IEVDHM-HT). In the proposed method, first the authors decompose non-stationary signals using the IEVDHM with suitably defined criterion for eigenvalue selection, requirement of number of iterations, and new component merging criteria. Furthermore, the HT is applied on extracted components in order to obtain the TFR of non-stationary signals. The performance of proposed TFR has been evaluated on synthetic signals in clean and white noise environment with different signal-to-noise ratios. The proposed method gives good performance in terms of Renyi entropy measure in comparison with other existing methods. Application of the proposed TFR is also shown for the classification of epileptic seizure electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM) with radial basis function kernel is used for classification of seizure and seizure-free EEG signals obtained from the publicly available database by the University of Bonn, Germany. The proposed method has achieved classification accuracy 100% for the studied EEG database.

Compared with physiological signal, however, EEG signal is more difficult to obtain and more expensive so that it still cannot be utilized effectively and sufficiently. In this paper, we propose a method to enhance the performance of physiological-based emotion recognition system, where EEG signal is considered as privileged information and only available during training. Discriminative canonical correlation analysis (DCCA) is used to capture the consistency and complementarity from between physiological and EEG features, and then, a new emotional-relevant discriminative space can be constructed. During training period, physiological and EEG features are projected into an emotional discriminative space by using DCCA with the help of EEG signals. And then, machine learning techniques are utilized to build emotion recognizer for projected affective samples. During testing period, only peripheral signals are used for emotion recognition. The experimental results on two databases demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better recognition performance than existing methods.

Intracranial EEG (iEEG) data enhances the training of deep learning models of the human brain, yet is often prohibitive due to the invasive recording process. A more convenient alternative is to record brain activity using scalp electrodes. However, the inherent noise associated with scalp EEG data often impedes the learning process of neural models, achieving substandard performance. Here, an ensemble deep learning architecture for nonlinearly mapping scalp to iEEG data is proposed. The proposed architecture exploits the information from a limited number of joint scalp-intracranial recording to establish a novel methodology for detecting the epileptic discharges from the sEEG of a general population of subjects. Statistical tests and qualitative analysis have revealed that the generated pseudo-intracranial data are highly correlated with the true intracranial data. This facilitated the detection of IEDs from the scalp recordings where such waveforms are not often visible. As a real-world clinical application, these pseudo-iEEGs are then used by a convolutional neural network for the automated classification of intracranial epileptic discharges (IEDs) and non-IED of trials in the context of epilepsy analysis. Although the aim of this work was to circumvent the unavailability of iEEG and the limitations of sEEG, we have achieved a classification accuracy of 68% an increase of 6% over the previously proposed linear regression mapping.

Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) could provide an alternative approach to solve these problems. However, the current BCIs have low classification accuracy and require tedious human-learning procedures. The use of complicated Electroencephalogram (EEG) caps, where many electrodes must be attached on the user's head to identify imaginary motor commands, brings a lot of inconvenience. In this demonstration, we will showcase EXGbuds, a compact, non-obtrusive, and comfortable wearable device with non-invasive biosensing technology. People can comfortably wear it for long hours without tiring. Under our developed machine learning algorithms, we can identify various eye movements and facial expressions with over 95% accuracy, such that people with motor disabilities could have a fun time to play VR games totally "Hands-free".

The EEG recordings are obtained from an open database which has been widely studied with many different combinations of feature extraction and classification techniques. Cepstral analysis technique is mainly used for speech recognition, seismological problems, mechanical part tests, etc. Utility of cepstral analysis based features in EEG signal classification is explored in the paper. In the proposed study, mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are computed in the feature extraction stage and used in neural network based classification stage. MFCCs are calculated based on a frequency analysis depending on filter bank of approximately critical bandwidths. The experimental results have shown that the proposed method is superior to most of the previous studies using the same dataset in classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. This achieved success is the result of applying cepstral analysis technique to extract features. The system is promising to be used in real time seizure detection systems as the neural network adopted in the proposed method is inherently of non-iterative nature.

Recent studies have concentrated on developing efficient algorithms for the EEG analysis and diagnosis of epilepsy. A major bottleneck during the algorithm development is that, whether to consider a lengthy signal to analyze or a part of the signal for producing an adequate classification result. In this work, we analyzed the epileptic classification performance of the features from short durational segment of the signal. Two wellknown entropy features are extracted from the random segments.

Manual staging is resource intensive and time consuming, and thus considerable effort must be spent to ensure inter-rater reliability. As a result, there is a great interest in techniques based on signal processing and machine learning for a completely Automatic Sleep Stage Classification (ASSC). Methods: In this paper, we present a single-EEG-sensor ASSC technique based on the dynamic reconfiguration of different aspects of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) estimated between predefined frequency pairs over 5 s epoch lengths. The proposed analytic scheme is demonstrated using the PhysioNet Sleep European Data Format (EDF) Database with repeat recordings from 20 healthy young adults. We validate our methodology in a second sleep dataset. Results: We achieved very high classification sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 96.2 +/- 2.2%, 94.2 +/- 2.3%, and 94.4 +/- 2.2% across 20 folds, respectively, and also a high mean F1 score (92%, range 90-94%) when a multi-class Naive Bayes classifier was applied. High classification performance has been achieved also in the second sleep dataset. Conclusions: Our method outperformed the accuracy of previous studies not only on different datasets but also on the same database. Significance: Single-sensor ASSC makes the entire methodology appropriate for longitudinal monitoring using wearable EEG in real-world and laboratory-oriented environments.

The independence and linear restrictions are relaxed using several ICA mixture models (ICAMMs) obtaining a two-layer artificial neural network structure. This allows for dependence between sources of different classes, and thus, a myriad of multidimensional probability density functions can be accurate modeled. This paper proposes a new probabilistic distance (PDI) between the parameters learned for two ICAMMs. The PDI is computed explicitly, unlike the popular Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) and other similar metrics, removing the need for numerical integration. Furthermore, the PDI is symmetric and bounded within 0 and 1, which enables its use as a posterior probability in fusion approaches. In this paper, the PDI is employed for change detection by measuring the distance between two ICAMMs learned in consecutive time windows. The changes might be associated with relevant states from a process under analysis that are explicitly reflected in the learned ICAMM parameters. The proposed distance was tested in two challenging applications using simulated and real data: 1) detecting flaws in materials using ultrasounds and 2) detecting changes in electroencephalography signals from humans performing neuropsychological tests. The results demonstrate that the PDI outperforms the KLD in change-detection capabilities.

Dutch TeleEpilepsy Consortium	Multimodal seizure detection: A review	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						accelerometry; epilepsy; heart rate; seizure monitoring; SUDEP	DETECTION SYSTEMS; CLONIC SEIZURES; EPILEPSY; SUDEP	A review is given on the combined use of multiple modalities in non electroencephalography (EEG)-based detection of motor seizures in children and adults. A literature search of papers was done on multimodal seizure detection with extraction of data on type of modalities, study design and algorithm, sensitivity, false detection rate, and seizure types. Evidence of superiority was sought for using multiple instead of single modalities. Seven papers were found from 2010 to 2017, mostly using contact sensors such as accelerometers (n = 5), electromyography (n = 2), heart rate (n = 2), electrodermal activity (n = 1), and oximetry (n = 1). Remote sensors included video, radar, movement, and sound. All studies but one were in-hospital, with video-EEG as a gold standard. Algorithms were based on physiology and supervised machine learning, but did not always include a separate test dataset. Sensitivity ranged from 4% to 100% and false detection rate from 0.25 to 20 per 8hours. Tonic-clonic seizure detection performed best. False detections tended to be restricted to a minority (16%-30%) of patients. Use of multiple sensors increased sensitivity; false detections decreased in one study, but increased in another. These preliminary studies suggest that detection of tonic-clonic seizures might be feasible, but larger field studies are required under more rigorous design that precludes bias. Generic algorithms probably suffice for the majority of patients.	[Leijten, Frans S.

Varying in complexity of cognitive tasks, mental load results in different EEG recordings. Classification of mental load is one of core issues in studies on working memory. Various machine learning methods have been introduced into this area, achieving competitive performance. Inspired by the recent breakthrough via deep recurrent convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on classifying mental load, we propose improved CNNs methods for this task. Specifically, our frameworks contain both single-model and double-model methods. With the help of our models, spatial, spectral, and temporal information of EEG data is taken into consideration. Meanwhile, a novel fusion strategy for utilizing different networks is introduced in this work. The proposed methods have been compared with state-of-the-art ones on the same EEG database. The comparison results show that both our single-model method and double-model method can achieve comparable or even better performance than the well-performed deep recurrent CNNs. Furthermore, our proposed CNNs models contain less parameters than state-of-the-art ones, making it be more competitive in further practical application. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Relevant Frequency Band Selection using Sequential Forward Feature Selection for Motor Imagery Brain Computer Interfaces	2018 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (IEEE SSCI)			English	Proceedings Paper	8th IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)	NOV 18-21, 2018	Bengaluru, INDIA	IEEE		Common spatial pattern; Motor imagery; Brain computer interface	COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERN; SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; CLASSIFICATION; FILTER	In order to provide basic communication abilities to people with motor disability, motor imagery brain computer interface is one of most widely used technique. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm (Composite Filter Bank based stationary CSP) for determining subject as well as task specific discriminative frequency bands for classification of motor imagery tasks. It is noted in the literature that while performing any motor imagery tasks, two major frequency band of EEG spectrum i.e mu (7-12 Hz) as well as beta (12-30 Hz) bands are actively involved. Hence, in most of the literature work EEG signals were filtered using a frequency band of 7-30 Hz usually before using CSP transformation. However, it is possible that some of the frequencies may not provide useful features to distinguish motor imagery tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to select a subset of relevant frequency bands using sequential forward feature selection method from a composite filter bank which consists of Prior-known EEG frequency bands and a set of variable size overlapping frequency bands to improve the performance of motor imagery tasks classification. Experimental results of the proposed work on publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Friedman statistical test conducted further shows that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the existing methods.	[Kirar, Jyoti Singh] Shiv Nadar Univ, Greater Noida, India; [Agrawal, R.

BCIs allow people including completely locked-in patients to communicate with others without actual movements of body. Whereas EEGs are usually observed by multiple electrodes, single-channel measurement has been recently studied for gaining the simplicity of use. However, existing single-channel BCI studies have evaluated the performance on their own, private datasets that are not accessible from other researchers. Therefore, it remains a practical challenge to determine the optimal combination of channel, feature, and classifier using a public dataset. For the assessment, we used an open-access database (BCI competition IV dataset 2a) and a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. We found that support vector machine or multilayer perceptron with power spectrum or single-channel common spectral patterns of C3 or C4 position showed high classification accuracies in all subjects (mean: 63.5 +/- 0.4%, maximum: 86.6 +/- 0.4%).

The success rate of human emotion recognition has high implication in practical applications such as Human Machine Interaction, anomaly detection, surveillance, etc. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is one of the highly favored computational intelligence techniques for human emotion recognition. However, the performance of traditional ANN is not satisfactory in case of applications such as human emotion analysis. This leads to the necessity of modified ANN with better performance than the conventional systems. In this paper, we propose Circular Back Propagation Neural Network (CBPN) and Deep Kohonen Neural Network (DKNN) to overcome drawbacks of the traditional neural networks regarding computational complexity and accuracy. Performance of the proposals is explored in classifying different emotions of humans using Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. It has been validated that the proposals have better performance than the related methods.	[Hemanth, D.

It has been observed that among total number of accidents, 20% are contributed from driver fatigue. Acknowledging the existing data it is clear that a notification system for driver fatigue is of at most importance. Over the past a large number of strategies have been tested out and among them EEC based systems have shown to be the most accurate and reliable to estimate driver's cognitive state. The direct relation of brain activity to EEC signal explains its high accuracy in a fatigue detection system. Current researches in machine learning as well as deep learning have shown a new perspective in EEC data analysis. This work proposed a highly accurate, EEC based driver fatigue classification system which can reduce the rate of fatigue related road accidents using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The results showed that the relative power of theta, alpha, beta and delta showed significant correlation to driver fatigue. The selected features were trained and evaluated using 20 well established classifiers in the field of driver fatigue. Among all the classifiers tested, the Fine Tree, Subspace KNN, Fine Gaussian SVM, and Weighted KNN were performed to the highest accuracy levels. Different performance metrics are used for this work and Deep Autoencoder and KNN are identified as the best suitable Deep learning and Machine Learning Algorithms for driver fatigue prediction with an accuracy of 99.7% and 99.6 % respectively.

In this paper, we investigate the suitability of imagined speech for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Approach. A novel method based on covariance matrix descriptors, which lie in Riemannian manifold, and the relevance vector machines classifier is proposed. The method is applied on electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and tested in multiple subjects. Main results. The method is shown to outperform other approaches in the field with respect to accuracy and robustness. The algorithm is validated on various categories of speech, such as imagined pronunciation of vowels, short words and long words. The classification accuracy of our methodology is in all cases significantly above chance level, reaching a maximum of 70% for cases where we classify three words and 95% for cases of two words. Significance. The results reveal certain aspects that may affect the success of speech imagery classification from EEG signals, such as sound, meaning and word complexity. This can potentially extend the capability of utilizing speech imagery in future BCI applications. The dataset of speech imagery collected from total 15 subjects is also published.

However, the intra and inter subject variability in the brain signal patterns is a bottleneck for developing general BCI systems and needs to be tackled. To address this issue, recently filter banks are deployed to extract frequency specific features, which are then fused at the classification step. On the other hand, some works deploy optimization techniques to design (extract) subject-specific filters (features). While both approaches have reached compromising results, there is still a huge gap between the performance of the techniques and that of humans. In this regard, we propose a Bayesian framework to simultaneously optimize a number of filter banks and spatial filters according to the patterns of brain activity for each subject. Referred to as the Bayesian double band spectro-spatial filter optimization (B2B-SSFO), the proposed method aims at combining the advantages of the two aforementioned approaches, and consists of two bandpass filters providing frequency specific features for each subject. The proposed framework is evaluated on dataset 2b from BCI Competition IV. The proposed B2B-SSFO approach outperforms its counterparts and introduces a robust framework for motor imagery studies.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is an relevant tool for analyzing brain related disorders. Currently, manual reading of EEG is widely adopted by neurologists to diagnose epilepsy and related disorders. The process is erroneous as it involves fatigues due to continuous monitoring of nonstationary signals. The automated seizure detection may assist neurologist to automate the process and diagnose seizure signals with high accuracy. The nonlinearity of the EEG signals is evaluated by decomposing the signals for various types of filters according to the oscillatory behaviour of the signals. The computation of spectral features from the subbands obtained from Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) are used as a feature for classifying the different classes of test signals. In this work, two different classification problems have been considered on bivariate signals. First problem is normal (N) and ictal (I) and second is normal (N), inter-ictal (IC) and ictal (I). Features obtained from the EEG signals of these classes are fed to the input of three different classifiers namely, Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Networks (MLPNN) and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM).

Events of interest such as seizures are easily confused with signal artifacts (e.g., eye movements) or benign variants (e.g., slowing). Commercially available systems suffer from unacceptably high false alarm rates. Deep learning algorithms that employ high dimensional models have not previously been effective due to the lack of big data resources. In this paper, we use the TUH EEG Seizure Corpus to evaluate a variety of hybrid deep structures including Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory Networks. We introduce a novel recurrent convolutional architecture that delivers 30% sensitivity at 7 false alarms per 24 hours. We have also evaluated our system on a held-out evaluation set based on the Duke University Seizure Corpus and demonstrate that performance trends are similar to the TUH EEG Seizure Corpus. This is a significant finding because the Duke corpus was collected with different instrumentation and at different hospitals. Our work shows that deep learning architectures that integrate spatial and temporal contexts are critical to achieving state of the art performance and will enable a new generation of clinically-acceptable technology.

It is characterized by a common oscillatory pattern in which resting-state alpha activity is replaced by cross-frequency coupling of low- and high-frequency oscillations. We undertook a data-driven approach using support vector machine learning for analyzing resting-state electroencephalography oscillatory patterns in patients with Parkinson's disease, neuropathic pain, tinnitus, and depression. We show a spectrally equivalent but spatially distinct form of TCD that depends on the specific disorder. However, we also identify brain areas that are common to the pathology of Parkinson's disease, pain, tinnitus, and depression. This study therefore supports the validity of TCD as an oscillatory mechanism underlying diverse neurological disorders.

With the development of pervasive sensor technologies, physiological signals can be captured continuously to prevent the serious outcomes caused by epilepsy. However, the progress on seizure prediction has been hindered by the lack of automatic early warning system. The existing research is classifying electroencephalograph (EEG) clips and is distinguishing the clips of onset epileptic seizures. Deep learning is a promising method to analyze the large-scale unlabeled data and to widely spread the clinical treatment and risk prediction. In this paper, we outline a patient-specific method for extracting the frequency domain and time-series data features based on the two-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A data preprocessing method based on the discrete Fourier transform is proposed to convert the time-domain signal of the EEG data to the frequency-domain signal. Long short-term memory networks are introduced in seizure prediction using pre-seizure clips of the EEG dataset, expanding the use of deep learning algorithms with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Furthermore, the proposed CNN and RNN are compared with the traditional machine learning algorithms, such as linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression, and the evaluation criteria are on the area under the curve. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively extract the latent features with meaningful interpretation and exhibits excellent performance for predicting epileptic preictal state changes, and hence is an effective method in detecting the epileptic seizure.

The P300 - an Evoked Related Potential (ERP) - is induced for purpose by visual stimuli. The developed Brain-Computer Interface is made up by: (i) acquisition unit; (ii) processing unit and (iii) navigation unit. The acquisition unit is a wireless 32-channel EEG headset collecting data from 6 electrodes (parietal-cortex area). The processing unit is a dedicated mu PC performing stimuli delivery, data gathering, Machine Learning (ML), real-time hyper-dimensional classification leading to the user intention interpretation. The ML stage is based on a custom algorithm (t-RIDE) which trains the following classification stage on the user-tuned P300 reference features. The real-time classification performs a functional approach for time-domain features extraction, which reduce the amount of data to be analyzed. The Raspberry-based navigation unit actuates the received commands and support the wheelchair motion using peripheral sensors (USB camera for video processing, ultrasound sensors). Differently from related works, the proposed protocol for stimulation is aware of the environment. The experimental results, based on a dataset of 5 subjects, demonstrate that: (i) the implemented ML algorithm allows a complete P300 spatio-temporal characterization in 1.95 s using only 22 target brain visual stimuli (88 s/direction); (ii) the complete classification chain (from features extraction to validation) takes in the worst case only 19.65 ms +/- 10.1, allowing real-time control; (iii) the classification accuracy of the implemented BCI is 80.5 +/- 4.1% on single-trial.

Current neuroimaging research suggests that presaccadic stimulation has a late effect on postsaccadic processing, in contrast to the early effect seen in behavioral studies. Human participants (both male and female) were instructed to saccade toward a face or a house that, on different trials, remained the same, changed, or disappeared during the saccade. We used a multivariate pattern analysis of electroencephalography data to decode face versus house processing directly after the saccade. The classifier was trained on separate trials without a saccade, where a house or face was presented at the fovea. When the saccade target remained the same across the saccade, we could reliably decode the target 123 ms after saccade offset. In contrast, when the target was changed during the saccade, the new target was decoded at a later time-point, 151 ms after saccade offset. The "same" condition advantage suggests that congruent presaccadic information facilitates processing of the postsaccadic stimulus compared with incongruent information. Finally, the saccade target could be decoded above chance even when it had been removed during the saccade, albeit with a slower time course (162 ms) and poorer signal strength. These findings indicate that information about the (peripheral) presaccadic stimulus is transferred across the saccade so that it becomes quickly available and influences processing at its expected new retinal position (the fovea).

Most researches have focused on finding particularly effective features and classifiers to achieve higher classification accuracy in some cases, while most methods are only effective under specific tasks or data and lack broad applicability. In this paper, we propose a novel baseline strategy that introducing emotional features to acquire a newly generated baseline and then, calibrate the individualized features in the emotional features, so that decrease the experimental errors and improve the versatility and effectiveness of the classification method. We performed a classification comparison experiment with baseline-strategy and no baseline-strategy on the DEAP dataset. The selected methods adopt different power spectral density (PSD) feature extraction methods and are classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) respectively. The results showed that the experiments with the baseline-strategy achieved better classification results.

The proposal parameters allow controlling the number of selected spatio-spectral components and CSP features. The experimental results evidence an improved accuracy in comparison with CSP, FB and SFB assessed in the BCI competition IV dataset IIa.

A number of innovative algorithms have been introduced that can aid in epilepsy diagnosis with a high degree of accuracy. In recent years, the frontiers of computational epilepsy research have moved to seizure prediction, a more challenging problem. While antiepileptic medication can result in complete seizure freedom in many patients with epilepsy, up to one-third of patients living with epilepsy will have medically intractable epilepsy, where medications reduce seizure frequency but do not completely control seizures. If a seizure can be predicted prior to its clinical manifestation, then there is potential for abortive treatment to be given, either self-administered or via an implanted device administering medication or electrical stimulation. This will have a far-reaching impact on the treatment of epilepsy and patient's quality of life. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of recent efforts and journal articles on seizure prediction. The technologies developed for epilepsy diagnosis and seizure detection are being adapted and extended for seizure prediction. The paper ends with some novel ideas for seizure prediction using the increasingly ubiquitous machine learning technology, particularly deep neural network machine learning. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We propose a Markov Switching Model (MSM) to achieve quick detection of an event related desynchronization (ERD) elicited bymotor imagery (MI) and recorded by electroencephalography (EEG). Conventional brain computer interfaces (BCI) rely on sliding window classifiers in order to perform online continuous classification of the rest vs. MI classes. Based on this approach, the detection of abrupt changes in the sensorimotor power suffers from an intrinsic delay caused by the necessity of computing an estimate of variance across several tenths of a second. Here we propose to avoid explicitly computing the EEG signal variance, and estimate the ERD state directly from the voltage information, in order to reduce the detection latency. This is achieved by using a model suitable in situations characterized by abrupt changes of state, the MSM. In our implementation, the model takes the form of a Gaussian observation model whose variance is governed by two latent discrete states with Markovian dynamics. Its objective is to estimate the brain state (i.e., rest vs. ERD) given the EEG voltage, spatially filtered by common spatial pattern (CSP), as observation. The two variances associated with the two latent states are calibrated using the variance of the CSP projection during rest and MI, respectively. The transition matrix of the latent states is optimized by the "quickest detection" strategy that minimizes a cost function of detection latency and false positive rate. Data collected by a dry EEG system from 50 healthy subjects, was used to assess performance and compare the MSM with several logistic regression classifiers of different sliding window lengths. As a result, the MSM achieves a significantly better tradeoff between latency, false positive and true positive rates. The proposed model could be used to achieve a more reactive and stable control of a neuroprosthesis. This is a desirable property in BCI-based neurorehabilitation, where proprioceptive feedback is provided based on the patient's brain signal. Indeed, it is hypothesized that simultaneous contingent association between brain signals and proprioceptive feedback induces superior associative learning.

Though many previous approaches have been proposed to solve it, most of them suffer from poor generalization for unknown identity. In this paper, we proposed a deep identity confusion method to extract powerful task-specific and identity-invariant feature and then score sleep stages with non-linear machine learning model. With an unified CNN-LSTM structure employed for feature extraction, we implement identity confusion with an extra identity prediction branch and apply inversed gradients to frontal layers during back-propagation. Then the deep feature is used to train a XGBoost classifier. Experiments on Sleep-EDF benchmarks achieve classification accuracy and macro F1 score of 84.1% and 78.9%, and it suggests proposed method boost performance of origin deep learning base model and show competitive result comparing to state-of-the-art methods.

Eventually, machine learning technique is required for automatic sleep stage scoring. Therefore, a new feature extraction method for EEG analysis and classification is discussed based on the statistical properties of cepstral coefficients. The sleep EEG signal is segmented into 30 s epoch and each epoch is decomposed into different frequency bands: Gamma (gamma), Beta (beta), Alpha (alpha), Theta (theta) and Delta (delta) by employing the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The statistical properties of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), which represent the short term spectral characteristics of the wavelet coefficients, are extracted. The MFCC feature vectors are incorporated into the Gaussian Mixture Model with Expectation Maximization (GMM-EM) to classify various sleep stages: Wake, Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and Non-Rapid Eye Movement (N-REM) stage1 (S1), N-REM stage2 (S2), N-REM stage3 (S3), N-REM stage4 (S4). The proposed feature extraction for sleep stage scoring achieves 88.71% of average classification accuracy.

Musical NeuroPicks: A consumer-grade BCI for on-demand music streaming services	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						EEG; Music evaluation; Recommendation-systems; Human computer interaction	EEG; ASYMMETRY	We investigated the possibility of using a machine-learning scheme in conjunction with commercial wearable EEG-devices for translating listener's subjective experience of music into scores that can be used in popular on-demand music streaming services. Our study resulted into two variants, differing in terms of performance and execution time, and hence, subserving distinct applications in online streaming music platforms. The first method, NeuroPicks, is extremely accurate but slower. It is based on the well-established neuroscientific concepts of brainwave frequency bands, activation asymmetry index and cross frequency coupling (CFC). The second method, NeuroPicks VQ, offers prompt predictions of lower credibility and relies on a custom-built version of vector quantization procedure that facilitates a novel parameterization of the music-modulated brainwaves. Beyond the feature engineering step, both methods exploit the inherent efficiency of extreme learning machines (ELMs) so as to translate, in a personalized fashion, the derived patterns into a listener's score. NeuroPicks method may find applications as an integral part of contemporary music recommendation systems, while NeuroPicks VQ can control the selection of music tracks. Encouraging experimental results, from a pragmatic use of the systems, are presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Kalaganis, F. P.; Laskaris, N.

J	Luo, TJ; Zhou, CL; Chao, F				Luo, Tian-jian; Zhou, Chang-le; Chao, Fei			Exploring spatial-frequency-sequential relationships for motor imagery classification with recurrent neural network	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						EEG signals classification; Spatial-frequency-sequential relationships; Deep recurrent neural networks; Brain computer interface	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; PATTERN; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM; SIGNALS; FILTERS	Background: Conventional methods of motor imagery brain computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) suffer from the limited number of samples and simplified features, so as to produce poor performances with spatial-frequency features and shallow classifiers. Methods: Alternatively, this paper applies a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) with a sliding window cropping strategy (SWCS) to signal classification of MI-BCIs. The spatial-frequency features are first extracted by the filter bank common spatial pattern (FB-CSP) algorithm, and such features are cropped by the SWCS into time slices. By extracting spatial-frequency-sequential relationships, the cropped time slices are then fed into RNN for classification. In order to overcome the memory distractions, the commonly used gated recurrent unit (GRU) and long-short term memory (LSTM) unit are applied to the RNN architecture, and experimental results are used to determine which unit is more suitable for processing EEG signals. Results: Experimental results on common BCI benchmark datasets show that the spatial-frequency-sequential relationships outperform all other competing spatial-frequency methods. In particular, the proposed GRU-RNN architecture achieves the lowest misclassification rates on all BCI benchmark datasets. Conclusion: By introducing spatial-frequency-sequential relationships with cropping time slice samples, the proposed method gives a novel way to construct and model high accuracy and robustness MI-BCIs based on limited trials of EEG signals.

We focused in this paper on the classification of two types of MI tasks (left-hand x right-hand and right-hand x foot) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. We compare various feature extraction techniques by combining common spatial pattern (CSP) with several features: variance, energy, entropy and logarithmic band power (LBP). Three types of classifiers were employed for classification: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). We tested our proposed method using data recorded from 17 subjects, provided by BCI-Competition III and IV. The results show that features extracted using a combination of CSP and LBP produce highest classification accuracy. LDA is more suitable than other classifiers to classify features extracted using CSP and LBP.

The EEG signal contains information about the electrical activity of the brain. Traditionally, neurologists employ direct visual inspection to identify epileptiform abnormalities. This technique can be time-consuming, limited by technical artifact, provides variable results secondary to reader expertise level, and is limited in identifying abnormalities. Therefore, it is essential to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to automatically distinguish the class of these EEG signals using machine learning techniques. This is the first study to employ the convolutional neural network (CNN) for analysis of EEG signals. In this work, a 13-layer deep convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm is implemented to detect normal, preictal, and seizure classes. The proposed technique achieved an accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of 88.67%, 90.00% and 95.00%, respectively.	[Acharya, U.

So EEG signal recognition plays an important role in brain-computer interaction (BCI). In this study, to enhance the ability of classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM), deep neural networks (DNN), k-nearest neighbor method (kNN), decision tree (DT), a feature extraction method is proposed using techniques of fast Fourier transform (FFT) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. In the proposed method, the raw EEG data was transformed into power spectrum of FFT at first, and then to find frequencies decided by area under curve (AUC) of ROC between the value of spectrums of different classes of metal tasks. Experiment results using benchmark data and BCI competition II data showed the effectiveness of the proposed method for all above classifiers.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during imagined speech production are difficult to decode accurately, due to factors such as weak neural correlates and spatial specificity, and signal noise during the recording process. In this study, a dataset of imagined speech recordings obtained during production of eleven different units of imagined speech is used to investigate the relative effects of different features on classification accuracy. Three distinct feature-sets are computed from the data: a linear feature-set, a non-linear feature-set, and a feature-set comprised only of mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC). Each feature-set is used to train a decision tree classifier and a Support Vector Machine classifier. The results indicate that the use of MFCC features provides greater discrimination of imagined speech EEG recordings in comparison with the other features evaluated, and that phonological differences between imagined words can serve as an aid to classification.

In many disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or stroke, people can communicate with the external world in a limited degree. However, they may be disabled, while their mind is still intact. Various tongue-machine interface techniques has been developed to support these people by providing additional communication pathway. In this study, we aimed to develop a tongue-machine interface approach by investigating pattern of glossokinetic potential (GKP) signals using neural networks via simple right/left tongue touchings to the buccal walls for 1-D control and communication, named as GKP-based TMI. As can be known in the literature, the tongue is connected to the brain via hypoglossal cranial nerve. Therefore, it generally escapes from the severe damages, in spinal cord injuries and was slowly affected than limbs of persons suffering from many neuromuscular degenerative disorders. In this work, 8 male and 2 female naive healthy subjects, aged 22 to 34 years, participated. Multilayer neural network and probabilistic neural network were employed as classification algorithms with root-mean-square and power spectral density feature extraction operations. Then the greatest success rate achieved was 97.25%. This study may serve disabled people to control assistive devices in natural, unobtrusive, speedy and reliable manner. Moreover, it is expected that GKP-based TMI could be a collaboration channel for traditional electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain computer interfaces which have significant inadequacies arisen from the EEG signals.

The differences in the EEG signal neural representations from the norm indicates abnormality and thus classifiable. It is known that dyslexia, a neurological disorder that impairs the subject ability to properly read or write, is caused by the inefficiency of the brain's left hemisphere processing region. This study looks into the classification of EEG signals of writing word, non-word and a combination of both in identifying subjects as either normal, poor dyslexic or as capable dyslexic. With an overall total of 21 subjects having an age range of 6 to 11 years old band power features were extracted from EEG signals recorded from eight (8) electrode locations which are, C3, C4, P3, P4, T7, T8, FC5 and FC6 that corresponds to the brain's learning pathway using Daubechies wavelet transform of order 2. A multiclass support vector machine (SVM) was applied as the classification algorithm with the classifier having three (3) different training data set of word, non-word and combination of both. Results showed an improved classifier performance with the combine training sets of word and non-word with an accuracy of 100% for word test data and 83.3% for non-word. Applying only word for the training data yielded an accuracy of 75%, and for the non-word, it is 58%.

Two categories of features were utilized namely a high dimensional feature set extracted from 22 EEG channels and a feature set extracted from two EEG channels (C3 and C4). Four signal classifiers namely KNN, Regression tree, NB and LDA are applied on wavelet-based EEG signal features for discrimination of four classes of motor imagery (MI) tasks (left hand, right hand, foot and tongue). Efficient discrimination of motor imagery tasks is significantly dependent on signal-to-noise ratio of EEG signals to enhance the performance of signal classifiers. A preprocessing technique is firstly applied on filtered EEG signals to remove contamination in the form of artifacts. Then, useful signal features are extracted from artifact free EEG signals, whereby relevant subsets with high predictive power are selected using feature selection technique. The best features subsets are fed into signal classifiers for classification purposes. A highest average classification accuracy of 73.06% and 72.95% was achieved using NB while classifying both features acquired from 2 and 22 EEG channels respectively.

A new method in frequency domain is presented to analyze intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) decomposed by EMD. They are used to determine whether the electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings contain seizure or not. Energy levels of the IMFs are extracted as threshold level to detect the changes caused by seizure activity. A scalar value energy resulting from the energy levels is individually used as an indicator of the epileptic EEG without the requirements of multidimensional feature vector and complex machine learning algorithms. The proposed methods are tested on different EEG recordings to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method and yield accuracy rate up to 97.89%.

Detection of brain activities is the vital element in these applications. This paper is employing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on EEG data acquired simultaneously from students in classroom to detect the changes of brain activities during learning process. Situational interest of subjects and the learning materials were evaluated through questionnaires. After preprocessing and segmentation of the data, SVD was applied on each segment separately. The 2-norms of the singular values were compared to the subject baseline and the overall result complied with the questionnaire result. Furthermore, feeding these features to Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier achieved 83.3% accuracy in differentiating between high and low situationally interested students. It is therefore, suggested that SVD could be applied successfully to detect changes in students' brain activities in classrooms.

It consists of a collection of second-order non-linear differential equations. This paper attempts to solve the equations using MATLAB in order to simulate cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. We also attempt to simulate cortical epileptic discharge using this model.

Epileptic Seizure Detection from EEG Signals Using Best Feature Subsets Based on Estimation of Mutual Information for Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes Classifiers	ADVANCES IN SYSTEMS, CONTROL AND AUTOMATION	Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Emerging Trends and Advances in Electrical Engineering and Renewable Energy (ETAEERE)	DEC 17-18, 2016	Majhitar, INDIA	Sikkim Manipal Inst Technol, Dept Elec & Elect Engn		Electroencephalogram (EEG); Epilepsy; Discrete wavelet transform (DWT); Mutual information (MI); Naive Bayes (NB); Support vector machine (SVM)	CLASSIFICATION	The detection of epileptic abnormality from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is achieved using pattern recognition system. In this work, to distinguish the epileptic seizure from normal EEG signal, pattern recognition is applied. Novel pattern recognition is studied with the conventional features which are extracted from discrete wavelet transform (DWT) sub-bands D3-D5 and A5 to detect epileptic seizure with support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes (NB) classifier for 14 varying combinations of set A to D with set E. The open source EEG data which is provided by University of Bonn, Germany, and Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), India, are used in this work. Further, the DWT coefficients obtained from D3-D5 to A5 sub-bands increases the computational burden of the classifier. So, feature selection based on the estimation of mutual information theory is applied to the DWT coefficients to obtain significant features required for the classifier to get better accuracy with lesser computational burden. The results show that SVM performs well for 9 data sets and NB performs better for 4 varying data sets. However, SVM and NB performed equally well in differentiating normal open EEG and epileptic data and afford an accuracy of 100%. In using CMCH data, SVM provides 100% accuracy with only top 2 ranked features.

We introduce the use of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) on raw EEG samples for supervised learning of 5 class sleep stage prediction. The network has 14 layers, takes as input the 30-s epoch to be classified as well as two preceding epochs and one following epoch for temporal context, and requires no signal preprocessing or feature extraction phase. We train and evaluate our system using data from the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS), a large multi-center cohort study including expert-rated polysomnographic records. Performance metrics reach the state of the art, with accuracy of 0.87 and Cohen kappa of 0.81. The use of a large cohort with multiple expert raters guarantees good generalization. Finally, we present a method for visualizing class-wise patterns learned by the network. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As brain is a chaos dynamical system, many complexity based methods have been used to track the dynamical changes of absence seizure EEG. However, most of these methods treat multichannel EEG recordings as a set of individual time series, which will inevitably lead to the loss of crucial cross-channel correlation in the epileptic network. Recently, a spatial-temporal permutation entropy method called multi-variate multiscale permutation entropy (MMPE) was proposed to measure the complexity of multichannel data. In this study, MMPE was applied to multichannel EEG for characterizing dynamics of absence seizure. It was found that the pre-ictal EEG exhibited a significant lower MMPE value than interictal EEG, and a significant higher MMPE value than the ictal EEG, indicating that the complexity of multichannel EEG decreased in the transition of brain activities. This finding confirmed the existence of a pre-seizure state in absence epilepsy. The identification ability of MMPE was tested against its original univariate complexity measures: permutation entropy (PE) and multiscale permutation entropy (MSPE), and another multivariate multiscale entropy: multivariate multiscale sample entropy (MMSE). After evaluating the performance by four classifiers (Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine), MMPE can achieve accuracy of 87.2% at least, which is about 15%, 12%, and 10% higher than that of PE, MSPE and MMSE. Hence, this work supports the view that EEG has a detectable change prior to an absence seizure, and MMPE could be considered as a candidate precursor of the impending absence seizures.

However, unlike other data, EEG signals have temporal, spatial and frequency characteristics. For the EEG based depression detection, how to preserve these features when EEG signals are fed into neural networks and select appropriate network structure to extract the corresponding inherent patterns is a problem that needs to be solved. Inspired by the application of deep learning in image processing, we used the distance-based projection method and the non-distance projection method to construct EEG signals as inputs of neural networks. Four different networks were used to extract inherent structure from constructed data. As a result, CNN outperformed other networks, with the highest classification accuracy of 77.20% using the non-distance projection method and 76.14% using the distance-based projection method. The results demonstrate that application of deep learning methods in the research of depression is feasible.

When an intention is initiated in the brain or an external stimulus is perceived, the underlying relevant processing alters brain activity. This alteration in brain activity can be reflected in EEG signal. The intention or stimulus perception is therefore classified based on the alteration in brain activity. It might be difficult to classify brain activities in the perception of shape-analogous English letters because the similar shape could lead to less difference in brain activity. In order to explore classification feasibility and classification performance of shape-analogous letters using EEG signal, we performed an experiment of shape-analogous letter perception, in where participants perceived four letters (i.e., 'p', 'q', and 'd') while EEG signal was recorded. The F-score method was employed to assess the discriminative power for each feature, and a subgroup of features with high discriminative powers was then selected and fed into classifiers. Five classifiers (i.e., k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Random Forest (RF) and AdaBoost (ADA)), which are either pervasive or advanced in the field of machine learning, were utilized to classify brain activities in perception of shape-analogous letters. For each classifier, its parameters and the number of used features were optimized. Based on the performance comparison among the classifiers, Random Forest (RF) classifier achieved a maximal accuracy of 74.1%, but it was not statistically significantly better than the SVM. Our study demonstrated that brain activities in perception of shape-analogous English letters can be classified based on EEG signal and showed that random forest classifier outperformed other classifiers according to the results of comparison.

Four alertness states were considered, namely 'engaged', 'calm', 'drowsy' and 'asleep'. The features used in the automatic selection are the energies associated with the conventional rhythms, delta, theta, alpha beta and gamma, extracted from overlapping windows of the different EEG channels. The selection process consists of two stages. In the first stage, the optimal brain regions, represented by sets of EEG channels, are selected using a simple search technique based on support vector machine (SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM) and LDA classifiers. In the second stage, a fuzzy rule-based alertness classification system (FRBACS) is used to identify, from the previously selected EEG channels, the optimal features and their supports. The IF-THEN rules used in FRBACS are constructed using a novel differential evolution-based search algorithm particularly designed for this task. Each alertness state is represented by a set of IF-THEN rules whose antecedent parts contain EEG rhythm/channel combination. The selected spatio-frequency features were found to be good indicators of the different alertness states, as judged by the classification performance of the FRBACS that was found to be comparable to those of the SVM, ELM and LDA classifiers. Moreover, the proposed classification system has the advantage of revealing simple and easy to interpret decision rules associated with each of the alertness states.

Electrode placement may differ from planning due to instrument deflection during surgical insertion. We present a regression-based model to predict instrument bending using image features extracted from structural and diffusion images. We compare three machine learning approaches: Random Forest, Feed-Forward Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory on accuracy in predicting global instrument bending in the context of SEEG implantation. We segment electrodes from post-implantation CT scans and interpolate position at 1mm intervals along the trajectory. Electrodes are modelled as elastic rods to quantify 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) bending using Darboux vectors. We train our models to predict instrument bending from image features. We then iteratively infer instrument positions from the predicted bending. In 32 SEEG post-implantation cases we were able to predict trajectory position with a MAE of 0.49 mm using RF. Comparatively a FFNN had MAE of 0.71 mm and LSTM had a MAE of 0.93 mm.

Unsupervised Learning of Spatiotemporal Interictal Discharges in Focal Epilepsy	NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Epileptogenic tissue; Interictal epileptiform discharges; Automated detection; Non-negative matrix factorization; Intracranial monitoring	SPIKE DETECTION; EEG; STIMULATION; DATABASE; SYSTEM; ADULTS	BACKGROUND: Interictal epileptiform discharges are an important biomarker for localization of focal epilepsy, especially in patients who undergo chronic intracranial monitoring. Manual detection of these pathophysiological events is cumbersome, but is still superior to current rule-based approaches in most automated algorithms. OBJECTIVE: To develop an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm for the improved, automated detection and localization of interictal epileptiform discharges based on spatiotemporal pattern recognition. METHODS: We decomposed 24 h of intracranial electroencephalography signals into basis functions and activation vectors using non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF). Thresholding the activation vector and the basis function of interest detected interictal epileptiform discharges in time and space (specific electrodes), respectively. We used convolutive NNMF, a refined algorithm, to add a temporal dimension to basis functions. RESULTS: The receiver operating characteristics for NNMF-based detection are close to the gold standard of human visual-based detection and superior to currently available alternative automated approaches (93% sensitivity and 97% specificity). The algorithm successfully identified thousands of interictal epileptiform discharges across a full day of neurophysiological recording and accurately summarized their localization into a single map. Adding a temporal window allowed for visualization of the archetypal propagation network of these epileptiform discharges. CONCLUSION: Unsupervised learning offers a powerful approach towards automated identification of recurrent pathological neurophysiological signals, which may have important implications for precise, quantitative, and individualized evaluation of focal epilepsy.

While these findings are consistent with theories of age-related declines in selective attention and inhibitory control, the degree to which older adults are able to selectively attend to relevant contextual information during encoding is unknown. To better understand the neural dynamics associated with selective attention during encoding, the current study applied multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) to oscillatory EEG in order to track moment-to-moment shifts of attention between relevant and irrelevant contextual information during encoding. Young and older adults studied pictures of objects in the presence of two contextual features: a color and a scene, and their attention was directed to the object's relationship with one of those contexts (i.e., target context). Results showed that patterns of oscillatory power successfully predicted whether selective attention was directed to a scene or color, across age groups. Individual differences in overall classification performance were associated with individual differences in target context memory accuracy during retrieval. However, changes in classification performance within a trial, suggestive of fluctuations in selective attention, predicted individual differences in hyper-binding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use MPVA techniques to decode attention during episodic encoding and the impact of attentional shifts toward distracting information on age-related context memory impairments and hyper-binding. These results are consistent with the as-of-yet unsubstantiated theory that age-related declines in context memory may be attributable to poorer selective attention and/or greater inhibitory deficits in older adults.

Hence, it is of great significance to develop automatic seizure detection technique. Methods: In this work, a seizure detection approach, synthesizing generalized Stockwell transform (GST), singular value decomposition (SVD) and random forest, was proposed. Utilizing GST, the raw EEG was transformed into a time-frequency matrix, then the global and local singular values were extracted by SVD from the holistic and partitioned matrices of GST, respectively. Subsequently, four local parameters were calculated from each vector of local singular values. Finally, the global singular value vectors and local parameters were respectively fed into two random forest classifiers for classification, and the final category of a testing EEG was voted based on sub-labels obtained from the trained classifiers. Results: Four most common but challenging classification tasks of Bonn EEG database were investigated. The highest accuracies of 99.12%, 99.63%, 99.03% and 98.62% were achieved using our presented technique, respectively. Conclusions: Our proposed technique is comparable or superior to other up-to-date methods. The presented method is promising and able to handle with kinds of epileptic seizure detection tasks with satisfactory accuracy.

Here, we show that in humans, neural signatures of memory reactivation are modulated by the phase of a theta oscillation. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while participants were cued to recall previously learned word-object associations, and time-resolved pattern classifiers were trained to detect neural reactivation of the target objects. Classifier fidelity rhythmically fluctuated at 7 or 8 Hz and was modulated by theta phase across the entire recall period. The phase of optimal classification was shifted approximately 180 degrees between encoding and retrieval. Inspired by animal work, we then computed "classifier-locked averages" to analyze how ongoing theta oscillations behaved around the time points at which the classifier indicated memory retrieval. We found strong theta (7 or 8 Hz) phase consistency approximately 300 ms before the time points of maximal neural memory reactivation. Our findings provide important evidence that the neural signatures of memory retrieval fluctuate and are time locked to the phase of an ongoing theta oscillation.

We applied time-resolved, multivariate decoding analysis to the pattern of rhythmic EEG activity that was registered while participants planned and executed individual elements from pre-learned, structured sequences. Across three experiments, the theta and alpha-band activity coded basic elements and abstract control representations, in particular, the ordinal position of basic elements, but also the identity and position of chunks. Further, a robust representation of higher level, chunk identity information was only found in individuals with above-median working memory capacity, potentially providing a neural-level explanation for working-memory differences in sequential performance. Our results suggest that by decoding oscillatory activity we can track how the cognitive system traverses through the states of a hierarchical control structure.

Prosthetic limbs can enhance the quality of life of amputees. To this end, anthropomorphic design and intuitive manipulation are two essential requirements. This paper presents a motor control framework for prosthetic control through Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) using Finite Automata Theory, and NeuCube Evolving Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture. Voluntary control of prosthetics requires decoding motor commands from the Central Nervous System of the amputee. Selection of the most suitable biomedical signal depends on many parameters such as level of amputation and muscle atrophy. Non-invasive BMI's have the possibility of supporting a wider range of amputees as it extracts the motor commands from the brain. In this paper, we present a proof of concept study on whether a cognitive computational model that is inspired by the motor control of the human body through muscle synergies combined with an anthropomorphic mechanical design, can result in accurate and robust prosthetic control through a noninvasive BMI. In future, learning of a complex Finite Automata that reflects complex upper limb motor behaviours will be investigated.

Unfortunately, the use of machine learning typically requires the collection of subject specific labelled data. This process is time-consuming and not productive from a user's point of view, as during calibration the user has to follow given instructions and cannot make own decisions. Only after calibration, the user is able to use the BCI freely. In this chapter, we describe how the supervised calibration process can be circumvented by unsupervised learning in which the decoder is trained while the user is utilising the system. We discuss three variations. First, expectation-maximisation (EM)-based training, which works wells empirically but can sometimes be unstable. Learning from label proportions (LLP)-based training, which is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution, but learns more slowly. Third, a hybrid approach combining the stability of LLP with the speed of learning of EM in a highly efficient and effective approach that can readily replace supervised decoders for event-related potential BCI.

In EEG classification, Feature Selection (FS) represents a pivotal phase, as these problems request the processing of a large amount of high-dimensional patterns. In this paper, FS has been solved by an embedded multi-objective genetic optimization procedure which evolves a population of potential solutions (subsets of features), subject to the simultaneous minimization of the misclassification ratio and number of selected attributes. Random Forests (RF) classifiers are adopted, due to their fast training and their compatibility with spread classes of very diverse patterns. The main contribution presented in this paper consists in introducing an inertial behavior to feature extraction. The available feature set is extended with features from previous time frames, and FS is performed on this extended set. In this context, the experimental analysis illustrates the impact of the temporal extension on FS. Additionally, two enhancements are proposed for the multi-objective optimization, to support an effective Pareto-ranking of the solutions in the expanded exploration search space. Thus, the number of trees in the embedded RF classifier is gradually increased, for reducing the computational load requested for the evaluation of the misclassification ratio, without impeding the exploration. Also, the preference for the minimization of misclassifications is set by introducing a dynamic objective function for describing the parsimony of the selected subset of attributes. The proposed FS is experimentally demonstrated on EEG data collected during mathematical tasks of gradual complexities.

To promote long-lasting motor recovery, these interventions have to be carried out across several weeks or even months. The success of these therapies partly relies on the performance of the system decoding movement intentions, which normally has to be recalibrated to deal with the nonstationarities of the cortical activity. Minimizing the recalibration times is important to reduce the setup preparation and maximize the effective therapy time. To date, a systematic analysis of the effect of recalibration strategies in EEG-driven interfaces for motor rehabilitation has not yet been performed. Data from patients with stroke (4 patients, 8 sessions) and spinal cord injury (SCI) (4 patients, 5 sessions) undergoing two different paradigms (self-paced and cue-guided, respectively) are used to study the performance of the EEG-based classification of motor intentions. Four calibration schemes are compared, considering different combinations of training datasets from previous and/or the validated session. The results show significant differences in classifier performances in terms of the true and false positives (TPs) and (FPs). Combining training data from previous sessions with data from the validation session provides the best compromise between the amount of data needed for calibration and the classifier performance. With this scheme, the average true (false) positive rates obtained are 85.3% (17.3%) and 72.9% (30.3%) for the self-paced and the cue-guided protocols, respectively. These results suggest that the use of optimal recalibration schemes for EEG-based classifiers of motor intentions leads to enhanced performances of these technologies, while not requiring long calibration phases prior to starting the intervention.

Unlike the existing deep neural networks in the literature, the proposed network allows us to analyze the learned network weights from a neurophysiological perspective, thus providing an insight into the underlying patterns inherent in motor imagery induced EEG signals. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on the BCI Competition IV-IIa dataset by comparing with the competing methods in terms of the Cohen's. value. For qualitative analysis, we also performed visual inspection of the activation patterns estimated from the learned network weights.

The proposed method consists of three stages. First, amultirate filterbank structure is proposed that is constructed using the basis vectors of discrete cosine transform. The proposed filterbank decomposes EEG signals into its respective brain rhythms: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. Second, these brain rhythms are statistically modeled with the class of self-similar Gaussian random processes, namely, fractional Brownian motion and fractional Gaussian noises. The statistics of these processes are modeled using a single parameter called the Hurst exponent. In the last stage, the value of Hurst exponent and autoregressive moving average parameters are used as features to design a binary support vectormachine classifier to classify pre-ictal, inter-ictal (epileptic with seizure free interval), and ictal (seizure) EEG segments. The performance of the classifier is assessedvia extensive analysison two widely used data set and is observed to provide good accuracy on both the data set. Thus, this paper proposes a novel signal model for EEG data that best captures the attributes of these signals and hence, allows to boost the classification accuracy of seizure and seizure-free epochs.

Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are known to be vulnerable to variabilities in background states of a user. Usually, no detailed information on these states is available even during the training stage. Thus there is a need in a method which is capable of taking background states into account in an unsupervised way. Approach. We propose a latent variable method that is based on a probabilistic model with a discrete latent variable. In order to estimate the model's parameters, we suggest to use the expectation maximization algorithm. The proposed method is aimed at assessing characteristics of background states without any corresponding data labeling. In the context of asynchronous motor imagery paradigm, we applied this method to the real data from twelve able-bodied subjects with open/closed eyes serving as background states. Main results. We found that the latent variable method improved classification of target states compared to the baseline method (in seven of twelve subjects). In addition, we found that our method was also capable of background states recognition (in six of twelve subjects). Significance. Without any supervised information on background states, the latent variable method provides a way to improve classification in BCI by taking background states into account at the training stage and then by making decisions on target states weighted by posterior probabilities of background states at the prediction stage.

Subjective and highly dynamic in nature, emotional arousal involves the whole body and particularly the brain. However, it has been difficult to relate subjective emotional arousal to an objective, neurophysiological marker-especially in naturalistic settings. We tested the association between continuously changing states of emotional arousal and oscillatory power in the brain during a VR roller coaster experience. We used novel spatial filtering approaches to predict self-reported emotional arousal from the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal of 38 participants. Periods of high vs. low emotional arousal could be classified with accuracies significantly above chance level. Our results are consistent with prior findings regarding emotional arousal in less naturalistic settings. We demonstrate a new approach to decode states of subjective emotional arousal from continuous EEG data in an immersive VR experience.	[Klotzsche, F.; Hofmann, S.; Nikulin, V.

Moreover, estimating emotions is widely used in different aspects such as psychology, neuroscience, entertainment, e-learning, etc. This paper aims to classify emotions through EEG signals. When it comes to emotion recognition, participants' opinions toward induced emotions are really case-dependent and thus corresponding labels might be imprecise and uncertain. Furthermore, it is acceptable that mixture classifiers lead to higher accuracy (ACE) and lower uncertainty. This paper, introduces new methods, including setting time intervals to process EEG signals, extracting relative values of nonlinear features and classifying them through Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) of evidence method. In this work, we used EEG signals which are taken from a very reliable database and the extracted features are classified by DST in order to reduce uncertainty and consequently achieve better results. First, time windows are determined based on signal complexity. Then, nonlinear features are extracted. Actually, this paper suggests feature variability through time intervals instead of absolute values of features and discriminant features are selected using genetic algorithm (GA). Finally, data is fed in the classification process and different classifiers are combined through DST. 10-fold cross-validation is applied and the results are extracted and compared with some basic classifiers. We managed to achieve high classification performance in terms of emotion recognition (ACC = 92.57%). Results prove that EEG signals can reflect emotional responses of the brain and the proposed method is effective which gives considerably precise estimation of emotions.

Robust detection of epileptic seizures based on L1-penalized robust regression of EEG signals	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						EEG signals; Epileptic seizures; Robust detection; Feature learning; Random forest	RECURRENCE QUANTIFICATION ANALYSIS; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM; TRANSFORM; MACHINE	Epilepsy is the second common brain disorder affecting 70 million people worldwide. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been widely used for the diagnosis of epileptic seizures. However, most of the existing EEG-based seizure detection methods cannot maintain robust performance in real life conditions. This is where the EEG data are corrupted with different sources of noise and artifacts. This study presents a robust seizure detection system that works efficiently under the real life conditions as well as the ideal conditions. A feature learning method based on L1-penalized robust regression is developed and applied to the EEG spectra to recognize the most prominent features pertinent to epileptic seizures. The extracted features are then fed into the random forest classifier for seizure detection. Results on a public benchmark dataset show that the performance of this seizure detection system is superior to prior work. It first achieves seizure detection rates of 100.00% sensitivity, 100.00% specificity, and 100.00% classification accuracy under the ideal conditions. The proposed method is also proven to be robust in the presence of white noise and EEG artifacts mainly those arising from muscle activities and eyes-blinking. It is found to achieve seizure detection accuracies in the range of 90.00-100.00% when applied to noisy EEG data corrupted with high noise levels. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no work in the literature that detects seizures under these conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Hussein, Ramy; Wang, Z.

Pattern recognition is mainly involved in this Signal Processing module and in this paper, we experimented with different state-of-the-art algorithms for each of these submodules on two separate datasets we acquired using Emotiv EPOC and the Muse headband from 38 college-aged young adults. For our experiment, we used two artefact removal techniques, namely Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) based denoising technique and an extended SWT technique (SWTSD). We found SWTSD improves average classification accuracy up to 7.2% and performs better than SWT. However, that does not state that SWTSD will outperform SWT when implemented on other BCI paradigms or on other EEG-based applications. In our study, the highest average accuracy achieved by the data of the Muse headband and Emotiv EPOC were 77.7% and 66.7% respectively and from our results we conclude that, the performance of different BCI systems depends on several different factors including artefact removal techniques, filters, feature extraction and selection algorithms, classifiers, etc. and appropriate choice and usage of such methods can have a significant positive impact on the end results.

This paper focuses on the importance of preserving the correlation information among multichannel data and proposes the correlation assisted SUTCCSP (CASUT) algorithm to address this issue. The performance of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated by classifying the motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset. The features were first extracted using CSP algorithms including the proposed method, and then the random forest classifier was utilized for the classification. Experiments using CASUT yielded an average classification accuracy of 78.10 (%), which significantly outperformed those of original CSP, Complex Common Spatial Patterns (CCSP), and SUTCCSP with. p-values less than 0.01, tested by the Wilcoxon signed rank test.

Using the correlation between various software process metrics and defects, earlier work has traditionally attempted to spot such bug risks. However, this study departs from previous works in examining a more direct method of using psycho-physiological sensors data to detect the difficulty of program comprehension tasks and programmer level of expertise. By conducting a study with 38 expert and novice programmers, we investigated how well an electroencephalography and an eye-tracker can be utilized in predicting programmer expertise (novice/expert) and task difficulty (easy/difficult). Using data from both sensors, we could predict task difficulty and programmer level of expertise with 64.9 and 97.7% precision and 68.6 and 96.4% recall, respectively. The result shows it is possible to predict the perceived difficulty of a task and expertise level for developers using psycho-physiological sensors data. In addition, we found that while using single biometric sensor shows good results, the composition of both sensors lead to the best overall performance.

Because it is easy to run machine-learning-based solutions directly over time series, it has been a popular approach to use alternative types of intelligent systems to analyze time series. Regarding such works, time series prediction is known as a remarkable topic as followed by researchers from different fields. The objective of this chapter is to provide an alternative work by using artificial neuro-fuzzy inference system trained by the league championship algorithm, which is an optimization algorithm from the associated literature. As the application objective, electroencephalogram (EEG) time series have been tried to be predicted by using the designed ANFIS-LCA approach. The chapter briefly introduces details about the approach and reports findings from the performed prediction operations.

For the past two decades, many studies have explored the feasibility and practicality of drowsiness detection using electroencephalogram (EEG)based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. However, on the pathway of transitioning laboratory-oriented BCI into real-world environments, one chief challenge is to obtain high-quality EEG with convenience and long-term wearing comfort. Recently, acquiring EEG from non-hair-bearing (NHB) scalp areas has been proposed as an alternative solution to avoid many of the technical limitations resulted from the interference of hair between electrodes and the skin. Furthermore, our pilot study has shown that informative drowsiness-related EEG features are accessible from the NHB areas. This study extends the previous work to quantitatively evaluate the performance of drowsiness detection using cross-session validation with widely studied machine-learning classifiers. The offline results showed no significant difference between the accuracy of drowsiness detection using the NHB EEG and the whole-scalp EEG across all subjects (p = 0.31). The findings of this study demonstrate the efficacy and practicality of the NHB EEG for drowsiness detection and could catalyze explorations and developments of many other real-world BCI applications.

Method: The DL model is using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers for learning generalized features and dimension reduction, while a conventional Fully Connected (FC) layer is used for classification. Together they build a unified end-to-end model that can be applied to raw EEG signals. This previously proposed model was applied to a new set of data to validate its robustness against data variations. Furthermore, it was extended by subject-specific adaptation. Lastly, an analysis of the learned filters provides insights into how such a model derives a classification decision. Results: The selected global classifier reached 80.38%, 69.82%, and 58.58% mean accuracies for datasets with two, three, and four classes, respectively, validated using 5-fold crossvalidation. As a novel approach in this context, transfer learning was used to adapt the global classifier to single individuals improving the overall mean accuracy to 86.49%, 79.25%, and 68.51%, respectively. The global models were trained on 3s segments of EEG data from different subjects than they were tested on, which proved the generalization performance of the model. Conclusion: The results are comparable with the reported accuracy values in related studies and the presented model outperforms the results in the literature on the same underlying data. Given that the model can learn features from data without having to use specialized feature extraction methods, DL should be considered as an alternative to established EEG classification methods, if enough data is available.

It is a process of extracting electrical activities of the brain in the form of EEG signals using non-invasive methods. In EEG based techniques, a challenge exists in the form of signal contamination caused by internal and external factors in the recorded EEG signals, such as the artifacts, interferences among multiple EEG sources, and noise. Signal pre-processing is the most significant phase for EEG based applications, for instance, the brain computer interface (BCI) systems. This is because the quality of data acquired from the brain through EEG measurements is dependent on the effectiveness of artifact detection and removal methods. During EEG recording there are several factors that influence the quality of data. One of the factors of signal contamination occurs as the result of physiological and non-physiological artifacts. To detect and remove such contaminations from EEG signals, there are several efficient artifact detection and elimination techniques based on certain pre-processing methods. The main objective of this study is to demonstrate various types of artifacts in EEG recordings as results of external and internal factors. Furthermore, the study will also present an extensive review of existing artifacts identification and elimination methods applied on EEG signals.

A public database was used to test the algorithms and a total of eleven features were analysed. Sequential feature selection was employed to select the most relevant features and a post processing procedure was used for further improvement of the classification. The classification of the A phases was produced using linear discriminant analysis and the average accuracy, sensitivity and specificity was, respectively, 75%, 78% and 74%. The cyclic alternating pattern detection accuracy was 75%. When comparing with the state of the art, the proposed method achieved the highest sensitivity but a lower accuracy since the fallowed approach was to keep the REM periods, contrary to the method that is used in the majority of the state of the art publications which leads to an increase in the overall performance. However, the approach of this work is more suitable for automatic system implementation since no alteration of the EEG data is needed.

As psychological understanding of emotions progresses, feature extraction along with classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) representation of these emotions becomes a more important challenge. In this work, Neural Networks as a type of high accuracy robust statistical learning model was employed in order to classify human emotions from the DEAP [7] dataset containing the measured EEG signals for Emotion Classification research. We take advantage of two Neural Network based models the first one of which is the Deep Neural Network and the other one is the Convolutional Neural Network in order to classify Valence, Arousal, Dominance and liking into two categories of Yes or No (High and Low) and to classify Valence and Arousal into three categories of (High, Normal, Low), The achieved accuracy surpasses those achieved in other papers indicating that these models carry the ability to be used as a high achieving classifier for BCI signals.

However, because of its low signal-to-noise ratio, extracting useful information from these signals continues to be a hard-technical challenge. Many studies focus on simple properties of the ERPs such as peaks, latencies, and slopes of signal deflections. New method: To overcome these limitations, we developed the Wavelet-Information method which uses wavelet decomposition, information theory, and a quantification based on single-trial decoding performance to extract information from evoked responses. Results: Using simulations and real data from four experiments, we show that the proposed approach outperforms standard supervised analyses based on peak amplitude estimation. Moreover, the method can extract information using the raw data from all recorded channels using no a priori knowledge or pre-processing steps. Comparison with existing method(s): We show that traditional approaches often disregard important features of the signal such as the shape of EEG waveforms. Also, other approaches often require some form of a priori knowledge for feature selection and lead to problems of multiple comparisons. Conclusions: This approach offers a new and complementary framework to design experiments that go beyond the traditional analyses of ERPs. Potentially, it allows a wide usage beyond basic research; such as for clinical diagnosis, brain-machine interfaces, and neurofeedback applications requiring single-trial analyses.

However, CSP is also known to be very sensitive to noise and prone to over fitting, and the performance of this spatial filter is closely related to the operational frequency band of electroencephalogram data. To address this issue, we propose a new method FB-TRCSP+RF based on CSP and random forest. The FB-TRCSP is combined by the 8th-order Butterworth bandpass-filters and the CSP with Tikhonov regularization, which is a more robust feature extraction method compared to the CSP. Then, the model is applied to an experimental data set collected from 14 subjects and is compared with the non-regularization method FB-CSP+RF. The results show that the method we proposed yields relatively higher median classification accuracies and shows a stronger ability in subject-to-subject learning compared to prevailing approaches.

Feature extraction from multiple channel fNIRS signal is always challenging due to its high dimensionality. To reduce the feature dimension, common spatial pattern (CSP) is an effective method. The present research work proposes an algorithm named by standardized common spatial pattern (SCSP) based filtering method for fNIRS based motor imagery classification. This work used both the conventional CSP method and the proposed SCSP method to extract the features from the fNIRS signal through spatial filtering. The results revealed that the proposed SCSP algorithm outperformed the conventional CSP method and channel-wise methods for classifying the two motor imagery event classifications. In addition, it can improve the classification accuracy up to 17% (in average) and 7% (in average) with respect to the channel-wise feature extraction method and conventional CSP algorithm, respectively.

Sixteen patients with depression and sixteen healthy controls were involved in this study. Both features from the alpha and beta frequency bands were selected to analysis in this study. First the features sensitivity to the group-difference and the correlation to the clinical HAMD scale score were analyzed, and then the classification method was used to further test the role of the resting EEG features in depression. The results showed that the difference between depression and healthy controls in the absolute power of beta band in the left prefrontal lobe was significant. And the alpha left-right asymmetry in the prefrontal cortex had a correlation with HAMD scale score. In addition, the classification based on the features showed that there was a relative higher accuracy rate to identify the depressions than to identify the healthy controls. Specifically, the classification based on alpha asymmetry was higher than that based on beta asymmetry, and the absolute power in beta band was higher than that in alpha band. Alpha asymmetry is a traditional sensitive resting EEG features for depression, this study provide new evidence to support the view. The findings here further suggest that absolute power in beta band would be important biomarker in depression.

In this regard, the generalized Hurst exponent (GHE) method is used for robust estimation of the multifractals in each type of EEG signals, and three powerful statistical tests are performed to check existence of differences between estimated GHEs from healthy control subjects and epileptic patients. The obtained results show that multifractals exist in both types of EEG signals. Particularly, it was found that the degree of fractal is more pronounced in short variations of normal EEG signals than in short variations of EEG signals with seizure free intervals. In contrary, it is more pronounced in long variations of EEG signals with seizure free intervals than in normal EEG signals. Importantly, both parametric and nonparametric statistical tests show strong evidence that estimated GHEs of normal EEG signals are statistically and significantly different from those with seizure free intervals. Therefore, GHEs can be efficiently used to distinguish between healthy and patients suffering from epilepsy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The common spatial patterns (CSP) technique is a well-established approach to the spatial filtering of the electroencephalogram (EEG) data in BCI applications. Even though CSP was originally proposed from a heuristic viewpoint, it can be also built on very strong foundations using information theory. This paper reviews the relationship between CSP and several information-theoretic approaches, including the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the Beta divergence and the Alpha-Beta log-det (AB-LD)divergence. We also revise other approaches based on the idea of selecting those features that are maximally informative about the class labels. The performance of all the methods will be also compared via experiments.

It consists of preprocessing, variational mode decomposition (VMD), mode sample spectral entropy extraction and thresholding rule. The preprocessing first performs the mean removal and then performs principal component analysis (PCA) based channel selection if required under multi-channel EEG recordings. The VMD is used to decompose the EEG signal into a series of bandlimited modes with specific central frequencies. The mode spectral entropies are extracted from the selected modes by discarding the baseline and artifacts based on the mode central frequencies. The extracted mode spectral entropy features are compared for detecting the presence of the epileptic seizures. The method is evaluated using the standard EEG databases such as Physionet CHB-MIT EEG database and Bonn database. The proposed method achieves an overall accuracy (ACC) of 98-100% with sensitivity (SE) of 100% and specificity (SP) of 97.5-100% for seven EEG groups of the Bonn database. Evaluation results demonstrate that the mode spectral entropy based generic method achieves an average SE=88.55%, SP=94.86 % and ACC=72.92% on the CHB-MIT EEG dataset.	[Das, Priya; Manikandan, M.

This is done in a way that is accessible to readers whose main experience rather lies in other fields. While attempting to be as illustrative as possible, our exposition contains the mathematically precise formalism of the methods discussed. Readers not familiar with basic mathematical notions such as vectors and matrices should nevertheless not be discouraged, as they hopefully benefit from reading this tutorial even when skipping the technical parts. For the classification of event-related potentials, spatiotemporal features and classification with regularized linear discriminant analysis is discussed. Modulations of oscillatory brain activity are detected with common spatial pattern analysis and log(arithmized) band-power features. All of those methods are well comprehensible and easy to implement and show nevertheless competitive performance. The first two sections motivate the transition from univariate features, such as signal amplitude in a certain channel and at a certain latency toward multivariate features. Readers familiar with the benefits of multivariate analyses are encouraged to step very quickly over those two sections and to start with Section 18.3.

However, raw EEG may be contaminated with unwanted components such as noises and artifacts caused by power source, environment, eye blinks, heart rate and muscle movements, which are unavoidable. These unwanted components will effect the analysis of EEG and provide inaccurate information. Therefore, researchers have proposed all kind of approaches to eliminate unwanted noises and artifacts from EEG. In this paper, a literature review is carried out to study the works that have been done for noise and artifact removal from year 2010 up to the present. It is found that conventional approaches include ICA, wavelet based analysis, statistical analysis and others. However, the existing ways of artifacts removal cannot eliminate certain noise and will cause information lost by directly discard the contaminated components. From the study, it is shown that combination of conventional with other methods is popularly used, as it is able to improve the removal of artifacts. The current trend of artifacts removal makes use of machine learning to provide an automated solution with higher efficiency.

Twelve subjects completed four different STEM learning tasks - two entailing passive learning (watching a video or reading), and two entailing active learning (solving problems based on the passive learning). There were two mathematics tasks (one active and one passive) and two Python programming tasks (one active, one passive). Subjects were fitted with wearable brainwave sensors that captured cortical oscillations from four scalp electrodes, and transformed the signals from each electrode into five distinct frequency bands. This yielded 10 samples per second within each frequency band and from each electrode. We then trained ensemble-based machine learning algorithms (boosting and bagging of decision tree learners) to classify various features of tasks and subjects from a single sample of brainwave activity. We explored several different types of training/ testing regimes, and our results suggest that within a single session, brain activity patterns for each of these four types of learning are substantially different, but that the patterns do not generalize well between sessions. Importantly, the brainwave patterns differ greatly between individuals, which suggests that applications using such devices will need to rely on personalization to achieve high accuracy.

However, EEG patterns have been found to vary across subjects due to user fatigue, different electrode placements, and varying impedances, etc. This problem renders the performance of EEG-based emotion recognition highly specific to subjects, requiring time-consuming individual calibration sessions to adapt an emotion recognition system to new subjects. Recently, domain adaptation (DA) strategies have achieved a great deal success in dealing with inter-subject adaptation. However, most of them can only adapt one subject to another subject, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios. To alleviate this issue, a novel unsupervised DA strategy called Multi-Subject Subspace Alignment (MSSA) is proposed in this paper, which takes advantage of subspace alignment solution and multi-subject information in a unified framework to build personalized models without user-specific labeled data. Experiments on a public EEG dataset known as SEED verify the effectiveness and superiority of MSSA over other state of the art methods for dealing with multi-subject scenarios.

Covariate shift (CS) presents a major challenge during data processing within NSEs wherein the input-data distribution shifts during transitioning from training to testing phase. CS is one of the fundamental issues in electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems and can be often observed during multiple trials of EEG data recorded over different sessions. Thus, conventional learning algorithms struggle to accommodate these CSs in streaming EEG data resulting in low performance (in terms of classification accuracy) of motor imagery (MI)-related BCI systems. This chapter aims to introduce a novel framework for nonstationary adaptation in MI-related BCI system based on CS detection applied to the temporal and spatial filtered features extracted from raw EEG signals. The chapter collectively provides an efficient method for accounting nonstationarity in EEG data during learning in NSEs.

The conventional methods ignore the complementarity between time domain characteristics, frequency domain characteristics, and time-frequency characteristics of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and cannot fully capture the correlation information between different channels. In this paper, an integrated deep learning framework based on improved deep belief networks with glia chains (DBN-GCs) is proposed. In the framework, the member DBN-GCs are employed for extracting intermediate representations of EEG raw features from multiple domains separately, as well as mining interchannel correlation information by glia chains. Then, the higher level features describing time domain characteristics, frequency domain characteristics, and time-frequency characteristics are fused by a discriminative restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) to implement emotion recognition task. Experiments conducted on the DEAP benchmarking dataset achieve averaged accuracy of 75.92% and 76.83% for arousal and valence states classification, respectively. The results show that the proposed framework outperforms most of the above deep classifiers. Thus, potential of the proposed framework is demonstrated.

Especially in electroencephalogram (EEG) medical applications, it is important for medical doctors and patients to understand the reason for the classification. In this paper, we thus propose a method to quantify contributions of interpretable EEG features on classification using the Shapley sampling value (SSV). In addition, a pruning method is proposed to reduce the SSV computation cost. The pruning is conducted on an EEG feature tree, specifically at the sensor (electrode) level, frequency-band level, and amplitude-phase level. If the contribution of a feature at a high level (e.g., sensor level) is very small, the contributions of features at a lower level (e.g., frequency-band level) should also be small. The proposed method is verified using two EEG datasets: classification of sleep states, and screening of alcoholics. The results show that the method reduces the SSV computational complexity while maintaining high SSV accuracy. Our method will thus increase the importance of data-driven approaches in EEG analysis.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate the raw EEG data before training the classification model. In this paper, we propose a framework to filter out low quality EEG data from participants with low attention using eye tracking data and boost the performance of deep affective models with CNN and LSTM. We introduce a novel attention-deprived experiment with dual tasks, in which the dominant task is auditory continuous performance test, identical pairs version (CPT-IP) and the subtask is emotion eliciting experiment. Motivated by the idea that subjects with attention share similar scan-path patterns under the same clips, we adopt the cosine distance based spatial-temporal scan-path analysis with eye tracking data to cluster these similar scan-paths. The average accuracy of emotion recognition using the selected EEG data with attention is about 3% higher than that of original training dataset without filtering. We also found that with the increasing distance of scan-paths between outliers and cluster center, the performance of corresponding EEG data tends to decrease.

Implemented as a standalone motor imagery (MI) training system or as part of a rehabilitation robotic system, many studies have shown benefits of using them to restore motor control in stroke patients. Hand movements have widely been chosen as MI tasks. Although potentially more challenging to analyze, wrist and forearm movement such as wrist flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination should also be considered for MI tasks, because these movements are part of the main exercises given to patients in conventional stroke rehabilitation. This paper will evaluate the effectiveness of such movements for MI tasks. Methods: Three hand and wrist movement tasks which were hand opening/closing, wrist flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination were chosen as motor imagery tasks for both hands. Eleven subjects participated in the experiment. All of them completed hand opening/closing task session. Ten subjects completed two MI task sessions which were hand opening/closing and wrist flexion/extension. Five subjects completed all three MI tasks sessions. Each MI task comprised 8 sessions spanning a 4 weeks period. For classification, feature extraction based on common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm was used. Two types were implemented, one with conventional CSP (termed WB) and one with an increase number of features achieved by filtering EEG data into five bands (termed FB). Classification was done by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM). Results: Eight-fold cross validation was applied on EEG data. LDA and SVM gave comparable classification accuracy. FB achieved significantly higher classification accuracy compared to WB. The accuracy of classifying wrist flexion/extension task were higher than that of classifying hand opening/closing task in all subjects. Classifying forearm pronation/supination task achieved higher accuracy than classifying hand opening/closing task in most subjects but achieved lower accuracy than classifying wrist flexion/extension task in all subjects. Significant improvements of classification accuracy were found in nine subjects when considering individual sessions of experiments of all MI tasks. The results of classifying hand opening/closing task and wrist flexion/extension task were comparable to the results of classifying hand opening/closing task and forearm pronation/supination task. Classification accuracy of wrist flexion/extension task and forearm pronation/supination task was lower than those of hand movement tasks and wrist movement tasks. Conclusion: High classification accuracy of the three MI tasks support the possibility of using EEG-based stroke rehabilitation system with these movements. Either LDA or SVM can equally be chosen as a classifier since the difference of their accuracies is not statistically significant. Significantly higher classification accuracy made FB more suitable for classifying MI task compared to WB. More training sessions could potentially lead to better accuracy as evident in most subjects in this experiment.

EEG-based Discriminative Features During Hand Movement Execution and Imagination	2018 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL, AUTOMATION, ROBOTICS AND VISION (ICARCV)	International Conference on Control Automation Robotics and Vision		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV)	NOV 18-21, 2018	Singapore, SINGAPORE			Electroencephalogram (EEG); Brain-computer interface; band power; phase; discrimination and classification accuracy	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MOTOR IMAGERY	Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one the most commonly used brain activity measurement tools in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) framework to establish "thought' based human-machine interaction. On account of the fact that mental rehearsal of motor movement termed motor imagery, is a robust candidate for developing BCI systems, it is of great importance to find the distinction between the neural correlates of executed motor movement and its imagination, to enhance command signal generation and utilization in BCI-based communication and control. This paper investigates the EEG-based parameters associated with execution and imagination of left and right hand movement from a set of 10 healthy subjects. The study explores the distinguishable power and phase features in theta (4-8 Hz), alpha/mu (8-12 Hz), lower beta (12-20 Hz), higher beta (20-30 Hz) and gamma (30-40 Hz) bands of EEG. It is observed that the most informative channels that effectively discriminates motor execution and imagination varies across bands and tasks. Frontal and parietal channels are found to be more discriminative compared to those in central region in both tasks. Combining the task-specific discriminative features along with Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) based spatial features, an average classification accuracy of 81 % is achieved in 5 x 5 -fold cross validation, over 10 subjects. Further study is essential to investigate the temporal structure of the distinguishable features, to generalize the discriminative spectral and spatial characteristics and to improve the classification accuracy.

To improve operators' BCI performances, here we proposed a novel paradigm, which combined the covert verb reading in the traditional motor imagery paradigm. In our proposed paradigm, participants were asked to covertly read the presented verbs during imagining right hand or foot movements referred by those verbs. EEG signals were recorded with both our proposed paradigm and the traditional paradigm. By the common spatial pattern method, we, respectively, decomposed these signals into spatial patterns and extracted their features used in the following classification of support vector machine. Compared with the traditional paradigm, our proposed paradigm could generate clearer spatial patterns following a somatotopic distribution, which led to more distinguishable features and higher classification accuracies than those in the traditional paradigm. These results suggested that semantic processing of verbs can influence the brain activity of motor imagery and enhance the mu event-related desynchronisation. The combination of semantic processing with motor imagery is therefore a promising method for the improvement of operators' BCI performances.

Among them, brain - computer interface (BCI)-based electrical stimulation (ES) and MI synchronously induced electroencephalo-graph (EEG) analysis is one of the research directions. This paper integrates MI with ES, and introduces the steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP) on the MI, and then fuses features. The purpose is to achieve better accuracy, reducing training time, and enhancing target body imagine attention. We use ES and MI synchronous-evoked EEG analysis for rehabilitation training strategy in the process of synchronization. Based on the time - frequency diagram and brain topographic map, we make analysis on event-related desynchronization (ERD), time -frequency characteristic of the steady-state evoked potentials (SSEP), energy characteristics, and distribution regularity of brain regions of each task model. We apply the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), common spatial pattern (CSP), and filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) to classify task pattern recognition on the basis of support vector machine. The results show that based on the lead less the FBCSP has certain superiority, the classification accuracy of ES versus ES& MI achieved 95% or more.

The system exploits a machine-learning algorithm based on spatio-temporal characterization of the P300, which realizes the binary discrimination from a multiclass classification. The BCI architecture is made up by (i) the acquisition unit, (ii) the processing unit and (iii) the home management. The acquisition unit is realized by a wireless EEG headset collecting data from 6 electrodes. The processing unit is a hybrid PC-Raspberry Pi architecture that: (i) provides stimulation, operates a Machine Learning (ML) and (iii) realizes a real-time multidimensional classification. The ML stage is based on a custom algorithm (t-RIDE) which emphasizes the subjective P300 characteristics and trains the classifiers. The extracted features are functionally reduced and, thus, used to define proper prediction boundaries. The Raspberry-based core classifies and actuates the received commands, interfacing the environment through a dedicated module that manages the home via TCP/IP. The experimental results on a dataset of 7 subjects enable a classification with an accuracy of 84.28% +/- 0.87 % in less than 10ms.

The objective of the work described in this paper is the development of a computationally efficient methodology for patient-specific automatic seizure detection in long-term multi-channel EEG recordings. Approach. A novel patient-specific seizure detection approach based on a signal-derived empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based dictionary approach is proposed. For this purpose, we use an empirical framework for EMD-based dictionary creation and learning, inspired by traditional dictionary learning methods, in which the EMD-based dictionary is learned from the multi-channel EEG data being analyzed for automatic seizure detection. We present the algorithm for dictionary creation and learning, whose purpose is to learn dictionaries with a small number of atoms. Using training signals belonging to seizure and non-seizure classes, an initial dictionary, termed as the raw dictionary, is formed. The atoms of the raw dictionary are composed of intrinsic mode functions obtained after decomposition of the training signals using the empirical mode decomposition algorithm. The raw dictionary is then trained using a learning algorithm, resulting in a substantial decrease in the number of atoms in the trained dictionary. The trained dictionary is then used for automatic seizure detection, such that coefficients of orthogonal projections of test signals against the trained dictionary form the features used for classification of test signals into seizure and non-seizure classes. Thus no hand-engineered features have to be extracted from the data as in traditional seizure detection approaches. Main results. The performance of the proposed approach is validated using the CHB-MIT benchmark database, and averaged accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values of 92.9%, 94.3% and 91.5%, respectively, are obtained using support vector machine classifier and five-fold cross-validation method. These results are compared with other approaches using the same database, and the suitability of the approach for seizure detection in long-term multi-channel EEG recordings is discussed. Significance. The proposed approach describes a computationally efficient method for automatic seizure detection in long-term multi-channel EEG recordings. The method does not rely on hand-engineered features, as arc required in traditional approaches. Furthermore, the approach is suitable for scenarios where the dictionary once formed and trained can be used for automatic seizure detection of newly recorded data, making the approach suitable for long-term multi-channel EEG recordings.

However, there is great interest in shifting the BCI trend toward applications aimed at healthy users. Although BCI operation depends on technological factors (i.e., EEG pattern classification algorithm) and human factors (i.e., how well the person can generate good quality EEG patterns), it is the latter that is least investigated. In order to control a motor imagery-based BCI, users need to learn to modulate their sensorimotor brain rhythms by practicing motor imagery using a classical training protocol with an abstract visual feedback. In this paper, we investigate a different BCI training protocol using a human-like android robot (Geminoid HI-2) to provide realistic visual feedback. The proposed training protocol addresses deficiencies of the classical approach and takes the advantage of body-abled user capabilities. Experimental results suggest that android feedback-based BCI training improves the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms during motor imagery task. Moreover, we discuss how the influence of body ownership transfer illusion toward the android might have an effect on the modulation of event-related desyn-chronization/synchronization activity.

To prevent such accidents, it is necessary to detect driver drowsiness as early as possible. In previous studies, it was confirmed that decreasing arousal levels affect physiological indices, behavioral indices, and driving performance. The goal of this study is to classify the alert states of drivers, particularly the slightly drowsy state, based on physiological indices, behavioral measures, and driving performance. First, the relationship between the arousal level of a driver, physiological signals, such as electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram signals, behavioral measures, and driving performance is investigated based on analysis of data measured by a driving simulator (DS) and driver monitoring system. Next, to classify the alert and the slightly drowsy states utilizing machine learning algorithms, a total of 32 features are extracted from the measured data over a period of 10 seconds. Four machine learning algorithms, namely logistic regression, support vector machines, the k-nearest neighbor classifier, and random forest (RF), are utilized for the classification of driver drowsiness in this study. As a result, it is confirmed that the RF method can obtain up to 81.4% accuracy when distinguishing between alert and slightly drowsy states. This result demonstrates the feasibility of driver drowsiness detection based on hybrid measures over a 10-second time period with high accuracy.

This Letter investigated phase-synchronisation patterns from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded from ten healthy participants performing motor imagery (MI) tasks using schematic emotional faces as stimuli. These phase-synchronised states, named synchrostates, are specific for each cognitive task performed by the user. The maximum and minimum number of occurrence states were selected for each subject and task to extract the connectivity network measures based on graph theory to feed a set of classification algorithms. Two MI tasks were successfully classified with the highest accuracy of 85% with corresponding sensitivity and specificity of 85%. In this work, not only the performance of different supervised learning techniques was studied, as well as the optimal subset of features to obtain the best discrimination rates. The robustness of this classification method for MI tasks indicates the possibility of expanding its use for online classification of the brain-computer interface (BCI) systems.

Understanding the relationship between brain and upper limb function in children with unilateral motor impairments: A multimodal approach	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Cerebral palsy; Mirror movements; Motor; MRI; TMS; EEG	INDUCED MOVEMENT THERAPY; CORTICOMOTOR-PROJECTION PATTERN; USE EXPERIENCE QUESTIONNAIRE; CEREBRAL-PALSY; CONGENITAL HEMIPARESIS; HAND FUNCTION; CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM; MIRROR MOVEMENTS; REORGANIZATION; PLASTICITY	Atypical brain development and early brain injury have profound and long lasting impact on the development, skill acquisition, and subsequent independence of a child. Heterogeneity is present at the brain level and at the motor level; particularly with respect to phenomena of bilateral activation and mirrored movements (MMs). In this multiple case study we consider the feasibility of using several modalities to explore the relationship between brain structure and/or activity and hand function: Electroencephalography (EEG), both structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI, fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), Electromyography (EMG) and hand function assessments. Methods: 15 children with unilateral CP (ages: 9.4 2.5 years) undertook hand function assessments and at least two additional neuroimaging and/or neurophysiological procedures: MRI/DTI/fMRI (n = 13), TMS (n = 11), and/or EEG/EMG (n = 8). During the fMRI scans and EEG measurements, a motor task was performed to study cortical motor control activity during simple hand movements. DTI tractography analysis was used to study the corpus-callosum (CC) and cortico-spinal tracts (CST). TMS was used to study cortico-spinal connectivity pattern. Results: Type and range of severity of brain injury was evident across all levels of manual ability with the highest radiological scores corresponded to children poorer manual ability. Evidence of MMs was found in 7 children, mostly detected when moving the affected hand, and not necessarily corresponding to bilateral brain activation. When moving the affected hand, bilateral brain activation was seen in 6/11 children while 3/11 demonstrated unilateral activation in the contralateral hemisphere, and one child demonstrated motor activation predominantly in the supplementary motor area (SMA). TMS revealed three types of connectivity patterns from the cortex to the affected hand: a contralateral (n = 3), an ipsilateral (n = 4) and a mixed (n = 1) connectivity pattern; again without clear association with MMs. No differences were found between children with and without MMs in lesion scores, motor fMRI laterality indices, CST diffusivity values, and upper limb function. In the genu, midbody, and splenium of the CC, higher fractional anisotropy values were found in children with MMs compared to children without MMs. The EEG data indicated a stronger mu-restoration above the contralateral hemisphere in 6/8 children and above the ipsilateral hemisphere in 2/8 children. Conclusion: The current results demonstrate benefits from the use of different modalities when studying upper-limb function in children with CP; not least to accommodate to the variations in tolerance and feasibility of implementation of the differing methods. These exposed multiple individual brain-reorganization patterns corresponding to different functional motor abilities. Additional research is warranted to understand the transactional influences of early brain injury, neuroplasticity and developmental and environmental factors on hand function in order to develop targeted interventions.

When designing multiclass motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (MI-BCD, a so-called tangent space mapping (TSM) method utilizing the geometric structure of covariance matrices is an effective technique. This paper aims to introduce a method using ISM for finding accurate operational frequency bands related brain activities associated with MI tasks. Approach. A multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is decomposed into multiple subbands, and tangent features are then estimated on each subband. A mutual information analysis-based effective algorithm is implemented to select subbands containing features capable of improving motor imagery classification accuracy. Thus obtained features of selected subbands are combined to get feature space. A principal component analysis-based approach is employed to reduce the features dimension and then the classification is accomplished by a support vector machine (SVM). Main results. Offline analysis demonstrates the proposed multiband tangent space mapping with subband selection (MTSMS) approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods. It acheives the highest average classification accuracy for all datasets (BCI competition dataset 2a, ilia, IIIb, and dataset JK-HH1). Significance. The increased classification accuracy of MI tasks with the proposed MTSMS approach can yield effective implementation of BCE. The mutual information-based subband selection method is implemented to tune operation frequency bands to represent actual motor imagery tasks.

However, how to further improve its classification performance and make these classifiers avoid overfitting is still one of the most important research topics. Stacked deep extreme learning machine classifier (SD-ELM-C) was constructed using a stacked structure in this study, which could quickly solve output weights using ELM. SD-ELM-C could effectively improve the classification accuracy of epileptic signals and avoid overfitting. The difference between SD-ELM-C and the current popular deep learning mode was that SD-ELM-C was not achieved through the formation and superposition of layers, but a combination of multiple training units. One traditional neural network was included in each base training unit. These basic training units could be trained independently of each other. The input of each base training unit was also obtained by randomly selecting features, which greatly improved the training speed. According to the principle of stacked structure, the source datasets were projected to each training base unit and the original data structure in each training was preserved. The greatest contribution of this study was not only in improving the training accuracy but also in avoiding overfitting. The final experimental results also showed that SD-ELM-C could effectively improve the classification effect of epileptic signals compared with the other classifiers in this study. Using ELM, SD-ELM-C could easily solve the output weights without iteration by solving a simple expression. Hence, SD-ELM-C proved to be a good choice.

However, current assessment methods have relied on either indirect inference from observing changes in consumer behavior after the launch of an advertising campaign, which has long cycle times and requires an ad campaign to have already have been launched (often meaning costs having been sunk). Or through surveys or focus groups, which have a potential for experimental biases, peer pressure, and other psychological and sociological phenomena that can reduce the effectiveness of the study. In this paper, we investigate a new approach to assess the impact of advertisement by utilizing low-cost EEG headbands to record and assess the measurable impact of advertising on the brain. Our evaluation shows the desired performance of our method based on user experiment with 30 recruited subjects after watching 220 different advertisements. We believe the proposed SVM method can be further developed to a general and scalable methodology that can enable advertising agencies to assess impact rapidly, quantitatively, and without bias.

In this research, the suitability of three EEG references was compared while classifying depressed and healthy brains using a machine-learning (ML)-based validation method. In this research, the EEG data of 30 unipolar depressed subjects and 30 age-matched healthy controls were recorded. The EEG data were analyzed in three different EEG references, the link-ear reference (LE), average reference (AR), and reference electrode standardization technique (REST). The EEG-based functional connectivity (FC) was computed. Also, the graph-based measures, such as the distances between nodes, minimum spanning tree, and maximum flow between the nodes for each channel pair, were calculated. An ML scheme provided a mechanism to compare the performances of the extracted features that involved a general framework such as the feature extraction (graph-based theoretic measures), feature selection, classification, and validation. For comparison purposes, the performance metrics such as the classification accuracies, sensitivities, specificities, and F scores were computed. When comparing the three references, the diagnostic accuracy showed better performances during the REST, while the LE and AR showed less discrimination between the two groups. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the choice of appropriate reference is critical during the clinical scenario. The REST reference is recommended for future applications of EEG-based diagnosis of mental illnesses.

Testing the Limits of the Stimulus Reconstruction Approach: Auditory Attention Decoding in a Four-Speaker Free Field Environment	TRENDS IN HEARING			English	Article						selective attention; auditory attention; cocktail party problem; stimulus reconstruction; electroencephalogram	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ATTENDED SPEECH; REPRESENTATION; RESPONSES; TRACKING	Auditory attention can be defined as the cognitive process that enables us to selectively focus on relevant aspects of the acoustic environment while other aspects are ignored. The remarkable ability of the auditory system to focus on one out of several speakers in a multispeaker environment has become known as the cocktail party effect. Although the neural processes underlying selective auditory attention (SAA) are not well understood, it has recently been shown that the cortical representation of a listener's attended sound stream can be recorded noninvasively from the scalp and that stimulus reconstruction from single trial electroencephalographic (EEG) data enables the decoding of the orientation of auditory attention. The present study extends this approach by evaluating its efficacy in a naturalistic and challenging four-speaker acoustic free field environment, in which the four speakers were spatially separated and presented different but equally salient spoken messages to the listeners. Ten participants were instructed to focus SAA on a spoken prose message in one of the four loudspeakers while ignoring the remaining three streams of prose. Concurrent EEG activity recorded via 128 scalp channels was used for a stimulus reconstruction analysis. The results showed that this approach can be used to decode the orientation of SAA even in a complex and realistic acoustic setting. To confirm that the successful decoding was driven by correspondences between the recorded EEG activity and the attended speech envelopes, the analysis method was validated against randomly constructed sets of surrogate data and by correlations with behavioral data.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are undoubtedly the most widely used signals for measuring DoA. In this paper, a novel EEG -based index is proposed to evaluate DoA for 24 patients receiving general anaesthesia with different levels of unconsciousness. Sample Entropy (SampEn) algorithm was utilised in order to acquire the chaotic features of the signals. After calculating the SampEn from the EEG signals, Random Forest was utilised for developing learning regression models with Bispectral index (BIS) as the target Correlation coefficient, mean absolute error, and area under the curve (AUC) were used to verify the perioperative performance of the proposed method. Validation comparisons with typical nonstationary signal analysis methods (i.e., recurrence analysis and permutation entropy) and regression methods (i.e., neural network and support vector machine) were conducted. To further verify the accuracy and validity of the proposed methodology, the data is divided into four unconsciousness -level groups on the basis of BIS levels. Subsequently, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to the corresponding index (i.e., regression output). Results indicate that the correlation coefficient improved to 0.72 +/- 0.09 after filtering and to 0.90 +/- 0.05 after regression from the initial values of 0.51 +/- 0.17. Similarly, the final mean absolute error dramatically declined to 5.22 +/- 2.12. In addition, the ultimate AUC increased to 0.98 +/- 0.02, and the ANOVA analysis indicates that each of the four groups of different anaesthetic levels demonstrated significant difference from the nearest levels. Furthermore, the Random Forest output was extensively linear in relation to BIS, thus with better DoA prediction accuracy. In conclusion, the proposed method provides a concrete basis for monitoring patients' anaesthetic level during surgeries.

However, the large volumes of data with high dimensions cause computational complexity in EEG data processing and pose a great challenge to the use of wearable EEG devices in healthcare. This paper proposes a new approach to extract the structural information of EEG data and tackle the curse of dimensionality of the EEG data. A set of methods for dimensionality reduction (DR)-like linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and their improved methods have been developed for EEG processing in the literature. However, the existing LDA-related methods suffer from the singularity problem or expensive computational cost, and none of existing methods take into consideration the structure of the projection matrix, which is crucial for the extraction of the structural information of the EEG data. In this paper, a new method called a regularized matrix discriminant analysis (R-MDA) is proposed for EEG feature representation and DR. In the R-MDA, the EEG data are represented as a data matrix, and projection vectors are reshaped to be a set of projection matrices stacking together. By reformulating the LDA as a least-square formulation and imposing specified constraint on each projection matrix, the new R-MDA has been constructed to effectively reduce EEG dimensions and capturing the structural information of the EEG data. Experimental results demonstrate that this new R-MDA outperforms the existing LDA-related methods, including achieving improved accuracy with significant DR of the EEG data. This offers an effective way to enable wearable EEG devices be applicable in human-centered health monitoring.

In this paper, machine learning methods are used to model a relationship using the publicly available dataset SEED (SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset) which contains EEG signals of 15 participants recorded when excited to video stimuli. The signal processing techniques in time domain and time-frequency domain (Wavelet analysis) are used to extract the desired features. The discrete wavelet transforms are used to extract frequency bands. The features such as Statistical features, Hjorth parameters, differential entropy, and the combination on symmetric electrodes (differential asymmetry DASM and rational asymmetry RASM) are extracted. Artificial neural networks and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are applied on the feature set to develop prediction models to extract the emotion information carried by the participant from emotional characteristics exhibited in different frequency bands. These models are evaluated on the dataset and emotions are classified using ANN into three different states such as positive, negative and neutral states with an accuracy of 91.2%.											11	5	5	0	1	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES	2191-530X	2191-5318	978-981-10-6698-6; 978-981-10-6697-9	SPRINGERBR APPL SCI			2018							101	112		10.1007/978-981-10-6698-6_10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-6698-6_10	10.1007/978-981-10-6653-5		12	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Multidisciplinary Sciences	Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)	Computer Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics	BK6NC					2022-08-02	WOS:000440592300010

The use of the MVPA approach for source-reconstructed MEG/EEG data is uncommon. For these data, we need to consider the source orientation information and the signal leakage among brain regions. In the present study, we evaluate the perspective of the MVPA approach in the context of source orientation information and signal leakage in source-reconstructed MEG data. We perform face vs. tool object category decoding (FvsT-OCD) of event-related responses from single or multiple voxels from a brain region using a univariate analysis approach and/or the MVPA approach. We also propose and perform symmetric signal leakage correction of source reconstructed data using an independent component analysis-based approach. FvsT-OCD using single voxel information shows higher sensitivity for the MVPA approach than univariate analysis, as the MVPA approach efficiently utilizes information on all three dipole orientations and is less affected by inter-subject variability. The MVPA approach shows higher sensitivity for FvsT-OCD when considering information from multiple voxels than for a single voxel in a brain region. This finding suggests that the MVPA approach captures the latent multivoxel distributed pattern. However, the results may be partly or entirely attributable to signal leakage between brain regions, as the sensitivity is substantially reduced after signal leakage correction. A consideration of signal leakage is therefore essential during the evaluation of MVPA outcomes.

Multimodal characterization of the semantic N400 response within a rapid evaluation brain vital sign framework	JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article						N400; ERP; MEG; Semantic language; Clinical application	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; LEXICAL DECISION; MEG-DATA; WORD; CONSCIOUSNESS; DISORDERS; SENTENCES; EEG	Background: For nearly four decades, the N400 has been an important brainwave marker of semantic processing. It can be recorded non-invasively from the scalp using electrical and/or magnetic sensors, but largely within the restricted domain of research laboratories specialized to run specific N400 experiments. However, there is increasing evidence of significant clinical utility for the N400 in neurological evaluation, particularly at the individual level. To enable clinical applications, we recently reported a rapid evaluation framework known as"brain vital signs"that successfully incorporated the N400 response as one of the core components for cognitive function evaluation. The current study characterized the rapidly evoked N400 response to demonstrate that it shares consistent features with traditional N400 responses acquired in research laboratory settings-thereby enabling its translation into brain vital signs applications. Methods: Data were collected from 17 healthy individuals using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), with analysis of sensor-level effects as well as evaluation of brain sources. Individual-level N400 responses were classified using machine learning to determine the percentage of participants in whom the response was successfully detected. Results: The N400 response was observed in both M/EEG modalities showing significant differences to incongruent versus congruent condition in the expected time range (p <0.05). Also as expected, N400-related brain activity was observed in the temporal and inferior frontal cortical regions, with typical left-hemispheric asymmetry. Classification robustly confirmed the N400 effect at the individual level with high accuracy (89%), sensitivity (0.88) and specificity (0.90). Conclusion: The brain vital sign N400 characteristics were highly consistent with features of the previously reported N400 responses acquired using traditional laboratory-based experiments. These results provide important evidence supporting clinical translation of the rapidly acquired N400 response as a potential tool for assessments of higher cognitive functions.

Brain-machine interfaces for controlling lower-limb powered robotic systems	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						BMI; EEG; lower-limb; exoskeleton; walk; classification; neural decoding	SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; COMPUTER INTERFACE; GAIT; EXOSKELETONS; REHABILITATION; WALKING; MOVEMENT; OSCILLATIONS; IMAGINATION; WHEELCHAIR	Objective. Lower-limb, powered robotics systems such as exoskeletons and orthoses have emerged as novel robotic interventions to assist or rehabilitate people with walking disabilities. These devices are generally controlled by certain physical maneuvers, for example pressing buttons or shifting body weight. Although effective, these control schemes are not what humans naturally use. The usability and clinical relevance of these robotics systems could be further enhanced by brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). A number of preliminary studies have been published on this topic, but a systematic understanding of the experimental design, tasks, and performance of BMI-exoskeleton systems for restoration of gait is lacking. Approach. To address this gap, we applied standard systematic review methodology for a literature search in PubMed and EMBASE databases and identified 11 studies involving BMI-robotics systems. The devices, user population, input and output of the BMIs and robot systems respectively, neural features, decoders, denoising techniques, and system performance were reviewed and compared. Main results. Results showed BMIs classifying walk versus stand tasks are the most common. The results also indicate that electroencephalography (EEG) is the only recording method for humans. Performance was not clearly presented in most of the studies. Several challenges were summarized, including EEG denoising, safety, responsiveness and others. Significance. We conclude that lower-body powered exoskeletons with automated gait intention detection based on BMIs open new possibilities in the assistance and rehabilitation fields, although the current performance, clinical benefits and several key challenging issues indicate that additional research and development is required to deploy these systems in the clinic and at home. Moreover, rigorous EEG denoising techniques, suitable performance metrics, consistent trial reporting, and more clinical trials are needed to advance the field.

However, in addition to the common artifacts in standard EEG data, spTMS-EEG data suffer from enormous stimulation-induced artifacts, posing significant challenges to the extraction of neural information. Typically, neural signals are analyzed after a manual time-intensive and often subjective process of artifact rejection. Here we describe a fully automated algorithm for spTMS-EEG artifact rejection. A key step of this algorithm is to decompose the spTMS-EEG data into statistically independent components (ICs), and then train a pattern classifier to automatically identify artifact components based on knowledge of the spatio-temporal profile of both neural and artefactual activities. The autocleaned and hand-cleaned data yield qualitatively similar group evoked potential waveforms. The algorithm achieves a 95% IC classification accuracy referenced to expert artifact rejection performance, and does so across a large number of spTMS-EEG data sets (n=90 stimulation sites), retains high accuracy across stimulation sites/subjects/populations/montages, and outperforms current automated algorithms. Moreover, the algorithm was superior to the artifact rejection performance of relatively novice individuals, who would be the likely users of spTMS-EEG as the technique becomes more broadly disseminated. In summary, our algorithm provides an automated, fast, objective, and accurate method for cleaning spTMS-EEG data, which can increase the utility of TMS-EEG in both clinical and basic neuroscience settings.

A key design consideration is where and how to access neural correlates of intended speech. Most prior work has examined cortical field potentials at a coarse resolution using electroencephalography (EEG) or medium resolution using electrocorticography (ECoG). The few studies of speech with single-neuron resolution recorded from ventral areas known to be part of the speech network. Here, we recorded from two 96-electrode arrays chronically implanted into the 'hand knob' area of motor cortex while a person with tetraplegia spoke. Despite being located in an area previously demonstrated to modulate during attempted arm movements, many electrodes' neuronal firing rates responded to speech production. In offline analyses, we could classify which of 9 phonemes (plus silence) was spoken with 81% single-trial accuracy using a combination of spike rate and local field potential (LFP) power. This suggests that high-fidelity speech prostheses may be possible using large-scale intracortical recordings in motor cortical areas involved in controlling speech articulators.

This study expects to better quality of life by motor imagery and replacement of neuro-muscular pathways as BCI systems work on motor imagery to control prosthetic limbs for rehabilitation therapy. In this research, multiple combinations of classifiers have been used to classify electroencephalographic (EEG) signals in order to acquire maximum classification accuracy for a three classes EEG based BCI system. Data set IVa from the BCI Competition III was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. One-Verous-Rest common spatial patterns(OVR-CSP) is commonly used to extract discriminative spatial filters which can divide the three types of motion imaging tasks into three new two-category classification tasks. We considered using OVR-CSP to extract features together and submitted them to Naive Bayes, LDA, QDA and SVM algorithms which can obviously classify left hand, right hand, and right foot movement. OVR-CSP combined with LDA classifier performed best with an accuracy of 84.62%. Experiments show that these novel findings clearly exhibit the feasibility of achieving good classification accuracies using the covariance matrix of EEG signals as feature vectors and LDA as classifier. Our approach presented in this paper is relatively simple, easy to execute and is validated robustly with a large dataset.

How to effectively extract features and improve the recognition rate of EEG signals is one of the hot problems in this field. This study is based on the motor imagery ECoG signals, in which the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is used for feature extraction, and then the extracted energy features are classified by the classification algorithms. In order to improve the classification accuracy of the ECoG signals, this study introduces the sparse representation-based classification (SRC) algorithm with the elastic network constraint. Then the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) algorithm and the least angle regression (LARS) algorithm are respectively applied to sparse coding for the ECoG signals. The elastic network which combines the L1 norm and the L2 norm not only avoids the over-fitting problem, but also has a higher prediction ability than the Lasso algorithm.

J	Mert, A; Akan, A				Mert, Ahmet; Akan, Aydin			Emotion recognition from EEG signals by using multivariate empirical mode decomposition	PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Empirical mode decomposition; Multivariate empirical mode decomposition; Emotion recognition; Electroencephalogram	CLASSIFICATION; SEIZURE	This paper explores the advanced properties of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and its multivariate extension (MEMD) for emotion recognition. Since emotion recognition using EEG is a challenging study due to nonstationary behavior of the signals caused by complicated neuronal activity in the brain, sophisticated signal processing methods are required to extract the hidden patterns in the EEG. In addition, multichannel analysis is another issue to be considered when dealing with EEG signals. EMD is a recently proposed iterative method to analyze nonlinear and nonstationary time series. It decomposes a signal into a set of oscillations called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) without requiring a set of basis functions. In this study, a MEMD-based feature extraction method is proposed to process multichannel EEG signals for emotion recognition. The multichannel IMFs extracted by MEMD are analyzed using various time and frequency domain techniques such as power ratio, power spectral density, entropy, Hjorth parameters and correlation as features of valance and arousal scales of the participants. The proposed method is applied to the DEAP emotional EEG data set, and the results are compared with similar previous studies for benchmarking.

Extracting multidimensional stimulus-response correlations using hybrid encoding-decoding of neural activity	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							TEMPORAL RECEPTIVE WINDOWS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; NATURAL SPEECH; COCKTAIL PARTY; ATTENTION; RECONSTRUCTION; INFORMATION; REVEALS; IMAGES; REPRESENTATION	In neuroscience, stimulus-response relationships have traditionally been analyzed using either encoding or decoding models. Here we propose a hybrid approach that decomposes neural activity into multiple components, each representing a portion of the stimulus. The technique is implemented via canonical correlation analysis (CCA) by temporally filtering the stimulus (encoding) and spatially filtering the neural responses (decoding) such that the resulting components are maximally correlated. In contrast to existing methods, this approach recovers multiple correlated stimulus-response pairs, and thus affords a richer, multidimensional analysis of neural representations. We first validated the technique's ability to recover multiple stimulus-driven components using electroencephalographic (EEG) data simulated with a finite element model of the head. We then applied the technique to real EEG responses to auditory and audiovisual narratives experienced identically across subjects, as well as uniquely experienced video game play. During narratives, both auditory and visual stimulus-response correlations (SRC) were modulated by attention and tracked inter-subject correlations. During video game play, SRC varied with game difficulty and the presence of a dual task. Interestingly, the strongest component extracted for visual and auditory features of film clips had nearly identical spatial distributions, suggesting that the predominant encephalographic response to naturalistic stimuli is supramodal. The diversity of these findings demonstrates the utility of measuring multidimensional SRC via hybrid encoding-decoding.

A computer game was created that mimics a real-world application of assistive BCIs, with the main outcome metric being the time needed to complete the game. This approach was used at the Cybathlon 2016, a competition for people with disabilities who use assistive technology to achieve tasks. The paper summarizes the technical challenges of BCIs, describes the design of the benchmarking game, then describes the rules for acceptable hardware, software and inclusion of human pilots in the BCI competition at the Cybathlon. The 11 participating teams, their approaches, and their results at the Cybathlon are presented. Though the benchmarking procedure has some limitations (for instance, we were unable to identify any factors that clearly contribute to BCI performance), it can be successfully used to analyze BCI performance in realistic, less structured conditions. In the future, the parameters of the benchmarking game could bemodified to bettermimic different applications (e.g., the need to use some commands more frequently than others). Furthermore, the Cybathlon has the potential to showcase such devices to the general public.

In this paper, for the issue of epileptic electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recognition, we propose a fast recognition algorithm. Firstly, we demonstrate that the classical zero-order TSK fuzzy system is equivalence to a single layer feedforward natural network, then we consider the optimization of the single layer feedforward natural network as a ridge regression problem and derive an analytical solution to this problem. Compare with the traditional quadratic programming of zero-order TSK fuzzy systems, our algorithm does not need to tune the parameters in if-parts of fuzzy rules which are often obtained by clustering technologies. We obtain them randomly. In addition, for the parameter learning of then-parts of fuzzy rules, our algorithm only needs to compute an inverse matrix with low time complexity rather than iterations in quadratic programming. The proposed fast recognition algorithm is verified on UCI datasets and EEG signal datasets and the results indicate that it is a promising algorithm when comparing with other similar algorithms.

This research article presents a novel architecture of classification of four finger movements (thumb movement, index finger movement, middle and index finger combined movement and fist movement) of the right hand on the basis of EEG (Electroencephalogram) data of the movements, The presented architecture utilizes Guided filter for reduction of noise (artefacts) from EEG signals alpha and beta band (8-30 Hz). As this band contains the maximum information of movement in terms of motor imagery, Rank Transform is employed as feature extraction approach for further enhancement of processed EEG signals.

Drowsiness level can be readily detected through measurement of human brain activity. The electroencephalogram (EEG), a device whose application relies on adhering electrodes to the scalp, is the primary method used to monitor brain activity. The many electrodes and wires required to perform an EEG place considerable constraints on the movement of users, and the cost of the device limits its availability. For these reasons, conventional EEG devices are not used in practical studies and businesses. Many potential practical applications could benefit from the development of a wire-free, low-priced device; however, it remains to be elucidated whether portable EEG devices can be used to estimate human drowsiness levels and applied within practical research settings and businesses. In this study, we outline the development of a drowsiness detection system that makes use of a low-priced, prefrontal single-channel EEG device and evaluate its performance in an offline analysis and a practical experiment. Firstly, for the development of the system, we compared three feature extraction methods: power spectral density (PSD), autoregressive (AR) modeling, and multiscale entropy (MSE) for detecting characteristics of an EEG. In order to efficiently select a meaningful PSD, we utilized step-wise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA). Time-averaging and robust-scaling were used to fit the data for pattern recognition. Pattern recognition was performed by a support vector machine (SVM) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. The optimal hyperparameters for the SVM were selected by the grind search method so as to increase drowsiness detection accuracy. To evaluate the performance of the detections, we calculated classification accuracy using the SVM through 10-fold cross-validation. Our model achieved a classification accuracy of 72.7% using the PSD with SWLDA and the SVM. Secondly, we conducted a practical study using the system and evaluated its performance in a practical situation. There was a significant difference (* p < 0.05) between the drowsiness-evoked task and concentration-needed task. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our low-priced portable drowsiness detection system in quantifying drowsy states.

However, the partial accuracy of emotion recognition is low. For improving the accuracy rate, original EEG signal is filtered to 5 bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma), then the Differential Entropy (DE), Power Spectral Density (PSD), Wavelet Entropy (WE) and Approximate Entropy (ApEn) are selected by feature extraction method. Finally, we select the features and use the support vector machine (SVM), KNN, Naive Bayes classifier and the neural network for classification learning. A large number of data generated by 62 channels is inconvenient to calculate, in this paper, we use SVM for training DE feature to get the higher accuracy with four different electrode placement methods. Through the study we found that the overall accuracy is generally higher than the accuracy of each frequency band. The high frequency band in emotional activities plays a more important role than the low frequency band. Smaller band and channels can also achieve the high accuracy.

Training a predictive model using EEG is challenging due to a small number of training trials, a low signal-to-noise ratio, and a high correlation among independent variables. When a predictive model is trained with a machine learning algorithm, the features extracted from multi-channel EEG signals are usually organized as a vector and their structures are ignored even though they are highly structured signals. This study predicts the subjective rating scores of synthesized speeches, including their overall impression, valence, and arousal, by creating tensor structured features instead of vectorized ones to exploit the structure of the features. We extracted various features to construct a tensor feature that maintained their structure. Vectorized and tensorial features were used to predict the rating scales, and the experimental result showed that prediction with tensorial features achieved the better predictive performance. Among the features, the alpha and beta bands are particularly more effective for predictions than other features, which agrees with previous neurophysiological studies.

Considering the importance and the near-future development of noninvasive brain-machine interface (BMI) systems, this paper presents a comprehensive theoretical-experimental survey on the classification and evolutionary methods for BMI-based systems in which EEG signals are used. Approach. The paper is divided into two main parts. In the first part, a wide range of different types of the base and combinatorial classifiers including boosting and bagging classifiers and evolutionary algorithms are reviewed and investigated. In the second part, these classifiers and evolutionary algorithms are assessed and compared based on two types of relatively widely used BMI systems, sensory motor rhythm-BMI and event-related potentials-BMI. Moreover, in the second part, some of the improved evolutionary algorithms as well as bi-objective algorithms are experimentally assessed and compared. Main results. In this study two databases are used, and cross-validation accuracy (CVA) and stability to data volume (SDV) are considered as the evaluation criteria for the classifiers. According to the experimental results on both databases, regarding the base classifiers, linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines with respect to CVA evaluation metric, and naive Bayes with respect to SDV demonstrated the best performances. Among the combinatorial classifiers, four classifiers, Bagg-DT (bagging decision tree), LogitBoost, and GentleBoost with respect to CVA, and Bagging-LR (bagging logistic regression) and AdaBoost (adaptive boosting) with respect to SDV had the best performances. Finally, regarding the evolutionary algorithms, single-objective invasive weed optimization (IWO) and bi-objective nondominated sorting IWO algorithms demonstrated the best performances. Significance. We present a general survey on the base and the combinatorial classification methods for EEG signals (sensory motor rhythm and event-related potentials) as well as their optimization methods through the evolutionary algorithms. In addition, experimental and statistical significance tests are carried out to study the applicability and effectiveness of the reviewed methods.

Neuromarketing background suggested that consumers might be seduced by the attentional bias which can direct their decision. This study aims at modelling and visualisation of the brain activity patterns generated by marketing product features with respect to the spatio-temporal relationships between the continuous EEG data streams. This research utilises brain-like Spiking Neural Network (SNN) models for analysing spatio-temporal brain patterns generated by attentional bias. The model was applied to Electroencephalogram (EEG) data for investigating the effectiveness of attentional bias on consumer preference towards marketing stimuli. Our experimental results have shown that consumers were more likely to get distracted by product features that are related to their subconscious preferences. This paper proofs that consumers pay the highest attention to non-target stimuli when they were presented with attractive features. This study provided a proof of principle for the role of attentional bias on concern-related human preferences. It represents knowledge discovery in the prediction of consumer preferences in the field of neuromarketing. The SNN-based models performed superior not only in achieving a higher classification of EEG data related to different stimuli in comparison with traditional methods, but it most importantly enables a better interpretation and understanding of underpinning brain functions against marketing stimuli.

The incidence and significance of periictal apnea in epileptic seizures	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						apnea; breathing; seizures; sudden unexpected death in epilepsy; temporal epilepsy	NEAR-SUDEP; STIMULATION; AMYGDALA; HIPPOCAMPAL; PATTERNS; DEATH	ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to investigate periictal central apnea as a seizure semiological feature, its localizing value, and possible relationship with sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) pathomechanisms. MethodsWe prospectively studied polygraphic physiological responses, including inductance plethysmography, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), electrocardiography, and video electroencephalography (VEEG) in 473 patients in a multicenter study of SUDEP. Seizures were classified according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) 2017 seizure classification based on the most prominent clinical signs during VEEG. The putative epileptogenic zone was defined based on clinical history, seizure semiology, neuroimaging, and EEG. ResultsComplete datasets were available in 126 patients in 312 seizures. Ictal central apnea (ICA) occurred exclusively in focal epilepsy (51/109 patients [47%] and 103/312 seizures [36.5%]) (P<.001). ICA was the only clinical manifestation in 16/103 (16.5%) seizures, and preceded EEG seizure onset by 84.9s, in 56/103 (54.3%) seizures. ICA 60s was associated with severe hypoxemia (SpO(2) <75%). Focal onset impaired awareness (FOIA) motor onset with automatisms and FOA nonmotor onset semiologies were associated with ICA presence (P<.001), ICA duration (P=.002), and moderate/severe hypoxemia (P=.04). Temporal lobe epilepsy was highly associated with ICA in comparison to extratemporal epilepsy (P=.001) and frontal lobe epilepsy (P=.001). Isolated postictal central apnea was not seen; in 3/103 seizures (3%), ICA persisted into the postictal period. SignificanceICA is a frequent, self-limiting semiological feature of focal epilepsy, often starting before surface EEG onset, and may be the only clinical manifestation of focal seizures. However, prolonged ICA (60s) is associated with severe hypoxemia and may be a potential SUDEP biomarker. ICA is more frequently seen in temporal than extratemporal seizures, and in typical temporal seizure semiologies. ICA rarely persists after seizure end. ICA agnosia is typical, and thus it may remain unrecognized without polygraphic measurements that include breathing parameters.

One prominent class of actions, the human locomotion, has been object of several studies, all focused on manipulating the shape of degraded human figures like point-light walker (PLW) stimuli, represented as walking on the spot. Nevertheless, since the main goal of the locomotor function is to displace the whole body from one position to the other, these stimuli might not fully represent a goal-directed action and thus might not be able to induce the same motor resonance mechanism expected when observing a natural locomotion. To explore this hypothesis, we recorded the event-related potentials (ERP) of canonical/scrambled and translating/centered PLWs decoding. We individuated a novel ERP component (N2c) over central electrodes, around 435 ms after stimulus onset, for translating compared to centered PLW, only when the canonical shape was preserved. Consistently with our hypothesis, sources analysis associated this component to the activation of trunk and lower legs primary sensory-motor and supplementary motor areas. These results confirm the role of own motor repertoire in processing human action and suggest that ERP can detect the associated motor resonance only when the human figure is explicitly involved in performing a meaningful action.

The current study introduces a method for deep learning of electroencephalogram (EEG) data using a spiking neural network (SNN) approach that reveals the complexity of peri-perceptual processes of familiarity. The method is applied to data from 20 participants viewing familiar and unfamiliar logos. The results support the potential of SNN models as novel tools in the exploration of peri-perceptual mechanisms that respond differentially to familiar and unfamiliar stimuli. Specifically, the activation pattern of the time-locked response identified by the proposed SNN model at approximately 200 milliseconds post-stimulus suggests greater connectivity and more widespread dynamic spatio-temporal patterns for familiar than unfamiliar logos. The proposed SNN approach can be applied to study other peri-perceptual or perceptual brain processes in cognitive and computational neuroscience.

Methods We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with aSAH between 2011 and 2016. A set of 473 predictor variables was evaluated. Our outcome measure was discharge Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). For laboratory and physiological data, we computed the minimum, maximum, median, and variance for the first three admission days. We created a penalized logistic regression model to determine predictors of outcome and a multivariate multilevel prediction model to predict poor (GOS 1-2), intermediate (GOS 3), or good (GOS 4-5) outcomes. Results One hundred and fifty-three patients met inclusion criteria; most were discharged with a GOS of 3. Multivariate analysis predictors of mortality (AUC 0.9198) included APACHE II score, Glasgow Come Scale (GCS), white blood cell (WBC) count, mean arterial pressure, variance of serum glucose, intracranial pressure (ICP), and serum sodium. Predictors of death/dependence versus independence (GOS 4-5)(AUC 0.9456) were levetiracetam, mechanical ventilation, WBC count, heart rate, ICP variance, GCS, APACHE II, and epileptiform discharges. The multiclass prediction model selected GCS, admission APACHE II, periodic discharges, lacosamide, and rebleeding as significant predictors; model performance exceeded 80% accuracy in predicting poor or good outcome and exceeded 70% accuracy for predicting intermediate outcome. Conclusions Variance in early physiologic data can impact patient outcomes and may serve as targets for early goal-directed therapy. Electronically retrievable features such as ICP, glucose levels, and electroencephalography patterns should be considered in disease severity and risk stratification scores.

Most of the previous studies are focused in building an individual discrimination model for every subject (subject dependent model). Building subject-independent models is a harder problem due to the high data variability between different subjects and different experiments with the same subject. This paper explores, for the first time, the Factor Analysis as an efficient technique to extract temporal and spatial EEG features suitable to build brain-computer interface for decoding human emotions across various subjects. Our findings show that early waves (temporal window of 200-400 ms after the stimulus onset) carry more information about the valence of the emotion. Also, spatial location of features, with a stronger impact on the emotional valence, occurs in the parietal and occipital regions of the brain. All discrimination models (NN, SVM, kNN, and RF) demonstrate better discrimination rate of the positive valence. These results match closely experimental psychology hypothesis that, during early periods after the stimulus presentation, the brain response-to images with highly positive valence-is stronger.

The classification performance of CSP deeply depends on the MI related channels and classifiers. However, many existing variants of CSP usually design spatial patterns by removing irrelevant or noisy distorted channels and selecting classifiers manually. In this paper, we propose a novel but simple calculation model termed information fusion scheme based CSP (IFCSP). It employs information fusion technology to take the place of conventional classifiers. Firstly, we divide all channels into several symmetrical sensor groups. Then the average Euclidean distance ratio (EDR) of each sensor group is calculated between different MI tasks following CSP. In the end, information fusion technology is employed to make the utmost of EDRs of all sensor groups to obtain the final result. In this study, the channel division scheme and parameter setting are determined by cross-validation on training data. As such, the proposed method can be customized to yield better classification accuracy. The proposed IFCSP method is validated on the well-known BCI competition IV dataset 2a. Experimental results reveal that the proposed IFCSP method outperforms other existing competitive approaches in the classification of motor imagery tasks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The first description of absence seizures was made by Poupart in 1705 and Tissot in 1770. In 1824, Calmed introduced the term "absences", and in 1838, Esquirol for the first time used the term petit mal. Reynolds instead used the term "epilepsia mitior" (milder epilepsy) and provided a comprehensive description of absence seizures (1861). In 1854, Delasiauve ranked absences as the seizure type with lower severity and introduced the concept of idiopathic epilepsy. Otto Binswanger (1899) discussed the role of cortex in the pathophysiology of "abortive seizures", whereas William Cowers (1901) emphasized the importance of a detailed clinical history to identify nonmotor seizures or very mild motor phenomena which otherwise may go unnoticed or considered not epileptic. At the beginning of the 20th Century, the term pyknotepsy was introduced, but initially was not universally considered as a type of epilepsy; it was definitely recognized as an epileptic entity only in 1945, based on electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Hans Berger, the inventor of the EEG, made also the first EEG recording of an atypical absence (his results were published only in 1933), whereas the characteristic EEG pattern was reported by neurophysiologists of the Harvard Medical School in 1935. The discovery of EEG made it also possible to differentiate absence seizures from so called "psychomotor" seizures occurring in temporal lobe epilepsy. Penfield and Jasper (1938) considered absences as expression of "centrencephalic epilepsy". Typical absences seizures are now classified by the International League Against Epilepsy among generalized nonmotor (absence) seizures. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although the common feature-level fusion allows capturing spatial dependencies across sensors, the significant increase of feature vector dimensionality does not allow learning the classification models using a small number of samples usually available in practice. In decision-level fusion on the other hand, sensor-specific classification models are trained and subsequently integrated to reach a combined decision. Recent work has shown that decision-level fusion with a global (common for all sensors) classification model, is more appropriate for generalized events that show a (weak or strong) manifestation across all sensors. Although we can hypothesize that the choice of scheme depends on the event type (generalized vs focal/local), the prior work does not provide enough evidence to guide on the choice of fusion scheme. Thus in this work we aim to compare the three data fusion schemes for classification of generalized and nongeneralized events using two case scenarios: (i) classification of paroxysmal events based on EEG patterns and (ii) classification of falls and activities of daily living (ADL5) from multiple sensors. The results support our hypothesis that feature level fusion is more beneficial for the characterization of heterogeneous data (based on an adequate number of samples), while sensorindependent classifiers should be selected in the case of generalized manifestation patterns.

The current study elicited two positive emotions (amusement and tenderness) and two negative emotions (anger and fear) that are similar in both valence and arousal dimensions to examine the differences in brain activities in these emotional states. Frontal electroencephalographic (EEG) asymmetry and midline power in three bands (theta, alpha and beta) were measured when participants watched affective film excerpts. Significant differences were detected between tenderness and amusement on FP1/FP2 theta asymmetry, F3/F4 theta and alpha asymmetry. Significant differences between anger and fear on FP1/FP2 theta asymmetry and F3/F4 alpha asymmetry were also observed. For midline power, midline theta power could distinguish two negative emotions, while midline alpha and beta power could effectively differentiate two positive emotions. Liking and dominance were also related to EEG features. Stepwise multiple linear regression results revealed that frontal alpha and theta asymmetry could predict the subjective feelings of two positive and two negative emotions in different patterns. The binary classification accuracy, which used EEG frontal asymmetry and midline power as features and support vector machine (SVM) as classifiers, was as high as 64.52% for tenderness and amusement and 78.79% for anger and fear. The classification accuracy was improved after adding these features to other features extracted across the scalp. These findings indicate that frontal EEG asymmetry and midline power might have the potential to recognize discrete emotions that are similar in the valence-arousal coordinate space.

The proposed system is used to acquire signals while users are interacting with horses. The captured signals will then be used in order to quantitatively evaluate human and equine interaction by mapping the signals to the emotional state of the subjects using machine learning techniques. In this preliminary study, ECG based features were utilised in order to create a supervised classification model that can identify emotions elicited during human-horse interaction. Experimental results provide evidence about the efficiency of the proposed approach in distinguishing between negative and positive emotions, reaching a classification accuracy of 74.21%.

The estimation of sleep disorder plays an important role in identifying sleep stages. Correct predictions can aid doctors in the diagnosis and further treatment. In this paper, features are extracted in both time and time-frequency domain and classified using a various machine learning algorithm. The recorded EEG datasets are divided into delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma sub-bands, and a set of descriptive statistical features are attained from all the sub-bands in the time domain. In the time-frequency domain, spectral energy features are extracted from the S-transform. Finally, classification is done using three different classifiers such as ANN, KNN, and SVM. The extensive numerical simulation results illustrate that the proposed method is providing more classification accuracy.

The critical component in BMI-training consists of the associative connection (contingency) between the intention and the feedback provided. However, the relationship between the BMI design and its performance in stroke patients is still an open question. Methods: In this study we compare different methodologies to design a BMI for rehabilitation and evaluate their effects on movement intention decoding performance. We analyze the data of 37 chronic stroke patients who underwent 4weeks of BMI intervention with different types of association between their brain activity and the proprioceptive feedback. We simulate the pseudo-online performance that a BMI would have under different conditions, varying: (1) the cortical source of activity (i.e., ipsilesional, contralesional, bihemispheric), (2) the type of spatial filter applied, (3) the EEG frequency band, (4) the type of classifier; and also evaluated the use of residual EMG activity to decode the movement intentions. Results: We observed a significant influence of the different BMI designs on the obtained performances. Our results revealed that using bihemispheric beta activity with a common average reference and an adaptive support vector machine led to the best classification results. Furthermore, the decoding results based on brain activity were significantly higher than those based on muscle activity. Conclusions: This paper underscores the relevance of the different parameters used to decode movement, using EEG in severely paralyzed stroke patients. We demonstrated significant differences in performance for the different designs, which supports further research that should elucidate if those approaches leading to higher accuracies also induce higher motor recovery in paralyzed stroke patients.

EEG signals are useful for doing deductions about the mental state of a person and diagnosing a number of diseases such as epilepsy, brain tumors, and trauma caused problems. The EEG technique is widely used for the diagnosis and analysis of aforementioned diseases. Only epilepsy, an acute and recurring neurological disorder, affects 0.06 million people around the globe [2]. This fact states the importance of the automated systems designed for detecting the neurological disorders. The current automated systems generally designed using signal processing and machine learning techniques, are proven great tools for the analysis of complex, non-stationary and non-linear EEG signals. Fractal dimensions, a derived theory from fractal geometry is a valuable tool that allows scientist to handle complex functions, objects or data sequences in a relatively simple yet effective way. The proposed study provides a new and simple method to detect epilepsy disease based on signal windowing in time domain and fractal dimension. The result of are discussed in order to state the fact that the proposed method is giving promising results.

A knowledge discovery methodology from EEG data for cyclic alternating pattern detection	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE			English	Article						Cyclic alternating pattern; A-phase detection; EEG processing; Knowledge discovery in data	SLOW-WAVE SYNCHRONIZATION; LEMPEL-ZIV COMPLEXITY; AUTOMATIC DETECTION; ENERGY OPERATOR; SLEEP; CAP; CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; EPILEPSY; VALIDATION	BackgroundDetection and quantification of cyclic alternating patterns (CAP) components has the potential to serve as a disease bio-marker. Few methods exist to discriminate all the different CAP components, they do not present appropriate sensitivities, and often they are evaluated based on accuracy (AC) that is not an appropriate measure for imbalanced datasets.MethodsWe describe a knowledge discovery methodology in data (KDD) aiming the development of automatic CAP scoring approaches. Automatic CAP scoring was faced from two perspectives: the binary distinction between A-phases and B-phases, and also for multi-class classification of the different CAP components. The most important KDD stages are: extraction of 55 features, feature ranking/transformation, and classification. Classification is performed by (i) support vector machine (SVM), (ii) k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and (iii) discriminant analysis. We report the weighted accuracy (WAC) that accounts for class imbalance.ResultsThe study includes 30 subjects from the CAP Sleep Database of Physionet. The best alternative for the discrimination of the different A-phase subtypes involved feature ranking by the minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm (mRMR) and classification by SVM, with a WAC of 51%. Concerning the binary discrimination between A-phases and B-phases, k-NN with mRMR ranking achieved the best WAC of 80%.ConclusionsWe describe a KDD that, to the best of our knowledge, was for the first time applied to CAP scoring. In particular, the fully discrimination of the three different A-phases subtypes is a new perspective, since past works tried multi-class approaches but based on grouping of different sub-types. We also considered the weighted accuracy, in addition to simple accuracy, resulting in a more trustworthy performance assessment. Globally, better subtype sensitivities than other published approaches were achieved.	[Machado, Fatima; Dourado, Antonio; Teixeira, C.

At the core of our approach is a local binary pattern (LBP) based feature representation containing a set of statistical features derived from the distribution of LBPs of the ECG signal. In order to enhance the discriminating power, a set of statistical features are also extracted from the original ECG signal. The composite feature is then generated by combining the two homogeneous feature sets. The discriminating ability of the proposed composite feature is investigated using two different classifiers namely, support vector machine and a bagged ensemble of decision trees. Results from the experimental evaluation on the publicly available MIT-BIH ECG dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed features over conventional histogram based LBP features. Our results also show that the proposed approach provides better classification accuracy than methods existing in the literature for classification of normal and partial epileptic beats in ECG.

The motor imagery (MI) is presented by specific signal features that reflect the user's intention to be extracted and interpreted as commands. This paper focuses on the classification of two types of MI tasks (Right Hand and Foot). We deployed various feature extraction techniques for EEG data using wavelet transform and common spatial pattern. For the wavelet features, statistical values, energy, entropy and band power were used to form the desired feature vectors. Before extracting wavelet coefficients, we performed two scenarios, with and without surface laplacian filter around the channels C3, C4 and Cz. Three types of classifiers were employed for classification, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). The aim of this work is to compare between them and to recommend the suitable combination for synchronous two-class motor-imagery-based brain-computer interface experiments. The data were recorded from five subjects, provided by BCI-Competition III. The results show that SVM is more suitable with the features than those extracted from wavelet coefficients and combination of entropy-energy-band power, and LDA is more suitable with common spatial pattern. Overall, the results from CSP-LDA are better than those obtained from WT-SVM with the average classification accuracy of 84.79% and 82.64%, respectively.

J	Collins, E; Robinson, AK; Behrmann, M				Collins, Elliot; Robinson, Amanda K.; Behrmann, Marlene			Distinct neural processes for the perception of familiar versus unfamiliar faces along the visual hierarchy revealed by EEG	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Face processing; Face recognition; FPVS; Frequency tagging; EEG; Famous faces	SELECTIVE ATTENTION; STEADY-STATE; RECOGNITION; IDENTITY; SYSTEMS; REPRESENTATIONS; RESPONSES; OBJECT; AREAS; VIEW	Humans recognize faces with ease, despite the complexity of the task and of the visual system which underlies it. Different spatial regions, including both the core and extended face processing networks, and distinct temporal stages of processing have been implicated in face recognition, but there is ongoing controversy regarding the extent to which the mechanisms for recognizing a familiar face differ from those for an unfamiliar face. Here, we used electroencephalogram (EEG) and flicker SSVEP, a high signal-to-noise approach, and searchlight decoding methods to elucidate the mechanisms mediating the processing of familiar and unfamiliar faces in the time domain. Familiar and unfamiliar faces were presented periodically at 15 Hz, 6 Hz and 3.75 Hz either upright or inverted in separate blocks, with the rationale that faster frequencies require shorter processing times per image and tap into fundamentally different levels of visual processing. The 15 Hz trials, likely to reflect early visual processing, exhibited enhanced neural responses for familiar over unfamiliar face trials, but only when the faces were upright. In contrast, decoding methods revealed similar classification accuracies for upright and inverted faces for both familiar and unfamiliar faces. For the 6 Hz frequency, familiar faces had lower amplitude responses than unfamiliar faces, and decoding familiarity was more accurate for upright compared with inverted faces. Finally, the 3.75 Hz frequency revealed no main effects of familiarity, but decoding showed significant correlations with behavioral ratings of face familiarity, suggesting that activity evoked by this slow presentation frequency reflected higher-level, cognitive aspects of familiarity processing. This three-way dissociation between frequencies reveals that fundamentally different stages of the visual hierarchy are modulated by face familiarity. The combination of experimental and analytical approaches used here represent a novel method for elucidating spatio-temporal characteristics within the visual system.

In this letter, we focused on features of iEEG signals recorded during wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in order to find differences between the two states, respectively. We preliminary screened the data using standard deviation analysis (STD). Then, we compared and combined STD values with coefficients from wavelet decomposition (Daubechies mother wavelet of order 4). Resulting parameters were classified using an artificial neural network. STD analysis underlined two brain areas [superior temporal sulcus (STS) and intraparietal-sulcus and parietal transverse (IPS)] with different electrical activity in the two states. STD values of STS and IPS channels were highly correlated in time; therefore, only STS was then used further in the features extraction analysis. Approximation and detail coefficients from Daubechies decomposition were used alone or in combination with the STD value. The overall accuracy of the pattern recognition was higher (98.57%), when features from different methods were used in combination. Our test was able to automatically recognize wake or NREM sleep status with very good discrimination performances using one single iEEG electrode.

Despite the high number of degrees of freedom of the human hand, most actions of daily life can be executed incorporating only palmar, pincer and lateral grasp. In this study we attempt to discriminate these three different executed reach-and-grasp actions utilizing their EEG neural correlates. Approach. In a cue-guided experiment, 15 healthy individuals were asked to perform these actions using daily life objects. We recorded 72 trials for each reach-and-grasp condition and from a no-movement condition. Main results. Using lowfrequency time domain features from 0.3 to 3 Hz, we achieved binary classification accuracies of 72.4%, STD +/- 5.8% between grasp types, for grasps versus no-movement condition peak performances of 93.5%, STD +/- 4.6% could be reached. In an offline multiclass classification scenario which incorporated not only all reach-and-grasp actions but also the no-movement condition, the highest performance could be reached using a window of 1000 ms for feature extraction. Classification performance peaked at 65.9%, STD +/- 8.1%. Underlying neural correlates of the reach-and-grasp actions, investigated over the primary motor cortex, showed significant differences starting from approximately 800 ms to 1200 ms after the movement onset which is also the same time frame where classification performance reached its maximum. Significance. We could show that it is possible to discriminate three executed reach-andgrasp actions prominent in people's everyday use from non-invasive EEG. Underlying neural correlates showed significant differences between all tested conditions. These findings will eventually contribute to our attempt of controlling a neuroprosthesis in a natural and intuitive way, which could ultimately benefit motor impaired end users in their daily life actions.

J	Ferdowsi, S; Abolghasemi, V				Ferdowsi, Saideh; Abolghasemi, Vahid			Multi layer spectral decomposition technique for ERD estimation in EEG mu rhythms: An EEG-fMRI study	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						EEG-fMRI combination; Event related desynchronization in mu band; Singular spectrum analysis; Spectral factorization	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; DESYNCHRONIZATION ERD; ARTIFACT; REMOVAL	In this paper, power suppression detection in mu band known as event-related desynchronization during a simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording is addressed. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiments provide great opportunities to recognize relation between the active areas in the brain, discovered by fMRI, and EEG events. However, decoding EEG is challenging as a result of artifacts which MRI scanner applies on EEG. Ballistocardiogram (BCG) is one of the main destructive artifacts which deteriorates EEG rhythms specially in mu band. The proposed method, is a supervised time-frequency decomposition algorithm which estimates underlying rhythms of EEG signals recorded in MRI scanner. In the proposed method, a multi layer decomposition approach using three criteria is developed to extract brain oscillations. This goal is achieved by eliminating the artifact related components at each decomposition layer as a result of removing useless extracted components in each layer. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated using synthetic and real EEG. The achieved results from synthetic data confirm the ability of the proposed method to extract mu rhythms when different levels of noise exist. In addition, proposed algorithm is applied on a set of real EEG acquired in a simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording. Estimated ERD confirms the superiority of the developed algorithm in terms of estimating changes of mu rhythms. Moreover, an EEG-fMRI integration is performed to explore the correlation between blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) in fMRI and ERD of mu rhythm in EEG. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In our experiments, the three neural network models-LSTM, CNN and CNN-LSTM were designed which could help to evaluate the situation of the patient. It was found that CNN-LSTM showed the best performance in predicting the MRS with the accuracy 99.68%. In exploring the EEG, we found that the envelope of beta and gamma bands show higher correlation with the unit output of the neural network (p <0.01, Analysis of Variance). For BFV, the correlation of BFV is strongly related to the responsible arteries of ischemic stroke, with a correct rate of 75%. In conclusion, the CNN-LSTM can predict the state of ischemic stroke patients, and the envelope of EEG and PSD features of BFV are important features learned by the network model for classification.

Scalp electroencephalograms (EEGs) of epilepsy patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of FCD type I or II (n=71, age=3-66 years, 28 female) and of controls with other underlying pathologies (n=43, age=2-60 years, 16 female) were retrospectively evaluated regarding the presence or absence of 12 scalp EEG patterns previously reported to be associated with FCD. Furthermore, 2 subgroups of these biomarkers with common characteristics were also analyzed. Each of the 12 biomarkers was tested for association with FCD by comparing the presence of each feature in FCD patients and controls using Fisher exact test. ResultsInterpretationA significant association with FCD as underlying etiology was found for 6 of 12 previously reported biomarkers. With decreasing odds ratios, these were continuous epileptiform discharges, 2 types of rhythmic epileptiform discharges, polyspikes, frequent rhythmic bursting epileptiform activity, and repetitive discharges as well as the subgroups containing repetitive activity and polyspikes, respectively. Presence of EEG biomarkers was independent of a visible underlying magnetic resonance imaging-visible lesion, and had similar prevalence with FCD I and II. Individual biomarkers had specificities of 65 to 98% and sensitivities of 17 to 61% for an underlying FCD, and combinations of EEG biomarkers achieved 100% specificity. This study confirms that there are several surface EEG biomarkers significantly associated with an underlying cortical dysplasia. These biomarkers may aid in localizing suspicious brain regions and provide evidence for dysplastic brain tissue also in nonlesional patients of either histological FCD subtype.

For this reason, in particular situations the cognitive demand experienced by the driver could be very high, inducing an excessive experienced mental workload and consequently an increasing of error commission probability. In this regard, it has been demonstrated that human error is the main cause of the 57% of road accidents and a contributing factor in most of them. In this study, 20 young subjects have been involved in a real driving experiment, performed under different traffic conditions (rush hour and not) and along different road types (main and secondary streets). Moreover, during the driving tasks different specific events, in particular a pedestrian crossing the road and a car entering the traffic flow just ahead of the experimental subject, have been acted. A Workload Index based on the Electroencephalographic (EEG), i.e., brain activity, of the drivers has been employed to investigate the impact of the different factors on the driver's workload. Eye-Tracking (ET) technology and subjective measures have also been employed in order to have a comprehensive overview of the driver's perceived workload and to investigate the different insights obtainable from the employed methodologies. The employment of such EEG-based Workload index confirmed the significant impact of both traffic and road types on the drivers' behavior (increasing their workload), with the advantage of being under real settings. Also, it allowed to highlight the increased workload related to external events while driving, in particular with a significant effect during those situations when the traffic was low. Finally, the comparison between methodologies revealed the higher sensitivity of neurophysiological measures with respect to ET and subjective ones. In conclusion, such an EEG-based Workload index would allow to assess objectively the mental workload experienced by the driver, standing out as a powerful tool for research aimed to investigate drivers' behavior and providing additional and complementary insights with respect to traditional methodologies employed within road safety research.

Stereotactic EEG-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS; SEIZURE RECURRENCE; SURGERY; LOBECTOMY; ABLATION; AMYGDALOHIPPOCAMPECTOMY; CLASSIFICATION; COMPLICATIONS; PATTERNS	Objective To determine the outcomes of combined stereo-electroencephalography-guided and MRI-guided stereotactic laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) in the treatment of patients with drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE). Methods We prospectively assessed the surgical and neuropsychological outcomes in 21 patients with medically refractory mTLE who underwent LITT at the University of Chicago Medical Center. We further compared the surgical outcomes in patients with and without mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). Results Of the 21 patients, 19 (90%) underwent Invasive EEG study and 11 (52%) achieved freedom from disabling seizures with a mean duration of postoperative follow-up of 24 +/- 11 months after LITT. Eight (73%) of 11 patients with MTS achieved freedom from disabling seizures, whereas 3 (30 %) of 10 patients without MTS achieved freedom from disabling seizures. Patients with MTS were significantly more likely to become seizure-free, as compared with those without MTS (P=0.002). There was no significant difference in total ablation volume and the percentage of the ablated amygdalohippocampal complex between seizure-free and non-seizure-free patients. Presurgical and postsurgical neuropsychological assessments were obtained in 10 of 21 patients. While there was no group decline in any neuropsychological assessment, a significant postoperative decline in verbal memory and confrontational naming was observed in individual patients. Conclusions MRI-guided LITT is a safe and effective alternative to selective amygdalohippocampectomy and anterior temporal lobectomy for mTLE with MTS. Nevertheless, its efficacy in those without MTS seems modest. Large multicentre and prospective studies are warranted to further determine the efficacy and safety of LITT.

In the case of endogenous systems the reliable detection of induced patterns is more challenging than the detection of the more stable and stereotypical evoked responses. In the former case specific mental activities such as motor imagery are used to encode different messages. In the latter case users have to attend to sensory stimuli to evoke a characteristic response. Indeed, a large number of users who try to control endogenous BCIs do not reach sufficient level of accuracy. This fact is also known as BCI "inefficiency" or "illiteracy". In this paper we discuss and make some conjectures, based on our knowledge and experience in BCI, on whether or not online co-adaptation of human and machine can be the solution to overcome this challenge. We point out some ingredients that might be necessary for the system to be reliable and allow the users to attain sufficient control.<bold> </bold>	[Scherer, Reinhold] Graz Univ Technol, Inst Neural Engn, Graz, Austria; [Faller, Josef; Sajda, Paul] Columbia Univ, Lab Intelligent Imaging & Neural Comp, New York, NY USA; [Vidaurre, Carmen] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Stat Informat & Math, Navarra, Spain		Scherer, R (corresponding author), Graz Univ Technol, Inst Neural Engn, Graz, Austria.	reinhold.scherer@tugraz.at; josef.faller@columbia.edu; psajda@columbia.edu; carmen.vidaurre@unavarra.es	Faller, Josef/ABG-2374-2020	Faller, Josef/0000-0001-7814-9292; Vidaurre, Carmen/0000-0003-3740-049X	FP7 Framework EU Research Projects ABC [287774]; Spanish MINECO [RyC-2014-15671]	FP7 Framework EU Research Projects ABC; Spanish MINECO(Spanish Government)	R.

By analyzing brain waves measured by NeuroSky MindWave headset, the system can serve to prevent drowsy driving. It also provides driver with drowsy driving pattern by accumulating environmental elements like weather, temperature, and location, etc. in which the driver habitually falls drowsy. By analyzing brain wave data, the system creates a classification model based on deep neural network to determine whether the driver is drowsy or not. When it determines that the driver is drowsy, it sends alarm to the driver's smart phone or smart watch, or to the device of passenger designated by the driver beforehand. We expect that the system will help prevent drowsy driving.

The algorithm combines local binary patterns with brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing to enable end-to-end learning and inference with binary operations. The algorithm first transforms iEEG time series from each electrode into local binary pattern codes. Then atomic high-dimensional binary vectors are used to construct composite representations of seizures across all electrodes. For the majority of our patients (10 out of 16), the algorithm quickly learns from one or two seizures (i.e., one-/few-shot learning) and perfectly generalizes on 27 further seizures. For other patients, the algorithm requires three to six seizures for learning. Overall, our algorithm surpasses the state-of-the-art methods [1] for detecting 65 novel seizures with higher specificity and sensitivity, and lower memory footprint.

Although fMRI methods are optimized for identifying the structure of brain networks, the relatively slow temporal course of fMRI limits the ability to characterize network operation. The latter is crucial for developing a mechanistic understanding of how brain networks shift dynamically to support inhibitory control. To address this critical gap, we applied spectrally resolved Granger causality (GC) and random forest machine learning tools to human EEG data in two large samples of adults (test sample n = 96, replication sample n = 237, total N = 333, both sexes) who performed a color-word Stroop task. Time-frequency analysis confirmed that recruitment of inhibitory control accompanied by slower behavioral responses was related to changes in theta and alpha/beta power. GC analyses revealed directionally asymmetric exchanges within frontal and between frontal and parietal brain areas: top-down influence of superior frontal gyrus (SFG) over both dorsal ACC (dACC) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), dACC control over middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and frontal-parietal exchanges (IFG, precuneus, MFG). Predictive analytics confirmed a combination of behavioral and brain-derived variables as the best set of predictors of inhibitory control demands, with SFG theta bearing higher classification importance than dACC theta and posterior beta tracking the onset of behavioral response. The present results provide mechanistic insight into the biological implementation of a psychological phenomenon: inhibitory control is implemented by dynamic routing processes during which the target response is upregulated via theta-mediated effective connectivity within key PFC nodes and via beta-mediated motor preparation.

Early detection of cancer can effectively reduce the rate of mortality caused by Prostate cancer. Due to high and multiresolution of MRIs from prostate cancer require a proper diagnostic systems and tools. In the past researchers developed Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems that help the radiologist to detect the abnormalities. In this research paper, we have employed novel Machine learning techniques such as Bayesian approach, Support vector machine (SVM) kernels: polynomial, radial base function (RBF) and Gaussian and Decision Tree for detecting prostate cancer. Moreover, different features extracting strategies are proposed to improve the detection performance. The features extracting strategies are based on texture, morphological, scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), and elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs) features. The performance was evaluated based on single as well as combination of features using Machine Learning Classification techniques. The Cross validation (Jack-knife k-fold) was performed and performance was evaluated in term of receiver operating curve (ROC) and specificity, sensitivity, Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), false positive rate (FPR). Based on single features extracting strategies, SVM Gaussian Kernel gives the highest accuracy of 98.34% with AUC of 0.999. While, using combination of features extracting strategies, SVM Gaussian kernel with texture + morphological, and EFDs + morphological features give the highest accuracy of 99.71% and AUC of 1.00.

The novelty of research here lies in the design of vertical slice based General Type-2 Fuzzy Classifier, capable of classifying finer changes in the brain activation patterns due to changes in the touch nourishment on a subject by different people, including spouse, children, graces of the Almighty and parents. Experiments undertaken confirm that for most of the subjects the above four classes are prominent in the brain activation patterns. The frontal lobe is more activated in devotion and respect, whereas temporal lobe is more activated in fondness and love. The General Type-2 fuzzy classifier designed for classification of four affection classes yield high classification accuracy over 98 % in comparison to existing type-1 fuzzy and other classifies. The proposed scheme of touch-induced affection classification can be interestingly applied to measure subjective sensitivity of healthy and psychologically disabled people.

Specifically, we propose to use a steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (SSSEP) paradigm, which elicits brain responses to tactile stimulation of specific frequencies, for a user's intention to control a wheelchair. In our system, a user had three possible commands by concentrating on one of three vibration stimuli, which were attached to the left-hand, right-hand, and right-foot, to selectively control the wheelchair. The three stimuli were associated with three wheelchair commands: turn-left, turn-right, and move-forward. From a machine learning perspective, we also devise a novel feature representation by combining spatial and spectral characteristics of brain signals. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed SSSEP-based system, we considered two different tasks: 1) a simple obstacle-avoidance task within a limited time and; 2) a driving task along the predefined trajectory of about 40 m length, where there were a narrow pathway, a door, and obstacles. In both experiments, we recruited 12 subjects and compared the average time of motor imagery (MI) and SSSEP-based controls to complete the task. With the SSSEP-based control, all subjects successfully completed the task without making any collision while four subjects failed it with MI-based control. It is also noteworthy that in terms of the average time to complete the task, the SSSEP-based control outperformed the MI-based control. In the other more challenging task, all subjects successfully reached the target location.

Time-invariant multi-scale matrices are constructed in the first step. The two-directional two-dimensional principal component analysis then operates on the multi-scale matrices to reduce the dimension, rather than vectors in conventional PCA. Results are presented from an experiment to classify twenty hand motions using 89-channel EMG signals recorded in stroke survivors, which illustrates the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method for biomedical signal analysis. With this multi-scale two-directional two-dimensional principal component analysis for high-dimensional signal classification, spatial-time-frequency discriminant information from high-dimensional EMG electrode array can be effectively extracted and reduced using the proposed method. Compared with the time domain feature extraction in conjunction with PCA, MS2D(2)PCA performed better with higher classification accuracy and less PCs in EMG classification. The efficiency and effectiveness of the method can be further validated by using high-dimensional EEG, MEG, fMRI signals. Although the present study focuses on high-dimensional signal pattern classification, based on the PCs obtained at multiple scales, it is relatively straightforward to expand MS2D(2)PCA for high-dimensional signal compression, denoising, component extraction, and other related tasks.

Methods: 15 healthy participants, eight males and seven females, mean age 40.8 +/- 9.5 years, wore a set of three commercial sensors to record physiological signals during the Maastricht Acute Stress Test, an experimental protocol known to elicit robust physical and mental stress in humans. Salivary samples were collected throughout the different phases of the test. Statistical analysis was performed using a support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm. A correlation analysis between extracted physiological features and salivary cortisol levels was also performed. Results: 15 features extracted from heart rate variability, electrodermal, and electroencephalography signals showed a high degree of significance in disentangling stress from a relaxed state. The classification algorithm, based on significant features, provided satisfactory outcomes with 86% accuracy. Furthermore, correlation analysis showed that the observed changes in physiological features were consistent with the trend of salivary cortisol levels (R-2 = 0.714). Conclusion: The tested set of wearable sensors was able to successfully capture human stress and quantify stress level. Significance: The results of this pilot study may be useful in designing portable and remote control systems, such as medical devices used to turn on interventions and prevent stress consequences.

J	Dai, MX; Zheng, DZ; Liu, SC; Zhang, PJ				Dai, Mengxi; Zheng, Dezhi; Liu, Shucong; Zhang, Pengju			Transfer Kernel Common Spatial Patterns for Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interface Classification	COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE			English	Article							EEG	Motor-imagery-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) commonly use the common spatial pattern (CSP) as preprocessing step before classification. The CSP method is a supervised algorithm. Therefore a lot of time-consuming training data is needed to build the model. To address this issue, one promising approach is transfer learning, which generalizes a learning model can extract discriminative information fromother subjects for target classification task. To this end, we propose a transfer kernel CSP (TKCSP) approach to learn a domain-invariant kernel by directly matching distributions of source subjects and target subjects. The dataset IVa of BCI Competition III is used to demonstrate the validity by our proposed methods. In the experiment, we compare the classification performance of the TKCSP against CSP, CSP for subject-to-subject transfer (CSP SJ-to-SJ), regularizing CSP (RCSP), stationary subspace CSP (ssCSP), multitask CSP (mtCSP), and the combined mtCSP and ssCSP (ss + mtCSP) method. The results indicate that the superior mean classification performance of TKCSP can achieve 81.14%, especially in case of source subjects with fewer number of training samples. Comprehensive experimental evidence on the dataset verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed TKCSP approach over several state-of-the-art methods.

Integrating Space, Time, and Orientation in Spiking Neural Networks: A Case Study on Multimodal Brain Data Modeling	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); multimodal brain data; NeuCube; response to treatment; schizophrenia; spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP); spiking neural network	CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; SPATIOTEMPORAL DATA; ICA-AROMA; FMRI; FUSION; CLASSIFICATION; CEREBELLAR; MACHINE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; CONNECTIVITY	Recent progress in a noninvasive brain data sampling technology has facilitated simultaneous sampling of multiple modalities of brain data, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, diffusion tensor imaging, and so on. In spite of the potential benefits from integrating predictive modeling of multiple modality brain data, this area of research remains mostly unexplored due to a lack of methodological advancements. The difficulty in fusing multiple modalities of brain data within a single model lies in the heterogeneous temporal and spatial characteristics of the data sources. Recent advances in spiking neural network systems, however, provide the flexibility to incorporate multidimensional information within the model. This paper proposes a novel, unsupervised learning algorithm for fusing temporal, spatial, and orientation information in a spiking neural network architecture that could potentially be used to understand and perform predictive modeling using multimodal data. The proposed algorithm is evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively using synthetically generated data to characterize its behavior and its ability to utilize spatial, temporal, and orientation information within the model. This leads to improved pattern recognition capabilities and performance along with robust interpretability of the brain data. Furthermore, a case study is presented, which aims to build a computational model that discriminates between people with schizophrenia who respond or do not respond to monotherapy with the antipsychotic clozapine.

Objective of this study is to classify driver workload associated with traffic complexity into five levels. We conducted driving experiments in systematically varied traffic complexity levels in a simulator. We recorded driver physiological signals including electrocardiography, electrodermal activity, and electroencephalography. In addition, we integrated driver performance and subjective workload measures. Deep learning based models outperform statistical machine learning methods when dealing with dynamic time-series data with variable sequence lengths. We show that our long short-term memory based recurrent neural network model can classify driver perceived-workload into five classes with an accuracy of 74.5%. Since perceived workload differ between individual drivers for the same traffic situation, our results further highlight the significance of including driver characteristics such as driving style and workload sensitivity to achieve higher classification accuracy.

Methods: Participants included N = 25 individuals with Parkinson's disease and an equal number of well-matched controls. EEG was recorded during a three-stimulus auditory oddball paradigm both ON and OFF medication. Results: While control participants showed reliable EEG habituation to novel events over time, individuals with Parkinson's did not. In the OFF condition, individual differences in habituation correlated with years since diagnosis. Pattern classifiers achieved high sensitivity and specificity in discriminating patients from controls, with a maximum accuracy of 82%. Most importantly, the confidence of the classifier was related to years since diagnosis, and this correlation increased as the time course of differential habituation increasingly distinguished the groups. Conclusions: These findings identify systemic alteration in an obligatory neural mechanism that may contribute to higher-level cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease.

The accuracy of the prediction algorithms to detect seizure in real-world applications is largely limited because the brain signals are inherently uncertain and affected by various factors, such as environment, age, drug intake, etc., in addition to the internal artefacts that occur during the process of recording the brain signals. To deal with such ambiguity, researchers transitionally use active learning, which selects the ambiguous data to be annotated by an expert and updates the classification model dynamically. However, selecting the particular data from a pool of large ambiguous datasets to be labelled by an expert is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an active learning-based prediction framework that aims to improve the accuracy of the prediction with a minimum number of labelled data. The core technique of our framework is employing the Bernoulli-Gaussian Mixture model (BGMM) to determine the feature samples that have the most ambiguity to be annotated by an expert. By doing so, our approach facilitates expert intervention as well as increasing medical reliability. We evaluate seven different classifiers in terms of the classification time and memory required. An active learning framework built on top of the best performing classifier is evaluated in terms of required annotation effort to achieve a high level of prediction accuracy. The results show that our approach can achieve the same accuracy as a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using only 20% of the labelled data and also improve the prediction accuracy even under the noisy condition.

J	Wallroth, R; Hochenberger, R; Ohla, K				Wallroth, Raphael; Hoechenberger, Richard; Ohla, Kathrin			Delta activity encodes taste information in the human brain	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Gustation; Taste quality; EEG; MVPA; Delta	GUSTATORY CORTEX; NEURAL OSCILLATIONS; EEG-DATA; RESPONSES; SYNCHRONY; PHASE; TIME; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; MECHANISMS	The categorization of food via sensing nutrients or toxins is crucial to the survival of any organism. On ingestion, rapid responses within the gustatory system are required to identify the oral stimulus to guide immediate behavior (swallowing or expulsion). The way in which the human brain accomplishes this task has so far remained unclear. Using multivariate analysis of 64-channel scalp EEG recordings obtained from 16 volunteers during tasting salty, sweet, sour, or bitter solutions, we found that activity in the delta-frequency range (1-4 Hz; delta power and phase) has information about taste identity in the human brain, with discriminable response patterns at the single-trial level within 130 ms of tasting. Importantly, the latencies of these response patterns predicted the point in time at which participants indicated detection of a taste by pressing a button. Furthermore, taste pattern discrimination was independent of motor-related activation and encoded taste identity rather than other taste features such as intensity and valence. On comparison with our previous findings from a delayed taste-discrimination task (Crouzet et al., 2015), taste-specific neural representations emerged earlier during this speeded taste-detection task, suggesting a goal-dependent flexibility in gustatory response coding. Together, these findings provide the first evidence of a role of delta activity in taste-information coding in humans. Crucially, these neuronal response patterns can be linked to the speed of simple gustatory perceptual decisions - a vital performance index of nutrient sensing.

The dataset consists of fifty nine channels of EEG signals which are first normalised using minmax method and then given as input to the FFBPNN network. Experimental outcomes of the FFBPNN are recorded in term of '0's or '1's for two classes of motor imagery signals. The accuracy of the proposed FFBPNN method has been measured using confusion matrix, mean square error and percentage accuracy. However, accuracy of the FFBPNN based method is recorded up to 99.8%. Hence the proposed method gives better accuracy of the classification which will ultimately help in designing robust BCI. (C) 2018 Ain Shams University.

Mental State Assessment and Validation Using Personalized Physiological Biometrics	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						computational models; machine learning; mental fatigue; stress; attention; validation; N-back recall; EEG	SIMULATED PROCESS-CONTROL; PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES; SUSTAINED ATTENTION; STRESS; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM; TASK; EEG; TIME; RESPONSES	Mental state monitoring is a critical component of current and future human-machine interfaces, including semi-autonomous driving and flying, air traffic control, decision aids, training systems, and will soon be integrated into ubiquitous products like cell phones and laptops. Current mental state assessment approaches supply quantitative measures, but their only frame of reference is generic population-level ranges. What is needed are physiological biometrics that are validated in the context of task performance of individuals. Using curated intake experiments, we are able to generate personalized models of three key biometrics as useful indicators of mental state; namely, mental fatigue, stress, and attention. We demonstrate improvements to existing approaches through the introduction of new features. Furthermore, addressing the current limitations in assessing the efficacy of biometrics for individual subjects, we propose and employ a multi-level validation scheme for the biometric models by means of k-fold cross-validation for discrete classification and regression testing for continuous prediction. The paper not only provides a unified pipeline for extracting a comprehensive mental state evaluation from a parsimonious set of sensors (only EEG and ECG), but also demonstrates the use of validation techniques in the absence of empirical data. Furthermore, as an example of the application of these models to novel situations, we evaluate the significance of correlations of personalized biometrics to the dynamic fluctuations of accuracy and reaction time on an unrelated threat detection task using a permutation test. Our results provide a path toward integrating biometrics into augmented human-machine interfaces in a judicious way that can help to maximize task performance.

The main difficulties are in the classification of signals and the determination of patterns of nerve impulses that actuate the limbs of the human body. If these problems are successfully solved, the classified patterns can be used to control biomechanical systems, for example, such as bionic prostheses. Modern methods of artificial neural networks open up the prospect for realizing an effective classification of the received impulses. However, the effectiveness depends on the chosen model of the artificial neuron and its computational complexity. This article will consider the most popular hybrid neural networks, and it will be shown that they have such advantages as resource intensity, energy efficiency and high level of accuracy of calculations and at the same time are biorealistically enough.

Experiments were conducted on male rat before and after Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Experts in neurology performed a manual markup of signals as Epileptiform Discharges (ED) and Sleep Spindles (SS). A proprietary Event Detection Algorithm based on time-frequency analysis of wavelet spectrograms was developed. Feature space was based on Power Spectrum Density (PSD) and Frequency of signals, and each feature was assessed for importance of epileptic activity prediction. Resulted predictors were used for training logistic regression model, which estimated features weights in probability of epilepsy function. Validation of proposed model was done by multiple train-test division. It was shown that the accuracy of prediction is around 80%. Proposed Epilepsy Prediction Model, as well as Event Detection Algorithm, can be applied to identification of epileptiform activity in long term EEG records of rats and analysis of disease dynamics.

Decoding Inner Speech Using Electrocorticography: Progress and Challenges Toward a Speech Prosthesis	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						inner speech; electrocorticography; decoding; neuroprosthetics; brain-computer interface	BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; TEMPORAL RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; HUMAN SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; AUDITORY IMAGERY; MUSICAL IMAGERY; LANGUAGE; MOTOR; EEG; RESTORATION; NEURONS	Certain brain disorders resulting from brainstem infarcts, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, stroke, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, limit verbal communication despite the patient being fully aware. People that cannot communicate due to neurological disorders would benefit from a system that can infer internal speech directly from brain signals. In this review article, we describe the state of the art in decoding inner speech, ranging from early acoustic sound features, to higher order speech units. We focused on intracranial recordings, as this technique allows monitoring brain activity with high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution, and therefore is a good candidate to investigate inner speech. Despite intense efforts, investigating how the human cortex encodes inner speech remains an elusive challenge, due to the lack of behavioral and observable measures. We emphasize various challenges commonly encountered when investigating inner speech decoding, and propose potential solutions in order to get closer to a natural speech assistive device.

Predictive coding of visual object position ahead of moving objects revealed by time-resolved EEG decoding	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							MOTION; CORTEX; EXTRAPOLATION; REPRESENTATION; LATENCIES; DYNAMICS; STIMULI; RETINA; TARGET; BRAIN	Due to the delays inherent in neuronal transmission, our awareness of sensory events necessarily lags behind the occurrence of those events in the world. If the visual system did not compensate for these delays, we would consistently mislocalize moving objects behind their actual position. Anticipatory mechanisms that might compensate for these delays have been reported in animals, and such mechanisms have also been hypothesized to underlie perceptual effects in humans such as the Flash-Lag Effect. However, to date no direct physiological evidence for anticipatory mechanisms has been found in humans. Here, we apply multivariate pattern classification to time-resolved EEG data to investigate anticipatory coding of object position in humans. By comparing the time-course of neural position representation for objects in both random and predictable apparent motion, we isolated anticipatory mechanisms that could compensate for neural delays when motion trajectories were predictable. As well as revealing an early neural position representation (lag 80-90 ms) that was unaffected by the predictability of the object's trajectory, we demonstrate a second neural position representation at 140-150 ms that was distinct from the first, and that was pre-activated ahead of the moving object when it moved on a predictable trajectory. The latency advantage for predictable motion was approximately 16 +/- 2 ms. To our knowledge, this provides the first direct experimental neurophysiological evidence of anticipatory coding in human vision, revealing the time-course of predictive mechanisms without using a spatial proxy for time. The results are numerically consistent with earlier animal work, and suggest that current models of spatial predictive coding in visual cortex can be effectively extended into the temporal domain.

Functional Brain Connectivity during Multiple Motor Imagery Tasks in Spinal Cord Injury	NEURAL PLASTICITY			English	Article							HIGH-RESOLUTION EEG; SCALE NETWORK ANALYSIS; CAUSAL RELATIONS; BCI CONTROL; PATTERNS; REHABILITATION; CLASSIFICATION; REORGANIZATION; RELIABILITY; RECORDINGS	Reciprocal communication of the central and peripheral nervous systems is compromised during spinal cord injury due to neurotrauma of ascending and descending pathways. Changes in brain organization after spinal cord injury have been associated with differences in prognosis. Changes in functional connectivity may also serve as injury biomarkers. Most studies on functional connectivity have focused on chronic complete injury or resting-state condition. In our study, ten right-handed patients with incomplete spinal cord injury and ten age- and gender-matched healthy controls performed multiple visual motor imagery tasks of upper extremities and walking under high-resolution electroencephalography recording. Directed transfer function was used to study connectivity at the cortical source space between sensorimotor nodes. Chronic disruption of reciprocal communication in incomplete injury could result in permanent significant decrease of connectivity in a subset of the sensorimotor network, regardless of positive or negative neurological outcome. Cingulate motor areas consistently contributed the larger outflow (right) and received the higher inflow (left) among all nodes, across all motor imagery categories, in both groups. Injured subjects had higher outflow from left cingulate than healthy subjects and higher inflow in right cingulate than healthy subjects. Alpha networks were less dense, showing less integration and more segregation than beta networks. Spinal cord injury patients showed signs of increased local processing as adaptive mechanism.

This disease reduces the quality of life of patients and their families due to the constant danger of sudden convulsions or loss of consciousness. Thus, it is important to have automated seizure prediction systems that alert to patients about this risk. Many methods and techniques have been proposed in the last years to address this problem. However, further research is needed to improve the efficiency and adaptability of current systems. Hence, this work analyzes several configurations for a seizure prediction system based on spectral wavelet decomposition of electroencephalogram signals. The evaluation of this systems shows that a few electrodes can predict seizures with an accuracy of 99.9% and a sensitivity of 99.8%. We are convinced that studies like this will definitively help to improve the quality of live of people suffering from epileptic seizures.

Nevertheless, most studies on the ADHD children, which employed the EEG signals for analyzing the ADHD influence on the brain activities, considered the EEG signals as a random or chaotic process without considering the role of these opposites in the brain activities. In this study, we considered the EEG signals as a biotic process according to these opposites and examined the ADHD effect on the brain activity by defining the dual sets of transitions between states in the complement plots of quantized EEG segments. The results of this study generally indicated that the complement plots of quantized EEG signal have a surprising regularity similar to the Mandala patterns compared to the chaotic processes. These results also indicated that the probability of occurrence of dual sets in the complement plots of ADHD children was averagely different (p < 0.01) from that of healthy children, so that the SVM classifier developed by these probabilities could significantly separate the ADHD from healthy children (99.37% and 98.25% for training and testing sets, respectively). Therefore, the complement plots of quantized EEG signals relevant to the ADHD children not only can quantify informational opposition caused by inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, but also these plots can provide remarkable information for developing new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques.

Omair			VMD-RiM: Rician Modeling of Temporal Feature Variation Extracted From Variational Mode Decomposed EEG Signal for Automatic Sleep Apnea Detection	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						EEG signal; entropy; goodness of feature; KNN classifier; model fitting; Rician model; sleep apnea; sub-framing; variational mode decomposition	RECOGNITION; HYPOPNEA	Electroencephalogram (EEG) is getting special attention of late in the detection of sleep apnea as it is directly related to the neural activity. But apnea detection through visual monitoring of EEG signal by an expert is expensive, difficult, and susceptible to human error. To counter this problem, an automatic apnea detection scheme is proposed in this paper using a single lead EEG signal, which can differentiate apnea patients and healthy subjects and also classify apnea and non-apnea frames in the data of an apnea patient. Each sub-frame of a given frame of EEG data is first decomposed into band-limited intrinsic mode functions (BLIMFs) by using the variational mode decomposition (VMD). The advantage of using VMD is to obtain compact BLIMFs with adaptive center frequencies, which give an opportunity to capture the local information corresponding to varying neural activity. Furthermore, by extracting features from each BLIMF, a temporal within-frame feature variation pattern is obtained for each mode. We propose to fit the resulting pattern with the Rician model (RiM) and utilize the fitted model parameters as features. The use of such VMD-RiM features not only offers better feature quality but also ensures very low feature dimension. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, K nearest neighbor classifier is used and various cross-validation schemes are carried out. Detailed experimentation is carried out on several apnea and healthy subjects of various apnea-hypopnea indices from three publicly available datasets and it is found that the proposed method achieves superior classification performances in comparison to those obtained by the existing methods, in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.

Recently, motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) has become an active research field where a subject's active intent can be detected. The accurate decoding of MI-EEG signals is essential for effective BCI systems but also very challenging due to the lack of informative correlation between the signals and the brain activities. To improve the precision performance of a BCI system, accurate feature discrimination from input signals and proper classification are necessary. However, the traditional deep learning scheme is failed to generate spatio-temporal representation simultaneously and capture the dynamic correlation for an MI-EEG sequence. To address this problem, we propose a long short-term memory network combined with a spatial convolutional network that concurrently learns spatial information and temporal correlations from raw MI-EEG signals. In addition, spectral representations of EEG signals are obtained via a discrete wavelet transformation decomposition. In order to achieve even higher learning rates and less demanding initialization, we employ a batch normalization method before training and recognition. Various experiments have been performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed deep learning architectures. Results indicate a high level of accuracy over both the public data set and the local data set. Our method can also serve as a useful and robust model for multi-task classification and subject-independent movement class decoder across many different methods.

These semantic vectors have also been extensively studied in correlation with human brain data, showing evidence that the representation of language in the human brain can be modeled through these vectors with high correlation. Further, various attempts have been made to study how the human brain represents and understands music. For example, it has been shown that EEG data of subjects listening to music can be used for tempo detection and singer gender recognition.

To improve event-related desynchronization during motor imagery and obtain improved brain-computer interface classification accuracy, we introduce dynamic video guidance and complex motor tasks to the motor imagery paradigm. Methods: Eleven participants were included in the experiment; 64-channel electroencephalographic data were collected and analyzed during four motor imagery tasks with different guidance. Time-frequency analysis, spectral-time variation analysis, topographical distribution maps, and statistical analysis were utilized to analyze the event-related desynchronization patterns. Common spatial patterns were used to extract spatial pattern features and support vector machines were used to discriminate the offline classification accuracies in three bands (the alpha band, beta band, alpha and beta band) for comparison. Results: The experimental outcomes showed that complex motor imagery tasks coupled with dynamic video guidance induced significantly stronger event-related desynchronization than other paradigms, which use simple motor imagery tasks or static guidance. Similar results were obtained during analysis of the motor imagery brain-computer interface classification performance; namely, the highest average classification accuracy in complex and dynamic guidance was improved by approximately 14%, compared with static guidance. For individually specified paradigms, all participants obtained a classification accuracy that exceeded or was equal to 87.5%. Conclusions: This study provides an optional route to enhance the event-related desynchronization activities and classification accuracy of a motor imagery brain-computer interface through optimization of motor imagery tasks and instructive guidance.

J	Ruan, J; Wu, XP; Zhou, BY; Guo, XJ; Lv, Z				Ruan, Jing; Wu, Xiaopei; Zhou, Bangyan; Guo, Xiaojing; Lv, Zhao			An Automatic Channel Selection Approach for ICA-Based Motor Imagery Brain Computer Interface	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Brain computer interface; Independent component analysis; Channel selection; Motor imagery	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; EEG SIGNALS; CLASSIFICATION; BCI; DESYNCHRONIZATION	Independent component analysis (ICA) is a potential spatial filtering method for the implementation of motor imagery brain-computer interface (MIBCI). However, ICA-based MIBCI (ICA-MIBCI) is sensitive to electroencephalogram (EEG) channels and the quality of the training data, which are two crucial factors affecting the stability and classification performance of ICA-MIBCI. To address these problems, this paper is mainly focused on the investigation of EEG channel optimization. As a reference, we constructed a single-trial-based ICA-MIBCI system with commonly used channels and common spatial pattern-based MIBCI (CSP-MIBCI). To minimize the impact of artifacts on EEG channel optimization, a data-quality evaluation method, named self-testing in this paper, was used in a single-trial-based ICA-MIBCI system to evaluate the quality of single trials in each dataset; the resulting self-testing accuracies were used for the selection of high-quality trials. Given several candidate channel configurations, ICA filters were calculated using selected high-quality trials and applied to the corresponding ICA-MIBCI implementation. Optimal channels for each dataset were assessed and selected according to the self-testing results related to various candidate configurations. Forty-eight MI datasets of six subjects were employed in this study to validate the proposed methods. Experimental results revealed that the average classification accuracy of the optimal channels yielded a relative increment of 2.8% and 8.5% during self-testing, 14.4% and 9.5% during session-to-session transfer, and 36.2% and 26.7% during subject-to-subject transfer compared to CSP-MIBCI and ICA-MIBCI with fixed the channel configuration. This work indicates that the proposed methods can efficiently improve the practical feasibility of ICA-MIBCI.

Participants are tasked with memorizing German-Korean word association pairs, and their retention performance is tested on the day of and the day after learning. To investigate whether brain activity recorded via multi-channel EEG is predictive of memory formation, we perform statistical analysis followed by single-trial classification: first by using linear discriminant analysis, and then with convolutional neural networks. Our preliminary results confirm previous neurophysiological findings, that above-chance prediction of vocabulary memory formation is possible in both LDA and deep neural networks.

Many outstanding studies have reported great results in providing sensible indirect (warning systems) or direct (interactive neural stimulation) control over refractory seizures, some of which achieved high performance. However, to achieve high sensitivity and a low false prediction rate, many of these studies relied on handcraft feature extraction and/or tailored feature extraction, which is performed for each patient independently. This approach, however, is not generalizable, and requires significant modifications for each new patient within a new dataset. In this article, we apply convolutional neural networks to different intracranial and scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets and propose a generalized retrospective and patient-specific seizure prediction method. We use the short-time Fourier transform on 30-s EEG windows to extract information in both the frequency domain and the time domain. The algorithm automatically generates optimized features for each patient to best classify preictal and interictal segments. The method can be applied to any other patient from any dataset without the need for manual feature extraction. The proposed approach achieves sensitivity of 81.4%, 81.2%, and 75% and a false prediction rate of 0.06/h, 0.16/h, and 0.21/h on the Freiburg Hospital intracranial EEG dataset, the Boston Children's Hospital-MIT scalp EEG dataset, and the American Epilepsy Society Seizure Prediction Challenge dataset, respectively. Our prediction method is also statistically better than an unspecific random predictor for most of the patients in all three datasets. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recently, many researches show that the EEG of AD patients can be characterized by EEG slowing, enhanced complexity of the EEG signals, and EEG synchrony. In order to examine the neural synchrony at multi scales, and to find'a biomarker that help detecting AD in diagnosis, detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) of EEG signals is applied in this paper. Several parameters, namely DCCA coefficients in the whole brain, DCCA coefficients at a specific scale, maximum DCCA coefficient over the span of all time scales and the corresponding scale of such coefficients, were extracted to examine the synchronization, respectively. The results show that DCCA coefficients have a trend of increase as scale increases, and decreases as electrode distance increases. Comparing DCCA coefficients in AD patients with healthy controls, a decrease of synchronization in the whole brain, and a bigger scale corresponding to maximum correlation is discovered in AD patients. The change of max-correlation scale may relate to the slowing of oscillatory activities. Linear combination of max DCCA coefficient and max-correlation scale reaches a classification accuracy of 90%. From the above results, it is reasonable to conclude that DCCA coefficient reveals the change of both oscillation and synchrony in AD, and thus is a powerful tool to differentiate AD patients from healthy elderly individuals.

Salient features of the device are the ability to achieve higher and controllable stiffness for both isometric and isotonic contraction. Then we analyze the active control for isometric and isotonic movement through electroencephalograph (EEG) signal. This paper focuses on three issues. The first is using silicon rubber to build a soft finger which can continuously stretch and bend to fit the basic action of the fingers. The second is changing stiffness of the finger through the coordination between variable stiffness cavity and actuating cavity. The last is to classify different EEG states based on isometric and isotonic contraction using common spatial pattern feature extraction (CSP) methods and support vector machine classification methods (SVM). On this basis, an EEG-based manipulator control system was set up.

Relevant studies in the field of sports rehabilitation show that motor imagery training can promote the recovery of damaged nerves and the reconstruction of motor nerve pathways. This paper proposes a human-brain cooperative control strategy of a pneumatic muscle-driven ankle rehabilitation robot based on motor imagery EEG. Robots provide assisted rehabilitation training for patients with impaired neural transmission but with movement intentions. The brain network algorithm is used to select the optimal channels for the motor imagery signal, and the common spatial pattern (CSP) method is combined with the time-frequency analysis method local characteristic-scale decomposition (LCD) to extract the time-frequency information.Finally, the classification is processed by the spectral regression discriminant analysis (SRDA) classifier. In addition, two rehabilitation training modes are designed, namely, synchronous rehabilitation training and asynchronous rehabilitation training. The experimental results prove that a brain intention driven human robot cooperative control method is realized to complete an ankle rehabilitation training task effectively.

Despite such successful studies, there still remain solving works for the purpose of realizing an ECoG-based prosthesis. We suggest a neuromuscular interface to control robot using decoded muscle activities and joint angles. We used sparse linear regression to find the best fit between band-passed ECoGs and electromyograms (EMG) or joint angles. The best coefficient of determination for 100 s continuous prediction was 0.6333 +/- 0.0033 (muscle activations) and 0.6359 +/- 0.0929 (joint angles), respectively. We also controlled a 4 degree of freedom (DOF) robot arm using only decoded 4 DOF angles from the ECoGs in this study. Consequently, this study shows the possibility of contributing to future advancements in neuroprosthesis and neurorchabilitation technology.

A reliable automatic system could result in tremendous improvement in the quality of life of epilepsy patients. This paper presents dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), a data-driven dimensionality reduction technique, originally used in fluid mechanics, as an instrument for epileptic seizure detection from scalp electroencephalograph (EEG) data. DMD is employed in this paper to measure power of signals in different frequency bands. These subband-powers, along with signal curve lengths, are used as features for training random under-sampling boost decision-tree classifier. Post-processing measures ensure an acceptable balance between false positives and true positives. The proposed algorithm has been tested over a thousand hours of EEG data from two different data sets, the CHB-MIT data set and the KU Leuven data set, giving sensitivity values of 0.87 and 0.88, respectively, and specificity values of 0.99 for both the data sets.

The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is utilized to recognize the human electroencephalograph (EEG) signals in the brain-computer interface (BCI) system which is based on steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP). In this way the intentions of human can be distinguished and control commands are generated for mobile robot. The DLT is used to recognize the type of environmental obstacles and environmental features by analysing the images that describe the environment. And then according to the classification of obstacle, various potential fields are built for the specific obstacles. By utilizing bottles as the features of environment, a whole map of the surroundings can be built through a sequential simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. The main contribution of this paper is that the relationship between the potential field strength and classification of EEG signals is built up through the combination of multiple artificial potential fields with the brain signals, which produces the motion commands and designs a trajectory free of obstacles in un-structure environments. Three volunteer subjects are invited to test the entire system, and all operators can successfully complete experiments of manipulating the robot in corridor environments.

Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) is a widely used method for learning spatial filters for user specific feature extraction but the performance is degraded when applied to a different user. This paper proposes a novel Adaptive Selective Common Spatial Pattern (ASCSP) method to update the covariance matrix using selected candidates. Subspace alignment is then applied to the extracted features before classification. The proposed method outperforms the standard CSP and adaptive CSP algorithms previously proposed. Visualization of extracted features is provided to demonstrate how subspace alignment contributes to reduce the domain variance between source and target domains.

Emotions produce different psycho physiological signal which is either stimulated by conscious or unconscious profundity of a situation or an object. Emotion has a key role in human communication as well as in modern BCI (brain-computer interaction) systems. Most of the contemporary BCI systems are lacking emotional intelligence and also they are not able to detect human emotional states for proper execution of action. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the common methods to acquire brain signals for brain computer interface (BCI). Most of the works for emotion recognition using EEG data are complex and with relatively average performance obtained. Hence, there is still a lot of space for developing a better performing system in emotion recognition. In the present work, a wavelet based better performing feature extraction algorithm is proposed. Further this algorithm is tested for different classifiers namely k Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM). The average sensitivity obtained for the present work was 92.97% with an accuracy of 91.67%, which is better result than the previous work.

Onset typically occurs in children and adolescents, but may also start in adulthood. These forms of adult onset constitute the focus of this review. A critical analysis of the medical literature was conducted through a narrative review search of PubMed and Medline databases. Cases of idiopathic generalised epilepsies with adult onset, in general, are not considered to be independent nosological entities. The grand mal on awakening seems to prevail among the idiopathic syndromes of adult onset. The EEG findings that question the diagnosis of late-onset idiopathic generalised epilepsies consist mainly of patterns interpreted as representing focal epileptiform activity. Normal brain MRI and typical EEG abnormalities are essential for diagnosis. For all cases with symptomatology of suspected adult-onset idiopathic generalised epilepsy, it is mandatory to exclude neurological conditions that may be associated with epileptic seizures which appear in this age group. A correct diagnosis of adult-onset idiopathic generalised epilepsy alleviates concern for a symptomatic origin, leading to appropriate antiepileptic treatment.

Methods A retrospective case-control study was performed on 159 patients who presented with a seizure and received an emergency VPCT within the first 3.5 hours of admission, after being misjudged to have an acute stroke. The reference test was a clinical-based, EEG-supported diagnostic algorithm for seizure. Results We included 133 patients: 94 stroke-mimicking cases with postictal focal neurologic deficits ("Todd phenomenon," n = 67) or ongoing seizure on hospital admission Octal patients," n = 27), and 39 postictal controls without focal neurologic deficits. Patients with Todd phenomenon showed normal perfusion (64%), hypoperfusion (21%), and hyperperfusion (14%) on early VPCT. Ictal patients displayed more hyperperfusion compared to postictal patients (p = 0.015). Test sensitivity of hyperperfusion for ictal patients is 38% (95% confidence interval [CI] 20.7%-57.7%), specificity 86% (95% CI 77.3%-91.7%), positive predictive value is 42% (95% CI 27.5%-58.7%), and the negative predictive value 83% (95% CI 78.6%-86.9%). A cortical distribution was seen in all hyperperfusion scans, compared to a cortico-subcortical pattern in hypoperfusion (p < 0.001). A history of complex focal seizure and age were associated with hyperperfusion (p = 0.046 and 0.038, respectively). Conclusion VPCT can differentiate ictal stroke mimics with hyperperfusion from acute ischemic stroke, but not postictal patients who display perfusion patterns overlapping with ischemic stroke. Classification of evidence This study provides Class IV evidence that VPCT accurately differentiates ictal stroke mimics from acute ischemic stroke.	[Van Cauwenberge, Margot G.

J	Astrand, E				Astrand, Elaine			A continuous time-resolved measure decoded from EEG oscillatory activity predicts working memory task performance	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						EEG; working memory; decoding; task performance	LOAD; CAPACITY; DYNAMICS; DIFFICULTY; ATTENTION; DRIVERS; ABILITY	Objective. Working memory (WM), crucial for successful behavioral performance in most of our everyday activities, holds a central role in goal-directed behavior. As task demands increase, inducing higher WM load, maintaining successful behavioral performance requires the brain to work at the higher end of its capacity. Because it is depending on both external and internal factors, individual WM load likely varies in a continuous fashion. The feasibility to extract such a continuous measure in time that correlates to behavioral performance during a working memory task remains unsolved. Approach. Multivariate pattern decoding was used to test whether a decoder constructed from two discrete levels of WM load can generalize to produce a continuous measure that predicts task performance. Specifically, a linear regression with L2-regularization was chosen with input features from EEG oscillatory activity recorded from healthy participants while performing the n-back task, n is an element of [1, 2]. Main results. The feasibility to extract a continuous time-resolved measure that correlates positively to trial-bytrial working memory task performance is demonstrated (r = 0.47, p < 0.05). It is furthermore shown that this measure allows to predict task performance before action (r = 0.49, p < 0.05). We show that the extracted continuous measure enables to study the temporal dynamics of the complex activation pattern of WM encoding during the n-back task. Specifically, temporally precise contributions of different spectral features are observed which extends previous findings of traditional univariate approaches. Significance. These results constitute an important contribution towards a wide range of applications in the field of cognitive brain-machine interfaces. Monitoring mental processes related to attention and WM load to reduce the risk of committing errors in high-risk environments could potentially prevent many devastating consequences or using the continuous measure as neurofeedback opens up new possibilities to develop novel rehabilitation techniques for individuals with degraded WM capacity.

The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of deep learning techniques and some of the state-of-the-art applications in the biomedical field. We first introduce the development of artificial neural network and deep learning. We then describe two main components of deep learning, i.e., deep learning architectures and model optimization. Subsequently, some examples are demonstrated for deep learning applications, including medical image classification, genomic sequence analysis, as well as protein structure classification and prediction. Finally, we offer our perspectives for the future directions in the field of deep learning.

Human EEG reveals distinct neural correlates of power and precision grasping types	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Brain-machine interfaces; Grasping; Neural correlates; EEG	BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; CORTICAL CONTROL; BRAIN; ALPHA; NETWORKS; RHYTHMS; MEG	Hand grasping is a sophisticated motor task that has received much attention by the neuroscientific community, which demonstrated how grasping activates a network involving parietal, pre-motor and motor cortices using fMRI, ECoG, LFPs and spiking activity. Yet, there is a need for a more precise spatio-temporal analysis as it is still unclear how these brain activations over large cortical areas evolve at the sub-second level. In this study, we recorded ten human participants (1 female) performing visually-guided, self-paced reaching and grasping with precision or power grips. Following the results, we demonstrate the existence of neural correlates of grasping from broadband EEG in self-paced conditions and show how neural correlates of precision and power grasps differentially evolve as grasps unfold. 100 ms before the grasp is secured, bilateral parietal regions showed increasingly differential patterns. Afterwards, sustained differences between both grasps occurred over the bilateral motor and parietal regions, and medial pre-frontal cortex. Furthermore, these differences were sufficiently discriminable to allow single-trial decoding with 70% decoding performance. Functional connectivity revealed differences at the network level between grasps in fronto-parietal networks, in terms of upper-alpha cortical oscillatory power with a strong involvement of ipsilateral hemisphere. Our results supported the existence of fronto-parietal recurrent feedback loops, with stronger interactions for precision grips due to the finer motor control required for this grasping type.

Its core competency lies in shedding light on data intensive fields by generating complex relations amongst data points. Depression is a mental condition which has bemused psychologists due to its eccentric display in each individual. In this paper we peruse various sensory signals and suggest ways by which they can be exploited to effectively capture concealed patterns. Moreover we also review and suggest a number of learning models that can accurately classify and recursively pinpoint the intensity of depression.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilized to reduce the dimensionality of the features and the transformed features or biomarkers were used to train the classifiers. Classifiers used in this study are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and k Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The results obtained from 5 study volunteers indicated that the highest contributions to the 56 new biomarkers are the higher order even central moments and more predominantly from channel T7. Also, the extracted features from EEG signals during visual imagery of different shapes with and without visual stimuli consistently showed a low degree of correlation. Furthermore, the dataset used to train the classifiers were subdivided into two: one containing neutral state with visual stimulus, and the other comprising neutral state without visual stimulus. Performance of different classifiers trained with and without visual stimulus yielded similar accuracies; however, the dataset with the absence of visual stimulus exhibit higher classification accuracies for all classifiers. In addition, all classifiers obtained high classification accuracies (>96%) for both datasets and the SVM performed best among the classifiers having accuracies of 97.5% and 99.5% for datasets with and without visual stimulus respectively. The study supports the feasibility of a brain-computer typing interface that utilizes visual imagery as an input modality. Furthermore, the findings of this study will serve as a basis for the development of a brain-computer typing interface using visual imagery of characters and letters.

Brain-computer interfaces based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide accessible and non-invasive means to capture the neuronal activity within the human brain. Towards analyzing the covert (imagined) speech, the brain activity during its production is captured through EEG signals. The ability to accurately interpret covert speech from EEG signals would be advantageous for communication by the patients suffering from speech disabilities or locked-in syndrome. On referring to the cognitive literature, we come across the Wernicke-Geschwind model that localizes the areas in human brain which are active during speech production and perception. In this paper, we present some classification results which are in support of the lateralization of the brain while analyzing the covert speech. For this study, a recently reported database which consists of EEG signals corresponding to pronounced and covert speech for six Spanish commands is used. A comparative study has been done between channels corresponding to the two hemispheres of the brain. The results indicate that there exists a laterality in brain functions and the dominant (left) hemisphere remains more active as compared to the right hemisphere during the covert speech similar to case of normal speech. This fact can be verified based on classification tasks performed on covert speech.

Defining the phenotypic spectrum of SLC6A1 mutations	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						epilepsy; epilepsy genetics; MAE; SLC6A1	MYOCLONIC-ASTATIC EPILEPSY; CHILDHOOD ABSENCE EPILEPSY; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY; GABA TRANSPORTERS; ILAE COMMISSION; POSITION PAPER; SEIZURES; CLASSIFICATION; TERMINOLOGY; ATTENTION	ObjectivePathogenic SLC6A1 variants were recently described in patients with myoclonic atonic epilepsy (MAE) and intellectual disability (ID). We set out to define the phenotypic spectrum in a larger cohort of SCL6A1-mutated patients. MethodsWe collected 24 SLC6A1 probands and 6 affected family members. Four previously published cases were included for further electroclinical description. In total, we reviewed the electroclinical data of 34 subjects. ResultsCognitive development was impaired in 33/34 (97%) subjects; 28/34 had mild to moderate ID, with language impairment being the most common feature. Epilepsy was diagnosed in 31/34 cases with mean onset at 3.7years. Cognitive assessment before epilepsy onset was available in 24/31 subjects and was normal in 25% (6/24), and consistent with mild ID in 46% (11/24) or moderate ID in 17% (4/24). Two patients had speech delay only, and 1 had severe ID. After epilepsy onset, cognition deteriorated in 46% (11/24) of cases. The most common seizure types were absence, myoclonic, and atonic seizures. Sixteen cases fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for MAE. Seven further patients had different forms of generalized epilepsy and 2 had focal epilepsy. Twenty of 31 patients became seizure-free, with valproic acid being the most effective drug. There was no clear-cut correlation between seizure control and cognitive outcome. Electroencephalography (EEG) findings were available in 27/31 patients showing irregular bursts of diffuse 2.5-3.5Hz spikes/polyspikes-and-slow waves in 25/31. Two patients developed an EEG pattern resembling electrical status epilepticus during sleep. Ataxia was observed in 7/34 cases. We describe 7 truncating and 18 missense variants, including 4 recurrent variants (Gly232Val, Ala288Val, Val342Met, and Gly362Arg). SignificanceMost patients carrying pathogenic SLC6A1 variants have an MAE phenotype with language delay and mild/moderate ID before epilepsy onset. However, ID alone or associated with focal epilepsy can also be observed.

J	Stefano, CA; Attux, R; Castellano, G				Stefano Filho, Carlos Alberto; Attux, Romis; Castellano, Gabriela			Can graph metrics be used for EEG-BCIs based on hand motor imagery?	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						BCI; EEG; Graphs; Graph theory; Brain-computer interface; Signal analysis; Motor imagery	CONNECTIVITY; NETWORK	The study of motor imagery (MI) has been a subject of great interest within the brain-computer interface (BCI) community. Several approaches have been proposed to solve the problem of classifying cerebral responses due to MI, mostly based on the power spectral density of the mu and beta bands; however, no optimum manner of proceeding through the fundamental steps of a MI-BCI has yet been established. In this work, we explored a relatively novel approach regarding feature generation for a MI-BCI by assuming that functional connectivity patterns of the brain are altered during hand MI. We modelled interactions among EEG electrodes by a graph, extracted metrics from it during left and right hand MI from eight subjects and classified the signals using commonly employed techniques in the BCI community (LDA and SVM). We also compared this approach to the more established method of using the signal power spectral density as the classifier features. With the graph method, we confirmed that only specific electrodes provide relevant information for data classification. A first approach provided maximum average classification rates across all subjects for the graph method of 86% for the mu band and 87% for the beta band. For the PSD method, average rates were of 98% and 99% for the mu and beta bands, respectively. However, a much larger number of features was needed: (130 44) and (273 89) for the mu and beta bands, respectively. Aiming to reproduce these rates using the graph method, pairwise inputs combinations of graph metrics were tested. They proved to be sufficient to obtain essentially the same classification accuracy rates, but with a considerably smaller number of features - about 60 features, for both bands. We thus conclude that the graph method is a feasible option for classification of hand MI signals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Lately, online co-adaptive feedback training approaches achieved promising results. Does this also mean that users can have meaningful BCI-based interactions after training? To answer this question an online study was conducted with 10 naive (first time) users. The users trained to gain BCI control by playing a Whack-A-Mole game for about 30 minutes. During this time BCI parameters were adapting to the users EEG patterns. The adaptation was then stopped and users continued playing the game with the trained BCI for another 20 minutes. Eight out of the ten users were able to control the BCI and play the game. These preliminary results seem to suggest that online co-adaptation is an effective way to gain BCI control.

Analysis of EEG Correlates of Perceived Difficulty in Dynamically Changing Flying Tasks	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 07-10, 2018	IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc, Miyazaki, JAPAN	IEEE, Sci Council Japan	IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc			Real-time workload estimation can be an important tool to improve human-machine interaction. Despite multiple efforts in this sense, most studies focused on tasks designed to have extreme conditions of workload (high vs low), and these levels remain rather constant throughout task execution. However, some applications may induce changing levels of workload and it is not clear how decoders trained in the extreme conditions will perform. In this study we study this scenario in a simulated drone task where participants had to fly through several waypoints. The task difficulty was modulated by the size of waypoints; in one of the studied conditions, the size was modulated in real time by the EEG-based decoding of the perceived difficulty. We show that this protocol can effectively induce different levels of workload and perceived difficulty. Furthermore, post-experiment analysis using a sparse-regularized technique supports the feasibility of decoding perceived difficulty in this dynamically changing task above chance level (average class-balanced accuracy across subjects 67% +/- 7%). Interestingly, an analysis of the selected features in independent recording sessions showed that roughly 20% of the features were stable across multiple sessions.

A powerful method for detecting systematic differences between experimental conditions in such multivariate data sets is multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), particularly pattern classification. However, in virtually all applications, data from the classes that correspond to the conditions of interest are not homogeneous but contain subclasses. Such subclasses can for example arise from individual subjects that contribute multiple data points, or from correlations of items within classes. We show here that in multivariate data that have subclasses nested within its class structure, these subclasses introduce systematic information that improves classifiability beyond what is expected by the size of the class difference. We analytically prove that this subclass bias systematically inflates correct classification rates (CCRs) of linear classifiers depending on the number of subclasses as well as on the portion of variance induced by the subclasses. In simulations, we demonstrate that subclass bias is highest when between-class effect size is low and subclass variance high. This bias can be reduced by increasing the total number of subclasses. However, we can account for the subclass bias by using permutation tests that explicitly consider the subclass structure of the data. We illustrate our result in several experiments that recorded human EEG activity, demonstrating that parametric statistical tests as well as typical trial-wise permutation fail to determine significance of classification outcomes correctly.

It is expected that the flexibility and safety of a BCI will be improved if movement-related information can be extracted from brain activity before executing the movement. In this study, we examined whether movement difficulty levels can be decoded from electroencephalogram (EEG) data. We conducted an experiment where in five participants performed arm reaching movements with three different levels of difficulty, brain activity was measured before these movements. To classify the levels of difficulty, we extracted event-related spectrum perturbation (ERSP) data and performed classification using a relevance vector machine (RVM). Single-trial classification using ERSP data could not obtain high classification accuracy. However, classification accuracies using averaged-trial ERSP data were 66.0% on average (53.9%, 82.3%, 79.6%, 53.1% and 61.1% for each participant). These results show that information related to movement difficulty might be decoded from brain activity before movement, although it is necessary to improve the performance at the single-trial level in future work.

Unfortunately, such markers may not be available or may come with poor timing resolution for experiments conducted in less-controlled naturalistic environments. New method: We present an integrated event-identification method for identifying particular responses that occur in unlabeled continuously recorded EEG signals based on information from recordings of other subjects potentially performing related tasks. We introduce the idea of timing slack and timing tolerant performance measures to deal with jitter inherent in such non-time-locked systems. We have developed an implementation available as an open-source MATLAB toolbox (http://github.com/VisLab/EEG-Annotate) and have made test data available in a separate data note. Results: We applied the method to identify visual presentation events (both target and non-target) in data from an unlabeled subject using labeled data from other subjects with good sensitivity and specificity. The method also identified actual visual presentation events in the data that were not previously marked in the experiment. Comparison with existing methods: Although the method uses traditional classifiers for initial stages, the problem of identifying events based on the presence of stereotypical EEG responses is the converse of the traditional stimulus-response paradigm and has not been addressed in its current form. Conclusions: In addition to identifying potential events in unlabeled or incompletely labeled EEG, these methods also allow researchers to investigate whether particular stereotypical neural responses are present in other circumstances. Timing-tolerance has the added benefit of accommodating inter- and intra-subject timing variations. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

It gained its significance from the intention of helping paralyzed people communicate with the external environment. One of the major challenges facing BCI systems is obtaining reliable classification accuracy of motor imagery (MI) mental tasks. In this paper, a novel CSP\AM-BA-SVM approach is proposed using bio-inspired algorithms for feature selection and classifier optimization to improve classification accuracy of the MI-BCI systems. The proposed approach applies optimum selection of time interval for each subject. The features are extracted from EEG signal using the common spatial pattern (CSP). Binary CSP is extended to multi-class problems by utilizing one-vs-one strategy. This paper introduces applying a hybrid attractor metagene (AM) algorithm along with the Bat optimization algorithm (BA) to select the most discriminant CSP features and optimize SVM parameters. The efficacy of the proposed approach was examined using three data sets. The proposed approach has achieved 78.55% accuracy and 0.71 mean kappa for BCI Competition IV data set 2a, 86.6% accuracy and 0.82 mean kappa for BCI Competition III data set Ma, and 85% for the binary class BCI Competition III data set IVa. For multi-class data sets, the proposed approach outperforms winners of BCIC IV, 2a and BCIC III, IIIa with kappa 0.14 and 0.17, respectively. For binary class BCIC III, IVa, it performed slightly better than existing studies in the literature by approximate to 0.5%. The proposed CSP\AM-BA-SVM transcends the traditional CSP\SVM approach and other existing studies.

Frequency Specific Cortical Dynamics During Motor Imagery Are Influenced by Prior Physical Activity	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						motor imagery (MI); EEG; ERD/ERS; motor execution (ME); training effects	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE; MENTAL PRACTICE; STROKE REHABILITATION; VISUOSPATIAL TASK; PERFORMANCE; EXECUTION; EEG; ACTIVATION; TRIAL; NETWORKS	Motor imagery is often used inducing changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals for imagery-based brain-computer interfacing (BCI). A BCI is a device translating brain signals into control signals providing severely motor-impaired persons with an additional, non-muscular channel for communication and control. In the last years, there is increasing interest using BCIs also for healthy people in terms of enhancement or gaming. Most studies focusing on improving signal processing feature extraction and classification methods, but the performance of a BCI can also be improved by optimizing the user's control strategies, e.g., using more vivid and engaging mental tasks for control. We used multichannel EEG to investigate neural correlates of a sports imagery task (playing tennis) compared to a simple motor imagery task (squeezing a ball). To enhance the vividness of both tasks participants performed a short physical exercise between two imagery sessions. EEG was recorded from 60 closely spaced electrodes placed over frontal, central, and parietal areas of 30 healthy volunteers divided in two groups. Whereas Group 1 (EG) performed a physical exercise between the two imagery sessions, Group 2 (CG) watched a landscape movie without physical activity. Spatiotemporal event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) patterns during motor imagery (MI) tasks were evaluated. The results of the EG showed significant stronger ERD patterns in the alpha frequency band (8-13 Hz) during MI of tennis after training. Our results are in evidence with previous findings that MI in combination with motor execution has beneficial effects. We conclude that sports MI combined with an interactive game environment could be a future promising task in motor learning and rehabilitation improving motor functions in late therapy processes or support neuroplasticity.

In this paper, we propose to investigate the performance of the binary classification of Propofol-induced sedation states using partial granger causality analysis. Based on the brain connectivity measurements obtained from EEG signals in a database that contains four sedation states: baseline, mild, moderate, and recovery, we consider eight sensors and evaluate the area under the ROC curve with five classifiers: the k-nearest neighbor (density method), support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, Bayesian discriminant analysis, and a model based on extreme learning machine. The results support the conclusion that the different Propofol-induced sedation states can be identified with an AUC of around 0.75, by considering signal segments of only 4 second. These results highlight the discriminant power that can be obtained from scalp level connectivity measures for online brain monitoring.

However, continuously assessing the mental workload during a browsing task is challenging. To address this issue, this paper leverages the correlation between stimuli and physiological responses, which are measured with high-frequency, non-invasive psychophysiological sensors during very short span windows. An experiment was conducted to identify levels of mental workload through the analysis of pupil dilation measured by an eye-tracking sensor. In addition, a method was developed to classify mental workload by appropriately combining different signals (electrodermal activity (EDA), electrocardiogram, photoplethysmo-graphy (PPG), electroencephalogram (EEG), temperature and pupil dilation) obtained with non-invasive psychophysiological sensors. The results show that the Web browsing task involves four levels of mental workload. Also, by combining all the sensors, the efficiency of the classification reaches 93.7%.

Neuromarketing explained how marketing activity will stimulate and educate consumer preferences from marketers creativity. Dual process theory become the main foundation for marketers to create ethical marketing stimuli in order to process the stimulus effect. Traditional neuromarketing research explained these preferences process on theoritical constructs whereas neuroscience clarified which psychology and somatic response. These paper contributed for new development in marketing management research by experiment to gain external validity development. These external validity will be answered by machine learning methodology which suitable to process medical devices data such as electrochephalography (EEG). The research in consumer emotion is very limited because of the most researchers could not capable to explain the dynamics of cognitive and affective functions. These paper try to explain neuromarketing concepts via medical devices to predict and process consumer emotion from specific stimuli to get the insight of consumer preferences.

Many biomedical applications require embedded inference on resource-constrained platforms thus causing a challenge when considering the deployment of DNNs. One method to address this challenge is via reduced precision implementations. We use an analytical method to determine suitable minimum precision requirements of DNNs and show its application to the CHB-MIT EEG seizure detection dataset and the Bonn dataset for brain electrical activity recognition. We show that our method leads to 2x reduction in average precision and 45% complexity reduction compared to the minimum uniform precision assignment. Compared to a conventional 16-b precision assignment, our method leads to 9x complexity reduction. Furthermore, we study the impact of network topology on precision and accuracy. Once again we find our method to be similar to 2x more efficient that the uniform assignment for all topologies considered.

The CSP algorithm is a mathematical procedure used for separating a multivariate signal into additive components which have maximum differences in variance between two windows; in other terms, CSP increases the signal variance for one condition while minimizing the variance for the other condition. Features computed by means of CSP are fed to a data classifier in order to discriminate between two mental tasks. A novel technique to achieve feature extraction is tangent-space mapping (TSM) that insists on spatial covariance matrices computed from the recorded electroencephalogram signals (EEG). TSM is based on Riemannian geometry, which allows one to estimate statistical features of data distributions over non-Euclidean spaces. The aim of this chapter is twofold: first, to provide a new data-visualization tool to visually inspect data distributions on the Riemannian space of spatial covariance matrices and its tangent bundle; second, to present an experimental comparison of CSP and TSM feature extraction, in conjunction with two classification methods, namely, support-vector machine and linear discriminant analysis. In particular, the experimental comparison performed on a number of data sets will show the superiority of TSM-based feature extraction over CSP.

Rajendra			An accurate sleep stages classification system using a new class of optimally time-frequency localized three-band wavelet filter bank	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Electroencephalogram signal; Sleep stages; Three-band wavelet filter bank; Time-frequency localization; Classification	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; EPILEPTIC SEIZURE DETECTION; EEG SIGNALS; AUTOMATED DETECTION; LEAST-SQUARES; UNCERTAINTY; TRANSFORM; DESIGN; FEATURES; BASES	Sleep related disorder causes diminished quality of lives in human beings. Sleep scoring or sleep staging is the process of classifying various sleep stages which helps to detect the quality of sleep. The identification of sleep stages using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is an arduous task. Just by looking at an EEG signal, one cannot determine the sleep stages precisely. Sleep specialists may make errors in identifying sleep stages by visual inspection. To mitigate the erroneous identification and to reduce the burden on doctors, a computer-aided EEG based system can be deployed in the hospitals, which can help identify the sleep stages, correctly. Several automated systems based on the analysis of polysomnographic (PSG) signals have been proposed. A few sleep stage scoring systems using EEG signals have also been proposed. But, still there is a need for a robust and accurate portable system developed using huge dataset. In this study, we have developed a new single-channel EEG based sleep-stages identification system using a novel set of wavelet-based features extracted from a large EEG dataset. We employed a novel three-band time-frequency localized (TBTFL) wavelet filter bank (FB). The EEG signals are decomposed using three-level wavelet decomposition, yielding seven sub-bands (SBs). This is followed by the computation of discriminating features namely, log-energy (LE), signal-fractal-dimensions (SFD), and signal-sample-entropy (SSE) from all seven SBs. The extracted features are ranked and fed to the support vector machine (SVM) and other supervised learning classifiers. In this study, we have considered five different classification problems (CPs), (two-class (CP-1), three-class (CP-2), four-class (CP-3), five-class (CP-4) and six-class (CP-5)). The proposed system yielded accuracies of 98.3%, 93.9%, 92.1%, 91.7%, and 91.5% for CP-1 to CP-5, respectively, using 10-fold cross validation (CV) technique.

Electrocorticographies for 39 patients with medically intractable neocortical epilepsy were analyzed. We separately analyzed 38 frequencies from 0.9 to 800 Hz including both high-frequency activities and low-frequency activities to select hands related to seizure outcome. An automatic detector using amplitude-duration-number thresholds was used. Interictal electrocorticography data sets of 8 min for each patient were selected. In the first training data set of 20 patients, the automatic detector was optimized to best differentiate the seizure-free group from not-seizure-free-group based on ranks of resection percentages of activities detected using a genetic algorithm. The optimization was validated in a different data set of 19 patients. There were 16 (41%) seizure-free patients. The mean follow-up duration was 21 +/- 11 mo (range. 13-44 mo). After validation, frequencies significantly related to seizure outcome were 5.8, 8.4-25, 30, 36. 52. and 75 among low-frequency activities and 108 and 800 Hz among high-frequency activities. Resection for 5.8, 8.4-25, 108. and 800 Hz activities consistently improved seizure outcome. Resection effects of 17-36. 52, and 75 Hz activities on seizure outcome were variable according to thresholds. We developed and validated an automated detector for monitoring interictal pathological and inhibitory/physiological activities in neocortical epilepsy using a datadriven approach through outcome-guided machine learning. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Outcome-guided machine learning based on seizure outcome was used to improve detections for interictal electrocorticographic low- and high-frequency activities. This method resulted in better separation of seizure outcome groups than others reported in the literature. The automatic detector can be trained without human intervention and no prior information. It is based only on objective seizure outcome data without relying on an expert's manual annotations. Using the method, we could find and characterize pathological and inhibitory activities.

Methods: It was hypothesized that the similarity of the oscillatory pattern between stimulation sensation (SS, real sensation) and somatosensory attentional orientation (SAO) provides a way to decode covert somatic attention. Subjects were instructed to sense the tactile stimulation, which was applied to the left (SS-L) or the right (SS-R) wrist. The brain-computer interface (BCI) system was calibrated with the sensation data and then applied for online SAO decoding. Results: Both SS and SAO showed oscillatory activation concentrated on the contralateral somatosensory hemisphere. Offline analysis showed that the proposed calibration method led to a greater accuracy than the traditional calibration method based on SAO only. This is confirmed by online experiments, where the online accuracy on 15 subjects was 78.8 +/- 13.1%, with 12 subjects >70% and 4 subject >90%. Conclusion: By integrating the stimulus-induced oscillatory dynamics from sensory cortex, covert somatosensory attention can be reliably decoded by a BCI system calibrated with tactile sensation.

This brain-computer interfacing approach may find application for stroke and completely locked-in patients with preserved somatic sensation.

This study addresses the challenge of decoding cortical state changes from continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded during hypnosis. We model changes in brain state dynamics over the course of hypnosis using Adaptive Mixture Independent Component Analysis (AMICA), an unsupervised approach that learns multiple ICA models for characterizing non-stationary, unlabeled data. Applied to EEG from six sessions of hypnosis, AMICA characterized changes in system-wide brain activity that corresponded to transitions between hypnosis stages. Moreover, the results showed consistent AMICA-based models across sessions and subjects that reflected distinct patterns of source activities in different hypnosis states. By analyzing independent component clusters associated with distinctive classes of model probability patterns, shifts in the theta, alpha, and other spectral features of source activities were characterized over the course of the therapy sessions. The AMICA approach offers a promising tool for linking brain-network changes during hypnotherapy with physiological and cognitive state changes brought about by this form of treatment. It can also ignite new research and developments toward brain-state monitoring for clinical applications.

They offer the potential to improve the quality of life ofmotor-impaired patients. Motor BCIs aim to permit severely motor-impaired users to regain limb mobility by controlling orthoses or prostheses. In particular, motor BCI systems benefit patients if the decoded actions reflect the users' intentions with an accuracy that enables them to efficiently interact with their environment. One of the main challenges of BCI systems is to adapt the BCI's signal translation blocks to the user to reach a high decoding accuracy. This paper will review the literature of data-driven and user-specific transducer design and identification approaches and it focuses on internally-paced motor BCIs. In particular, continuous kinematic biomimetic and mental-task decoders are reviewed. Furthermore, static and dynamic decoding approaches, linear and non-linear decoding, offline and real-time identification algorithms are considered. The current progress and challenges related to the design of clinical-compatible motor BCI transducers are additionally discussed.

Quantifying the accuracy of such tools, however, is nontrivial as a ground truth to verify predictions about hypothetical resections is missing. New method: As one possibility to address this, we use customized hypotheses tests to examine the agreement of the methods on a common set of patients. One method uses machine learning techniques to enable the predictive modeling of EEG time series. The other estimates nonlinear interrelation between EEG channels. Both methods were independently shown to distinguish patients with excellent post-surgical outcome (Engel class I) from those without improvement (Engel class IV) when assessing the electrodes associated with the tissue that was actually resected during brain surgery. Using the AND and OR conjunction of both methods we evaluate the performance gain that can be expected when combining them. Results: Both methods' assessments correlate strongly positively with the similarity between a hypothetical resection and the corresponding actual resection in class I patients. Moreover, the Spearman rank correlation between the methods' patient rankings is significantly positive. Comparison with existing method(s): To our best knowledge, this is the first study comparing surgery target assessments from fundamentally differing techniques. Conclusions: Although conceptually completely independent, there is a relation between the predictions obtained from both methods. Their broad consensus supports their application in clinical practice to provide physicians additional information in the process of presurgical evaluation.

Nowadays the question about the effects of violence on women and the identification of latent risks that affect their health, is increasingly relevant. This article describes a pilot study that aimed to measure electrophysiological signals corresponding to the emotional neurophysiological response of women who had experienced IPV in contrast to those who did not. Six healthy female adults. ranged in age from 18 to 55 years old enrolled in this study. For the measurement we used the International Affective Picture System (TAPS) and an Auditory - and Visual Emotional Memory Test (avEMT), and we recorded the EEG signal with a g.Nautilus 32 g.LadyBird. EEG signals acquired from baseline and during the tests were compared. As a result of TAPS test, we found for all the participants a higher power spectrum at low EEG frequencies and a decrease in power as the frequencies increase for baseline and emotional pictures. For the avMET, both groups show a higher power spectrum in the different phases of the task compared with the baseline, with an exception of one participant from the WIPV group who show the opposite tendency. Also, two machine learning models were trained and an accuracy of more than 85% were achieved to classify EEG signals from women who experienced IPV and women who had not. This research is an approach to the phenomenon of violence against women and broadens the understanding of the effects on emotional response and electrophysiological activation in women who have experienced this type of situation	[Lopez Lopez, Juan M.; Acero Trivino, Maria Paula; Espitia, Catalina] Escuela Colombiana Ingn Julio Garavito, Biomed Engn Program, Bogota, Colombia; [Carolina Cardenas-Poveda, D.; Gonzalez-Alvarez, Alexandra; Rizo-Arevalo, Alejandra; Andrea Prado-Rivera, Mayerli; Mejia-Soto, Eliana; Luis Velasquez-Perez, Jose] Corp Univ Minuto Dios, Psychol Program, Bogota, Colombia		Lopez, JML (corresponding author), Escuela Colombiana Ingn Julio Garavito, Biomed Engn Program, Bogota, Colombia.	juan.lopezl@escuelaing.edu.co		Rizo Arevalo, Alejandra/0000-0003-0060-9011; Cardenas Poveda, Diana Carolina/0000-0002-5065-8623; Prado Rivera, Mayerli Andrea/0000-0002-7957-0385; Lopez Lopez, Juan Manuel/0000-0002-3595-3317					20	2	2	0	2	SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING	BELLINGHAM	1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-2606-5	PROC SPIE			2018	10975								UNSP 1097507	10.1117/12.2511600	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2511600			10	Medical Informatics; Optics	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Medical Informatics; Optics	BM3AY					2022-08-02	WOS:000461816200006

Hence, an early detection of the focal epileptic seizures can be carried out using the EEG signals, which act as a helpful tool for early diagnosis of epilepsy. Several EEG-based approaches have been proposed and developed to understand the underlying characteristics of the epileptic seizures. Despite the fact that the early results were positive, the proposed techniques cannot generate reproducible results and lack a statistical validation, which has led to doubts regarding the presence of the pre-ictal state. Various methodical and algorithmic studies have indicated that the transition to an ictal state is not a random process, and the build-up can lead to epileptic seizures. This study reviews many recently-proposed algorithms for detecting the focal epileptic seizures. Generally, the techniques developed for detecting the epileptic seizures were based on tensors, entropy, empirical mode decomposition, wavelet transform and dynamic analysis. The existing algorithms were compared and the need for implementing a practical and reliable new algorithm is highlighted. The research regarding the epileptic seizure detection research is more focused on the development of precise and non-invasive techniques for rapid and reliable diagnosis. Finally, the researchers noted that all the methods that were developed for epileptic seizure detection lacks standardization, which hinders the homogeneous comparison of the detector performance.

Due to their inherent trade-offs, these design challenges have not yet been simultaneously addressed. We propose a novel way out of this predicament by employing signal compression, machine learning inference, and cryptographic techniques on the IoT sensor node. Our approach not only enables the IoT system to push signal processing and decision-making to the extreme of the edge-side (i.e., the sensor node), but also solves data security and energy efficiency problems simultaneously. Experimental results on six different IoT applications indicate that relative to traditional sense-and-transmit sensors, IoT sensor energy can be reduced by 77.8x for electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor based arrhythmia detection, 808.6x for freezing of gait detection in the context of Parkinson's disease, 162.8x for neural prosthesis spike sorting, 37.6x for human activity classification, 368.4x for electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor based seizure detection, and 12.9x for chemical gas classification.

Reliable decoding of motor intentions and accurate timing of the robotic device actuation is fundamental to optimally enhance the patient's functional improvement. Several studies show that it may be possible to extract motor intentions from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. These findings, although notable, suggests that current techniques are still far from being systematically applied to an accurate real-time control of rehabilitation or assistive devices. Here we propose the estimation of spinal primitives of multi-muscle control from EEG, using electromyography (EMG) dimensionality reduction as a solution to increase the robustness of the method. We successfully apply this methodology, both to healthy and incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) patients, to identify muscle contraction during periodical knee extension from the EEG. We then introduce a novel performance metric, which accurately evaluates muscle primitive activations.

Clinical studies have shown that, rehabilitation therapy with the active participation of the central nervous system can rebuild related nerve function, restore the patient's neural plasticity and characterize the intention to move by means of electroencephalographic activity which can be used in rehabilitation protocols with patients' cortical activity taking an active role during the intervention. We describe our method framework including protocol, data processing and pattern recognition. Then the experimental results are analyzed. The tests were carried out with healthy people and achieved satisfactory performance both in trial and asynchronous detection. Our purpose is to apply to restoration of neural pathway of patients.

In order to enhance its applicability in identity authentication, a novel EEG-based identity authentication method is proposed based on self-or non-self-face rapid serial visual presentation. Results: In contrast to previous studies that extracted EEG features from rest state or motor imagery, the designed paradigm could obtain a distinct and stable biometric trait with a lower time cost. Channel selection was applied to select specific channels for each user to enhance system portability and improve discriminability between users and imposters. Two different imposter scenarios were designed to test system security, which demonstrate the capability of anti-deception. Fifteen users and thirty imposters participated in the experiment. The mean authentication accuracy values for the two scenarios were 91.31 and 91.61%, with 6 s time cost, which illustrated the precision and real-time capability of the system. Furthermore, in order to estimate the repeatability and stability of our paradigm, another data acquisition session is conducted for each user. Using the classification models generated from the previous sessions, a mean false rejected rate of 7.27% has been achieved, which demonstrates the robustness of our paradigm. Conclusions: Experimental results reveal that the proposed paradigm and methods are effective for EEG-based identity authentication.

In contrast, natural vision involves unique renderings of visual inputs that are continuously changing without explicitly defined temporal transitions. Here we considered commercial movies as a coarse proxy to natural vision. We recorded intracranial field potential signals from 1,284 electrodes implanted in 15 patients with epilepsy while the subjects passively viewed commercial movies. We could rapidly detect large changes in the visual inputs within approximately 100 ms of their occurrence, using exclusively field potential signals from ventral visual cortical areas including the inferior temporal gyrus and inferior occipital gyrus. Furthermore, we could decode the content of those visual changes even in a single movie presentation, generalizing across the wide range of transformations present in a movie. These results present a methodological framework for studying cognition during dynamic and natural vision.

Many BCI paradigms and decoding approaches do not directly consider the underlying physiology of the sensory pathway and brain responses. By accurately modeling the sensory pathway, it is possible to design new spatial and temporal stimulus patterns to enhance brain response characteristics. This study presents a combined model of the human retina with an artificial neural network (ANN) in order to estimate electroencephalographic (EEG) brain activity trained on actual EEG data. Based on this new visual pathway model, techniques can be developed to create and validate improved stimulus sequences for BCIs and other neurotechnologies.	[Sobreira, F.; Tremmel, C.; Krusienski, D.

Permutation Jaccard Distance-Based Hierarchical Clustering to Estimate EEG Network Density Modifications in MCI Subjects	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Alzheimer's Disease (AD); brain connectivity; electroencephalographic (EEG); hierarchical clustering (HC); mild cognitive impairment (MCI); network density; permutation entropy (PE); permutation Jaccard distance (PJD)	MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; MINIMALLY CONSCIOUS STATE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; WAVELET COHERENCE; NEURAL-NETWORK; DIAGNOSIS; SYNCHRONIZATION; SURVIVAL; POPULATION; SYSTEM	In this paper, a novel electroencephalographic (EEG)-based method is introduced for the quantification of brain-electrical connectivity changes over a longitudinal evaluation of mild cognitive impaired (MCI) subjects. In the proposed method, a dissimilarity matrix is constructed by estimating the coupling strength between every pair of EEG signals, Hierarchical clustering is then applied to group the related electrodes according to the dissimilarity estimated on pairs of EEG recordings. Subsequently, the connectivity density of the electrodes network is calculated. The technique was tested over two different coupling strength descriptors: wavelet coherence (WC) and permutation Jaccard distance (PJD), a novel metric of coupling strength between time series introduced in this paper. Twenty-five MCI patients were enrolled within a follow-up program that consisted of two successive evaluations, at time T0 and at time T1, three months later. At T1, four subjects were diagnosed to have converted to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). When applying the PJD-based method, the converted patients exhibited a significantly increased PJD (p < 0.05), i.e., a reduced overall coupling strength, specifically in delta and theta bands and in the overall range (0.5-32 Hz). In addition, in contrast to stable MCI patients, converted patients exhibited a network density reduction in every subband (delta, theta, alpha, and beta). When WC was used as coupling strength descriptor, the method resulted in a less sensitive and specific outcome. The proposed method, mixing nonlinear analysis to a machine learning approach, appears to provide an objective evaluation of the connectivity density modifications associated to the MCI-AD conversion, just processing noninvasive EEG signals.

Stereotyped high-frequency oscillations discriminate seizure onset zones and critical functional cortex in focal epilepsy	BRAIN			English	Article						epilepsy; high-frequency oscillations; seizure onset zone; intracranial EEG	80-500 HZ; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; TEMPORAL-LOBE; FAST RIPPLES; SLOW WAVES; RECORDINGS; BRAIN; EEG; AREAS	High-frequency oscillations are putative biomarkers of seizure onset zones, but can also be recorded from non-epileptic structures. Using machine-learning, Liu et al. show that HFOs generated by epileptic tissues produce stereotyped waveform patterns rarely observed in non-epileptogenic cortex, and discriminate between seizure onset zones, "eloquent" cortex and other cerebral regions.High-frequency oscillations in local field potentials recorded with intracranial EEG are putative biomarkers of seizure onset zones in epileptic brain. However, localized 80-500 Hz oscillations can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, physiological high-frequency oscillations are indistinguishable from pathological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy presurgical planning. We hypothesized that pathological high-frequency oscillations occur in a repetitive fashion with a similar waveform morphology that specifically indicates seizure onset zones. We investigated the waveform patterns of automatically detected high-frequency oscillations in 13 epilepsy patients and five control subjects, with an average of 73 subdural and intracerebral electrodes recorded per patient. The repetitive oscillatory waveforms were identified by using a pipeline of unsupervised machine learning techniques and were then correlated with independently clinician-defined seizure onset zones. Consistently in all patients, the stereotypical high-frequency oscillations with the highest degree of waveform similarity were localized within the seizure onset zones only, whereas the channels generating high-frequency oscillations embedded in random waveforms were found in the functional regions independent from the epileptogenic locations. The repetitive waveform pattern was more evident in fast ripples compared to ripples, suggesting a potential association between waveform repetition and the underlying pathological network. Our findings provided a new tool for the interpretation of pathological high-frequency oscillations that can be efficiently applied to distinguish seizure onset zones from functionally important sites, which is a critical step towards the translation of these signature events into valid clinical biomarkers.

J	Zhang, JM; Wu, Y				Zhang, Junming; Wu, Yan			Complex-valued unsupervised convolutional neural networks for sleep stage classification	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Complex-valued convolutional neural networks; Unsupervised training; Complex-valued k-means; Sleep stage; EEG	SINGLE-CHANNEL EEG; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; FEATURES; SYSTEM; DOMAIN	Background and objective: Despite numerous deep learning methods being developed for automatic sleep stage classification, almost all the models need labeled data. However, obtaining labeled data is a subjective process. Therefore, the labels will be different between two experts. At the same time, obtaining labeled data also is a time-consuming task. Even an experienced expert requires hours to annotate the sleep stage patterns. More important, as the development of wearable sleep devices, it is very difficult to obtain labeled sleep data. Therefore, unsupervised training algorithm is very important for sleep stage classification. Hence, a new sleep stage classification method named complex-valued unsupervised convolutional neural networks (CUCNN) is proposed in this study. Methods: The CUCNN operates with complex-valued inputs, outputs, and weights, and its training strategy is greedy layer-wise training. It is composed of three phases: phase encoder, unsupervised training and complex-valued classification. Phase encoder is used to translate real-valued inputs into complex numbers. In the unsupervised training phase, the complex-valued K-means is used to learn filters which will be used in the convolution. Results: The classification performances of handcrafted features are compared with those of learned features via CUCNN. The total accuracy (TAC) and kappa coefficient of the sleep stage from UCD dataset are 87% and 0.8, respectively. Moreover, the comparison experiments indicate that the TACs of the CUCNN from UCD and MIT-BIH datasets outperform these of unsupervised convolutional neural networks (UCNN) by 12.9% and 13%, respectively. Additionally, the convergence of CUCNN is much faster than that of UCNN in most cases. Conclusions: The proposed method is fully automated and can learn features in an unsupervised fashion. Results show that unsupervised training and automatic feature extraction on sleep data are possible, which are very important for home sleep monitoring. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Eilbeigi, E; Setarehdan, SK				Eilbeigi, Elnaz; Setarehdan, Seyed Kamaledin			Detecting intention to execute the next movement while performing current movement from EEG using global optimal constrained ICA	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Movement related cortical potential (MRCP); Constrained independent component analysis (dCA); Global optimal constrained ICA (GocIcA); Meta-heuristic optimization; Brain-computer interface (BCI); High-level commands; Natural neuroprostheses		Background Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are a promising tool in neurorehabilitation. The intention to perform a motor action can be detected from brain signals and used to control robotic devices. Most previous studies have focused on the starting of movements from a resting state, while in daily life activities, motions occur continuously and the neural activities correlated to the evolving movements are yet to be investigated. Method First we investigate the existence of neural correlates of intention to replace an object on the table during a holding phase. Next, we present a new method to extract the movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP) from a single-trial EEG. A novel method called Global optimal constrained ICA (GocICA) is proposed to overcome the limitations of cICA which is implemented based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Charged System Search (CSS) techniques. GocICA is then utilized for decoding the intention to grasp and lift and intention to replace movements where the results were compared. Results: It was found that GocICA significantly improves the intention detection performance. Best results in offline detection were obtained with CSS-cICA for both kinds of intentions. Furthermore, pseudo-online decoding showed that GodCA was able to predict both intentions before the onset of related movements with the highest probability. Conclusions: Decoding of the next movement intention during current movement is possible, which can be used to create more natural neuroprostheses. The results demonstrate that GocICA is a promising new algorithm for single-trial MRCP detection which can be used for detecting other types of ERPs such as P300.

These have been used for mostly commercial and advertising purposes. Such practice has been an established one for decades. Most advertising researchers have always relied on traditional means and techniques in measuring viewer experiences and under-standing conversion rates from these TV Commercials. In this work-in-progress, we present our preliminary findings from an exploratory study on understanding consumer behaviors and emotions especially when watching TV Commercials. Tar-get consumers for a specific commercial product underwent one-on-one semi-structured interviews and from viewing sessions where their EEG data were collected using the 5-channel EMOTIV Insight headset. To triangulate the emotion modeling phase, external observers referred to as coders annotated their emotions with the aid of emotion recognition via facial recognition. Initial Analysis of the interviews along with the early version of the model revealed several interesting points on visual and audio elements that triggered viewer valence. The collection of EEG data was also able to uncover a few insights that aided in the design of a better viewing experience for the target consumers. We intend to expand the findings in the future work to build a model from a bigger data and user base along with a wider array of emotions to choose from. Also, we intend to employ more advanced experiment designs to determine if we can directly correlate viewer experiences into actual product and commercial conversion.

In this paper, an effective medical recommendation system that uses a structural graph approach with advanced machine learning ensemble model is proposed for short-term disease risk prediction to provide chronic heart disease patients with appropriate recommendations about the need to take a medical test or not on the coming day based on analysing their medical data. A time series telehealth data recorded from patients is used for experimentations, evaluation and validation. The Tunstall dataset were collected from May to October 2012, from industry collaborator Tunstall. A time series data is segmented into slide windows and then mapped into undirect graph. The size of slide window was empirically determined. The structural properties of graph enter as the features set to the machine learning ensemble classifier to predict the patient's condition one day in advance. A combination of three classifiers-Least Squares-Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, and Naive Bayes-are used to construct an ensemble framework to classify the graph features. To investigate the predictive ability of the graph with the ensemble classifier, the extracted statistical features were also forwarded to the individual classifiers for comparison. The findings of this study shows that the recommendation system yields a satisfactory recommendation accuracy, offers a effective way for reducing the risk of incorrect recommendations as well as reducing the workload for heart disease patients in conducting body tests every day. A 94% average prediction accuracy is achieved by using the proposed recommendation system. The results conclusively ascertain that the proposed system is a promising tool for analyzing time series medical data and providing accurate and reliable recommendations to patients suffering from chronic heart diseases.

Accurate evaluation, presurgical assessment, seizure prevention, and emergency alerts all depend on the rapid detection of seizure onset. A new method of feature selection and classification for rapid and precise seizure detection is discussed wherein informative components of electroencephalogram (EEG)-derived data are extracted and an automatic method is presented using infinite independent component analysis (I-ICA) to select independent features. The feature space is divided into subspaces via random selection and multichannel support vector machines (SVMs) are used to classify these subspaces. The result of each classifier is then combined by majority voting to establish the final output. In addition, a random subspace ensemble using a combination of SVM, multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network and an extended k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), called extended nearest neighbor (ENN), is developed for the EEG and electrocorticography (ECoG) big data problem. To evaluate the solution, a benchmark ECoG of eight patients with temporal and extratemporal epilepsy was implemented in a distributed computing framework as a multitier cloud-computing architecture. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and both false positive and false negative ratios of the proposed method were found to be 0.97, 0.98, 0.96, 0.04, and 0.02, respectively. Application of the solution to cases under investigation with ECoG has also been effected to demonstrate its utility. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In most studies, in order to classify the EEG signals recorded in a cue-guided BCI paradigm, time segments for feature extraction after the onset of the visual cue were selected manually. In addition, in these studies the authors have selected a single identical time segment for different subjects. The present study emphasized on the inter-individual variability and difference between different motor imagery tasks as the potential source of erroneous results and used mutual information and the subject specific time interval to overcome this problem. More specifically, a new method was proposed to automatically find the best subject specific time intervals for the classification of four-class motor imagery tasks by using MI between the BCI input and output. Moreover, the signal-to-noise ratio was used to calculate the MI values, while the MI values were used as feature selection criteria to select the discriminative features. The time segments and the best discriminative features were found by using training data and used to assess the evaluation data. Furthermore, the CSP algorithm was used to extract signal features. The dataset 2A of BCI competition IV used in this study consisted of four different motor imagery signals, which were obtained from nine different subjects. One Vs One decomposition scheme was used to deal with the multi-class nature of the problem. The MI values showed that the obtained time segments not only varied between different subjects but also varied between different classifiers of different pair of classes. Finally, the results suggested that the proposed method was efficient in classifying multi-class motor imagery signals as compared to other classification strategies proposed by the other studies.

However, most of the existing methods are failed to trade off the effectivity and computation cost, which is not appropriate for on-line application. In this research, we propose a novel method for dealing with 3-class electroencephalogram (EEG) problem, based upon kernel density estimation (KDE) and least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM). The filtered EEG is decomposed into several sub-bands by wavelet packet transform (WPT), then KDE is explored to calculate the corresponding probability density. Five parameters are employed for EEG representation: the maximum (Max), the skewness (Sloe), the kurtosis (Kur), the energy (En), and the central moment (CM). And significant features selected by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) are fed to LS-SVM for pattern recognition. Furthermore, eight types of wavelet bases and four well-known functions are considered for feature extraction. Experimental results show that our approach has achieved satisfactory and comparable results for all validation methods when configured with coiflet of order 1 and uniform kernel. The highest accuracy of 10-fold cross-validation and standard 50-50 methodology is 99.40% and 99.60% with 27 and 26 features, respectively. As compared to previous literature, our proposed scheme is more suitable for diagnosis of epilepSy with higher accuracy and less number of feature that can be extracted with less computational cost. Overall, the advantages of high accuracy, easy implementation and low computational consumption have made this technique a suitable candidate for extensive clinical deployment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to identify neural dynamics related to the ability to adapt to different cognitive control demands - a process that has been referred to as 'metacontrol.' A sample of N = 227 healthy subjects that was split in a 'high' and 'low adaptability' group based on the behavioral performance in a task with varying control demands. To examine the neurophysiological mechanisms, we combined event-related potential (ERP) recordings with source localization and machine learning approaches. The results show that individuals who are better at strategically adapting to different cognitive control demands benefit from automatizing their response processes in situations where little cognitive control is needed. On a neurophysiological level, neither perceptual/attentional selection processes nor conflict monitoring processes paralleled the behavioral data, although the latter showed a descriptive trend. Behavioral differences in metacontrol abilities were only significantly mirrored by the modulation of response-locked P3 amplitudes, which were accompanied by activation differences in insula (BA13) and middle frontal gyrus (BA9). The machine learning result corroborated this by identifying a predictive/classification feature near the peak of the response-locked P3, which arose from the anterior cingulate cortex (BA24; BA33). In short, we found that metacontrol is associated to the ability to manage response selection processes, especially the ability to effectively downregulate cognitive control under low cognitive control requirements, rather than the ability to upregulate cognitive control.

Nonetheless, the brain interfaces are still in their infancy, but reaching to their maturity quickly as several initiatives are released to push forward their development (e.g., NeuraLink by Elon Musk and `typing-by-brain' by Facebook). This has motivated us to revisit the design of EEG-based non-invasive brain interfaces. Specifically, current methodologies entail a highly skilled neuro-functional approach and evidence-based a priori knowledge about specific signal features and their interpretation from a neuro-physiological point of view. Hereafter, we propose to demystify such approaches, as we propose to leverage new time-varying complex network models that equip us with a fractal dynamical characterization of the underlying processes. Subsequently, the parameters of the proposed complex network models can be explained from a system's perspective, and, consecutively, used for classification using machine learning algorithms and/or actuation laws determined using control system's theory. Besides, the proposed system identification methods and techniques have computational complexities comparable with those currently used in EEG-based brain interfaces, which enable comparable online performances. Furthermore, we foresee that the proposed models and approaches are also valid using other invasive and non-invasive technologies. Finally, we illustrate and experimentally evaluate this approach on real EEG-datasets to assess and validate the proposed methodology. The classification accuracies are high even on having less number of training samples.

As an elegant extension of linear methods, they are able to model complex non-linear relationships. However, since the kernel matrix grows with data size, the training of classifiers is computationally demanding in large datasets. Here, a technique developed for linear classifiers is extended to kernel methods: In linearly separable data, replacing sets of instances by their averages improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduces data size. In kernel methods, data is linearly non-separable in input space, but linearly separable in the high-dimensional feature space that kernel methods implicitly operate in. It is shown that a classifier can be efficiently trained on instances averaged in feature space by averaging entries in the kernel matrix.

Ten healthy participants performed or imagined four types of bilateral hand movements during neuromagnetic measurements. By applying a support vector machine (SVM) method to classify the four movements regarding the sensor data obtained from the sensorimotor area, we found the mean accuracy of a two-class classification using the amplitudes of neuromagnetic fields to be particularly suitable for real-time applications, with accuracies comparable to those obtained in previous studies involving unilateral movement. The sensor data from over the sensorimotor cortex showed discriminative time-series waveforms and time-frequency maps in the bilateral hemispheres according to the four tasks. Furthermore, we used four-class classification algorithms based on the SVM method to decode all types of bilateral movements. Our results provided further proof that the slow components of neuromagnetic fields carry sufficient neural information to classify even bilateral hand movements and demonstrated the potential utility of decoding bilateral movements for engineering purposes such as multidimensional motor control.

Methods We conducted a case-control study consisting of a discovery cohort and a replication cohort independently assessed at 2 different centers. In each center, patients with the idiopathic generalized epilepsy phenotype and generalized spike-wave discharges on EEG were classified as drug-resistant or drug-responsive. EEG changes were classified into predefined patterns and compared between the 2 groups in the discovery cohort. Factors associated with drug resistance in multivariable analysis were tested in the replication cohort. Results The discovery cohort included 85 patients (29% drug-resistant and 71% drug-responsive). Their median age at assessment was 32 years and 50.6% were female. Multivariable analysis showed that higher number of seizure types ever experienced (3 vs 1: odds ratio [OR] = 31.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.5-214, p < 0.001; 3 vs 2: OR = 14.6, 95% CI: 2.3-93.1, p = 0.004) and generalized polyspike train (burst of generalized rhythmic spikes lasting less than 1 second) during sleep were associated with drug resistance (OR = 10.8, 95% CI: 2.4-49.4, p = 0.002). When these factors were tested in the replication cohort of 80 patients (27.5% drug-resistant and 72.5% drug-responsive; 71.3% female; median age 27.5 years), the proportion of patients with generalized polyspike train during sleep was also higher in the drug-resistant group (OR = 4.0, 95% CI: 1.35-11.8, p = 0.012). Conclusion Generalized polyspike train during sleep may be an EEG biomarker for drug resistance in adults with idiopathic generalized epilepsy.

Compact convolutional neural networks for classification of asynchronous steady-state visual evoked potentials	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain-computer interface; convolutional neural networks; steady-state visual evoked potentials; deep learning	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; EEG ALPHA-PHASE; REACTION-TIME; DYNAMICS	Objective. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are neural oscillations from the parietal and occipital regions of the brain that are evoked from flickering visual stimuli. SSVEPs are robust signals measurable in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and are commonly used in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, methods for high-accuracy decoding of SSVEPs usually require hand-crafted approaches that leverage domain-specific knowledge of the stimulus signals, such as specific temporal frequencies in the visual stimuli and their relative spatial arrangement. When this knowledge is unavailable, such as when SSVEP signals are acquired asynchronously, such approaches tend to fail. Approach. In this paper, we show how a compact convolutional neural network (Compact-CNN), which only requires raw EEG signals for automatic feature extraction, can be used to decode signals from a 12-class SSVEP dataset without the need for user-specific calibration. Main results. The Compact-CNN demonstrates across subject mean accuracy of approximately 80%, out-performing current state-of-the-art, hand-crafted approaches using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and Combined-CCA. Furthermore, the Compact-CNN approach can reveal the underlying feature representation, revealing that the deep learner extracts additional phase-and amplitude-related features associated with the structure of the dataset. Significance. We discuss how our Compact-CNN shows promise for BCI applications that allow users to freely gaze/attend to any stimulus at any time (e.g. asynchronous BCI) as well as provides a method for analyzing SSVEP signals in a way that might augment our understanding about the basic processing in the visual cortex.

About 30% of the patients are not even aware that they have epilepsy and many have to undergo surgeries to relieve the pain. Therefore, developing a robust brain-computer interface for seizure prediction can help epileptic patients significantly. In this paper, we propose a hybrid CNN-SVM model for better epileptic seizure prediction. A convolutional neural network (CNN) consists of a multilayer structure, which can be adapted and modified according to the requirement of different applications. A support vector machine is a discriminative classifier which can be described by a separating optimal hyperplane used for categorizing new samples. The combination of CNN and SVM is found to provide an effective way for epileptic prediction. Furthermore, the resulting model is made autonomous using edge computing services and is shown to be a viable seizure prediction method. The results can be beneficial in real-life support of epilepsy patients.

Cybersickness is the condition that occurs during or after exposed by the virtual environment. The increasing of cybersickness symptoms in gamers can lead to the poor health condition. Prior studies in investigating cybersickness employ subjective self-reports questionnaire, i.e., simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ). However, the objective measurement is required to determine the actual condition of subjects due to cybersickness severity level. Therefore, this paper proposed identification of cybersickness severity level using electroencephalograph (EEG) signals. From the EEG, we extract the best feature such as percentage change (PC) of power percentage (PP) in beta and theta frequency band from pre- to post-stimulation. We found a specific pattern of cybersickness that marked by the sudden decreasing of PP beta during the recording between baseline segment (4 minutes) and the last part (4 minutes) of game playing. Unlike previous studies, this paper proposed the rules-based algorithm i.e. CN2 Rules Induction for identifying cybersickness severity level. This giving ease for medical-expert to determine appropriate diagnosis and treatment towards patients. The classification yields the best accuracy of 88.9% using the CN2 rule induction. It is outperforming other classifiers accuracies such as decision tree (72.2%) and SVM (83.3%). According to the results, incorporating PC of the PP beta feature with the rules-based algorithm is working well for identifying cybersickness severity level from EEG.

Analysing the retrieval of memory helps in better understanding of the disorders. This article aims at analysing the functional connectivity of young adults during a multiphase memory retrieval process. Subjects have been made to recall events in different phases of their life. EEG signals have been recorded while the subjects are performing their tasks. Inter-hemispherical coherence has been estimated from the processed EEG signals As theta band posed higher power compared to all other bands, it was considered for further analysis. A mathematical function was formed for the processed theta wave, to determine the coherence between various electrodes. The function generated a theta wave for every task and each wave was significant in its own way. The connectivity matrix was found to identify the active electrodes during retrieval of events. The results were validated by computing coherence separately for the same electrodes and for the same events.

J	Jirka, J; Prauzek, M; Krejcar, O; Kuca, K				Jirka, Jakub; Prauzek, Michal; Krejcar, Ondrej; Kuca, Kamil			Automatic epilepsy detection using fractal dimensions segmentation and GP-SVM classification	NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT			English	Article						genetic programming; adaptive segmentation; SVM; fractal dimensions; EEG	EEG; SEIZURES	Objective: The most important part of signal processing for classification is feature extraction as a mapping from original input electroencephalographic (EEG) data space to new features space with the biggest class separability value. Features are not only the most important, but also the most difficult task from the classification process as they define input data and classification quality. An ideal set of features would make the classification problem trivial. This article presents novel methods of feature extraction processing and automatic epilepsy seizure classification combining machine learning methods with genetic evolution algorithms. Methods: Classification is performed on EEG data that represent electric brain activity. At first, the signal is preprocessed with digital filtration and adaptive segmentation using fractal dimensions as the only segmentation measure. In the next step, a novel method using genetic programming (GP) combined with support vector machine (SVM) confusion matrix as fitness function weight is used to extract feature vectors compressed into lower dimension space and classify the final result into ictal or interictal epochs. Results: The final application of GP SVM method improves the discriminatory performance of a classifier by reducing feature dimensionality at the same time. Members of the GP tree structure represent the features themselves and their number is automatically decided by the compression function introduced in this paper. This novel method improves the overall performance of the SVM classification by dramatically reducing the size of input feature vector. Conclusion: According to results, the accuracy of this algorithm is very high and comparable, or even superior to other automatic detection algorithms. In combination with the great efficiency, this algorithm can be used in real-time epilepsy detection applications. From the results of the algorithm's classification, we can observe high sensitivity, specificity results, except for the Generalized Tonic Clonic Seizure (GTCS). As the next step, the optimization of the compression stage and final SVM evaluation stage is in place. More data need to be obtained on GTCS to improve the overall classification score for GTCS.

Although the external covariates can be directly controlled or measured; the internal factors are hard, if not impossible, to control or even observe. This study provides a statistical framework that enables characterization of the unobserved factors controlling neuronal response variability induced by behavior, with the model parameters fitted directly to real spiking data. We apply this model to simultaneously recorded spiking and local field potential activities of visual cortical neurons, and show its ability to encode and decode time-varying visual information, as well as to capture the dynamic response characteristics underpinning those computations.

Neuroprostheses or robotic arms can enable individuals with SCI to move independently, improving their quality of life. The control of restorative or assistive devices is facilitated by brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which convert brain activity into control commands. In this paper, we summarize the recent findings of our research towards the main aim to provide reliable and intuitive control. We propose a framework that encompasses the detection of goal-directed movement intention, movement classification and decoding, error-related potentials detection and delivery of kinesthetic feedback. Finally, we discuss future directions that could be promising to translate the proposed framework to individuals with SCI.

Introduction: With the advance of technology, automatic emotion recognition systems no longer seem far-fetched. Be that as it may, detecting neural correlates of emotion has remained a substantial bottleneck. Settling this issue will be a breakthrough of significance in the literature. Methods: The current study aims to identify the correlations between different emotions and brain regions with the help of suitable electrodes. Initially, independent component analysis algorithm is employed to remove artifacts and extract the independent components. The informative channels are then selected based on the thresholded average activity value for obtained components. Afterwards, effective features are extracted from selected channels common between all emotion classes. Features are reduced using the local subset feature selection method and then fed to a new classification model using modified Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. Results: The presented method is employed to DEAP dataset and the results are compared to those of previous studies, which highlights the significant ability of this method to recognize emotions through electroencephalography, by the accuracy of about 91%. Finally, the obtained results are discussed and new aspects are introduced. Conclusions: The present study addresses the long-standing challenge of finding neural correlates between human emotions and the activated brain regions. Also, we managed to solve uncertainty problem in emotion classification which is one of the most challenging issues in this field. The proposed method could be employed in other practical applications in future.

It has emerged as a promising recording technique in brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Compression of these signals is essential for saving power and bandwidth in the novel application scenarios of Health-based IoT and Body Area Networks. However, this task is particularly challenging since, ECoG signals are not compressible either in time domain or in frequency domain. To that end, Block Sparse Bayesian Learning (BSBL) techniques were suggested for the reconstruction of compressed EEG and ECG signals, which is however, computationally demanding. Furthermore, given the heterogeneity in modern computing systems, careful design partitioning is required to most effectively evaluate the particular resources available on the deployed architecture. In this paper, we propose to utilise a combination of compressive sensing and neural network for the compression and reconstruction of ECoG signals, respectively. For the choice of the neural network, a multi-layer perceptron regressor with a stochastic gradient descent solver is developed. For a sample system, we show that the network has a compression ratio of 50%, and reconstruction accuracy of 89.85% after training with a practical, medium-sized dataset. In general, the results show that the most efficient system implementation is a heterogeneous architecture combining a CPU and a field programmable gate array (FPGA).

The results of such behavioral measures reflect neural processing of the speech signal, but are also influenced by language processing, motivation, and memory. Very often, electrophysiological measures of hearing give insight in the neural processing of sound. However, in most methods, non-speech stimuli are used, making it hard to relate the results to behavioral measures of speech intelligibility. The use of natural running speech as a stimulus in electrophysiological measures of hearing is a paradigm shift which allows to bridge the gap between behavioral and electrophysiological measures. Here, by decoding the speech envelope from the electroencephalogram, and correlating it with the stimulus envelope, we demonstrate an electrophysiological measure of neural processing of running speech. We show that behaviorally measured speech intelligibility is strongly correlated with our electrophysiological measure. Our results pave the way towards an objective and automatic way of assessing neural processing of speech presented through auditory prostheses, reducing confounds such as attention and cognitive capabilities. We anticipate that our electrophysiological measure will allow better differential diagnosis of the auditory system, and will allow the development of closed-loop auditory prostheses that automatically adapt to individual users.

However, the time latency during an MI period varies between trials for each participant. Fixing the starting time point of MI features can lead to decreased system performance in MI-based BCI systems. To address this issue, we propose a novel correlation-based time window selection (CTWS) algorithm for MI-based BCIs. Specifically, the optimized reference signals for each class were selected based on correlation analysis and performance evaluation. Furthermore, the starting points of time windows for both training and testing samples were adjusted using correlation analysis. Finally, the feature extraction and classification algorithms were used to calculate the classification accuracy. With two datasets, the results demonstrate that the CTWS algorithm significantly improved the system performance when compared to directly using feature extraction approaches. Importantly, the average improvement in accuracy of the CTWS algorithm on the datasets of healthy participants and stroke patients was 16.72% and 5.24%, respectively when compared to traditional common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm. In addition, the average accuracy increased 7.36% and 9.29%, respectively when the CTWS was used in conjunction with Sub-Alpha-Beta Log-Det Divergences (Sub-ABLD) algorithm. These findings suggest that the proposed CTWS algorithm holds promise as a general feature extraction approach for MI-based BCIs. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Changes in neuronal oscillation amplitude across states of consciousness have been widely reported, but little is known about possible changes in the temporal dynamics of these oscillations. The temporal structure of brain oscillations may provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying consciousness. To address this question, we examined long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) of EEG oscillation amplitudes recorded during both wakefulness and anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. Importantly, the time-varying EEG oscillation envelopes were assessed over the course of a sevoflurane sedation protocol during which the participants alternated between states of consciousness and unconsciousness. Both spectral power and LRTC in oscillation amplitude were computed across multiple frequency bands. State-dependent differences in these features were assessed using non-parametric tests and supervised machine learning. We found that periods of unconsciousness were associated with increases in LRTC in beta (15-30Hz) amplitude over frontocentral channels and with a suppression of alpha (8-13Hz) amplitude over occipitoparietal electrodes. Moreover, classifiers trained to predict states of consciousness on single epochs demonstrated that the combination of beta LRTC with alpha amplitude provided the highest classification accuracy (above 80%). These results suggest that loss of consciousness is accompanied by an augmentation of temporal persistence in neuronal oscillation amplitude, which may reflect an increase in regularity and a decrease in network repertoire compared to the brain's activity during resting-state consciousness.

EEG patterns of self-paced movement imaginations towards externally-cued and internally-selected targets	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; DECISION-MAKING; BCI RESEARCH; POTENTIALS; INTENTION; STIMULI; P3; CLASSIFICATION; ACTIVATION	In this study, we investigate the neurophysiological signature of the interacting processes which lead to a single reach-and-grasp movement imagination (MI). While performing this task, the human healthy participants could either define their movement targets according to an external cue, or through an internal selection process. After defining their target, they could start the MI whenever they wanted. We recorded high density electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and investigated two neural correlates: the event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with the target selection, which reflect the perceptual and cognitive processes prior to the MI, and the movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs), associated with the planning of the self-paced MI. We found differences in frontal and parietal areas between the late ERP components related to the internally-driven selection and the externally-cued process. Furthermore, we could reliably estimate the MI onset of the self-paced task. Next, we extracted MRCP features around the MI onset to train classifiers of movement vs. rest directly on self-paced MI data. We attained performance significantly higher than chance level for both time-locked and asynchronous classification. These findings contribute to the development of more intuitive brain-computer interfaces in which movement targets are defined internally and the movements are self-paced.

Today, deep neural networks achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy in most learning tasks that involve large data sets of unstructured data. However, the application of deep learning techniques may not be beneficial in problems with limited training sets and computational resources, or under domain-specific test time constraints. Among other algorithms, ensembles of decision trees, particularly the gradient boosted models have recently been very successful in machine learning competitions. Here, we propose an efficient hardware architecture to implement gradient boosted trees in applications under stringent power, area, and delay constraints, such as medical devices. Specifically, we introduce the concepts of asynchronous tree operation and sequential feature extraction to achieve an unprecedented energy and area efficiency. The proposed architecture is evaluated in automated seizure detection for epilepsy, using 3074 h of intracranial EEG data from 26 patients with 393 seizures. Average F1 scores of 99.23% and 87.86% are achieved for random and block-wise splitting of data into train/test sets, respectively, with an average detection latency of 1.1 s. The proposed classifier is fabricated in a 65-nm TSMC process, consuming 41.2 nJ/class in a total area of 540 x 1850 mu m(2). This design improves the state-of-the-art by 27x reduction in energy-area-latency product. Moreover, the proposed gradient-boosting architecture offers the flexibility to accommodate variable tree counts specific to each patient, to trade the predictive accuracy with energy. This patient-specific and energy-quality scalable classifier holds great promise for low-power sensor data classification in biomedical applications.

Also, we propose a selection criteria in order to improve the classification accuracy. In this study, the brain signals of healthy and disabled subjects were analyzed and four architectures were tested with different numbers of filters with the same dimensions. The results of the current work indicate that the best bitrate in disabled and healthy subjects was 14.14 and 25.44 bits per minute, respectively. Using target by block evaluation, the classification accuracy of 100% was obtained in healthy and disabled subjects. This approach is compared to various machine learning algorithms so that our results outperformed others works.

Machine learning methods, in particular artifical neural networks (ANNs), are powerful on high-dimensional classification tasks. However, lack of interpretability of the resulting models has been a drawback in research. We assess relevant PN topology changes in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by novel ANN interpretation techniques. Approach: ANNs are trained to classify OSA based on the PNs of 48 patients and 48 age and gender matched healthy controls. The PNs consisting of 2812 links are derived from overnight biosignal recordings. The interpretation technique DeepLift is applied to the resulting ANN models, enabling the determination of the relevant features for classification decisions on individual subjects. The mean relevance scores of the features are compared to other machine learning methods (decision tree and random forests) and statistical tests on group differences. Main results: The ANN interpretation results show good agreement with the compared methods and 87% of the samples could be correctly classified. OSA patients show a significantly higher coupling (p < 0.001) in light sleep (N2) between breathing rate and EEG delta power in all electrode locations and to chin and leg muscular tone. In deep sleep (N3), OSA leads to significantly lower coupling (p < 0.01) in lateral connections of EEG theta and sigma power in central and frontal positions. Misclassified OSA patients had all mild/moderate AHIs and did not show PN topology changes. Both nights of these patients have been consistently misclassified as healthy. This may indicate, that the impact of respiratory events differs in subjects, thus forming different phenotypes. Significance: The proposed PN analysis provides a powerful and robust method to quantify a broad range of physiological interactions. Interpretability of the ANN make them a promising tool to identify new diagnostic markers in data-driven approaches.

We developed an approach that allowed to directly link observation of emotional expressions and imagery in ASD, and to derive biomarkers that are able to classify abnormal imagery in ASD. To provide a handle between perception and action imagery cycles it is important to use visual stimuli exploring the dynamical nature of emotion representation. We conducted a case-control study providing a link between both visualization and mental imagery of dynamic facial expressions and investigated source responses to pure face-expression contrasts. We were able to replicate the same highly group discriminative neural signatures during action observation (dynamical face expressions) and imagery, in the precuneus. Larger activation in regions involved in imagery for the ASD group suggests that this effect is compensatory. We conducted a machine learning procedure to automatically identify these group differences, based on the EEG activity during mental imagery of facial expressions. We compared two classifiers and achieved an accuracy of 81% using 15 features (both linear and non-linear) of the signal from theta, high-beta and gamma bands extracted from right-parietal locations (matching the precuneus region), further confirming the findings regarding standard statistical analysis. This robust classification of signals resulting from imagery of dynamical expressions in ASD is surprising because it far and significantly exceeds the good classification already achieved with observation of neutral face expressions (74%). This novel neural correlate of emotional imagery in autism could potentially serve as a clinical interventional target for studies designed to improve facial expression recognition, or at least as an intervention biomarker.

Firstly, it will introduce the pursued interest and contribution that visual-ERP EEG based BCI application for Generative Design may provide through a synthetic review of precedents and BCI technology. Secondly, selected BCI components will be described and a methodology will be presented to provide an appropriate framework for a CAAD software approach.

Statistics indicate the need of a reliable driver distraction system, which can monitor the driver's distraction and alert the driver before there is a chance of disasters on the road continuously an ubiquitously. Therefore, early detection of driver distraction can help decrease the cost of roadway disasters. Physiological signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) have been extensively used for driver state monitoring at the physiological level. More recently, galvanic skin response (GSR) analysis, which is a minimally intrusive technology, has been investigated to develop monitoring systems which alerts divers early. In this paper, we propose a novel detection system that characterizes the impact of secondary tasks of calling and texting on the driver based on the spectrogram and MEL Cepstrum representation of the GSR signals and convolutional neural networks (CNN) modeling. The proposed detection system decomposes the GSR signals in 2D time-frequency representation to decode spectro-temporal patterns. We further isolate the spectral envelope and then extract Mel frequency filter bank coefficients in time and frequency. Our proposed deep CNN structure is designed to automatically learn reliable discriminative visual patterns in the 2D spectrogram and Mel cepstrum space. Passing the layers of the CNN, the low level features transform to high level features representing the impact of the secondary tasks. The aforementioned process replaces the traditional ad hoc hand-crafted feature extraction when working with a high dimensional time-series dataset. The classification accuracy of the proposed prediction algorithm is evaluated based on a set of recorded GSR signals from 7 driver subjects during a naturalistic driving. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a high accuracy of detecting the state of inattention, 93.28%.

But their full potential is just being realised through the latest brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNN) and their deep learning algorithms, that make it possible for AI to gain a fast progress nowadays [3-14]. This presentation has two parts. The first part covers generic methodological aspects of AI and neural networks, including: Learning evolving processes in space and time; Data, Information and Knowledge; The human brain as a deep learning system; Classical methods of ANN; Methods of SNN; Deep learning in brain-inspired SNN architectures; Evolutionary and quantum inspired optimisation of SNN systems.

Although the SSVEP is useful for its high level of decoding accuracy, visual fatigue from the repetitive visual flickering is an unavoidable problem. In addition, hybrid BCI systems that combine the SSVEP with the event-related potential (ERP) have been proposed recently. These hybrid BCI systems would improve the decoding accuracy; however, the competing effect by simultaneous presentation of the visual stimulus could possibly supervene the signal in the hybrid system. Nevertheless, previous studies have not sufficiently reported these problems of visual fatigue with SSVEP stimuli or the competing effect in the SSVEP+ERP system. In this study, two different experiments were designed to explore our claims. The first experiment evaluated the visual fatigue level and decoding accuracy for the different types of SSVEP stimuli, which were the peripheral-field SSVEP (pSSVEP) and the central-field SSVEP (cSSVEP). We report that the pSSVEP could reduce the visual fatigue level by avoiding direct exposure of the eye-retina to the flickering visual stimulus, while also delivering a decoding accuracy comparable to that of cSSVEP. The second experiment was designed to examine the competing effect of the SSVEP stimuli on ERP performance and vice versa. To do this, the visual stimuli of ERP and SSVEP were presented simultaneously as part of the BCI speller layout. We found a clear competing effect wherein the evoked brain potentials were influenced by the SSVEP stimulus and the band power at the target frequencies was also decreased significantly by the ERP stimuli. Nevertheless, these competing effects did not lead to a significant loss in decoding accuracy; their features preserved sufficient information for discriminating a target class. Our work is the first to evaluate the visual fatigue and competing effect together, which should be considered when designing BCI applications. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the pSSVEP is a viable substitution for the cSSVEP because of its ability to reduce the level of visual fatigue while maintaining a minimal loss of decoding accuracy.

Though an online MI brain computer interface (BCI) system, which apply MI, can enhance the patient's participation and accelerate their recovery process. The traditional method deals with the electroencephalogram (EEG) induced by MI by common spatial pattern (CSP), which is used to extract information from a frequency band. In order to further improve the classification accuracy of the system, information of two characteristic frequency bands is extracted. The effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method is verified by off-line analysis of competition data and the analysis of online system.

The objective of this study was to assess and compare the behavioral and electrophysiological effects of both levodopa and subthalamic stimulation on emotional processing in Parkinson's disease. Operated patients (n =16) and matched healthy subjects performed an emotional Stroop task, in which the emotion expressed by a face must be recognized while ignoring an emotional distractive word and that includes a neutral control sub-task. Patients were tested in the four possible treatment conditions (off stim/off med; on stim/off med; off stim/on med; and on stim/on med). High-resolution electroencephalography was recorded while performing the task. Patients made significantly more mistakes in facial emotion recognition than healthy subjects (p < .005). Untreated patients performed worse in the emotional trials than in the control sub-task (p < .05). Fearful faces induced significantly slower reaction times than happy faces in patients (p = .0002), but not in the healthy subjects. The emotional Stroop effect with levodopa was significantly higher than with subthalamic stimulation when fearful faces were assessed (p = .0243). Conversely, treatments did not modulate the Stroop effect of the control sub-task. EEG demonstrated that, compared with the untreated state, levodopa but not subthalamic stimulation significantly increases the amplitude of the event-related potential N170 (p = .002 vs. p = .1, respectively), an electrophysiological biomarker of early aspects of facial processing. The activity of the N170 cortical sources within the right fusiform gyrus was increased by levodopa (p < .05) but not by stimulation. While levodopa normalizes the recognition of emotional facial expression and early EEG markers of emotional processing, subthalamic stimulation does not. Thus, operated patients require dopaminergic medication in addition to stimulation to treat emotional symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

B	Wang, Z; Verma, N		Cong, P		Wang, Z.; Verma, N.			Embedded Signal Analysis	CIRCUIT DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLANTABLE DEVICES	River Publishers Series in Electronic Materials and Devices		English	Article; Book Chapter							PROCESSOR; EEG	Medical devices are advancing to provide increasingly intelligent and relevant responses, bringing the potential for greater impact and better patient outcomes. Such responses are derived from analysis of patient signals made available thanks to advances in sensing and instrumentation technologies. However, given the complexity of the underlying physiologic and pathophysiologic processes, analysis of these signals is challenging on many levels. Data-driven methods for analysis are showing substantial promise towards these challenges, actuated both by the large-scale emergence of data in the medical domain and by progress in algorithms from the machine-learning and statistical-signal-processing domains. This chapter explores the platform-level challenges with extending data-driven methods to resource-constrained (energy, area) wearable and implantable devices. Recent work in the area of heterogeneous microprocessor design and low-power algorithms is presented to illustrate approaches to addressing the challenges.

Machine learning as a new paradigm for characterizing localization and lateralization of neuropsychological test data in temporal lobe epilepsy	EPILEPSY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Temporal lobe epilepsy; Machine learning; Neuropsychology; Localization; lateralization	MEMORY; MULTICOLLINEARITY; SENSITIVITY	In this study, we employed a kernel support vector machine to predict epilepsy localization and lateralization for patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy (n = 228). We assessed the accuracy to which indices of verbal memory, visual memory, verbal fluency, and naming would localize and lateralize seizure focus in comparison to standard electroencephalogram (EEG). Classification accuracy was defined as models that produced the least cross-validated error (CV epsilon). In addition, we assessed whether the inclusion of norm-based standard scores, demographics, and emotional functioning data would reduce CV epsilon. Finally, we obtained class probabilities (i.e., the probability of a particular classification for each case) and produced receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the primary analyses. We obtained the least error assessing localization data with the Gaussian radial basis kernel function (RBF; support vectors = 157, CV epsilon = 0.22). There was no overlap between the localization and lateralization models, such that the poorest localization model (the hyperbolic tangent kernel function; support vectors = 91, CV epsilon = 0.36) outperformed the strongest lateralization model (RBF; support vectors = 201, CV epsilon = 0.39). Contrary to our hypothesis, the addition of norm, demographics, and emotional functioning data did not improve the accuracy of the models. Receiver operating characteristic curves suggested clinical utility in classifying epilepsy lateralization and localization using neuropsychological indicators, albeit with better discrimination for localizing determinations. This study adds to the existing literature by employing an analytic technique with inherent advantages in generalizability when compared to traditional single-sample, not cross-validated models. In the future, class probabilities extracted from these and similar analyses could supplement neuropsychological practice by offering a quantitative guide to clinical judgements.

Methods: We included 28 consecutive patients with refractory focal epilepsy (25 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and 3 with extratemporal epilepsy) who underwent resective epilepsy surgery. Ictal EEG patterns were analyzed with a novel automatic IOSL algorithm. IOSL source localizations on a sublobar level were validated by comparison with actual resection sites and seizure free outcome 2 years after surgery. Results: Sensitivity of IOSL was 92.3% (TLE: 92.3%); specificity 60% (TLE: 50%); positive predictive value 66.7% (TLE: 66.7%); and negative predictive value 90% (TLE: 85.7%). The likelihood ratio was more than ten times higher for concordant IOSL results as compared to discordant results (p = 0.013). Conclusions: We demonstrated the clinical feasibility of our IOSL approach yielding reasonable high performance measures on a sublobar level. Significance: Our IOSL method may contribute to a correct localization of the seizure onset zone in temporal lobe epilepsy and can readily be used in standard epilepsy monitoring settings. Further studies are needed for validation in extratemporal epilepsy. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Feature selection methods can efficiently speed up the learning process and improve the overall classification accuracy by reducing the computational complexity. Among the feature selection methods, multivariate methods are more effective in removing irrelevant and redundant features. An efficient multivariate feature selection method, optimization method, called 'graph clustering based ant colony optimization (GCACO)' has been recently introduced and shown to outperform other well-known feature selection methods. In the GCACO, features are divided into communities (clusters) in the entire feature space represented as a graph by an efficient community detection algorithm. An ACO-based search strategy is then used to select an optimal feature subset from the initial set of features. In this paper, a modified GCACO algorithm called MGCACO is presented to significantly improve the performance of the GCACO. Performance of the MGCACO algorithm was assessed by testing it on several standard benchmark datasets and sleep EEG data. The performance of the MGCACO was compared to those obtained using the original GCACO and other well-known filtering methods available in the literature. The MGCACO achieved superior performance over the GCACO and other univariate and multivariate algorithms with up to 10%. The MGCACO also exhibited higher efficiency in reducing the number of features all by keeping the classification accuracy maximum.

Three factors of interest were modulated during the experimentation: (1) execution speed of the grasping, (2) type of grasping and (3) mental strategy (motor imagery or real motion) used to produce motor commands. Thirteen healthy subjects carried out the protocol. The peaks and latencies of the ErrP were analyzed for the different factors as well as the classification performance. Main results. ErrP are evoked for erroneous commands decoded from neural correlates of natural movements. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses revealed that latency and magnitude of the most characteristic ErrP peaks were significantly influenced by the speed at which the grasping was executed, but not the type of grasp. This resulted in an greater accuracy of single-trial decoding of errors for fast movements (75.65%) compared to slow ones (68.99%). Significance. Understanding the effects of combining paradigms is a first step to design hybrid BCI that optimize decoding accuracy and can be deployed in motor substitution and neuro-rehabilitation applications.

MM approaches have been particularly successful to tackle inverse problems and statistical machine learning problems where the regularization term is a sparsity-promoting concave function. However, due to non-convexity, the solution found by MM depends on its initialization. Uniform initialization is the most natural and often employed strategy as it boils down to penalizing all coefficients equally in the first MM iteration. Yet, this arbitrary choice can lead to unsatisfactory results in severely underdetermined inverse problems such as source imaging with magneto-and electro-encephalography (M/EEG). The framework of hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) is an alternative approach to encode sparsity. This work shows that for certain hierarchical models, a simple alternating scheme to compute fully Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates leads to the exact same sequence of updates as a standard MM strategy (see the adaptive lasso). With this parallel outlined, we show how to improve upon these MM techniques by probing the multimodal posterior density using Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Firstly, we show that these samples can provide well-informed initializations that help MM schemes to reach better local minima. Secondly, we demonstrate how it can reveal the different modes of the posterior distribution in order to explore and quantify the inherent uncertainty and ambiguity of such ill-posed inference procedure. In the context of M/EEG, each mode corresponds to a plausible configuration of neural sources, which is crucial for data interpretation, especially in clinical contexts. Results on both simulations and real datasets show how the number or the type of sensors affect the uncertainties on the estimates.

This process has proven to yield valid results as long as the stimuli of the experiment are under complete control (e.g.: the order of presentation). In this study, we have recorded the subject's electroencephalogram and eye-tracking data while they were exposed to a 2D platform game. In the game we had control over the design of each level by choosing the diversity of actions (i.e. events) afforded to the player. However we had no control over the order in which these actions were undertaken. The psychophysiological signals were synchronized to these game events and used to train and test an artificial neural network in order to evaluate how efficiently such a tool can help us in establishing the correlation, and therefore differentiating among the different categories of events. The highest average accuracies were between 60.25%-72.07%, hinting that it is feasible to recognize reactions to complex uncontrolled stimuli, like game events, using artificial neural networks.

Clinical and Electrophysiological Differences between Subjects with Dysphonetic Dyslexia and Non-Specific Reading Delay	BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						direct test of reading and spelling (DTRS); dysphonetic dyslexia; non-specific reading delay; QEEG; quantitative EEG tomography; source localization; VARETA; Biomarkers	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; LEARNING-DISABLED CHILDREN; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; RESTING-STATE; EEG ACTIVITY; NEUROMETRIC EVALUATION; SPELLING DISABILITIES; SPECTRAL PARAMETERS; FMRI CONNECTIVITY	Reading is essentially a two-channel function, requiring the integration of intact visual and auditory processes both peripheral and central. It is essential for normal reading that these component processes go forward automatically. Based on this model, Boder described three main subtypes of dyslexia: dysphonetic dyslexia (DD), dyseidetic, mixed and besides a fourth group defined non-specific reading delay (NSRD). The subtypes are identified by an algorithm that considers the reading quotient and the % of errors in the spelling test. Chiarenza and Bindelli have developed the Direct Test of Reading and Spelling (DTRS), a computerized, modified and validated version to the Italian language of the Boder test. The sample consisted of 169 subjects with DD and 36 children with NSRD. The diagnosis of dyslexia was made according to the DSM-V criteria. The DTRS was used to identify the dyslexia subtypes and the NSRD group. 2-5 min of artefact-free EEG (electroencephalogram), recorded at rest with eyes closed, according to 10-20 system were analyzed. Stability based Biomarkers identification methodology was applied to the DTRS and the quantitative EEG (QEEG). The reading quotients and the errors of the reading and spelling test were significantly different in the two groups. The DD group had significantly higher activity in delta and theta bands compared to NSRD group in the frontal, central and parietal areas bilaterally. The classification equation for the QEEG, both at the scalp and the sources levels, obtained an area under the robust Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) of 0.73. However, we obtained a discrimination equation for the DTRS items which did not participate in the Boder classification algorithm, with a specificity and sensitivity of 0.94 to discriminate DD from NSRD. These results demonstrate for the first time the existence of different neuropsychological and neurophysiological patterns between children with DD and children with NSRD. They may also provide clinicians and therapists warning signals deriving from the anamnesis and the results of the DTRS that should lead to an earlier diagnosis of reading delay, which is usually very late diagnosed and therefore, untreated until the secondary school level.

Some disabled people or autistic children are unable to express their emotions which form a communication gap between them and the outside world. This makes emotion recognition plays an important role in filling this gap. This paper focuses on investigating the human emotions from two physiological signals; EEG and EMG, using recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) approach. Features optimization has been applied using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. Three supervised classifiers (regression tree, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor) have been used for classifying signals into three cases for each one of the two emotional dimensions (arousal and valence). The achieved accuracy reached to 94% for arousal and 92% for valence dimension.

In this work, we present an out of the box approach to this problem, trying to mimic the visual inspection process that a trained physician might do to locate the beginning of a pre-ictal state in an EEG plot. We explore different data labeling methods for the posterior training of a Convolutional Neural Network, taking into account only visual characteristics for classification. Ten second images (300x400 px) were synthesized from scalp EEG recordings belonging to 10 epileptic patients from the public Physionet CHB-MIT database. A tortuosity measure was taken for each one-second window, for each channel (23 channels in 10-20 bipolar configuration). Unsupervised clustering methods in conjunction with the mean and the standard deviation of the tortuosity sets were used to identify pre-ictal states; interictal states were selected according to the same proximity criteria used for the Kaggles Melbourne University AES/MathWorks/NIH Seizure Prediction Challenge. The proposed labelling method indentified 28 posible pre-ictal states across 10 patients. Data from pre-ictal states and interictal states was used to train, and test, a Convolutional Neural Network classifier for each of the 8 patients selected. A classification accuracy of 99.29% was achieved for the best patient; however, an accuracy of 46.93% was also obtained for the worst patient. Mean performance across patients was 76.03%, a 52.07% improvement over chance.

Recent approaches employing brain-computer/brain-machine interfaces to provide online feedback of the MI during rehabilitation training have promising rehabilitation outcomes. In this study, we examined whether participants could volitionally recall MI-related brain activation patterns when guided using neurofeedback (NF) during training. The participants' performance was compared to that without NF. We hypothesized that participants would be able to consistently generate the relevant activation pattern associated with the MI task during training with NF compared to that without NF. To assess activation consistency, we used the performance of classifiers trained to discriminate MI-related brain activation patterns. Our results showed significantly higher predictive values of MI-related activation patterns during training with NF. Additionally, this improvement in the classification performance tends to be associated with the activation of middle temporal gyrus/inferior occipital gyrus, a region associated with visual motion processing, suggesting the importance of performance monitoring during MI task training. Taken together, these findings suggest that the efficacy of MI training, in terms of generating consistent brain activation patterns relevant to the task, can be enhanced by using NF as a mechanism to enable participants to volitionally recall task-related brain activation patterns.

An Amygdala-Hippocampus Subnetwork that Encodes Variation in Human Mood	CELL			English	Article							DEFAULT-MODE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; FREQUENCY ACTIVITY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; BRAIN; DYNAMICS; EMOTION; MEMORY; NETWORKS; IDENTIFICATION	Human brain networks that encode variation in mood on naturalistic timescales remain largely unexplored. Here we combine multi-site, semi-chronic, intracranial electroencephalography recordings from the human limbic system with machine learning methods to discover a brain subnetwork that correlates with variation in individual subjects' self-reported mood over days. First we defined the subnetworks that influence intrinsic brain dynamics by identifying regions that showed coordinated changes in spectral coherence. The most common subnetwork, found in 13 of 21 subjects, was characterized by beta-frequency coherency (13-30 Hz) between the amygdala and hippocampusus. Increased variability of this subnetwork correlated with worsening mood across these 13 subjects. Moreover, these subjects had significantly higher trait anxiety than the 8 of 21 for whom this amygdala-hippocampus subnetwork was absent. These results demonstrate an approach for extracting network-behavior relationships from complex datasets, and they reveal a conserved subnetwork associated with a psychological trait that significantly influences intrinsic brain dynamics and encodes fluctuations in mood.

COMPLEXITY			English	Article							HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; ARRHYTHMIA SUPPRESSION; EEG SIGNALS	Two main weaknesses have been identified for permutation entropy (PE): the neglect of subsequence pattern differences in terms of amplitude and the possible ambiguities introduced by equal values in the subsequences. A number of variations or customizations to the original PE method to address these issues have been proposed in the scientific literature recently. Specifically for ties, methods have tried to remove the ambiguity by assigning different weighted or computed orders to equal values. Although these methods are able to circumvent such ambiguity, they can substantially increase the algorithm costs, and a general characterization of their practical effectiveness is still lacking. This paper analyses the performance of PE using several biomedical datasets (electroencephalogram, heartbeat interval, body temperature, and glucose records) in order to quantify the influence of ties on its signal class segmentation capability. This capability is assessed in terms of statistical significance of the PE differences between classes and classification sensitivity and specificity. Being obvious that ties modify the PE results, we hypothesize that equal values are intrinsic to the acquisition process, and therefore, they impact all the classes more or less equally. The experimental results confirm ties are often not the limiting factor for PE, even they can be beneficial as a sort of stochastic resonance, and it can be far more effective to focus on the embedding dimension instead.

The BCI community has witnessed a substantial amount of work done on BCI technologies and many successful BCI applications. However, continuing effort is still needed to further optimize the capabilities, robustness, and usability of BCI systems for human use, including those who suffer from muscular disabilities such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, and severe cerebral palsy. This chapter reviews the state of the art of BCI as an emerging human-computer interaction technology. We first introduce a BCI classification scheme, along with different types of the signal recording methods and brain signal patterns for BCI operation. Next, the most commonly used signal processing techniques and feature extraction techniques are explained, in addition to classification methods used for identifying the user's intentions. Finally, we present and discuss various types of BCI applications with an emphasis on the future of BCI research and development through inter-and multidisciplinary collaborations and ongoing communication among neuroscientists, engineers, psychologists, human factors professionals, clinicians, and rehabilitation specialists.

Currently, the diagnosis and classification of OSA is based on the apnea-hypopnea index, which poorly correlates to underlying pathology and clinical consequences. A large number of in-laboratory sleep studies are performed around the world every year, already collecting an enormous amount of physiological data within an individual. Clinically, we have not yet fully taken advantage of this data, but combined with existing analytical approaches, we have the potential to transform the way OSA is managed within an individual patient. Currently, respiratory signals are used to count apneas and hypopneas, but patterns such as inspiratory flow signals can be used to predict optimal OSA treatment. Electrocardiographic data can reveal arrhythmias, but patterns such as heart rate variability can also be used to detect and classify OSA. Electroencephalography is used to score sleep stages and arousals, but specific patterns such as the odds-ratio product can be used to classify how OSA patients responds differently to arousals. Objective: In this review, we examine these and many other existing computer-aided polysomnography signal processing algorithms and how they can reflect an individual's manifestation of OSA. Significance: Together with current technological advance, it is only a matter of time before advanced automatic signal processing and analysis is widely applied to precision medicine of OSA in the clinical setting.

Decoding of EEG Signals Using Deep Long Short-Term Memory Network in Face Recognition Task	2018 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (IEEE SSCI)			English	Proceedings Paper	8th IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)	NOV 18-21, 2018	Bengaluru, INDIA	IEEE		Event Related Potential; N250; P600; Long Short Term Memory with attention; eLORETA	NEURAL-NETWORKS; BRAIN; FAMILIAR; CLASSIFICATION	The paper proposes a novel approach to classify the human memory response involved in the face recognition task by the utilization of event related potentials. Electroencephalographic signals are acquired when a subject engages himself/herself in familiar or unfamiliar face recognition tasks. The signals are analyzed through source localization using eLORETA and artifact removal by ICA from a set of channels corresponding to those selected sources, with an ultimate aim to classify the EEG responses of familiar and unfamiliar faces. The EEG responses of the two different classes (familiar and unfamiliar face recognition)are distinguished by analyzing the Event Related Potential signals that reveal the existence of large N250 and P600 signals during familiar face recognition. The paper introduces a novel LSTM classifier network which is designed to classify the ERP signals to fulfill the prime objective of this work. The first layer of the novel LSTM network evaluates the spatial and local temporal correlations between the obtained samples of local EEG time-windows. The second layer of this network models the temporal correlations between the timewindows. An attention mechanism has been introduced in each layer of the proposed model to compute the contribution of each EEG time-window in face recognition task. Performance analysis reveals that the proposed LSTM classifier with attention mechanism outperforms the efficiency of the conventional LSTM and other classifiers with a significantly large margin. Moreover, source localization using eLORETA shows the involvement of inferior temporal and frontal lobes during familiar face recognition and pre-frontal lobe during unfamiliar face recognition. Thus, the present research outcome can be used in criminal investigation, where meticulous differentiation of familiar and unfamiliar face detection by criminals can be performed from their acquired brain responses.

However, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can impede the use of single-trial analyses and decoding methods. In this study, we investigate the applicability of a single-trial approach to decode stimulus modality from magnetoence-phalographic (MEG) high frequency activity. In order to classify the auditory versus visual presentation of words, we combine beamformer source reconstruction with the random forest classification method. To enable group level inference, the classification is embedded in an across-subjects framework. We show that single-trial gamma SNR allows for good classification performance (accuracy across subjects: 66.44%). This implies that the characteristics of high frequency activity have a high consistency across trials and subjects. The random forest classifier assigned informational value to activity in both auditory and visual cortex with high spatial specificity. Across time, gamma power was most informative during stimulus presentation. Among all frequency bands, the 75 Hz to 95 Hz band was the most informative frequency band in visual as well as in auditory areas. Especially in visual areas, a broad range of gamma frequencies (55 Hz to 125 Hz) contributed to the successful classification. Thus, we demonstrate the feasibility of single-trial approaches for decoding the stimulus modality across subjects from high frequency activity and describe the discriminative gamma activity in time, frequency, and space.

The NeuCube platform was originally conceived and designed to process electroencephalographic (EEG) signals considering their temporal component and their spatial source within the brain. Its neural representation allows for a visual analysis of connectivity among different locations, and also provides a prediction tool harnessing the predictive learning capabilities of dynamic evolving Spiking Neural Networks (deSNNs). Taking advantage of the NeuCube features, this work focuses on the potential of spatially-aware traffic variable forecasts, as well as on the exploration of the spatio-temporal relationships among different sensor locations within a traffic network. Its performance, assessed over real traffic data collected in 51 locations in the center of Madrid (Spain), is superior to that of other machine learning techniques in terms of forecasting accuracy. Moreover, we discuss on the interactions and relationships among sensors of the network provided by Neucube, which may provide valuable insights on the traffic dynamics of the city under study towards enhancing its management.

Therefore, this work presents the implementation of a BCI system, coupled to a robotic hand orthosis and driven by hand motor imagery of healthy subjects and the paralysed hand of stroke patients. A novel processing stage was designed using a bank of temporal filters, the common spatial pattern algorithm for feature extraction and particle swarm optimisation for feature selection. Offline tests were performed for testing the proposed processing stage, and results were compared with those computed with common spatial patterns. Afterwards, online tests with healthy subjects were performed in which the orthosis was activated by the system. Stroke patients' average performance was 74.1 +/- 11%. For 4 out of 6 patients, the proposed method showed a statistically significant higher performance than the common spatial pattern method. Healthy subjects' average offline and online performances were of 76.2 +/- 7.6% and 70 +/- 6.7, respectively. For 3 out of 8 healthy subjects, the proposed method showed a statistically significant higher performance than the common spatial pattern method. System's performance showed that it has a potential to be used for hand rehabilitation of stroke patients.

Mohd			EEG-based biometric authentication modelling using incremental fuzzy-rough nearest neighbour technique	IET BIOMETRICS			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION	This paper proposes an Incremental Fuzzy-Rough Nearest Neighbour (IncFRNN) technique for biometric authentication modelling using feature extracted visual evoked. Only small training set is needed for model initialisation. The embedded heuristic update method adjusts the knowledge granules incrementally to maintain all representative electroencephalogram (EEG) signal patterns and eliminate those rarely used. It reshapes the personalized knowledge granules through insertion and deletion of a test object, based on similarity measures. A predefined window size can be used to reduce the overall processing time. This proposed algorithm was verified with test data from 37 healthy subjects. Signal pre-processing steps on segmentation, filtering and artefact rejection were carried out to improve the data quality before model building. The experimental paradigm was designed in three different conditions to evaluate the authentication performance of the IncFRNN technique against the benchmarked incremental K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) technique. The performance was measured in terms of accuracy, area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and Cohen's Kappa coefficient. The proposed IncFRNN technique is proven to be statistically better than the KNN technique in the controlled window size environment. Future work will focus on the use of dynamic data features to improve the robustness of the proposed model.	[Liew, Siaw-Hong; Choo, Yun-Huoy; Yusoh, Zeratul I.

Kuefner and colleagues used electrophysiological results to suggest that the composite face effect is driven solely by perceptual factors. Two limitations of their approach are (a) it did not involve behavioral measures of perceptual sensitivity or bias, and (b) it is unclear how the measures used in that study are consistent with other measures of perceptual and decisional processing. Eight observers completed three tasks involving the stimuli used by Kuefner et al.. The first was a direct replication. The second was a complete identification task, associated with the perceptual and decisional distinctions formalized in general recognition theory. The third was an implementation of the Eriksen flanker task, which allows for a pattern of results that have been interpreted in terms of perceptual and decisional influences. While the empirical distinctions used by Kuefner et al. were not consistent with either the EEG data from the other tasks or the established behavioral measures of perceptual sensitivity and decisional bias, the inferences drawn from the EEG and behavioral data from those tasks were consistent with one another, underscoring the importance of converging operations.

Despite this success, their implementations as part of implantable or wearable devices are still limited. These works are mainly based on heavily handcrafted feature extraction, which is computationally expensive and is shown to be data set specific. These issues greatly limit the applicability of such methods to hardware implementation, including in-silicon implementations such as application specific integrated circuits. In this paper, we propose an integer convolutional neural network (CNN) implementation, Integer-Net, as a memory-efficient unified hardware-friendly CNN framework. The performance of Integer-Net is evaluated with multiple time-series data sets consisting of intracranial and scalp electroencephalogram (EEC) signals. Integer-Net shows a consistent seizure detection performance across three data sets: Freiburg Hospital intracranial EEG data set, Children's Hospital of Boston-MIT scalp EEG data set, and UPenn and Mayo Clinic's seizure detection data set. Our experimental results show that a 4-bit Integer-Net leads to only 2% drop of accuracy compared with a 32-bit real-value resolution CNN model, while offering more than 7 times improvement in memory efficiency. We discuss the structure of the integer convolution to improve the computational gain and reduce the inference time that are crucial for real-time application.

This necessitates fast and reliable decoding of brain signals which mandate feature selection to play a crucial role. The literature discloses the improvement in performance of left/right motor imagery signal classification with many-objective feature selection where several classification performance metrics have been maximized for obtaining a good quality feature set. This work analyses the classification performance by varying the feature dimension and number of objectives. A recent many-objective optimization coupled with objective reduction algorithm viz. alpha-DEMO has been used for modeling the feature selection as an optimization problem with six objectives. The results obtained in this work have been statistically validated by Friedman Test.

Hemispheric asymmetries in rapid temporal processing at age 7 predict subsequent phonemic decoding 2 years later: A longitudinal event-related potential (ERP) study	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Tb; Asymmetric sampling in time; Temporal integration; Hemispheric asymmetry; Event-related potential; Auditory processing; Phonemic decoding; Children	AUDITORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; CLINICAL-APPLICATION; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; SYSTEM ACTIVITY; YOUNG-CHILDREN; T-COMPLEX; MATURATION; LANGUAGE; SPECIALIZATION; INTEGRATION	The asymmetric sampling in time hypothesis (AST) suggests that the left and right secondary auditory areas process auditory stimuli according to different sampling rates (Poeppel, 2003). We investigated whether asymmetries consistent with the AST are observable in children at age 7 and whether they become more pronounced at age 9. Data were collected from 50 children who attended a 2-day research program at age 7 and were followed up 2 years later. At both time points, children were presented with tone-pairs, each composed of two 50 ms, 1000 Hz, sinusoidal tones separated by inter-stimulus intervals (ISIS) of 25, 50, 100, or 200 ms. Stimuli were presented binaurally whilst the EEG was recorded. The Ta and Tb, which are components of the auditory event-related potential (ERP), were used as electrophysiological indices of auditory processing. There was no significant effect of age on Ta or Tb responses. Tb responses to the second tone of tone-pairs indicated a left-hemisphere preference for rapidly presented stimuli (50 ms ISI) and a right hemisphere preference for more slowly presented stimuli (100 and 200 ms ISI). The results provide evidence that auditory areas of the left hemisphere preferentially respond to fast temporal rates, and those of the right hemisphere preferentially respond to slow temporal rates in children at age 7 and 9. In 7-year-old children, leftward lateralisation of responses to rapidly presented tones predicted better phonemic decoding ability 2 years later, which suggests that hemispheric specialisation may be a precursor for subsequent phonemic decoding skills.

Nevertheless, few studies have been dedicated to quantify brain pattern changes and correlate them with motor characteristics in CP children. In this context, it is very important to identify feasible and complementary tools able to enrich the description of motor impairments by considering their neural correlates. To this aim, we recorded the electroencephalographic activity and the corresponding event-related desynchronization (ERD) of a group of mild-to-moderate affected unilateral CP children while performing unilateral reach-to-grasp movements with both their paretic and non-paretic arms. During paretic arm movement execution, we found a reduced ERD in the upper A mu band (10-12.5 Hz) over central electrodes, preceded by an increased fronto-central ERD in the lower A mu band (7.5-10 Hz) during movement preparation. These changes positively correlated, respectively, with the Modified House Classification scale and the Manual Ability Classification System. The fronto-central activation likely represents an ipsilesional plastic compensatory reorganization, confirming that in not-severely affected CP, the lesioned hemisphere is able to compensate part of the damage effects. These results highlight the importance of analyzing different sub-bands within the classical mu band and suggest that in similar CP population, the lesioned hemisphere should be the target of specific intensive rehabilitation programs.

Signals derived from this relation can also be harnessed to control external devices for Brain Computer Interface (BCI) applications. While the classic event-related potential (ERP) is appropriate for isolated stimuli, more sophisticated "decoding" strategies are needed to address continuous stimuli such as speech, music or environmental sounds. Here we describe an approach based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) that finds the optimal transform to apply to both the stimulus and the response to reveal correlations between the two. Compared to prior methods based on forward or backward models for stimulus-response mapping, CCA finds significantly higher correlation scores, thus providing increased sensitivity to relatively small effects, and supports classifier schemes that yield higher classification scores. CCA strips the brain response of variance unrelated to the stimulus, and the stimulus representation of variance that does not affect the response, and thus improves observations of the relation between stimulus and response.

J	Kalgotra, P; Sharda, R				Kalgotra, Pankush; Sharda, Ramesh			BIARAM: A process for analyzing correlated brain regions using association rule mining	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Association rule mining; Interruptions; Electroencephalogram (EEG); Neuroimaging	NETWORK ANALYSIS; EEG; ACTIVATION; RESOLUTION; CLASSIFICATION; DISCOVERY; PATTERNS; IMAGES; MEMORY	Background and objective: Because examining correlated (vs. individual) brain activity is a superior method for locating neural correlates of a stimulus, using a network approach for analyzing brain activity is gaining interest. In this study, we propose and illustrate the use of association rule mining (ARM) to analyze brain regions that are activated simultaneously. ARM is commonly used in marketing and other disciplines to help determine items that might be purchased together. We apply this technique toward identifying correlated brain regions that may respond simultaneously to specific stimuli. Our objective is to introduce ARM, describe a process for converting neural images into viable datasets (for analyses), and suggest how to apply this process for generating insights about the brain's responses to specific stimuli (e.g. technology-associated interruptions). Methods: We analyze electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected from 46 participants; convert brain waves into images via a source localization algorithm known as sLORETA (i.e., standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography); reorganize these into a "transactional" dataset; and generate association rules through ARM. Results: We compare the results with more conventional methods for analyzing neuroimaging data. We show that there is a stronger correlation between frontal lobe and sublobar/insula regions after interruptions. This result would not be obvious from independent analysis of each region. Conclusions: The main contribution of this paper is introducing ARM as a method for analyzing multiple images. We suggest that the biomedical community may apply this commonly available data mining technique to develop further insights about correlated regions affected by specific stimuli.

It is classified under movement disorder as patients with PD present with tremor, rigidity, postural changes, and a decrease in spontaneous movements. Comorbidities including anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep disorders are observed prior to the diagnosis of PD. Gene mutations, exposure to toxic substances, and aging are considered as the causative factors of PD even though its genesis is unknown. This paper reviews PD etiologies, progression, and in particular measurable indicators of PD such as neuroimaging and electrophysiology modalities. In addition to gene therapy, neuroprotective, pharmacological, and neural transplantation treatments, researchers are actively aiming at identifying biological markers of PD with the goal of early diagnosis. Neuroimaging modalities used together with advanced machine learning techniques offer a promising path for the early detection and intervention in PD patients.

The BCI system is based on the concept of somatosensory attentional orientation (SAO), in which the user shifts and maintains somatosensory attention by imagining the sensation of tactile stimulation of a body part. At the beginning of every trial, a vibration stimulus (200 ms) informed the subjects to prepare for the task. Four SAO tasks were performed following randomly presented cues: SAO of the left hand (SAO-LF), SAO of the right hand (SAO-RT), bilateral SAO (SAO-BI), and SAO suppressed or idle state (SAO-ID). Analysis of the event-related desynchronization and synchronization (ERD/ERS) in the EEG indicated that the four SAO tasks had different somatosensory cortical activation patterns. SAO-LF and SAO-RT exhibited stronger contralateral ERD, whereas bilateral ERD activation was indicative of SAO-BI, and bilateral ERS activation was associated with SAO-ID. By selecting the frequency bands and/or optimal classes, classification accuracy of the system reached 85.2% +/- 11.2% for two classes, 69.5% +/- 16.2% for three classes, and 55.9% +/- 15.8% for four classes. The results validated a multiclass BCI system based on SAO, on a single trial basis. Somatosensory attention to different body parts induces diverse oscillatory dynamics within the somatosensory area of the brain, and the proposed SAO paradigm provided a new approach for a multiple-class BCI that is potentially stimulus independent.

Consistent with this view, both the locus of attention and positions stored in working memory can be decoded based on the topography of oscillatory alpha-band (8-12 Hz) activity on the scalp. Thus far, however, alpha modulation has been studied in isolation for covert attention and working memory tasks. Here, we applied an inverted spatial encoding model in combination with EEG to study the temporal dynamics of spatially specific alpha activity during a task that required observers to visually select a target location while maintaining another independently varying location in working memory. During the memory delay period, alpha-based spatial tuning functions shifted from the position stored in working memory to the covertly attended position and back again after the attention task was completed. The findings provide further evidence for a common oscillatory mechanism in both the selection and the maintenance of relevant spatial visual information and demonstrate the dynamic trade-off in prioritization between two spatial tasks.

Scoring by visual inspection is time-consuming and heavily depends on the experience of experts. Thus, there is an urgent need for an automatic sleep stage classification system. This paper proposes a novel compact convolutional neural network (C-CNN) using only single-channel EEG signal. Compared with traditional machine learning approaches based on hand-engineered features, our approach provides an end-to-end solution that requires almost no prior knowledge and preprocessing while achieving better performance. Experiments on the expanded Sleep-EDF database verified its effectiveness and efficiency. In addition, we notice the issue of class imbalance in sleep stages, and a class-imbalance metric, the balanced classification accuracy (BCA), is introduced. At the cost of a little drop in accuracy, which is still higher than existing classification methods, the introduction of class-imbalance weights can significantly increase the BCA metric and result in a higher recall for each sleep stage. This paper also proposes a recurrent neural network based on the attention mechanism and bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM), which provides better performance than C-CNN but requires more training time.

The positive LEP-pain relationship lays the foundation for pain prediction based on single-trial LEP, but cross-individual pain prediction does not have a good performance because the LEP-pain relationship exhibits substantial cross-individual difference. In this study, we aim to explain the cross-individual difference in the LEP-pain relationship using inter-stimulus EEG (isEEG) features. The isEEG features (root mean square as magnitude and mean square successive difference as temporal variability) were estimated from isEEG data (at full band and five frequency bands) recorded between painful stimuli. A linear model was fitted to investigate the relationship between pain ratings and LEP response for fast-pain trials on a trial-by-trial basis. Then the correlation between isEEG features and the parameters of LEP-pain model (slope and intercept) was evaluated. We found that the magnitude and temporal variability of isEEG could modulate the parameters of an individual's linear LEP-pain model for fast-pain trials. Based on this, we further developed a new individualized fast-pain prediction scheme, which only used training individuals with similar isEEG features as the test individual to train the fast-pain prediction model, and obtained improved accuracy in cross-individual fast-pain prediction. The findings could help elucidate the neural mechanism of cross-individual difference in pain experience and the proposed fast-pain prediction scheme could be potentially used as a practical and feasible pain prediction method in clinical practice.

It has been an open question, whether the capability of mediotemporal structures to react to stimulus presentation with phase shifts may be similarly indicative of successful memory formation. We analysed data from 27 epilepsy patients implanted with depth electrodes in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, who performed a continuous word recognition task. Electroencephalographic phase information related to the first presentation of repeatedly presented words was used for prediction of subsequent remembering vs. forgetting applying a support vector machine. The capability to predict successful memory formation based on stimulus-related phase shifts was compared to that based on absolute phase values. Average hippocampal phase shifts were larger and rhinal phase shifts were more accumulated for later remembered compared to forgotten trials. Nevertheless, prediction based on absolute phase values clearly outperformed phase shifts and there was no significant increase in prediction accuracies when combining both measures. Our findings indicate that absolute rhinal and hippocampal phases and not stimulus-related phase shifts are most relevant for successful memory formation. Absolute phases possibly affect memory formation via influencing neural membrane potentials and thereby controlling the timing of neural firing.

J	Goshvarpour, A; Goshvarpour, A				Goshvarpour, Atefeh; Goshvarpour, Ateke			Automatic EEG classification during rapid serial visual presentation task by a novel method based on dual-tree complex wavelet transform and Poincare plot indices	BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS			English	Article						rapid serial visual presentation; electroencephalogram; dual-tree complex wavelet transform; poincare plot; classification; feature selection		Nowadays, brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are designed to do the desired action only by analyzing brain signals. Taking the advantages of computers, these systems have higher reliability and speed than conventional mankind approaches. In a typical BCI system, the stimulation is applied and at the same time, the participants' brain signals are recorded. The system then performs the desired action by decoding the brain responses. One of the most important stimuli is a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). This study dealt with the problem of automatic classification of the target/non-target images with different presentation rates at RSVP events using electroencephalogram (EEG) data. In the present work, we propose a combined dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) and Poincare plot indices to robustly characterize and classify EEG responses elicited during an RSVP experiment. Additionally, a robust classification scheme was developed by taking advantage of feature selection algorithms and a probabilistic neural network (PNN). The features were classified into six categories, including target/non-target events displayed at the rate of 5 Hz (C1/C2), target/non-target events displayed at the rate of 6 Hz (C3/C4), and target/non-target events displayed at the rate of 10 Hz (C5/C6) using one vs. all strategy. The framework was evaluated using EEG time-series from an RSVP task database available at Physionet. The data were collected from eight channels while target and non target pictures were shown in different displaying rates, including 5, 6, and 10 Hz. The results showed the robust maximum average classification rates in the range of 81.5 to 83.33% for all feature selection strategies. In conclusion, the proposed framework paved the way for designing a reliable BCI system for target detection and classification.

To investigate whether physical activity can diminish this aging-induced effect, mice of three age groups were provided with a running wheel (RW) for 1-3 months (6-months-old, n = 9; 18-months-old, n = 9; 24-months-old, n = 8) and were compared with control sedentary mice (n = 11, n = 8 and n = 9 respectively). Two weeks before the sleep-wake recordings the running wheels were removed. The electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram were continuously recorded during undisturbed 24 h baseline (BL) and a sleep-deprivation was conducted during the first 6 h of the second day. Increased waking and decreased NREM sleep was found in the young RW mice, compared to young controls. These effects were not evident in the 18 and 24 months old mice. Unlike sleep architecture, we found that SWA was altered throughout the whole age spectrum. Notably, SWA was increased with aging and attenuated with exercise, exhibiting the lowest levels in the young RW mice. To utilize the cross-age revealing features of SWA, we applied machine learning techniques and found that characteristic information regarding age and exercise was enclosed in SWA. In addition, with cluster analysis, we could classify and accurately distinguish the different groups based solely on their SWA. Therefore, our study comprises a three-fold contribution: (a) effects of exercise on sleep are sustained following 2 weeks after removal of the wheel, (b) we show that EEG SWA can be used as a physiological marker of brain age in the mouse, (c) long-term voluntary regular age-matched exercise leads to a younger phenotype.

Charles			Effects of stereoscopic disparity on early ERP components during classification of three-dimensional objects	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						3D shape perception; global configuration; local part structure; evoked potentials; ERP	VISUAL RECOGNITION; REAL CONTOURS; ORIENTATION; PERCEPTION; DEPTH; POTENTIALS; AREAS; VIEWS; REPRESENTATIONS; ORGANIZATION	This study investigates the effects of stereo disparity on the perception of three-dimensional (3D) object shape. We tested the hypothesis that stereo input modulates the brain activity related to perceptual analyses of 3D shape configuration during image classification. High-density (256-channel) electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to record the temporal dynamics of visual shape processing under conditions of two-dimensional (2D) and 3D visual presentation. On each trial, observers made image classification judgements (Same'/'Different') to two briefly presented, multi-part, novel objects. On different-object trials, stimuli could either share volumetric parts but not the global 3D shape configuration and have different parts but the same global 3D shape configuration or differ on both aspects. Analyses using mass univariate contrasts showed that the earliest sensitivity to 2D versus 3D viewing appeared as a negative deflection over posterior locations on the N1 component between 160 and 220 ms post-stimulus onset. Subsequently, event-related potential (ERP) modulations during the N2 time window between 240 and 370 ms were linked to image classification. N2 activity reflected two distinct components - an early N2 (240-290 ms) and a late N2 (290-370 ms) - that showed different patterns of responses to 2D and 3D input and differential sensitivity to 3D object structure. The results revealed that stereo input modulates the neural correlates of 3D object shape. We suggest that this reflects differential perceptual processing of object shape under conditions of stereo or mono input. These findings challenge current theories that attribute no functional role for stereo input during 3D shape perception.

P300 based BCI systems have been extensively used to achieve human-machine interaction. However, the appearance of fatigue symptoms during operation process leads to the decline in classification accuracy of P300. Characterizing brain cognitive process underlying normal and fatigue conditions constitutes a problem of vital importance in the field of brain science. We in this paper propose a novel wavelet decomposition based complex network method to efficiently analyze the P300 signals recorded in the image stimulus test based on classical 'Oddball' paradigm. Initially, multichannel EEG signals are decomposed into wavelet coefficient series. Then we construct complex network by treating electrodes as nodes and determining the connections according to the 2-norm distances between wavelet coefficient series. The analysis of topological structure and statistical index indicates that the properties of brain network demonstrate significant distinctions between normal status and fatigue status. More specifically, the brain network reconfiguration in response to the cognitive task in fatigue status is reflected as the enhancement of the small-worldness. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, Alpha would inhibit irrelevant stimuli, and Theta underlies working memory and processing. The balance between them seems essential for the word recognition, therefore evaluating the listening effort experienced by hearing impaired patients appears worthy, since noise/distortions in a speech signal increase listening effort. Aim of the study was the estimation of the effort during word in noise recognition under different noise conditions, and along the task. Results showed an increase in the frontal Theta and parietal Alpha for a difficult (but not the most difficult) noise condition, and for Theta in correspondence of the stimulus. Additionally, frontal Theta activity increased along the task for the same difficult noise condition during and after the stimulus. This evaluation was preliminary for a neurofeedback application of the effort management by CI users, since it could affect performances and attitudes. Such assessment appears extremely worthy of investigation since the symbiotic interaction between cochlear implant devices and deaf patients for the decoding and processing of the incoming auditory signal.

Here, we present the first comparison of dynamic neural processing as assessed by gustatory evoked potentials in obese and lean individuals. Two supra-threshold concentrations of sweet and salty tastants as well as two sizes of blue and green squares were presented to 30 lean (BMI 18.5-25) and 25 obese (BMI > 30) individuals while recording head-surface electroencephalogram (EEG). Multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) revealed differential taste quality representations from 130 ms until after stimulus offset. Notably, taste representations faded earlier and exhibited a reduced strength in the obese compared to the lean group; temporal generalization analysis indicated otherwise similar taste processing. Differences in later gustatory response patterns even allowed decoding of group membership. Importantly, group differences were absent for visual processing thereby excluding confounding effects from anatomy or signal-to-noise ratio alone. The latency of observed effects is consistent with memory maintenance rather than sensory encoding of taste, thereby suggesting that later evaluative aspects of taste processing are altered in obesity.

Multiple methods have been proposed in order to improve the recognition of human intentions. Moreover, current brain-computer interfaces are limited in the identification of human errors by manual tuning of parameters (e.g. feature/channel selection), thus selecting fronto-central channels as discriminative features within-subject. In this paper, we propose the inclusion of error-related potential activity as a generalized two-dimensional feature set and a Convolutional Neural Network for classification of EEG-based human error detection. We evaluate this pipeline using the BNCI2020 - Monitoring Error-Related Potential dataset obtaining a maximum error detection accuracy of 79.8% in a within-session 10-fold cross-validation modality, and outperforming current state of the art.

Bearing this in mind, we investigated non-linear magnetoencephalography (MEG) patterns in BD and MD. Methods: Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC) was used to evaluate the resting-state MEG activity in a cross-sectional sample of 60 subjects, including 20 patients with MD, 16 patients with BD type-I, and 24 control (CON) subjects. Particular attention was paid to the role of age. The results were aggregated by scalp region. Results: Overall, MD patients showed significantly higher LZC scores than BD patients and CONs. Linear regression analyses demonstrated distinct tendencies of complexity progression as a function of age, with BD patients showing a divergent tendency as compared with MD and CON groups. Logistic regressions confirmed such distinct relationship with age, which allowed the classification of diagnostic groups. Conclusions: The patterns of neural complexity in BD and MD showed not only quantitative differences in their non-linear MEG characteristics but also divergent trajectories of progression as a function of age. Moreover, neural complexity patterns in BD patients resembled those previously observed in schizophrenia, thus supporting preceding evidence of common neuropathological processes.

Why? Theoretical models predict that environmental risks shift the cost-benefit trade-off associated with the exploitation of others' behaviours (public information), yet this idea has received little empirical support. Using computational analyses of behaviour and multivariate decoding of electroencephalographic activity, we test the hypothesis that perceived vulnerability to extrinsic morbidity risks impacts susceptibility to social influence, and investigate whether and how this covariation is reflected in the brain. Data collected from 261 participants tested online revealed that perceived vulnerability to extrinsic morbidity risks is positively associated with susceptibility to follow peers' opinion in the context of a standard face evaluation task. We found similar results on 17 participants tested in the laboratory, and showed that the sensitivity of EEG signals to public information correlates with the participants' degree of vulnerability. We further demonstrated that the combination of perceived vulnerability to extrinsic morbidity with decoding sensitivities better predicted social influence scores than each variable taken in isolation. These findings suggest that susceptibility to social influence is partly calibrated by perceived environmental risks, possibly via a tuning of neural mechanisms involved in the processing of public information.

Suitable time-frequency (TF) and time-scale (TS) representations of such signals are reviewed for these purposes, and, the relationships between such TF and TS signal transformations is discussed. Both linear (atomic) decompositions and quadratic distributions are considered as well as other related methods such as fractional Fourier transform, polynomial Wigner-Ville distributions and time-varying order spectra. Current state-of-the-art methods are reviewed, and new results are presented including extensions of existing methods. Machine learning methodologies using TF/TS features can result in the design of systems that improve the classification of non-stationary signals. Using selected TF distributions (TFDs) and TS distributions (TSDs), the extraction of such TF/TS features is demonstrated on multi-channel recordings using channel fusion or feature fusion approaches. Extending the findings of previous studies, a TF/TS feature set is formed by including two complementary categories: signal related features and image features. The design of high-resolution TF/TS algorithms is then refined to account for issues of accuracy and robustness. Then, the desired TF/TS features are selected using different feature selection algorithms and compared with respect to the classification performance. Finally, other features from related methods are added, and comparisons performed. Improvements of up to 5% are obtained when using the chosen feature set after wrapper feature selection with channel feature fusion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Transdiagnostic Symptom Clusters and Associations With Brain, Behavior, and Daily Function in Mood, Anxiety, and Trauma Disorders	JAMA PSYCHIATRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	56th Annual Meeting of the American-College-of-Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP) and Cognitive-Neuroscience-Society	DEC 03-07, 2017	Palm Springs, CA	Amer Coll Neuropsychopharmacol, Cognit Neuroscience Soc			MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; EEG ALPHA ASYMMETRY; DSM-IV; 1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; MELANCHOLIC DEPRESSION; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; BIPOLAR DISORDER; COMORBIDITY; CRITERIA; SUBTYPES	IMPORTANCE The symptoms that define mood, anxiety, and trauma disorders are highly overlapping across disorders and heterogeneous within disorders. It is unknown whether coherent subtypes exist that span multiple diagnoses and are expressed functionally (in underlying cognition and brain function) and clinically (in daily function). The identification of cohesive subtypes would help disentangle the symptom overlap in our current diagnoses and serve as a tool for tailoring treatment choices. OBJECTIVE To propose and demonstrate 1 approach for identifying subtypes within a transdiagnostic sample. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study analyzed data from the Brain Research and Integrative Neuroscience Network Foundation Database that had been collected at the University of Sydney and University of Adelaide between 2006 and 2010 and replicated at Stanford University between 2013 and 2017. The study included 420 individuals with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder (n = 100), panic disorder (n = 53), posttraumatic stress disorder (n = 47), or no disorder (healthy control participants) (n = 220). Data were analyzed between October 2016 and October 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We followed a data-driven approach to achieve the primary study outcome of identifying transdiagnostic subtypes. First, machine learning with a hierarchical clustering algorithm was implemented to classify participants based on self-reported negative mood, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Second, the robustness and generalizability of the subtypes were tested in an independent sample. Third, we assessed whether symptom subtypes were expressed at behavioral and physiological levels of functioning. Fourth, we evaluated the clinically meaningful differences in functional capacity of the subtypes. Findings were interpreted relative to a complementary diagnostic frame of reference. RESULTS Four hundred twenty participants with a mean (SD) age of 39.8 (14.1) years were included in the final analysis; 256 (61.0%) were female. We identified 6 distinct subtypes characterized by tension (n=81; 19%), anxious arousal (n=55; 13%), general anxiety (n=38; 9%), anhedonia (n=29; 7%), melancholia (n=37; 9%), and normative mood (n=180; 43%), and these subtypes were replicated in an independent sample. Subtypes were expressed through differences in cognitive control (F-5,F-383 = 5.13, P < .001, eta(2)(p) = 0.063), working memory (F-5,F-401 = 3.29, P = .006, eta(2)(p) = 0.039), electroencephalography-recorded beta power in a resting paradigm (F-5,F-357 = 3.84, P = .002, eta(2)(p) = 0.051), electroencephalography-recorded beta power in an emotional paradigm (F-5,F-365 = 3.56, P = .004, eta(2)(p) = 0.047), social functional capacity (F-5,F-414 = 21.33, P < .001, eta(2)(p) = 0.205), and emotional resilience (F-5,F-376 = 15.10, P < .001, eta(2)(p) = 0.171). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings offer a data-driven framework for identifying robust subtypes that signify specific, coherent, meaningful associations between symptoms, behavior, brain function, and observable real-world function, and that cut across DSM-IV-defined diagnoses of major depressive disorder, panic disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder.

Feature fusion technology significantly helps to incorporate such information to provide promising algorithm performance. In this Letter, a fusion-based model with the aid of discriminant correlation analysis to classify electroencephalogram signals is proposed. Sets of multiple feature matrices are generated from signals in both time and wavelet domains for study-specific classes, which are further decomposed to derive a set of sub-multi-view features followed by optimisation to extract statistical features. Features are concatenated using feature fusion technique to derive low order discriminant features. Besides, the analysis of variance was also performed to validate the analysis. The statistically significant features are evaluated for the effective model performance. Experimental results manifest that the proposed feature fusion based algorithm is superior to many state-of-the-art methods and thus promote real-time implementation.

Design Guidelines for Rigorous BCI Experiments	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES HANDBOOK: TECHNOLOGICAL AND THEORETICAL ADVANCES			English	Article; Book Chapter							BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACES; REAL-TIME FMRI; NEUROFEEDBACK; EEG; CLASSIFICATION; VALENCE; EMG	Designing brain-computer interface (BCI) experiments requires knowledge in many different disciplines: from neurosciences to signal processing and machine learning, through psychology. However, very few people have skills in all these disciplines. Yet, a lack of knowledge in a single aspect of BCIs is likely to result in flaws in the experimental design, statistical analyses, or the interpretation of the results. Moreover, because the BCI field is relatively young, no widely accepted guidelines are available yet, while at the same time an exponentially increasing number of research teams contribute to this field and would benefit from such guidelines. Thus, the objective of this chapter is to propose, in a pedagogical way, step-by-step guidance to design a rigorous BCI experiment. We name potential pitfalls and explain how to avoid them using concrete examples. This chapter could be seen as a checklist of points that should be addressed when the aim is to design rigorous and scientifically valid BCI studies and experiments. It is structured into three categories: (1) the acquisition of brain signals, (2) data processing issues, and (3) the experimental design and consideration of the BCI user.

However, robust evidence for the human brain ability to automatically detect brief and subtle changes of facial expression remains limited. Here we built on a recently developed paradigm in human electrophysiology with full-blown expressions (Dzhelyova et al., 2017), to isolate and quantify a neural marker for the detection of brief and subtle changes of facial expression. Scalp electroencephalogram(EEG) was recorded from 18 participants during stimulation of a neutral face changing randomly in size at a rapid rate of 6 Hz. Brief changes of expression appeared every five stimulation cycle(i.e., at 1.2 Hz) and expression intensity increased parametrically every 20 s in 20% steps during sweep sequences of 100 s. A significant 1.2 Hz response emerged in the EEG spectrum already at 40% of facial expression-change intensity for most of the 5 emotions tested(anger, disgust, fear, happiness, or sadness in different sequences), and increased with intensity steps, predominantly over right occipito-temporal regions. Given the high signal-to-noise ratio of the approach, thresholds for automatic detection of brief changes of facial expression could be determined for every single individual brain. A time-domain analysis revealed three components, the two first increasing linearly with increasing intensity as early as 100 ms after a change of expression, suggesting gradual low-level image-change detection prior to visual coding of facial movements. In contrast, the third component showed abrupt sensitivity to increasing expression intensity beyond 300 ms post expression-change, suggesting categorical emotion perception. Overall, this characterization of the detection of subtle changes of facial expression and its temporal dynamics open promising tracks for precise assessment of social perception ability during development and in clinical populations.

If, however, patients with epilepsy complain about unrestful sleep or an increased incidence of nocturnal epileptic seizures, it is necessary to search for potential comorbidities that might either reduce the recreational value of sleep independent of epilepsy or trigger an increased incidence of nocturnal seizures through specific arousal. Additionally, it must not be disregarded that various antiepileptic drugs may cause side effects that can reduce sleep quality or cause symptoms of unrestful sleep, such as daytime drowsiness, concentration impairments or mood swings. Despite a thorough patient anamnesis and third party reports, the diagnostic classification of nocturnal movement sequences and the clarification of possible causal relationships are often only achievable with the help of specific diagnostic procedures, such as polysomnographic examinations in a sleep laboratory or with the use of a video electroencephalogram (EEG) long-term monitoring. The aim of this review article is to present the clinically relevant sleep-related movement disorders with a view to the differential diagnostics and to demarcate the most common causes of specific arousal in sleep.

We developed a task in which subjects have continuous control of a cursor's position by means of a joystick. The cursor's position was shown to the participants in two different modalities of continuous feedback: normal and jittered. The jittered feedback was created to mimic the instability that could exist if participants controlled the trajectory directly with brain signals. Approach. This paper studies the electroencephalographic (EEG)-measurable signatures caused by a loss of control over the cursor's trajectory, causing a target miss. Main results. In both feedback modalities, time-locked potentials revealed the typical frontal-central components of errorrelated potentials. Errors occurring during the jittered feedback (masked errors) were delayed in comparison to errors occurring during normal feedback (unmasked errors). Masked errors displayed lower peak amplitudes than unmasked errors. Time-locked classification analysis allowed a good distinction between correct and error classes (average Cohen-kappa = 0.803, average TPR = 81.8% and average TNR = 96.4%). Time-locked classification analysis between masked error and unmasked error classes revealed results at chance level (average Cohen-kappa = 0.189, average TPR = 60.9% and average TNR = 58.3%). Afterwards, we performed asynchronous detection of ErrPs, combining both masked and unmasked trials. The asynchronous detection of ErrPs in a simulated online scenario resulted in an average TNR of 84.0% and in an average TPR of 64.9%. Significance. The time-locked classification results suggest that the masked and unmasked errors were indistinguishable in terms of classification. The asynchronous classification results suggest that the feedback modality did not hinder the asynchronous detection of ErrPs.

As a relatively new noninvasive clinical recording system, magnetoencephalography (MEG) has rarely been applied for determining lateralization of unilateral TLE. Here we propose a framework for using resting-state brain-network features and support vector machine (SVM) for TLE lateralization based on MEG. We recruited 15 patients with left TLE, 15 patients with right TLE, and 15 age-and sex-matched healthy controls. The lateralization problem was then transferred into a series of binary classification problems, including left TLE versus healthy control, right TLE versus healthy control, and left TLE versus right TLE. Brain-network features were extracted for each participant using three network metrics (nodal degree, betweenness centrality, and nodal efficiency). A radial basis function kernel SVM (RBF-SVM) was employed as the classifier. The leave-one-subject-out cross-validation strategy was used to test the ability of this approach to overcome individual differences. The results revealed that the nodal degree performed best for left TLE versus healthy control and right TLE versus healthy control, with accuracy of 80.76% and 75.00%, respectively. Betweenness centrality performed best for left TLE versus right TLE with an accuracy of 88.10%. The proposed approach demonstrated that MEG is a good candidate for solving the lateralization problem in unilateral TLE using various brain-network features.

Objectives: This study describes and evaluates a novel FEST system designed to incorporate voluntary movement attempts and massed practice of functional grasp through the use of brain-computer interface (BCI) and computer vision (CV) modules. Methods: An EEG-based BCI relying on a single electrode was used to detect movement initiation attempts. A CV system identified the target object and selected the appropriate grasp type. The required grasp type and trigger command were sent to an FES stimulator, which produced one of four multichannel muscle stimulation patterns (precision, lateral, palmar, or lumbrical grasp). The system was evaluated with five neurologically intact participants and one participant with complete cervical SCI. Results: An integrated BCI-CV-FES system was demonstrated. The overall classification accuracy of the CV module was 90.8%, when selecting out of a set of eight objects. The average latency for the BCI module to trigger the movement across all participants was 5.9 +/- 1.5 seconds. For the participant with SCI alone, the CV accuracy was 87.5% and the BCI latency was 5.3 +/- 9.4 seconds. Conclusion: BCI and CV methods can be integrated into an FEST system without the need for costly resources or lengthy setup times. The result is a clinically relevant system designed to promote voluntary movement attempts and more repetitions of varied functional grasps during FEST.

However, the characteristics of the age-related network based on the sleep ECG signal and how the network changes during different sleep stages are poorly understood. This study focuses on exploring the age-related scale-free and small-world network properties of the ECG signal from male subjects during distinct sleep stages, including the wakeful (W), light sleep (LS),deep sleep (DS) and rapid eye movement (REM) stages. Approach: The subjects are divided into two age groups: a younger (age <= 40, n = 11) group and an older group (age > 40, n = 25). Main results: For the scale-free network analysis, our results reveal a distinctive pattern of the scale free network topologies between the two age groups, including the mean degree ((d) over bar), the clustering coefficient ((c) over bar), and the path length ((l) over bar) features, such as the slope distribution of (c) over bar in the younger group increased from 1.99 during W to above 2.05 during DS. In addition, the results indicate that the small-world properties can be found across all sleep stages in both age groups. However, the small-world index in the LS and REM stages significantly decreased with age (p = 0.0006 and p = 0.05, respectively). Significance: The comparison analysis result indicates that the network topology variations in the sleep ECG signals are prone to show age-relevant differences that could be used for sleep stage classification and sleep disorder diagnosis.

Methods: Seventeen patients with uniateral TLE (11 right TLE and 6 left TLE) were retrospectively selected for semi-quantitative F-18-FDG PET analysis. Twenty-three control subjects with a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 29 or greater were selected for comparison. Globally averaged standardized uptake value (gSUVmean) was computed for each temporal lobe. Lateralization indices (LI) and the absolute value of lateralization indices (vertical bar LI vertical bar)were calculated to assess the degree of asymmetry in each subject. Logistic regression analyses were performed at a probability cutoff 0.5 to classify TLE patients as left or right TLE and to discriminate patients from control subjects. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the utility of LI and vertical bar LI vertical bar as classification predictors. The Bland Altman test was used to evaluate the reproducibility of the measurements. Results: There was a statistically significant difference in gSUVmean computed LI between left and right TLE patients (P<0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in vertical bar LI vertical bar between the patient and control groups (P=0.22). Logistic regression revealed that 82% of TLE patients were lateralized correctly using LI as the sole predictor. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.80. Logistic regression using vertical bar LI vertical bar on the combined patient/control population showed a diagnostic accuracy of 65% and an AUC of 0.44. Bland Altman analysis revealed an intra-observer reproducibility of 96% and an inter-observer reproducibility of 96% and 91% on successive trials. Conclusion: We conclude that gSUVmean computed LI is a reliable and reproducible measure for predicting seizure lateralization in unilateral TLE patients. However, gSUVmean computed vertical bar LI vertical bar does not appear to be particularly effective at diagnosing TLE patients from control subjects. Further studies with more patients should investigate other machine learning techniques that combine gSUVmean with other diagnostic predictors	[Peter, Jonah; Khosravi, Mohsen; Werner, Thomas J.; Alavi, Abass] Hosp Univ Penn, Dept Radiol, Div Nucl Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA		Alavi, A (corresponding author), Hosp Univ Penn, Radiol, 3400 Spruce St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.	abass.alavi@uphs.upenn.edu							17	3	3	0	3	HELLENIC SOC NUCLEAR MEDICINE	THESSALONIKI	51 HERMU ST, THESSALONIKI, 546 23, GREECE	1790-5427			HELL J NUCL MED	Hell.

In particular, one behavioural effect of such specialization is that human adults search for and find categories of non-human faces faster and more accurately than a specific non-human face, and vice versa for human faces. However, a recent visual search study showed that neural responses (event-related potentials, ERPs) were identical when finding either a non-human or human face. We used time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis of the EEG data from that study to investigate the dynamics of neural representations during a visual search for own-species (human) or other-species (non-human ape) faces, with greater sensitivity than traditional ERP analyses. The location of each target (i.e., right or left) could be decoded from the EEG, with similar accuracy for human and non-human faces. However, the neural patterns associated with searching for an exemplar versus a category target differed for human faces compared to non-human faces: Exemplar representations could be more reliably distinguished from category representations for human than non-human faces. These findings suggest that the other-species effect modulates the nature of representations, but preserves the attentional selection of target items based on these representations.

However, the inconsistent phases of the SSVEP over channels in a trial and the existence of non-contributing channels due to noise effects can decrease accurate detection of stimulus frequency. New method: We propose a novel command detection method based on a complex sparse spatial filter (CSSF) by solving l(1) - and l(2,1) - regularization problems for a mixed-coded SSVEP-BCI. In particular, l(2,1) - regularization (aka group sparsification) can lead to the rejection of electrodes that are not contributing to the SSVEP detection. Results: A calibration data based canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and CSSF with l(1) - and l(2,1) -regularization cases were demonstrated for a 16-target stimuli with eleven subjects. The results of statistical test suggest that the proposed method with l(1) - and l(2,1)-regularization significantly achieved the highest ITR. Comparison with existing methods: The proposed approaches do not need any reference signals, automatically select prominent channels, and reduce the computational cost compared to the other mixed frequency-phase coding (FPC)-based BCIs. Conclusions: The experimental results suggested that the proposed method can be usable implementing BCI effectively with reduce visual fatigue. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Reducing the Effect of Spurious Phase Variations in Neural Oscillatory Signals	FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						instantaneous phase; spurious phase; Kalman smoother; phase synchronization; phase reset	ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM PHASE; PROPAGATING WAVES; PROPER ESTIMATION; FIELD POTENTIALS; LISTENING EFFORT; BRAIN DYNAMICS; MOTOR CORTEX; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; LOCKING	The phase-reset model of oscillatory EEG activity has received a lot of attention in the last decades for decoding different cognitive processes. Based on this model, the ERPs are assumed to be generated as a result of phase reorganization in ongoing EEG. Alignment of the phase of neuronal activities can be observed within or between different assemblies of neurons across the brain. Phase synchronization has been used to explore and understand perception, attentional binding and considering it in the domain of neuronal correlates of consciousness. The importance of the topic and its vast exploration in different domains of the neuroscience presses the need for appropriate tools and methods for measuring the level of phase synchronization of neuronal activities. Measuring the level of instantaneous phase (IP) synchronization has been used extensively in numerous studies of ERPs as well as oscillatory activity for a better understanding of the underlying cognitive binding with regard to different set of stimulations such as auditory and visual. However, the reliability of results can be challenged as a result of noise artifact in IP. Phase distortion due to environmental noise artifacts as well as different pre-processing steps on signals can lead to generation of artificial phase jumps. One of such effects presented recently is the effect of low envelope on the IP of signal. It has been shown that as the instantaneous envelope of the analytic signal approaches zero, the variations in the phase increase, effectively leading to abrupt transitions in the phase. These abrupt transitions can distort the phase synchronization results as they are not related to any neurophysiological effect. These transitions are called spurious phase variation. In this study, we present a model to remove generated artificial phase variations due to the effect of low envelope. The proposed method is based on a simplified form of a Kalman smoother, that is able to model the IP behavior in narrow-bandpassed oscillatory signals. In this work we first explain the details of the proposed Kalman smoother for modeling the dynamics of the phase variations in narrow-bandpassed signals and then evaluate it on a set of synthetic signals. Finally, we apply the model on ongoing-EEG signals to assess the removal of spurious phase variations.

The activation time course in auditory, somatosensory and motor regions during speech processing is seldom taken into account in models of speech perception. We critically review the literature with a focus on temporal information, and contrast between three alternative models of auditory-motor speech processing: parallel, hierarchical, and interactive. We argue that electrophysiological and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies support the interactive model. The findings reveal that auditory and somatomotor areas are engaged almost simultaneously, before 100 ms. There is also evidence of early interactions between auditory and motor areas. We propose a new interactive model of auditory-motor speech perception in which auditory and articulatory somatomotor areas are connected from early stages of speech processing. We also discuss how attention and other factors can affect the timing and strength of auditory-motor interactions and propose directions for future research.

Spatial frequency supports the emergence of categorical representations in visual cortex during natural scene perception	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA); Representational similarity analysis (RSA); Magnetoencephalography (MEG); Convolutional neural network (CNN); Scene categorization	LEVEL IMAGE PROPERTIES; NEURAL RESPONSE; TIME-COURSE; SELECTIVE REGIONS; PATTERNS; CATEGORIZATION; BRAIN; INFORMATION; EEG; STATISTICS	In navigating our environment, we rapidly process and extract meaning from visual cues. However, the relationship between visual features and categorical representations in natural scene perception is still not well understood. Here, we used natural scene stimuli from different categories and filtered at different spatial frequencies to address this question in a passive viewing paradigm. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA) and cross-decoding of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, we show that categorical representations emerge in human visual cortex at similar to 180 ms and are linked to spatial frequency processing. Furthermore, dorsal and ventral stream areas reveal temporally and spatially overlapping representations of low and high-level layer activations extracted from a feedforward neural network. Our results suggest that neural patterns from extrastriate visual cortex switch from low-level to categorical representations within 200 ms, highlighting the rapid cascade of processing stages essential in human visual perception.

We start by considering the problem of estimating ERP ensemble averages in the time domain. An estimator allowing for weights and time shifts for each trial is discussed. Then we consider spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal multivariate filters for improving the estimation, including principal component analysis, the common spatial pattern and blind source separation. Then, we review time-frequency analysis methods. The reader is provided with definitions in order to understand the most commonly used linear and non-linear measures used in the time-frequency domain. We continue with a brief discussion on the importance of the analysis in the spatial domain, including topographic maps and tomographies. Next, we review procedures for applying inferential statistics to ERP studies. Emphasis is given to procedures based on permutation tests, which account for the multiple comparison problem and adapt to the form and degree of correlation between hypotheses. Finally, we consider the problem of classifying ERP single-trials, pointing to recent literature covering the most promisingmethods currently available, namely, Riemannian geometry, random forests and neural networks.

Automatic two-channel sleep staging using a predictor-corrector method	PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT			English	Article						automatic sleep-staging; predictor-corrector; two-channel sleep measurements; machine learning	RECHTSCHAFFEN; SYSTEM	Objective: We developed and implemented two predictor-corrector methods for the classification of two-channel EEG data into sleep stages. Approach: The sequence of sleep stages over the night is modeled by a Markov chain of first and second order, resulting in an informative prior distribution for the new state, given the distribution of the current one. The correction step is realized by applying a Bayes classifier using the (preprocessed) data and this prior. The preprocessing step consists of a frequency analysis, a log transformation and a dimensionality reduction via principal component analysis. Main results: The software automatically generates sleep profiles in which it detects wakeful phases as well as the different sleep stages with error rates of 16.5%-31.9% (n = 8, healthy subjects, mean age +/- SD: 39 +/- 8.1 years, five females), where we compared our results to those of a certified polysomnographic technologist, who used a full polysomnograph and rated according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) criteria. Significance: The method presented relies on considerably less information than visual scoring and is done automatically. Furthermore, the error is comparable to visual scoring, where the inter-rater variability lies around 82%. Therefore, it has the potential to lessen the overheads associated with sleep diagnostics.

To characterize this processing as it occurs in ecological settings, we focused on unconstrained visual explorations of natural emotional faces (i.e., free eye movements). The General Linear Model (GLM; Smith and Kutas, 2015a, b; Kristensen et al., 2017a) enables such a depiction. It allows deconvolving adjacent overlapping responses of the eye fixation-related potentials (EFRPs) elicited by the subsequent fixations and the event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited at the stimuli onset. Nineteen participants were displayed with spontaneous static facial expressions of emotions (Neutral, Disgust, Surprise, and Happiness) from the DynEmo database (Tcherkassof et al., 2013). Behavioral results on participants' eye movements show that the usual diagnostic features in emotional decoding (eyes for negative facial displays and mouth for positive ones) are consistent with the literature. The impact of emotional category on both the ERPs and the EFRPs elicited by the free exploration of the emotional faces is observed upon the temporal dynamics of the emotional facial expression processing. Regarding the ERP at stimulus onset, there is a significant emotion-dependent modulation of the P2-P3 complex and LPP components' amplitude at the left frontal site for the ERPs computed by averaging. Yet, the GLM reveals the impact of subsequent fixations on the ERPs time-locked on stimulus onset. Results are also in line with the valence hypothesis. The observed differences between the two estimation methods (Average vs. GLM) suggest the predominance of the right hemisphere at the stimulus onset and the implication of the left hemisphere in the processing of the information encoded by subsequent fixations. Concerning the first EFRP, the Lambda response and the P2 component are modulated by the emotion of surprise compared to the neutral emotion, suggesting an impact of high-level factors, in parieto-occipital sites. Moreover, no difference is observed on the second and subsequent EFRP. Taken together, the results stress the significant gain obtained in analyzing the EFRPs using the GLM method and pave the way toward efficient ecological emotional dynamic stimuli analyses.

Violating environmental expectations (e.g., a toothbrush in the fridge) induces a late event-related negativity of the event-related potential/ERP. This N400 ERP has not only been linked to the semantic processing of language, but also to objects and scenes. Inconsistent object-scene relationships are additionally associated with an earlier negative deflection of the EEG signal between 250 and 350 ms. This N300 is hypothesized to reflect pre-semantic perceptual processes. To investigate whether these two components are truly separable or if the early object-scene integration activity (250-350 ms) shares certain levels of processing with the late neural correlates of meaning processing (350-500 ms), we used time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) where a classifier trained at one time point in a trial (e.g., during the N300 time window) is tested at every other time point (i.e., including the N400 time window). Forty participants were presented with semantic inconsistencies, in which an object was inconsistent with a scene's meaning. Replicating previous findings, our manipulation produced significant N300 and N400 deflections. MVPA revealed above chance decoding performance for classifiers trained during time points of the N300 component and tested during later time points of the N400, and vice versa. This provides no evidence for the activation of two separable neurocognitive processes following the violation of context-dependent predictions in visual scene perception. Our data supports the early appearance of high-level, context-sensitive processes in visual cognition.

However, the particularity of train driving often leads to railway drivers more susceptible to drowsiness and fatigue, and this fatigue has a distinct personality. Here, the authors analyse the mechanism of individual fatigue generation of different drivers, and use eye movement data collected by non-contact means as an objective measurement, and combine subjective sleepiness assessment to reveal the existence of individual differences in fatigue in high-speed railway driving. Furthermore, a novel driver-specific feature weighted support vector machine (FWSVM) algorithm is proposed to handle the individual differences. In the FWSVM, features are assigned with different weights by the information gain to reflect classification importance and individual effects. The average accuracy of FWSVM is 90.98%, the average sensitivity is 92.01%, and the average specificity is 89.88%, which is better than the classical SVM. Such improvements are attributed to the quantitative evaluation of individual effects by the weighted features. These results can be used as a preliminary study to design a high-speed rail vehicle interface to prevent driver fatigue.

The whole analysis based on source-reconstructed neuromagnetic activity. As ROI representation, we employed the principal component analysis (PCA) and centroid approaches. As representative bi-variate connectivity estimators for the estimation of intra and cross-frequency interactions, we adopted the phase locking value (PLV), the imaginary part (iPLV) and the correlation of the envelope (CorrEnv). Both intra and cross-frequency interactions (CFC) have been estimated with the three connectivity estimators within the seven frequency bands (intra-frequency) and in pairs (CFC), correspondingly. We demonstrated how different versions of functional connectivity graphs single-layer (SL-FCG) and multi-layer (ML-FCG) can give us a different view of the functional interactions across the brain areas. Finally, we applied machine learning techniques with main scope to build a reliable connectomic biomarker by analyzing both SL-FCG and ML-FCG in two different options: as a whole unit using a tensorial extraction algorithm and as single pair-wise coupling estimations. We concluded that edge-weighed feature selection strategy outperformed the tensorial treatment of SL-FCG and ML-FCG. The highest classification performance was obtained with the centroid ROI representation and edge-weighted analysis of the SL-FCG reaching the 98% for the CorrEnv in a l :012 and 94% for the iPLV in alpha(2). Classification performance based on the multi-layer participation coefficient, a multiplexity index reached 52% for iPLV and 52% for CorrEnv. Selected functional connections that build the multivariate connectomic biomarker in the edge-weighted scenario are located in default-mode, fronto-parietal, and cingulo-opercular network. Our analysis supports the notion of analyzing FCG simultaneously in intra and cross-frequency whole brain interactions with various connectivity estimators in beamformed recordings.

Smart, Secure, Yet Energy-Efficient, Internet-of-Things Sensors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTI-SCALE COMPUTING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Classification; compression; cryptographic techniques; edge computing; encryption and hashing; energy efficiency; inference; Internet-of-Things; machine learning; safety; security; sensor node; smartness	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ECG; DESIGN; SYSTEM; GAIT; TECHNOLOGY; PROCESSOR	The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) has led to the generation of zettabytes of sensitive data each year. The generated data are usually raw, requiring cloud resources for processing and decision-making operations to extract valuable information (i.e., distill smartness). Use of cloud resources raises serious design issues: limited bandwidth, insufficient energy, and security concerns. Edge-side computing and cryptographic techniques have been proposed to get around these problems. However, as a result of increased computational load and energy consumption, it is difficult to simultaneously achieve smartness, security, and energy efficiency. We propose a novel way out of this predicament by employing signal compression and machine learning inference on the IoT sensor node. An important sensor operation scenario is for the sensor to transmit data to the base station immediately when an event of interest occurs, e.g., arrhythmia is detected by a smart electrocardiogram sensor or seizure is detected by a smart electroencephalogram sensor, and transmit data on a less urgent basis otherwise. Since on-sensor compression and inference drastically reduce the amount of data that need to be transmitted, we actually end up with a dramatic energy bonus relative to the traditional sense-and-transmit IoT sensor. We use a part of this energy bonus to carry out encryption and hashing to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. We analyze the effectiveness of this approach on six different IoT applications with two data transmission scenarios: alert notification and continuous notification. The experimental results indicate that relative to the traditional sense-and-transmit sensor, IoT sensor energy is reduced by 57.1x for electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor based arrhythmia detection, 379.8x for freezing of gait detection in the context of Parkinson's disease, 139.7x for electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor based seizure detection, 216.6x for human activity classification, 162.8x for neural prosthesis spike sorting, and 912.6x for chemical gas classification. Our approach not only enables the IoT system to push signal processing and decision-making to the extreme of the edge-side (i.e., the sensor node), but also solves data security and energy efficiency problems simultaneously.

In the cognitive domain, proactive effects of conflicts have widely been studied; i.e. effects of conflicts in the n-1 trial on trial n. Yet, the neurophysiological processes and associated functional neuroanatomical structures underlying such proactive effects during emotional conflicts have not been investigated. This is done in the current study combining EEG recordings with signal decomposition methods and source localization approaches. We show that an emotional conflict in the n-1 trial differentially influences processing of positive and negative emotions in trial n, but not the processing of conflicts in trial n. The dual competition framework stresses the importance of dissociable 'perceptual' and 'response selection' or cognitive control levels for interactive effects of cognition and emotion. Only once these coding levels were isolated in the neurophysiological data, processes explaining the behavioral effects were detectable. The data show that there is not only a close correspondence between theoretical propositions of the dual competition framework and neurophysiological processes. Rather, processing levels conceptualized in the framework operate in overlapping time windows, but are implemented via distinct functional neuroanatomical structures; the precuneus (BA31) and the insula (BA13). It seems that decoding of information in the precuneus, as well as the integration of information during response selection in the insula is more difficult when confronted with angry facial emotions whenever cognitive control resources have been highly taxed by previous conflicts.

This paper proposes a novel asynchronous BCI that uses mixed frequency and phase-coded visual stimuli, which can provide high-speed and accurate command entries. Methods: The mixed-coded visual stimuli were presented as flickers with a following blank interval to synchronize the recorder of electroencephalogram (EEG) with the stimuli, which was aimed to detect the phase in an asynchronous situation. For decoding from the measured EEG, multiset canonical correlation analysis (MCCA) was efficiently exploited for recognizing the intentional state and the intending command. The proposed asynchronous BCI was tested on 11 healthy subjects. Results: The proposed decoder was capable of discriminating between the intentional control/noncontrol state and determining the command faster and more accurately than the contrast methods, achieving area under the curve of 0.9191 +/- 0.1206 and command recognition accuracy of 91.08 +/- 13.97% with data lengths of 3.0 s. Conclusion: The BCI based on mixed-coded visual stimuli was able to be implemented in an asynchronous manner, and the MCCAbased decoder outperformed the conventional ones in terms of discriminability of intentional states and command recognition accuracy. Significance: The present study showed that an asynchronous BCI can be implemented with mixed-coded visual stimuli for the first time, which enables a large increase in the number of choices/commands.

B	Cecotti, H		Tanaka, T; Arvaneh, M		Cecotti, Hubert			Feedforward artificial neural networks for event-related potential detection	SIGNAL PROCESSING AND MACHINE LEARNING FOR BRAIN-MACHINE INTERFACES	IET Control Robotics and Sensors Series		English	Article; Book Chapter							CLASSIFICATION; MODEL; P300	The detection of brain responses at the single-trial level in the electroencephalogram (EEG) such as event-related potentials (ERPs) is a difficult problem that requires different processing steps to extract relevant discriminant features as the input signal is noisy and the brain responses can be different over time. In brain-computer interface, single-trial detection is primarily applied to distinguish the presence of large ERP components such as the P300. Because the characteristics of the P300 can depend on the parameters of the oddball paradigm, the type of stimuli, and as it can vary across subjects and over time during experiments, a reliable classifier must take into account this variability for the detection of the P300. While most of the signal and classification techniques for the detection of brain responses are based on linear algebra, different pattern recognition techniques such as convolutional neural network (CNN), as a type of deep learning technique, have shown some interest as they are able to process the signal after limited preprocessing. In this chapter, we propose to investigate the performance of different feedforward neural networks in relation of their architecture and in relation to how they are evaluated: a single system for each subject or a system for all the subjects. More particularly, we want to address the change of performance that can be observed between specifying a neural network to a subject, or by considering a neural network for a group of subjects, taking advantage of a larger number of trials from different subjects. The results support the conclusion that a CNN trained on different subjects can lead to an AUC above 0.9 by using an appropriate architecture using spatial filtering and shift invariant layers.

Fast gamma activity has been identified as the most specific marker for seizure onset, but conflicting results have been reported. In this study, we describe an alternative marker, based on an objective description of interictal to ictal transition, with the aim of identifying a time-frequency pattern or 'fingerprint' that can differentiate the epileptogenic zone from areas of propagation. Seventeen patients who underwent stereoelectroencephalography were included in the study. Each had seizure onset characterized by sustained gamma activity and were seizure-free after tailored resection or laser ablation. We postulated that the epileptogenic zone was always located inside the resection region based on seizure freedom following surgery. To characterize the ictal frequency pattern, we applied the Morlet wavelet transform to data from each pair of adjacent intracerebral electrode contacts. Based on a visual assessment of the time-frequency plots, we hypothesized that a specific time-frequency pattern in the epileptogenic zone should include a combination of (i) sharp transients or spikes; preceding (ii) multiband fast activity concurrent; with (iii) suppression of lower frequencies. To test this hypothesis, we developed software that automatically extracted each of these features from the time-frequency data. We then used a support vector machine to classify each contact-pair as being within epileptogenic zone or not, based on these features. Our machine learning system identified this pattern in 15 of 17 patients. The total number of identified contacts across all patients was 64, with 58 localized inside the resected area. Subsequent quantitative analysis showed strong correlation between maximum frequency of fast activity and suppression inside the resection but not outside. We did not observe significant discrimination power using only the maximum frequency or the timing of fast activity to differentiate contacts either between resected and non-resected regions or between contacts identified as epileptogenic versus non-epileptogenic. Instead of identifying a single frequency or a single timing trait, we observed the more complex pattern described above that distinguishes the epileptogenic zone. This pattern encompasses interictal to ictal transition and may extend until seizure end. Its time-frequency characteristics can be explained in light of recent models emphasizing the role of fast inhibitory interneurons acting on pyramidal cells as a prominent mechanism in seizure triggering. The pattern clearly differentiates the epileptogenic zone from areas of propagation and, as such, represents an epileptogenic zone 'fingerprint'.

Finding the correlation between the user data (e.g., location, time of the day, music listening history, emotion, etc.) and the music is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware personalized music recommendation system (EPMRS) to extract the correlation between the user data and the music. To achieve this correlation, we combine the outputs of two approaches: the deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) approach and the weighted feature extraction (WFE) approach. The DCNN approach is used to extract the latent features from music data (e.g., audio signals and corresponding metadata) for classification. In the WFE approach, we generate the implicit user rating for music to extract the correlation between the user data and the music data. In the WFE approach, we use the term-frequency and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) approach to generate the implicit user ratings for the music. Later, the EPMRS recommends songs to the user based on calculated implicit user rating for the music. We use the million songs dataset (MSD) to train the EPMRS. For performance comparison, we take the content similarity music recommendation system (CSMRS) as well as the personalized music recommendation system based on electroencephalography feedback (PMRSE) as the baseline systems. Experimental results show that the EPMRS produces better accuracy of music recommendations than the CSMRS and the PMRSE. Moreover, we build the Android and iOS APPs to get realistic data of user experience on the EPMRS. The collected feedback from anonymous users also show that the EPMRS sufficiently reflect their preference on music.

By delving into the complexity in electrophysiological signals and neuroimaging, new insights have emerged. These discoveries have revealed that complexity is a fundamental aspect of physiological processes. The inherent nonlinearity and non-stationarity of physiological processes limits the methods based on simpler underlying assumptions to point out the pathway to a more comprehensive understanding of their behavior and relation with certain diseases. The perspective of complexity may benefit both the research and clinical practice through providing novel data analytics tools devoted for the understanding of and the intervention about epilepsies. This review aims to provide a sketchy overview of the methods derived from different disciplines lucubrating to the complexity of bio-signals in the field of epilepsy monitoring. Although the complexity of bio-signals is still not fully understood, bundles of new insights have been already obtained. Despite the promising results about epileptic seizure detection and prediction through offline analysis, we are still lacking robust, tried-and-true real-time applications. Multidisciplinary collaborations and more high-quality data accessible to the whole community are needed for reproducible research and the development of such applications.

Modern network typologies, such as convolutional neural networks, can be very deep and impose considerable complexity that is often not feasible in resource bound, real-time systems. Processing of these networks requires high levels of parallelization, maximizing data throughput, and support for different network types, while minimizing power and resource consumption. In response to these requirements, in this paper, we present a low power FPGA based neural network accelerator named SCALENet: a SCalable Low power AccELerator for real-time deep neural Networks. Key features include optimization for power with coarse and fine grain scheduler, implementation flexibility with hardware only or hardware/software co-design, and acceleration for both fully connected and convolutional layers. The experimental results evaluate SCALENet against two different neural network applications: image processing, and biomedical seizure detection. The image processing networks, implemented on SCALENet, trained on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets with eight different networks, are implemented on an Arty A7 and Zedboard (TM) FPGA platforms. The highest improvement came with the Inception network on an ImageNet dataset with a throughput of 22x and decrease in energy consumption of 13x compared to the ARM processor implementation. We then implement SCALENet for time series EEG seizure detection using both a Direct Convolution and FFT Convolution method to show its design versatility with a 99.7% reduction in execution time and a 97.9% improvement in energy consumption compared to the ARM. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to achieve parity with or exceed the energy efficiency of NVIDIA GPUs when evaluated against Jetson TK1 with embedded GPU System on Chip (SoC) and with a 4x power savings in a power envelope of 2.07 Watts.

In 2013, we proposed a new probabilistic functional tractography methodology to study human brain connectivity. We have now been revisiting this method in the F-TRACT project (f-tract.eu) by developing a large multicenter CCEP database of several thousand stimulation runs performed in several hundred patients, and associated processing tools to create a probabilistic atlas of human cortico-cortical connections. Here, we wish to present a snapshot of the methods and data of F-TRACT using a pool of 213 epilepsy patients, all studied by stereo-encephalography with intracerebral depth electrodes. The CCEPs were processed using an automated pipeline with the following consecutive steps: detection of each stimulation run from stimulation artifacts in raw intracranial EEG (iEEG) files, bad channels detection with a machine learning approach, model-based stimulation artifact correction, robust averaging over stimulation pulses. Effective connectivity between the stimulated and recording areas is then inferred from the properties of the first CCEP component, i.e. onset and peak latency, amplitude, duration and integral of the significant part. Finally, group statistics of CCEP features are implemented for each brain parcel explored by iEEG electrodes. The localization (coordinates, white/gray matter relative positioning) of electrode contacts were obtained from imaging data (anatomical MRI or CT scans before and after electrodes implantation). The iEEG contacts were repositioned in different brain parcellations from the segmentation of patients' anatomical MRI or from templates in the MNI coordinate system. The F-TRACT database using the first pool of 213 patients provided connectivity probability values for 95% of possible intrahemispheric and 56% of interhemispheric connections and CCEP features for 78% of intrahemisheric and 14% of interhemispheric connections. In this report, we show some examples of anatomo-functional connectivity matrices, and associated directional maps. We also indicate how CCEP features, especially latencies, are related to spatial distances, and allow estimating the velocity distribution of neuronal signals at a large scale. Finally, we describe the impact on the estimated connectivity of the stimulation charge and of the contact localization according to the white or gray matter. The most relevant maps for the scientific community are available for download on f-tract. eu (David et al., 2017) and will be regularly updated during the following months with the addition of more data in the F-TRACT database. This will provide an unprecedented knowledge on the dynamical properties of large fiber tracts in human.

Part I: Existence and Behavioral Relevance	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; LOW-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; SLOW-POTENTIAL SHIFT; TEMPORAL PREPARATION; VISUAL-CORTEX; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; REACTION-TIME; STIMULUS; CNV; ENTRAINMENT	This letter makes scientific and methodological contributions. Scientifically, it demonstrates a new and behaviorally relevant effect of temporal expectation on the phase coherence of the electroencephalogram (EEG). Methodologically, it introduces novel methods to characterize EEG recordings at the single-trial level. Expecting events in time can lead to more efficient behavior. A remarkable finding in the study of temporal expectation is the foreperiod effect on reaction time, that is, the influence on reaction time of the delay between a warning signal and a succeeding imperative stimulus to which subjects are instructed to respond as quickly as possible. Here we study a new foreperiod effect in an audiovisual attention-shifting oddball task in which attention-shift cues directed the attention of subjects to impendent deviant stimuli of a given modality and therefore acted as warning signals for these deviants. Standard stimuli, to which subjects did not respond, were interspersed between warning signals and deviants. We hypothesized that foreperiod durations modulated intertrial phase coherence (ITPC, the degree of phase alignment across multiple trials) evoked by behaviorally irrelevant standards and that these modulations are behaviorally meaningful. Using averaged data, we first observed that ITPC evoked by standards closer to the warning signal was significantly different from that evoked by standards further away from it, establishing a new foreperiod effect on ITPC evoked by standards. We call this effect the standard foreperiod (SFP) effect on ITPC. We reasoned that if the SFP influences ITPC evoked by standards, it should be possible to decode the former from the latter on a trial-by-trial basis. We were able to do so showing that this effect can be observed in single trials. We demonstrated the behavioral relevance of the SFP effect on ITPC by showing significant correlations between its strength and subjects' behavioral performance.

P-300 and N-400 Induced Decoding of Learning-Skill of Driving Learners Using Type-2 Fuzzy Sets	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS (FUZZ-IEEE)	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE)	JUL 08-13, 2018	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	IEEE		learning-skill detection; electroencephalography; general type-2 fuzzy set; event related potentials	LOGIC SYSTEMS; CLASSIFICATION; POTENTIALS	The paper aims at classifying the learning-skill of driving-learners by utilizing the acquired P300 and N400 event related potentials during the learning phase of a simulated car-driving task. A set of driving stimuli, including braking on sudden appearance of bumpers, steering control at the sharp bending points, and the like, are prepared to experimentally classify the learning skill of the subjects in three distinct classes: Low, Medium and High. The complexity in classifying the subjective learning-skill arises because of intra-and inter-session variations in brain signals due to temporal fluctuation in activation levels of the involved brain lobes. A novel z-slice based model of general type-2 fuzzy set is proposed to represent the intra- and inter-session variations by the footprint of uncertainty and their composite variations by z-slices at different values of a given feature. Further, a novel technique for z-slice based classifier is proposed to classify the learning-skill under intra-and inter-session uncertainty. The proposed classifier is found to outperform traditional and well-known type-2 classifiers for the present learning-skill classification task in driving. Experiments undertaken confirm the frontal and parietal theta (4-7 Hz) activation in discrete learning steps. The proposed research outcome may directly be utilized to certify driving learners with required learning skills.

J	Ziel, F; Steinert, R				Ziel, Florian; Steinert, Rick			Probabilistic mid- and long-term electricity price forecasting	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS			English	Review						Electricity prices; Probabilistic forecasting; Supply and demand; Long-term; Negative prices; Renewable energy	PREDICTION INTERVAL ESTIMATION; EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; DYNAMIC FACTOR-ANALYSIS; REAL-TIME; POINT; IMPACT; SELECTION; MODEL; LMP	The liberalization of electricity markets and the development of renewable energy sources has led to new challenges for decision makers. These challenges are accompanied by an increasing uncertainty about future electricity price movements. The increasing amount of papers, which aim to model and predict electricity prices for a short period of time provided new opportunities for market participants. However, the electricity price literature seem to be very scarce on the issue of medium- to long-term price forecasting, which is mandatory for investment and political decisions. Our paper closes this gap by introducing a new approach to simulate electricity prices with hourly resolution for several months up to three years. Considering the uncertainty of future events we are able to provide probabilistic forecasts which are able to detect probabilities for price spikes even in the long-run. As market we decided to use the EPEX day-ahead electricity market for Germany and Austria. Our model extends the X-Model which mainly utilizes the sale and purchase curve for electricity day-ahead auctions. By applying our procedure we are able to give probabilities for the due to the EEG practical relevant event of six consecutive hours of negative prices. We find that using the supply and demand curve based model in the long-run yields realistic patterns for the time series of electricity prices and leads to promising results considering common error measures.

Signal quality of simultaneously recorded endovascular, subdural and epidural signals are comparable	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BRAIN-COMPUTER-INTERFACE; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; CAVERNOUS SINUS EEG; RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; NEURAL INTERFACE; ELECTRODE ARRAYS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; VENOUS SYSTEM; POTENTIALS	Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of minimally-invasive implantation of electrodes into a cortical blood vessel. However, the effect of the dura and blood vessel on recording signal quality is not understood and may be a critical factor impacting implementation of a closed-loop endovascular neuromodulation system. The present work compares the performance and recording signal quality of a minimally-invasive endovascular neural interface with conventional subdural and epidural interfaces. We compared bandwidth, signal-to-noise ratio, and spatial resolution of recorded cortical signals using subdural, epidural and endovascular arrays four weeks after implantation in sheep. We show that the quality of the signals (bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratio) of the endovascular neural interface is not significantly different from conventional neural sensors. However, the spatial resolution depends on the array location and the frequency of recording. We also show that there is a direct correlation between the signal-noise-ratio and classification accuracy, and that decoding accuracy is comparable between electrode arrays. These results support the consideration for use of an endovascular neural interface in a clinical trial of a novel closed-loop neuromodulation technology.

Identification of Brain Activation Regions in Inductive Learning Based Scientific Creativity Test	2018 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (IEEE SSCI)			English	Proceedings Paper	8th IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI)	NOV 18-21, 2018	Bengaluru, INDIA	IEEE		Scientific creativity; Inductive learning; Type-2 fuzzy neural classifier; P300 and N400 brain signals	INFERENCE SYSTEM; TYPE-2; EEG; CLASSIFICATION	Scientific creativity refers to exploration of original scientific development/creation. Although there are evidences of research on artistic creativity, including painting, music etc., there is hardly any research outcome on the biological basis of scientific creativity. This paper attempts to provide the biological basis of scientific creativity by identifying the brain activation patterns during the mental progress of scientific creation. It explores the scope of inductive learning in the psychological process of scientific concept formation from the commonality of positive instances of inductive learning, and use the formed concept to solve unknown problem, preferable in a new domain. The learning of the subject is monitored he acquiring the N400 brain signal and the correct application of the concept learnt to the unknown problem is detected by P300 event related potential. To identify the brain lobes involved in the learning (and planning) phase, we first trained an interval type-2 fuzzy-neural classifier with known input instances collected from selected (literature-provided) brain lobes and classes defined by N400 (P300) response of the subject. We then test the classifier performance by submitting arbitrarily selected brain lobe patterns as input to the classifier. In case the classifier produces the right class for the given input instance then the arbitrarily selected brain region carries significance in the learning (planning) phases. We declare a brain region responsible for learning/planning and hence creativity, if repeated testing of the region yields favorable outcomes of the pre-trained classifier. Experiments undertaken on 60 pre-college students indicate that pre-frontal and frontal lobes are responsible for inductive learning and prefrontal, parietal and occipital lobes for planning/scientific creativity. We also validate the brain region activation by using e-LORETA software.

It was hypothesized that somatosensory attention can modulate tactile-induced oscillation changes, which can decode different sensation attention tasks. Subjects performed four tactile attention tasks, prompted by cues presented in random order and while both wrists were simultaneously stimulated: 1) selective sensation on left hand (SS-L); 2) selective sensation on right hand (SS-R); 3) bilateral selective sensation; and 4) selective sensation suppressed or idle state (SS-S). The classification accuracy between SS-L and SS-R (79.9 +/- 8.7%) was comparable with that of a previous tactile BCI system based on selective sensation. Moreover, the accuracy could be improved to an average of 90.3 +/- 4.9% by optimal class-pair and frequency-band selection. Three-class discrimination had an accuracy of 75.2 +/- 8.3%, with the best discrimination reached for the classes SS-L, SS-R, and SS-S. Finally, four classes were classified with an accuracy of 59.4 +/- 7.3%. These results show that the proposed system is a promising new paradigm for multi-class BCI.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a non-invasive technique to record such neuronal activity due to excellent temporal and fair amount of spatial resolution. Single channel, connectivity as well as brain network analysis using MEG data in resting state and task-based experiments were analyzed from existing literature. Single channel analysis studies reported a less complex, more regular and predictable oscillations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) primarily in the left parietal, temporal and occipital regions. Investigations on both functional connectivity (FC) and effective (EC) connectivity analysis demonstrated a loss of connectivity in AD compared to healthy control (HC) subjects found in higher frequency bands. It has been reported from multiplex network of MEG study in AD in the affected regions of hippocampus, posterior default mode network (DMN) and occipital areas, however, conclusions cannot be drawn due to limited availability of clinical literature. Potential utilization of high spatial resolution in MEG likely to provide information related to in-depth brain functioning and underlying factors responsible for changes in neuronal waves in AD. This review is a comprehensive report to investigate diagnostic biomarkers for AD may be identified by from MEG data. It is also important to note that MEG data can also be utilized for the same pursuit in combination with other imaging modalities.

How struggling adult readers use contextual information when comprehending speech: Evidence from event-related potentials	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Adult literacy; Auditory ERPs; Contextual processing; N400; Phonological mismatch negativity; Prediction	MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; BRAIN POTENTIALS; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; PHONOLOGICAL AWARENESS; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PROCESSING EVIDENCE; WORD RECOGNITION; UPCOMING WORDS; PREDICTION; INTEGRATION	We investigated how struggling adult readers make use of sentence context to facilitate word processing when comprehending spoken language, conditions under which print decoding is not a barrier to comprehension. Stimuli were strongly and weakly constraining sentences (as measured by cloze probability), which ended with the most expected word based on those constraints or an unexpected but plausible word. Community-dwelling adults with varying literacy skills listened to continuous speech while their EEG was recorded. Participants, regardless of literacy level, showed N400 effects yoked to the cloze probability of the targets, with larger N400 amplitudes for less expected than more expected words. However, literacy-related differences emerged in an earlier time window of 170-300 ms: higher literacy adults produced a reduced negativity for strongly predictable targets over anterior channels, similar to previously reported effects on the Phonological Mapping Negativity (PMN), whereas low-literacy adults did not. Collectively, these findings suggest that in auditory sentence processing literacy may not notably affect the incremental activation of semantic features, but that comprehenders with underdeveloped literacy skills may be less likely to engage predictive processing. Thus, basic mechanisms of comprehension may be recruited differently as a function of literacy development-even in spoken language.	[Ng, Shukhan; Payne, Brennan R.; Stine-Morrow, Elizabeth A.

Nationwide incidence and risk factors for posttraumatic seizures in children with traumatic brain injury	JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-PEDIATRICS			English	Article						posttraumatic seizure; traumatic brain injury; trauma	HYDROCEPHALUS; PREDICTORS; EPILEPSY	OBJECTIVE Posttraumatic seizures (PTSs) are the most common complication following a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and may lead to posttraumatic epilepsy. PTS is well described in the adult literature but has not been studied extensively in children. Here, the authors utilized the largest nationwide registry of pediatric hospitalizations to report the national incidence, risk factors, and outcomes associated with PTS in pediatric TBI. METHODS The authors queried the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) using ICD-9-CM codes to identify all patients (age < 21 years) who had a primary diagnosis of TBI (850.xx-854.xx) and a secondary diagnosis of PTS (780.33, 780.39). Parameters of interest included patient demographics, preexisting comorbidities, hospital characteristics, nature of injury (open/closed), injury type (concussion, laceration/contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, or epidural hematoma), loss of consciousness (LOC), surgical management (Clinical Classification Software code 1 or 2), discharge disposition, in-hospital complications, and in-hospital mortality. The authors utilized the IBM SPSS statistical package (version 24) for univariate comparisons, as well as the identification of independent risk factors for PTS in multivariable analysis (alpha set at < 0.05). RESULTS The rate of PTS was 6.9% among 124,444 unique patients hospitalized for TBI. The utilization rate of continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) was 0.3% and increased between 2003 (0.1%) and 2012 (0.7%). The most common etiologies of TBI were motor vehicle accident (n = 50,615), accidental fall (n = 30,847), and blunt trauma (n = 13,831). However, the groups with the highest rate of PTS were shaken infant syndrome (41.4%), accidental falls (8.1%), and cycling accidents (7.4%). In multivariable analysis, risk factors for PTS included age 0-5 years (compared with 6-10, 11-15, and 16-20 years), African American race (OR 1.4), >= 3 preexisting comorbidities (OR 4.0), shaken infant syndrome (OR 4.4), subdural hematoma (OR 1.6), closed-type injury (OR 2.3), brief LOC (OR 1.4), moderate LOC (OR 1.5), and prolonged LOC with baseline return (OR 1.8). Surgically managed patients were more likely to experience PTS (OR 1.5) unless they were treated within 24 hours of admission (OR 0.8). PTS was associated with an increased likelihood of in-hospital complications (OR 1.7) and adverse (nonroutine) discharge disposition (OR 1.2), but not in-hospital mortality (OR 0.5). The overall utilization rate of cEEG was 1.3% in PTS patients compared with 0.2% in patients without PTS. Continuous EEG monitoring was associated with higher rates of diagnosed PTS (35.4% vs 6.8%; OR 4.9, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS PTS is common in children with TBI and is associated with adverse outcomes. Independent risk factors for PTS include younger age (< 5 years), African American race, increased preexisting comorbidity, prolonged LOC, and injury pattern involving cortical exposure to blood products. However, patients who undergo urgent surgical evacuation are less likely to develop PTS.

Abnormal Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent Fluctuations in Focal Cortical Dysplasia and the Perilesional Zone: Initial Findings	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							CONSENSUS CLASSIFICATION; EPILEPTIC NETWORKS; SURGICAL OUTCOMES; INTRACEREBRAL EEG; FMRI; AMPLITUDE; CHILDREN; ENTROPY; PATTERN; SURGERY	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Focal cortical dysplasia is a common cause of intractable epilepsy for which neurosurgery is an option. Delineations of a focal cortical dysplasia lesion on structural brain images may not necessarily reflect the functional borders of normal tissue. Our objective was to determine whether abnormalities in spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent fluctuations arise in focal cortical dysplasia lesions and proximal regions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with focal cortical dysplasia-related epilepsy and 16 healthy controls underwent structural and resting-state functional MR imaging. Three known blood oxygen level-dependent measures were determined, including the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, and wavelet entropy. These measures were evaluated in the lesion and perilesional zone and normalized to the contralateral cortex of patients with focal cortical dysplasia and healthy controls. RESULTS: Patients showed significantly decreased fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations and increased wavelet entropy in the focal cortical dysplasia lesion and the perilesional zone (2 cm) relative to the contralateral homotopic cortex and the same regions in healthy controls. Regional homogeneity was significantly increased in the focal cortical dysplasia lesion compared with the contralateral homotopic cortex and healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in spontaneous blood oxygen level-dependent fluctuations were seen up to 2 cm distant from the radiologically visible boundary. It was demonstrated that functional boundaries go beyond structural boundaries of focal cortical dysplasia lesions. Validation is required to reveal whether this information is valuable for surgical planning and outcome evaluation of focal cortical dysplasia lesions and comparing current results with electrophysiologic analysis.

MethodsOne hundred sixty adult patients with DOAs and 50 sex- and age-matched healthy participants underwent a clinical evaluation and vPSG assessment to quantify slow wave sleep (SWS) interruptions (SWS fragmentation index, slow/mixed and fast arousal ratios, and indexes per hour) and the associated behaviors. First, a case-control analysis was performed in 100 patients and the 50 controls to define the optimal cutoff values using receiver operating characteristic curves. Their sensitivity was then assessed in the other 60 patients with DOAs. ResultsThe SWS fragmentation index and the mixed, slow, and slow/mixed arousal indexes and ratios were higher in patients with DOAs than controls. The highest area under the curve (AUC) values were obtained for the SWS fragmentation and slow/mixed arousal indexes (AUC = 0.88 and 0.90, respectively). The SWS fragmentation index cutoff value of 6.8/h reached a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 82%. The slow/mixed arousal index had a sensitivity of 94% for the 2.5/h cutoff, and 100% specificity for 6/h. Both parameters showed good interrater agreement, and their sensitivities were confirmed in the second group of patients. Combining electroencephalographic parameters and video-based behavioral analyses increased the correct classification rate up to 91.3%. InterpretationFrequent slow/mixed arousals in SWS and complex behaviors during vPSG are strongly associated with DOAs, and could be promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of non-rapid eye movement parasomnias.

Magnetoencephalographic Spike Analysis in Patients With Focal Cortical Dysplasia: What Defines a "Dipole Cluster"?	PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Focal cortical dysplasia; Epilepsy surgery; Magnetoencephalography; Source localization; Equivalent current dipole	INTRINSIC EPILEPTOGENICITY; NEOCORTICAL EPILEPSY; INTRACRANIAL EEG; SOURCE LOCALIZATION; SURGICAL OUTCOMES; CLINICAL ARTICLE; MEG; MRI; SURGERY; RESECTION	Background: The purpose of this study is to clarify the source distribution patterns of magnetoencephalographic spikes correlated with postsurgical seizure-free outcome in pediatric patients with focal cortical dysplasia. Patients and methods: Thirty-two patients with pathologically confirmed focal cortical dysplasia were divided into seizure-free and seizure-persistent groups according to their surgical outcomes based on Engel classification. In each patient, presurgical magnetoencephalography was reviewed. Dipole sources of magnetoencephalographic spikes were calculated according to a single dipole model. We obtained the following quantitative indices for evaluating dipole distribution: maximum distance over all pairs of dipoles, standard deviation of the distances between each dipole and the mean coordinate of all dipoles, average nearest neighbor distance, the rate of dipoles located within 10, 20, and 30 mm from the mean coordinate, and the rate of dipoles included in the resection. These indices were compared between the two patient groups. Results: Average nearest neighbor distance was significantly smaller in the seizure-free group than in the seizure-persistent group (P = 0.008). The rates of dipoles located within 10, 20, and 30 mm from the mean coordinate were significantly higher in the seizure-free group (P = 0.001, 0.001, 0.005, respectively). The maximum distance, standard deviation, and resection rate of dipoles did not show a significant difference between the two groups. Conclusions: A spatially restricted dipole distribution of magnetoencephalographic spikes is correlated with postsurgical seizure-free outcomes in patients with focal cortical dysplasia. The distribution can be assessed by quantitative indices that are clinically useful in the presurgical evaluation of these patients. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a novel neural network architecture inspired by the immune algorithm is presented and used in the forecasting of naturally occurring signals, including weather big data signals. Big Data Analysis is a major research frontier, which attracts extensive attention from academia, industry and government, particularly in the context of handling issues related to complex dynamics due to changing weather conditions. Recently, extensive deployment of IoT, sensors, and ambient intelligence systems led to an exponential growth of data in the climate domain. In this study, we concentrate on the analysis of big weather data by using the Dynamic Self Organized Neural Network Inspired by the Immune Algorithm. The learning strategy of the network focuses on the local properties of the signal using a self-organised hidden layer inspired by the immune algorithm, while the recurrent links of the network aim at recalling previously observed signal patterns. The proposed network exhibits improved performance when compared to the feedforward multilayer neural network and state-of-the-art recurrent networks, e.g., the Elman and the Jordan networks. Three non-linear and non-stationary weather signals are used in our experiments. Firstly, the signals are transformed into stationary, followed by 5-steps ahead prediction. Improvements in the prediction results are observed with respect to the mean value of the error (RMS) and the signal to noise ratio (SNR), however to the expense of additional computational complexity, due to presence of recurrent links.

By creating a direct communication pathway between the human brain and a machine, without muscles contractions or activity from within the peripheral nervous system, BCI makes mapping persons intentions onto directive signals possible. One of the most commonly utilized phenomena in BCI is steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP). If subject focuses attention on the flashing stimulus (with specified frequency) presented on the computer screen, a signal of the same frequency will appear in his or hers visual cortex and from there it can be measured. When there is more than one stimulus on the screen (each flashing with a different frequency) then based on the outcomes of the signal analysis we can predict at which of these objects (e.g., rectangles) subject was/is looking at that particular moment. Proper preprocessing steps have taken place in order to obtain maximally accurate stimuli recognition (as the specific frequency). In the current article, we compared various preprocessing and processing methods for BCI purposes. Combinations of spatial and temporal filtration methods and the proceeding blind source separation (BSS) were evaluated in terms of the resulting decoding accuracy. Canonical-correlation analysis (CCA) to signals classification was used.

Researchers have explored the possibility to control SRLs in diverse ways from manual operation through a joystick to myoelectric signals from muscle impulses - but the ultimate goal is to be able to control them with the brain. Brain-machine interface systems (BMI) have allowed the control of prosthetics and robotic devices using brainwaves alone, but the low number of brain-based commands that can be decoded does not allow an SRL to achieve a high number of actions. For this reason, in this paper, we present an intelligent brain-controlled SRL that has context-aware capabilities in order to complement BMI-based commands and increase the number of actions that it can perform with the same BMI-based command. The proposed system consists of a human-like robotic limb that can be activated (i.e. grasp action) with a non-invasive EEG-based BMI when the human operator imagines the action. Since there are different ways that the SRL can perform the action (i.e. different grasping configurations) depending on the context (i.e. type of the object), we provided vision capabilities to the SRL so it can recognize the context and optimize its behavior in order to match the user intention. The proposed hybrid BMI-SRL system opens up the possibilities to explore more complex and realistic human augmentation applications.

Imbalance of Functional Connectivity and Temporal Entropy in Resting-State Networks in Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Machine Learning Approach	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						complexity; resting-state; fMRI; connectivity; dynamics; Autism Spectrum Disorders	DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; INHIBITORY CONTROL; BRAIN; COMPLEXITY; CHILDREN; EXCITATION/INHIBITION; NEUROPATHOLOGY; CLASSIFICATION; ORGANIZATION; CORTEX	Background: Two approaches to understanding the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) involve network level functional connectivity (FC) and the dynamics of neuronal signaling. The former approach has revealed both increased and decreased FC in individuals with ASD. The latter approach has found high frequency EEG oscillations and higher levels of epilepsy in children with ASD. Together, these findings have led to the hypothesis that atypical excitatory-inhibitory neural signaling may lead to imbalanced association pathways. However, simultaneously reconciling local temporal dynamics with network scale spatial connectivity remains a difficult task and thus empirical support for this hypothesis is lacking. Methods: We seek to fill this gap by combining two powerful resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) methods-functional connectivity (FC) and wavelet-based regularity analysis. Wavelet-based regularity analysis is an entropy measure of the local rs-fMRI time series signal. We examined the relationship between the RSN entropy and integrity in individuals with ASD and controls from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) cohort using a putative set of 264 functional brain regions-of-interest (ROI). Results: We observed that an imbalance in intra-and inter-network FC across 11 RSNs in ASD individuals (p = 0.002) corresponds to a weakened relationship with RSN temporal entropy (p = 0.02). Further, we observed that an estimated RSN entropy model significantly distinguished ASD from controls (p = 0.01) and was associated with level of ASD symptom severity (p = 0.003). Conclusions: Imbalanced brain connectivity and dynamics at the network level coincides with their decoupling in ASD. The association with ASD symptom severity presents entropy as a potential biomarker.	[Smith, Robert X.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, NeuroImaging Labs, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Jann, Kay; Wang, Danny J.

He was in a serious condition and had limited consciousness. Therefore, the doctor informed the patient's wife about the possibility of sudden death. The patient heard this information and remembered it, which was one of the main causes of the development of PTSD. On the basis of previous research amplitudes of P3 ERP, components elicited in the cued GO/NOGO tasks have been chosen as the candidate for PTSD neuromarkers. Case study: A 44-year-old patient had a major ischemic brain stroke while sizeable atherosclerotic plaque causing critical stenosis of the internal carotid artery in Angio-CT was discovered. The patient was urgently operated on using CEA. After the operation he had the opportunity to see the removed plaque which had been the cause of his stroke. Despite the positive postoperative recovery, half a year later, the patient began to complain of flashbacks, anxiety, trouble in falling and staying asleep, difficulty in concentration, a loss of interest. For the diagnosis of PTSD we used Checklist Specific for a stressor (PCL-S). Additionally we used Checklist according to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5) classification, and the patient met the PTSD criteria. The cognitive profile of the patient was measured with the use of the Wechsler Memory Test - Ill (WMS-III). Subsequently, the patient participated in the cued GO/NOGO task (Kropotov, 2009) with a recording 19-channel EEG. The P3 GO and NOGO waves in this task were found to be significantly smaller at p<0.01 in comparison to a group of healthy control subjects of the same age (N=23) taken from the Human Brain Institute (HBI) normative database (httos://www.hbimed.com/) . The pattern of this neuromarker in our patient corresponds to the ERPs pattern found in PTSD patients. Conclusions: The ERPs in a GO/NOGO task can be used in the assessment of the functional brain changes induced by chronic PTSD.

Noise-Assisted Multivariate EMD-Based Mean-Phase Coherence Analysis to Evaluate Phase-Synchrony Dynamics in Epilepsy Patients	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL SYSTEMS AND REHABILITATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Epileptic seizures; mean-phase coherence; noise-assisted; multivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-MEMD); synchrony dynamics; intrinsic mode function (IMF); high-frequency oscillations (HFOs); Hilbert transform; eigenvalue decomposition	HIGH-FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; CORTICAL NETWORKS; EEG; SEIZURES; DISCRIMINATION	Spatiotemporal evolution of synchrony dynamics among neuronal populations plays an important role in decoding complicated brain function in normal cognitive processing as well as during pathological conditions such as epileptic seizures. In this paper, a non-linear analytical methodology is proposed to quantitatively evaluate the phase-synchrony dynamics in epilepsy patients. A set of finite neuronal oscillators was adaptively extracted from a multi-channel electro-corticographic (ECoG) dataset utilizing noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode de-composition (NA-MEMD). Next, the instantaneous phases of the oscillatory functions were extracted using the Hilbert transform in order to be utilized in the mean-phase coherence analysis. The phase-synchrony dynamics were then assessed using eigenvalue decomposition. The extracted neuronal oscillators were grouped with respect to their frequency range into wideband (1-600 Hz), ripple (80-250 Hz), and fast-ripple (250-600 Hz) bands in order to investigate the dynamics of ECoG activity in these frequency ranges as seizures evolve. Drug-refractory patients with frontal and temporal lobe epilepsy demonstrated a reduction in phase-synchrony around seizure onset. However, the network phase-synchrony started to increase toward seizure end and achieved its maximum level at seizure offset for both types of epilepsy. This result suggests that hyper-synchronization of the epileptic network may be an essential self-regulatory mechanism by which the brain terminates seizures.

Moreover, oscillations related to pain perception and modulation change dynamically over time. Fluctuations in these neural oscillations reflect the dynamic neural states of the nucleus. In this study, an approach to classifying the synchronization level was developed to dynamically identify the neural states. An oscillation extraction model based on windowed wavelet packet transform was designed to characterize the activity level of oscillations. The wavelet packet coefficients sparsely represented the activity level of theta and alpha oscillations in local field potentials (LFPs). Then, a state discrimination model was designed to calculate an adaptive threshold to determine the activity level of oscillations. Finally, the neural state was represented by the activity levels of both theta and alpha oscillations. The relationship between neural states and pain relief was further evaluated. The performance of the state identification approach achieved sensitivity and specificity beyond 80% in simulation signals. Neural states of the PVAG and VPL were dynamically identified from LFPs of neuropathic pain patients. The occurrence of neural states based on theta and alpha oscillations were correlated to the degree of pain relief by deep brain stimulation. In the PVAG LFPs, the occurrence of the state with high activity levels of theta oscillations independent of alpha and the state with low-level alpha and high-level theta oscillations were significantly correlated with pain relief by deep brain stimulation. This study provides a reliable approach to identifying the dynamic neural states in LFPs with a low signal-to-noise ratio by using sparse representation based on wavelet packet transform. Furthermore, it may advance closed-loop deep brain stimulation based on neural states integrating multiple neural oscillations.

Because sleep becomes shorter with age and women complain of disturbed sleep more often than men, age and sex differences in the homeostatic response to a delayed bedtime may modify the homeostatic response. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of late-night short-sleep (3h with awakening at about 07:00hours) on in-home recorded sleep in men and women in two age groups (20-30 and 65-75years). Results (N=59) showed that late-night short-sleep was associated with an increase in percentage of N3 sleep and a decrease in percentage of rapid eye movement sleep, as well as decreases in several measures of sleep discontinuity and rapid eye movement density. Men showed a smaller decrease in percentage of rapid eye movement sleep than women in response to late-night short-sleep, as did older individuals of both sexes compared with younger. Older men showed a weaker percentage of N3 sleep in response to late-night short-sleep than younger men. In general, men showed a greater percentage of rapid eye movement sleep and a lower percentage of N3 sleep than women, and older individuals showed a lower percentage of N3 sleep than younger. In particular, older men showed very low levels of percentage of N3 sleep. We conclude that older males show less of a homeostatic response to late-night short-sleep. This may be an indication of impaired capacity for recovery in older men. Future studies should investigate if this pattern can be linked to gender-associated differences in morbidity and mortality.

Consistent with the pivotal role of the gustatory system, taste category information (e.g., sweet, salty) is represented during the earliest phase of the taste-evoked cortical response (Crouzet et al., 2015), and different tastes are perceived and responded to within only a few hundred milliseconds, in rodents (Perez et al., 2013) and humans (Bujas, 1935). Currently, it is unknown whether taste detection and discrimination are sequential or parallel processes, i.e., whether you know what it is as soon as you taste it. To investigate the sequence of processing steps involved in taste perceptual decisions, participants tasted sour, salty, bitter, and sweet solutions and performed a taste-detection and a taste-discrimination task. We measured response times (RTs) and 64-channel scalp electrophysiological recordings and tested the link between the timing of behavioral decisions and the timing of neural taste representations determined with multivariate pattern analyses. Irrespective of taste and task, neural decoding onset and behavioral RTs were strongly related, demonstrating that differences between taste judgments are reflected early during chemosensory encoding. Neural and behavioral detection times were faster for the iso-hedonic salty and sour tastes than their discrimination time. No such latency difference was observed for sweet and bitter, which differ hedonically. Together, these results indicate that the human gustatory system detects a taste faster than it discriminates between tastes, yet hedonic computations may run in parallel (Perez et al., 2013) and facilitate taste identification.

Combining wearable robotic exoskeletons and human-machine interfaces is a promising avenue for the restoration and substitution of lost and impaired functions for these users. In this study, we present a novel hand exoskeleton, mano, designed to assist and restore hand functions of people with motor disabilities during activities of daily living (ADL) and in neurorehabilitative scenarios. Compared to state-of-the-art devices, our system is fully wearable, portable, and minimally obtrusive on the hand. The exoskeleton can actively control flexion and extension of all fingers, while allowing natural somatosensorial interactions with the environment surrounding the users. We evaluated the device from four different perspectives. A mechanical characterization, showing that the exoskeleton can cover more than 70% of healthy hand workspace and it can achieve forces at the fingertips sufficient for ADL. A functional characterization, where we showed how two users who suffered from spinal cord injuries were able to perform several ADL for the first time since their accidents. Third, we evaluated the system from a neuroimaging perspective, showing that the device can elicit EEG brain patterns typical of natural hand motions. We finally exemplified the control of the hand exoskeleton within an exemplar framework, a brain-machine interface scenario, showing that motor intention can be decoded for a continuous control of the device. Overall, our results showed that the device represents an ecological solution for use both in ADL and in scenarios aimed at promoting sensorimotor recovery.

In this paper we review that paradigm and summarize its key lessons, which include the valence of this phenotype for future psychosis outcomes, but also for comorbid, persistent or incident non-psychotic disorders; and the evidence that onset of psychotic disorder can at least be delayed in ultra high risk (UHR) patients, and that some full-threshold psychotic disorder may emerge from risk states not captured by UHR criteria. The paradigm has also illuminated risk factors and mechanisms involved in psychosis onset. However, findings from this and related paradigms indicate the need to develop new identification and diagnostic strategies. These findings include the high prevalence and impact of mental disorders in young people, the limitations of current diagnostic systems and risk identification approaches, the diffuse and unstable symptom patterns in early stages, and their pluripotent, transdiagnostic trajectories. The approach we have recently adopted has been guided by the clinical staging model and adapts the original at risk mental state approach to encompass a broader range of inputs and output target syndromes. This approach is supported by a number of novel modelling and prediction strategies that acknowledge and reflect the dynamic nature of psychopathology, such as dynamical systems theory, network theory, and joint modelling. Importantly, a broader transdiagnostic approach and enhancing specific prediction (profiling or increasing precision) can be achieved concurrently. A holistic strategy can be developed that applies these new prediction approaches, as well as machine learning and iterative probabilistic multimodal models, to a blend of subjective psychological data, physical disturbances (e.g., EEG measures) and biomarkers (e.g., neuroinflammation, neural network abnormalities) acquired through fine-grained sequential or longitudinal assessments. This strategy could ultimately enhance our understanding and ability to predict the onset, early course and evolution of mental ill health, further opening pathways for preventive interventions.

This study examined the outcome of epilepsy in patients with mitochondrial disorders and its relation with the clinical phenotype, genotype and magnetic resonance imaging findings. Patients and methods: The cohort was derived from the database of 67 patients with definite genetic diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders evaluated over a period of 11 years (2006-2016). Among this, 27 had epilepsy and were included in final analysis. Data were analyzed with special reference to clinical phenotypes, genotypes, epilepsy characteristics, EEG findings, anti epileptic drugs used, therapeutic response, and magnetic resonance imaging findings. Patients were divided into three groups according to the seizure frequency at the time of last follow up: Group I- Seizure free; Group II- Infrequent seizures; Group III- uncontrolled seizures. For each group the clinical phenotype, genotype, magnetic resonance imaging and duration of epilepsy were compared. Results: The phenotypes & genotypes included Mitochondrial Encephalopathy Lactic Acidosis and Stroke like episodes (MELAS) & m.3243A > G mutation (n = 10), Myoclonic Epilepsy Ragged Red Fiber syndrome (MERRF) m.8344A > G mutation (n = 4), Chronic Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia plus & POLGI mutation (CPEO, n = 6), episodic neuroregression due to nuclear mutations (n = 6; NDUFVI (n = 3), NDUFA1, NDUFS2, MPV17-1 one each), and one patient with infantile basal ganglia stroke syndrome, mineralizing angiopathy & MT-ND5 mutations. Seven patients (25.9%) were seizure free; seven had infrequent seizures (25.9%), while thirteen (48.1%) had frequent uncontrolled seizures. Majority of the subjects in seizure free group had episodic neuroregression & leukoencephalopathy due to nuclear mutations (85.7%). Patients in group II with infrequent seizures had CPEO, POLG1 mutation and a normal MRI (71%) while 62% of the subjects in group III had MELAS, m.3243A > G mutation and stroke like lesions on MRI. Conclusions: A fair correlation exists between the outcome of epilepsy, clinical phenotypes, genotypes and magnetic resonance imaging findings in patients with mitochondrial disorders. The recognition of these patterns is important clinically because of the therapeutic and prognostic implications.

Medical informatics (MI) is an important cross-disciplinary field that, along with its applications, has received massive funding from the Chinese government. However, the question of how to evaluate China's input and output in MI remains important and complex issue of great significance for China and the rest of the world. Objective: This paper analyzed, for the first time, the quality and quantity of research by Chinese academics in MI based on their articles published in international specialty journals in recent years and examined MI research hotspots in China. Our purpose is to summarize the experiences and lessons learned by China and the rest of the world as they develop MI. Method: We targeted 18 MI journals listed in the JCR 2016 report and searched for papers published by Chinese academics in these 18 journals in the WOS and PUBMED databases and on journal sites. We also performed data cleansing and categorized the obtained information. We used Excel, SPSS, Ucinet and NetDraw to conduct quantitative analyses on the research papers. Results: A total of 1340 articles satisfied the inclusion criteria of this study. We observed a significant upward trend in the number of articles published over time, particularly after 2011. Lei Jianbo, Huang Zhengxing and Li Jin-song are active Chinese authors in the MI discipline who have written many high-quality publications. Meanwhile, universities remain the primary breeding grounds for scientific research: 93.36% of the articles came from universities. Zhejiang University published the most first-author articles, whereas Zhejiang University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Tsinghua University produced 17.76% of the total articles. According to the lists of authors, 24% of the papers were co-authored with foreign researchers. This rate of cooperation is increasing each year, from 5.88% to the current rate of 39.04%. An analysis of keywords showed that "EMR", "SVM", "Authentication", "Telecare medical information system", "EEG", "ECG" and "RFID" were the most frequently searched terms in popular technological fields, including artificial intelligence and image processing. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of high-frequency keywords and a broadening range of research fields, which has led to the emergence of several research hotspots, including MI systems, mobile health care, telecare, data mining and machine learning. Conclusions: Through the quantitative analysis of publications, we discovered the emergence of three stages - infancy, slow growth and rapid growth - in China's MI research in recent years as academics make achievements in their research works. The global influence of Chinese academics is growing, and they are making increasingly conscious efforts to enter into research collaborations with foreign researchers. The findings of Chinese academics' publications are gaining international recognition. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

On the other hand, as the road and industrial accidents are increasing in countries like Bangladesh, more and more people are losing body parts and are not able to treat their condition properly due to the financial burden and lack in technological advancement. In this research, we have preliminarily designed, implemented and tested a low-cost EMG recording and monitoring system that can detect and process EMG signals from different kinds of muscle contraction. The recorded signals can be interfaced with the computer through Arduino UNO and then the EMG signals can be analyzed further in MATLAB platform. We have also developed an algorithm to detect muscle contraction and expansion from raw EMG recordings and then converted them into command signals that can control a robotic arm. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system, lab experiments are performed by recording of EMG signals from 5 subjects by attaching electrodes on their shoulders and calculated the accuracy of detecting muscle contraction based on four ROC parameters, known as True Positives (TP) False Positives (FP), True Negatives (TN) and False Negatives (FN); which results in 83% accuracy on an average. Then based on the detected muscle contraction, we successfully demonstrated to control a robotic arm by opening and closing of its fingers which can later be replaced with a prosthetic arm for those disabled persons who lost their arms. This research will help not only to diagnose any neuromuscular disease by comparing it with any healthy subject's EMG signal, but also these EMG recordings can be processed and decoded to control prosthetic arm for those people who lost their arm but cannot afford commercially available expensive prosthetic systems in a developing country like Bangladesh.

It remains unclear whether NFB can be used to aid and sustain complex emotions, with ecological validity implications. We provide a technical proof of concept of a novel real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) NFB procedure. Using rtfMRI-NFB, we enabled participants to voluntarily enhance their own neural activity while they experienced complex emotions. The rtfMRI-NFB software (FRIEND Engine) was adapted to provide a virtual environment as brain computer interface (BCI) and musical excerpts to induce two emotions (tenderness and anguish), aided by participants' preferred personalized strategies to maximize the intensity of these emotions. Eight participants from two experimental sites performed rtfMRI-NFB on two consecutive days in a counterbalanced design. On one day, rtfMRI-NFB was delivered to participants using a region of interest (ROI) method, while on the other day using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Our multimodal VR/NFB approach was technically feasible and robust as a method for real-time measurement of the neural correlates of complex emotional states and their voluntary modulation. Guided by the color changes of the virtual environment BCI during rtfMRI-NFB, participants successfully increased in real time, the activity of the septohypothalamic area and the amygdala during the ROI based rtfMRI-NFB, and successfully evoked distributed patterns of brain activity classified as tenderness and anguish during SVM-based rtfMRI-NFB. Offline fMRI analyses confirmed that during tenderness rtfMRI-NFB conditions, participants recruited the septo-hypothalamic area and other regions ascribed to social affiliative emotions (medial frontal / temporal pole and precuneus). During anguish rtfMRI-NFB conditions, participants recruited the amygdala and other dorsolateral prefrontal and additional regions associated with negative affect. These findings were robust and were demonstrable at the individual subject level, and were reflected in self-reported emotion intensity during rtfMRI-NFB, being observed with both ROI and SVM methods and across the two sites. Our multimodal VR/rtfMRI-NFB protocol provides an engaging tool for brain-based interventions to enhance emotional states in healthy subjects and may find applications in clinical conditions associated with anxiety, stress and impaired empathy among others.
